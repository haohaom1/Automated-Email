The school has a long tradition of providing leadership opportunities and these are highly regarded positions within the school community. Associate Headteacher, Neil Renton, said: All the students who applied performed extremely well. Our new leadership structure gives more opportunities for our students to genuinely lead projects and our gender-neutral roles reflect leadership in the modern work place.

Jane,Powers,1250,http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/lifestyle/review-incantata-a-brilliantly-unstable-experience-856684.html,"Padraic Killeen reviews Incantata at the Town Hall Theatre, Galway Pulsating with a furious energy, and featuring the poet’s trademark verbal contortions, Paul Muldoon’s ‘Incantata’ — written in grief-stricken tribute to his deceased lover, Mary Farl Powers — certainly boasts a drama bold enough for the stage. At #worldpremiere of #Incantata last night at #GIAF, directed by @SamYates2020, performed by utterly magnificent Stanley Townsend. Is it cheeky to say it transcended the words of the great Muldoon? My late sister Mary Farl Powers was beautifully, poignantly honoured. Thank you. pic.twitter.com/6F3TpWixSk— Jane Powers (@PowersFlowers) July 19, 2018 What makes this a remarkable piece of theatre, however, is director Sam Yates’s frenzied use of sound and vision to complement, and foil, Muldoon’s raw and riveting lament. The latter is delivered here by Stanley Townsend, who is intense and sensitive. Like Muldoon’s poem, the play interrogates the capacity of art to negotiate grief, and it simmers with a suspicion that, actually, art may be impotent. In a frenzied moment of misleading catharsis, Townsend will step out of the pupa of an artist’s jumpsuit, as if transformed; but he is not healed. Caught the matinee show of Incantata. An incredible piece of poetry, a beautiful presentation of theatre #incantata #poetry #theatre #elegy #giaf pic.twitter.com/0nhARSkyau— Liz Quirke (@QuirkeyLiz) July 19, 2018 Significantly, Muldoon’s furious elegy fits in references to everyone from Burt Lancaster to Thomas Aquinas, while inventively channelling Samuel Beckett. It all makes for a brilliantly unstable experience, the play teetering between order and disorder, as Townsend’s wild cacophony of memory fragments struggles to extract from life some sense of a redemptive unity.

Bernard,Osher,1249,https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/christopher-wren-association-receives-national-grant.php,"The following story was updated to clarify some of the language that was used in the original version – Ed. The Bernard Osher Foundation has awarded William & Mary a $100,000 grant to support the Christopher Wren Association (CWA). As part of the grant, CWA will be renamed the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at William & Mary. Beginning spring 2019, courses in the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at W&M will be available to members ages 50 and older. The Christopher Wren Association provides over 300 courses throughout the year, including a Town & Gown Noon Lecture Series and other scheduled activities to registered members. Course registration for the fall 2018 semester is currently open and classes will begin Sept. 10. There will be no changes in class/program structure during the transition period. With the initial grant funds, CWA will make much-needed upgrades to audio visual equipment in the Wightman Cup Room at Kaplan Arena, one of the primary locations for classes. Improvements will include a new sound system, acoustic tiling and the installation of an interactive board, all of which will be compatible with the existing Hearing Loop system. In addition to this initial grant, the Osher Foundation will continue to assess the “long-term sustainability and success” of the program at William & Mary and will determine whether to award a $1 million endowment that would provide permanent support for the lifelong learning program at William & Mary. A final decision will be made in approximately 18 months. The Christopher Wren Association now reports up through William & Mary Auxiliary Services, which provides administrative support to other campus partners including Williamsburg Campus Child Care, McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center, W&M Dining, W&M Bookstore and more. The Christopher Wren Association will continue to manage its budget, staff and programming under Auxiliary Services at W&M. “A key element of the Osher Foundation support is our close connection to William & Mary,” said Harry Haynsworth, president of the Christopher Wren Association. “William & Mary has been a wonderful support of our continuing education mission and goals. As our transition to an Osher Institute progresses, we will strive to maximize course availability and become even more immersed in the William & Mary campus.” Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes are found on 121 other college and university campuses nationwide, providing “ a distinctive array of non-credit courses and activities specifically developed for seasoned adults aged 50 or older who are interested in learning for the joy of learning,” according to the foundation’s website.

Bernard,Osher,1249,https://leisuregrouptravel.com/steve-thaxton-osher-lifelong-learning-institutes/,"With over 163,000 members in all 50 states, Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes may be the largest college or university affiliated senior-oriented lifelong learning network of programs you’ve never heard of. I hadn’t, until a recent trip where I befriended two ladies from the University of North Carolina-Wilmington who worked on the local Osher program. While Osher is not a travel company, two-thirds of its locations offer some type of organized group travel effort. I caught up with Steve Thaxton to learn more about this impressive network. Steve Thaxton: There are 121 unique and independent Osher programs of the 400 or so of these sorts of college or university-based lifelong learning institutes across the country. There is at least one in each state and as many as 19 in the state of California in the Osher (or OLLI) network.. We’re a network that’s been established through, Bernard Osher, and the Osher Foundation in San Francisco. He was a prominent businessman as he made his fortunes in a number of industries, including banking. He decided that he would fund these learning endeavors through the Osher Foundation. Each of these programs has received funding, including endowments of $1 million or more to help with their operating costs. Between 2001 and about 2009 he funded about 119 of them. A few have come and gone, and there are now 121. The funding guidelines allow each one to operate in the way that they need to in their local communities. It’s not franchised. There’s no central governance. Each university builds the program as it sees fit for its community and its students, or “members” as they are known. About half of the institutes were existing and half were all new with their funding. The university might be invited to apply for funding and if accepted, use their Osher money to commence the program. The programs collectively have more than 163,000 members and really vary in size. The smallest are about 500 members and the largest is quite an anomaly, Florida Atlantic University at nearly 14,000 members. The newest is affiliated with Ringling College of Design in Sarasota, they became and OLLI late last year. The agreements with the universities intentionally honor localism and autonomy, because this is key to program success. I’ll offer a few examples. Some universities offer very academic courses and activities, and others that are not as academic may do more courses that are more experiential or hobby-oriented. It really has a lot to do with the communities that are served. So some more academic programs might not offer painting or yoga, but a lot of universities do. Universities do not want to get into any discriminatory practices, so the programs are designed for people over the age of 50, but oftentimes there will be people who haven’t hit that that point in life, or in some cases, for other special reasons they want to be involved, and they aren’t turned away. But the programs are designed for people who are 50-plus and who are retired or semi-retired. The biggest interest is in history, and history takes its form in many different ways. It might be studying the Reformation, it might be art history, it may be something specialized or current in a particular community, such as a new exhibit at a local museum. The pricing also varies. Generally, in some of the major metro areas, programs are priced higher than in smaller communities because it costs more to run programs in those cities. But each program makes its own decisions on pricing structure. And each is a terrific value compared to other offerings at universities or colleges. We hold a national conference every 18 month that’s generously underwritten by the Osher Foundation. We coordinate and produce the conference out of the Osher National Resource Center, and an invitation is extended to one volunteer leader and one paid staff member from each of the 121 institutes. This October we will be in Scottsdale, but we’ve been all over the country. It’s generally at resort conference facilities and not in the middle of cities. We stay pretty busy for those three days together, and that’s the opportunity for all staff members and volunteer leaders to come together and compare notes and network. It’s the social engagement combined with the cognitive intellectual stimulation. Seniors who are members come together to stay healthy and active. We see people who come in as members and they say, “Oh my goodness, this has saved my life. I was pretty much a recluse. I moved to be close to my kids. My entire social network was gone when I moved across the country. Now my days are filled with meaningful, interesting conversations and learning.” These Institutes form the social backbone that in past generations might have come from a faith community or a golf club, and they often substitute for what previously was a career of social networking in the workplace. Eighty-one of the 121 offer travel programs. I would say that those that do not offer travel have very specific reasons. A university might say “We’re not going to compete with our alumni association’s travel program or other programs that we offer,” or “The risk is too heavy and we don’t want to get into that business.” Or the membership at the Osher Institute might say, “We’re well-traveled and we’ve got such a variety of interests in travel that we’ll do our own group travel.” There are units that offer a huge amount of travel. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has around 50 trips a year that they’re offering for their members. These range from day trips to multi-day international travel. No, there are a wide variety of vendor suppliers used by the Osher Institutes. But as Road Scholar, formerly known as Elderhostel was active in helping form LLI programs across the country, they continue to work with many of the Osher Institutes along with a number of other organizations. Collette seems to be active with some OLLIs, along with OAT (Overseas Adventure Travel), then it splinters into many local travel relationships. AAA is sometimes a supplier, but it might be Bill’s travel company because Bill has been a member for years or Bill’s son is a member. Or it may be an RFP that the university has issued. Their interest is in making sure that the prices are both fair and negotiated. Here at the Osher National Resource Center, we try very hard to not get into any kind of preferred vendor negotiation because we can’t possibly deal with what is best for any of these or all of these units. ST: There are a number of Osher Insitutes, I’d say probably 10% that have limited capacity to grow. But there are others that have great capacity to grow. They market in a variety of ways. Yet it always seems to come back to the most effective membership growth strategy is personal recruiting. Across the board, word of mouth is the most effective way to grow membership.

Bob,Diamond,1247,https://www.reuters.com/article/italy-banks-spaxs-plan/italys-new-bank-to-invest-3-bln-euros-in-bad-loans-chase-high-margin-debt-idUSL8N1UG46K,"3 Min Read * New “challenger” bank will not have branches * Bank to scout for riskier companies with good potential * Italian banks slowly emerging from loan crisis By Valentina Za MILAN, July 20 (Reuters) - An Italian bank being set up with backing from former Barclays chief Bob Diamond said on Friday it aimed to trounce industry returns by chasing higher-margin borrowers and going digital to keep costs down. It targets a return on equity (ROE) of about 25 percent in its plans to 2023, compared with just 4 percent for Italian lenders in 2017 net of one-offs and 14 percent at Banca IFIS , a specialty bank which buys and manages bad debts. “This project is an act of confidence in Italy,” Corrado Passera, the chief executive of the new bank whose name has yet to be announced, told journalists. The veteran banker and former industry minister said the bank would scout for small businesses seen to have potential but which had trouble securing funds from mainstream lenders. It would also buy bad loans from rivals. The bank, which will not have branches, aims to tap the expertise of retired corporate executives and use artificial intelligence to identify companies that qualify for lending. Italian banks are slowly emerging from a bad loan crisis triggered by a deep recession. Credit losses and negative interest rates have hammered returns in the sector, which is weighed down by fragmentation and too many branches. The number of specialised banks, known as “challenger banks”, seeking to compete with established players has grown in Britain and other countries but they are still rare in Italy. Passera, who headed Intesa Sanpaolo until 2011, raised 600 million euros ($703 million) in January by listing SPAXS, a special purpose acquisition company that he used to buy small lender Banca Interprovinciale. Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital Fund indirectly owns a 7.7 percent stake in SPAXS and is its biggest investor. Alongside Passera, the chief financial officer will be Francesco Mele who held the same job at Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The new bank aims to deliver a net profit of 40 million-50 million euros in 2020 rising to about 300 million euros in 2023, broadly split between the small- and medium-sized (SME) enterprises lending unit and the bad loan business. Andrea Clamer, who has moved from Banca IFIS to head the bad loan unit, said the bank would invest 3 billion euros buying some of the 135 billion euros in bad corporate loans Italian banks were expected to offload in 2018-2023. The SME unit would also buy so-called “unlikely-to-pay” loans, which are not yet in default and could be recovered by turning around the troubled borrower. Clamer said the new group had agreed to buy a 300 million euro bad loan portfolio, a deal that would go ahead after Aug. 8 when SPAXS shareholders approve the tie-up with Banca Interprovinciale, which also needs regulatory clearing. The new bank targets a core capital ratio of more than 15 percent and plans to rely on digital technologies to keep costs below 30 percent of its income. $1 = 0.8537 euros Reporting by Valentina Za Editing by Edmund Blair All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Pete,Rouse,1245,https://www.whitehousedossier.com/2018/07/19/michelle-obama-joins-2018-campaign-bigly/,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama will take a high-profile role in the 2018 campaign, but in order to keep herself from getting to deep in the muck she’ll seek to elect Democrats under the guise of an ostensibly nonpartisan group which launches Thursday and that is being called “When We All Vote.” According to Politico report about the $8 million effort: The initiative, scheduled to be launched Thursday, is the result of months of quiet conversations and planning full of false starts and uncertainty about whether to go forward. It will have the former first lady appear in public service announcements and at live events throughout the country into the fall, according to multiple people informed of the plans. She’ll be joined by several A-list celebrities, including actor Tom Hanks, country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Houston Rockets star Chris Paul, singer Janelle Monae and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The first PSA will go out Thursday, with more in the process of being lined up, featuring other prominent activists and players. The group will be incorporated as a nonprofit, separate from the Obama Foundation, the personal offices of Barack and Michelle Obama, and Citizen 44, the LLC that the former president himself pays for to handle his own political involvement. Named “When We All Vote,” it will be stocked with prominent Obama alumni, including Valerie Jarrett as president of the board and former first lady chief of staff Tina Tchen as treasurer. Pete Rouse, an Obama senior adviser who served as interim White House chief of staff, will also be on the board . . . Organizers intend to send personal messages to people urging them to register. According to one document describing the group’s plans, it will partner with “outlets that young Americans use most.” So its nonpartisan, right? And the Obamas don’t deceive people, right? I mean, look at the roster of participants. And they’ll be trying to get young people off their video games and to stop texting for a few minutes to vote. Of course, they all vote Democratic. Here’s the video, which has just been released and has not yet been widely seen or even published, far as I can tell. I mean, honestly, have a look that people featured in this video. Young African Americans. An effusive young pajama-boy style white guy with a goatie. Um, Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, they are not likely conservative Republicans, as the makers of this video fully understand. And they are there to appeal to Democrats. This will be a tax-free effort to register Democrats. Thank you for contributing to Michelle’s new project. Michelle Obama is expanding her role in the Obama campaign, heading up a new effort… She raised money last night in Chicago for Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias and then at… President Obama will raise substantially less in the second quarter of his campaign than the… LOL, have they checked out the videos and testimonials at the FB #WalkAway Campaign site ? That’s where all their “targeted” reach seems to be hanging out. If Trump weaponized the IRS like obama did, they’d be dead in the water,lol! Well, we knew it was coming, didn’t we? We just weren’t sure of how they were going to format their anti-Trump, anti-American campaign for the midterms. Now we know. Good for her. If there’s one thing voters like? It’s a lecturing scold telling them what to do. You go, girl! Hope it works as well as her school lunch campaign did… I wonder if she’ll grow bored with this…remember #BringBackOurGirls? Re: When we ALL vote. That includes the illegals in California. And everywhere else. Screw each and everyone. Celebrities? BWAHAAAA. Dead to me. Amazing she could find time between attending Beyoncé concerts in Paris and vacations and all. This isn’t quite as extreme as the Democrat preparation for the Supreme Court nominee hearings but it’s close. See: https://freebeacon.com/culture/liberals-send-female-senate-democrats-pee-proof-underwear-oppose-trumps-scotus-pick/ OMG, what next? Reading the Freebeacon article was really quite disgusting. The idea of Elizabeth Warren wearing pee absorbing undies is just too much. Obviously, this limelight for MO leads to her being the nominee for president of our Republic in 2020. Follow the money right to the billionaire who has been NObama’s puppeteer for a long time! Do they really believe they are fooling us? Bring it, Moochie! Cheesey comes to mind, you go girl! Hand out those Obama iPads all day, don’t forget to check ID Ah, yes, and I am oh so sure (not) she will continue to adhere to her own standard of “when they go low, we go high”. I do so hope that the Republicans (well, Trump and his allies) do well in November. First, we need a better Congress and second, if/when the blue wave doesn’t materialize that will drive even more of the leftists insane. Just-call-me-Meesh-coat-tail rider seems to have put on the pounds — why doesn’t she just eat some healthy school lunch menus?

Most of us would be getting more excited about the £65million payout he's expected to receive, but perhaps under that gruff exterior bearded Lloyd, 63, is a man of simple pleasures. Hedge funder Crispin Odey's head of trading Ralph Beckett, son of the 4th Lord Grimthorpe, has retired after 18 years at the firm. Beckett, 61, is a contemporary of Odey's from Harrow but Crispin does enjoy stuffing his Mayfair offices with well-bred landed types. Current partners include Viscount Grimston, 40, the Earl of Sandwich's son, Orlando Montagu, 47, and Lord Roborough, 49. A hefty proportion of gorgeous female staff also seem to make it past Odey's vigorous interview process. Banker Bob Diamond says of former Treasury Select Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie, who memorably dragged him over the coals during the 2012 Libor scandal: 'There are few people I respect more than Andrew Tyrie. He had a tough job that day. I had a bit of a harder one, but I think he's a good man.' Good old Bob. Still a creep, isn't he? Creaky investor George Soros, 87, says Barack Obama, whose presidential campaign he backed early doors, was his 'greatest disappointment'. He tells the New York Times: 'He closed the door on me. He made one phone call thanking me for my support, which was meant to last for five minutes, and I engaged him, and he had to spend another three minutes with me, so I dragged it out to eight minutes.' Was the Leader of the Free World expected to spend hours drooling over the old toad? Singapore Airlines was named best carrier at the annual World Airline Awards. The title was won last year by Qatar Airways, whose chief, Hercule Poirot lookalike Akbar Al Baker, 56, sullied its crown by suggesting his job couldn't be done by a woman. He said: 'Of course it has to be led by a man, because it is a very challenging position.'

Steve,Cummings,1243,https://patch.com/california/petaluma/dont-call-police-yells-suspect-botched-petaluma-burglaries,"PETALUMA, CA — Police are hoping someone in the public may recognize a man suspected in a burglary and an attempted burglary early Tuesday in a Petaluma neighborhood. The first incident happened at 5:49 a.m. Tuesday when the unidentified man tried to enter a home on Spanish Bay Court via the front door, police said in a news release. In a surveillance image from the home's security cameras, the alleged prowler appeared to be a slender white man between 20 and 30 years old who was wearing a dark-colored baseball cap and light-colored clothing. The suspect also appeared to be holding something in his right hand, police said. The second incident was reported about 30 minutes later — at 6:23 a.m. — when a resident of nearby Silverado Circle called 911. The caller told dispatchers someone turned on a garden hose in their backyard, which caught their attention. The suspect used an exterior door to enter the garage, then an interior door to enter the home — where he was confronted by the homeowner. The resident said the suspect then left the residence through a side yard, yelling ""Don't call the police."" Investigators were able to determine from a neighbor's security camera footage that the suspect fled north toward a creek area. The suspect is described as a slender white man who appeared to be about 5 foot 11 inches tall with a weight of about 180 pounds who was wearing a dark-green jacket, light-colored jeans and was armed with a golf cub. Anyone who recognizes him is encouraged to call Petaluma police Officer Steve Cummings at 707-781-1249.

Steve,Cummings,1243,http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/sport/16364438.mark-cavendishs-tour-de-france-over-after-missing-time-cut/,"Walthamstow 7°c Mark Cavendish's Tour de France is over. Picture: Action Images Mark Cavendish is out of the Tour de France after missing the time cut by more than half an hour on stage 11. The Manxman finally crossed the line in La Rosiere some 65 minutes after stage winner Geraint Thomas, who was deep into the post-race press conference when Cavendish reached the ski station at the end of a 108.5km run from Albertville. The time cut had been set at 31 minutes 27 seconds after Thomas crossed the line. It means the 33-year-old, who has a property in Ongar, has ended a second consecutive Tour early without adding to his tally of 30 Tour stage wins, still four shy of Eddy Merckx's all-time record. He was one of three riders eliminated by the time cut on the day, along with team-mate Mark Renshaw and fellow sprinter Marcel Kittel, who like Cavendish has endured a frustrating Tour one year on from winning five stages in the 2017 edition. Kittel's team-mate Rick Zabel came home just five seconds after the time cut, but found the commissaires in forgiving mood as he suffered a late mechanical, meaning the German will take the start today. It was a second straight day of struggle for Cavendish, who was only 28 seconds inside the time cut on Tuesday as part of a large gruppetto. Cavendish won four stages in the 2016 Tour, but since then has suffered a succession of illnesses and injuries. ""He's lean and he looks in good shape but it shows the lack of racing he's had,"" said Team Dimension Data boss Doug Ryder as he waited for his sprinter to reach the finish line. ""He hasn't ridden a Grand Tour since 2016."" It was a bitter disappointment for the South African-registered team, who marked Mandela Day in 2015 with Steve Cummings' Tour stage victory in Mende, but ended this one with the loss of their star man. Cavendish did not hang around to speak to reporters himself, crossing the line and immediately turning around to freewheel back to the team's hotel for the night. Cavendish's fate was clear from midway through the stage, with Dimension Data electing to call forward Julien Vermote and Jay Thomson from pacing duties to avoid them suffering the same fate. Though he knew what was coming, Cavendish insisted on finishing the stage rather than hitching a ride in the broom wagon. Speaking at the start of the Tour, Ryder had sounded unsure if Cavendish would survive the mountains, trying instead to put the focus on sprint opportunities in the first week, though the best he could manage was eighth place on stage eight to Amiens. ""We went in hot,"" Ryder said. ""We wanted to try and win early because the opportunities were there and there was a chance of a yellow jersey. Sadly it didn't materialise. ""For sure we were hoping that he would get through today and tomorrow so that he could focus on Friday. We were hoping Cav would get better but I guess the lack of racing over the last two years has affected his power to get through tough tours."" Though a contract has yet to be announced, Ryder has said he has an agreement in principle for Cavendish to stay with his team, and he remains convinced Cavendish can still catch Merckx. ""You never write off someone like Cav and he's still young. Guys like (Andre) Greipel are still winning stages and they're two or three years older than Cav. ""His mind is very strong. He wants it badly. I think it's just physiology.""

Michael,Gordon,1242,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/obituaries/robert-keating-judge-who-backed-jail-alternatives-dies-at-76.html,"Supported by By Sam Roberts Robert G. M. Keating, a former judge who was instrumental in founding a community court in Manhattan that enlisted low-level offenders in neighborhood service programs instead of sending them to jail, died on Saturday in Stony Brook, N.Y. He was 76. His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his son Bobby. He did not specify the cause. Justice Keating held several leadership roles in criminal justice agencies and the courts. But he left his most enduring legacy as chief administrative judge of New York City’s Criminal Court, the job in which he oversaw the establishment of the Midtown Community Court in 1993. That court was, in a way, a back-to-the-future experiment in returning the swift, visible administration of justice to the communities where crimes had been committed — in this case, Times Square and the theater district. Most judicial proceedings had been centralized in each borough much earlier in the 20th century. Prostitutes, graffiti vandals and other minor offenders were offered alternative sentences, including clearing litter and painting over defaced property, coupled with mental health and sexual abuse counseling and monitored drug treatment. The goal was not only to reduce crime (by one count, an offender who completed a drug-treatment program was 71 percent less likely to be rearrested) but also to instill confidence within the community that the criminal justice system could function fairly and efficiently. Similar courts were soon established elsewhere in the city and in, among other places, Britain, South Africa and Australia. Herbert J. Sturz, Justice Keating’s predecessor as New York City’s criminal justice coordinator, said that when he suggested the establishment of the community court, Justice Keating immediately embraced the idea. “He was experienced, he was a generous human being, he felt this was in the interests of the public and the court system, and he had enough confidence to say this made sense,” Mr. Sturz said in a telephone interview. Justice Keating acknowledged that judicial systems were generally averse to innovation. But, he added, “It’s easier to change things if you’re replacing chaos.” The experimental tribunal spawned the Center for Court Innovation, a public-private partnership between the state’s Unified Court System and the Fund for the City of New York. As the chief assistant Brooklyn district attorney, Justice Keating had also begun a program to divert minor drug offenders to treatment instead of prison. He later instituted another program through which defendants received courthouse counseling about drug abuse, AIDS and tuberculosis. Robert Gordon Michael Keating was born on Sept. 25, 1941, in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn to Edward Keating, a firefighter, who died of a heart attack when Bob was 5, and Mary (Gordon) Keating, a teacher. After graduating from Xavier High School in Manhattan, he earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Georgetown University and a law degree from Duke University School of Law. In addition to his son Bobby, he is survived by his wife, Mary Lou (DeMarco) Keating, and another son, Christopher. He and his wife lived in Bellport Village, N.Y., on Long Island. Justice Keating was a Legal Aid lawyer before joining the Kings County district attorney’s office in 1979. In 1980, despite his opposition to capital punishment, he was named criminal justice coordinator by Mayor Edward I. Koch, a supporter of the death penalty. Justice Keating pressed prosecutors and the courts for tougher enforcement of gun laws and speedier trials. He was named administrative judge for the Criminal Court in 1984. In 1987, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appointed him to the Court of Claims. In 1995 he became administrative judge of the State Supreme Court for Brooklyn and Staten Island. He left for private practice and an executive role with a medical management company in 1996. He later served under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg as vice chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Judiciary. In 2002 he was named to lead the New York State Judicial Institute, a training and research partnership among the governor, the Legislature, the court system and Pace University. Justice Keating was named vice president for strategic initiatives at Pace in 2008 and served as senior adviser to the university’s president until he retired on June 30. His retirement party had been scheduled for this past Monday. Advertisement

It reports next week, and I’ve got to tell you, my charitable trust is not wavering. We’d like to be able to buy some in the $120s, $130s, but I think [CEO Scott] Santi, who’s been on the show, should come on and talk about why business isn’t as bad as the stock indicates.” Deutsche Bank AG: “Look, the company did say that things are better than expected. I think that it wouldn’t be a bad idea for them to raise capital. They have not said that. I don’t care what the book is. I’ve been fooled by book value before.” Forescout Technologies, Inc.: “I feel even [more] strongly about this now and I also like, by the way, Palo Alto. I like Cyberark. I think those are absolutely terrific. I like Nice, I think that is good. And I like Proofpoint, particularly because now we are back battling with the Chinese on intellectual property and that means that the Chinese might be making it so that we need more cybersecurity.” Applied Materials, Inc.: “Applied Materials, I think, at this level, is too cheap. I saw Lam Research going up. Now, it may take the whole cycle. It may actually literally take six to nine months for Applied Materials to come back, but I am urging patience.” Cardinal Health, Inc.: “It yields almost 4 percent. I liked it higher. It is hard for me to imagine how this stock got all the way down to $50. It is just not that bad at 10 times earnings.” Buckeye Partners: “Don’t buy any more. Last night, [Enbridge CEO] Al Monaco, I think, opened a lot of people’s eyes with Enbridge when he basically said that the master limited partnership model is not working, therefore I think that my inclination is don’t buy any more of that stock.” Opko Health, Inc.: “Opko’s coming back and we know [CEO] Dr. [Phillip] Frost never sold any stock and we know the stock is low, but I have no thesis to recommend the stock without Dr. Frost coming on here and telling us.” Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Illinois Tool Works.

The American Cancer Society recently estimated that by 2026, there will be nearly 26 million cancer survivors living in the U.S. as more people than ever are surviving cancer. The ability to survive a diagnosis of cancer has come as a result of improvements in care and an increase in Clinical Trials designed to address early diagnosis and developing better care and therapies resulting in more effective treatments. The mounting success of advanced cancer medicine progress continues to be revealed through innovative nontraditional-but still highly relevant-clinical trials. Recent scientific and drug-development advancements have created new opportunities and complexities in today's cancer treatment and research paradigm.

Jane,Powers,1239,https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/lifestyle/features/poet-paul-muldoons-intimate-work-incantata-is-being-re-imagined-for-the-theatre-at-galway-arts-festival-855901.html,"Poet Paul Muldoon’s intensely intimate work, ‘Incantata’, is being re-imagined for the theatre and will premiere at the Galway Arts Festival, writes Marjorie Brennan. Paul Muldoon is considered one of Ireland’s greatest contemporary poets; as one reviewer described him in The New York Times: “Only Yeats before him could write with such measured fury”. However, when Muldoon wrote Incantata, often described as one of the great elegies of 20th century Irish poetry, it was not anger that was fuelling him but grief. The poem was written in memory of Muldoon’s former partner, the American artist Mary Farl Powers, who had been Muldoon’s partner and later remained a close friend. She died in 1992 after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Muldoon describes the process of writing Incantata as akin to being possessed. It was almost like a demonic possession — whatever that is, what I imagine that to be. It sort of took over and I wrote it in three days, morning, noon and night. I was exhausted by it Incantata is now being reimagined for the theatre and will be staged at the Galway International Arts Festival this month. Muldoon is delighted that this incarnation of his poem will facilitate its transmission to a wider audience. “As a former director myself, my view of these matters is that the writer has finished his or her work when the ribbon runs out on the typewriter, or the ink runs out of the pen. After that it’s kind of up for grabs, it belongs to anyone. I’m a person who believes — and people laugh when I say it but I don’t care — that I don’t write my own poems. My investment is minimal and I like the idea that anyone would read them at all, and that someone might take a fresh line on it, let alone one I think is in keeping with the spirit of the piece itself.” Incantata is being directed by Sam Yates, whose most recent work has been on a West End production of Glengarry Glen Ross. After directing the work of one Pulitzer Prize winner, David Mamet, Yates says he was thrilled at the prospect of working with another — Muldoon. The challenge of bringing such an intense piece of work to the stage was also an exhilarating one. 📽 Paul Fahy caught up with #Incantata director @SamYates2020 & actor #StanleyTownsend to talk about this ""rollercoaster ride of a show"", written by Paul Muldoon. Townsend's tour de force performance is a #mustsee. ➡️ STARTS MONDAY @THTG July 16-27 https://t.co/3u9pY5tEia … pic.twitter.com/jQ6ZWHkeHe “I was excited, and scared, because the text, it’s an incredible piece. But fear is the petrol — as soon as you see something and think, ‘how will this work on stage’, that’s when you think, ‘come on, let’s get on with it’.” Incantata is an intensely personal and intimate piece of work, and opening that up into something that can be digested by a theatre audience is a huge task. This is reflected in the fact that Yates has been working on Incantata with Irish actor Stanley Townsend for months, breaking down the text. “We have spent a couple of days a week over a few months, doing a couple of pages of the text, just the references. So we started in a very academic way,” says Yates. “From there, you have to envisage a world for it and a central character who’s the speaker. We have found it to be a poem about creating and trying to make art from pain. That’s really our departure point, ‘what does the act of creation look like?’.” Yates has also met with Muldoon, and Mary Farl Powers’ sister, Jane Powers, to get a sense of the characters. “Muldoon’s quite elliptical, he doesn’t say ‘Mary was this or that’, he’s staving off grief by filling the poem with bits of the world,” says Yates. “So what you see on stage is a guy trying to make something that encapsulates the person [they have lost] and the feelings they’re going through. We’re asking big, big questions and the hope is it’ll transcend what was a very personal creation to become something universal.” Muldoon says he hopes that the staging of Incantata will also bring the work of Mary Farl Powers to a wider audience. Born in Minnesota, Powers came to Ireland in 1951 and studied at the Dun Laoghaire School of Art, and the National College of Art. She was known for her work as a printmaker and was a member of Aosdána. “She was a truly wonderful person, she was very funny, but also very serious,” says Muldoon. “She was very committed to her art-making but not in a self-regarding way. Her prints are really quite remarkable. I hope they’re able to display some of her work in Galway. Unfortunately, there is such an assault on our senses from all quarters that there’s always a danger things get lost in the dreadful, day-to-day shuffle of things. I don’t think Mary is forgotten at all by people who know anything about the history of printmaking in Ireland, but the fact is that people who know anything about the history of printmaking in Ireland are probably like the people who know anything about the history of poetry in Ireland, comparatively few and far between despite what we’d like to believe.” Final days of rehearsal here in Galway for #Incantata and what a rollercoaster ride of a show it is. It's shaping up to be a real Festival highlight with an outstanding performance by Stanley Townsend. Starting next week! Mon July 16 - Fri July 27 https://t.co/3u9pY5tEia pic.twitter.com/z8sNPgf9Lh Muldoon is speaking to me from the Long Island holiday spot of Fire Island, where he is staying with friends. He resides in New York, where until last year, he was poetry editor of The New Yorker. The evening before we speak, five reporters were shot dead in Annapolis, Maryland. I wonder what it is like being a writer now in the febrile political atmosphere of the US, with anti-press and anti-intellectual sentiment brewing? “I don’t know about America but throughout the world, some of our cherished ideas are under assault, and it’s clearer and clearer how tenuous our hold on civil order is,” says Muldoon. “In America at the moment there does seem to be a return to an era in which women’s rights are under threat again. I’ve taken to pointing out to my friends in the US — not boastfully, I hope — the direction in which Ireland is going. These are complex issues but the fact is Ireland is way ahead of the game on so many things, and the Irish can take tremendous…. I don’t know about comfort, but the Irish have done very well in recent years to rise above some of the difficulties that beset them. Many of them were difficulties made by men — the trick would now be to make sure those boys are out of the game. We have to be vigilant at all times and hope things are going to change for the better.” And for Muldoon, there is always the writing. “I’m working on a poem today,” he says. “I scribble away all the time on this, that and the other.” Incantata by Paul Muldoon; Town Hall Theatre, Galway Jul 16–21, 8pm; Jul 24 and 27, 6pm and 9pm; matinees Jul 19 and 21, 2pm; post-show talk Jul 19, following 9pm performance. www.giaf.ie Receive our lunchtime briefing straight to your inbox More in this Section Mumford and Sons achieve something many bands attempt but rarely pull off Ensuring Britain is still open for the business of arts He dreamed a dream: Killian Donnelly talks about leading Les Miserables in Dublin this Christmas Islands of Ireland: Islandhopping to Hop Island Breaking Stories How the Spice Girls’ hair has evolved, according to Mel C’s hairdresser Cookbook review: Jamie’s Friday Night Feast Cookbook by Jamie Oliver Are ceramide tablets the key to younger looking skin?

Kheir, who has raced imports of the quality of Melbourne Cup winner Protectionist as well as Group 1 winner Our Ivanhowe and the Japanese galloper Ambitious, will race all five horses with Phil Mehrten - part-owner of Melbourne Cup winners Rekindling and Almandin - John O'Neil and his brother Victor in his blue and gold colours worn by Ambitious. The five horses - headed by Cups contender Tosen Basil - will arrive on July 28 and will be split between trainers Darren Weir and Anthony Freedman. Six-year-old Tosen Basil is a winner of five of his 20 starts and will be prepared by Weir. He is twice Group 2-placed in Japan and has form through the likes of Japan Cup winner Cheval Grand. Tosen Basil has been purchased in partnership with Yulong Investments, the first partnership between Yulong and the Ozzie Kheir team. Kheir said from the US: ""I'm very excited to bring Tosen Basil to Australia with Yulong. We know he's a very good stayer with some world-class form and we hope that is enough to win a major cup. ""I think it's a perfect horse to kick off a partnership with Yulong. ""I'm very grateful to have access to these high-quality Japanese horses and I've focussed on building a strong international team in the last few years, hopefully these horses will do everyone proud, here in Australia and also in Japan."" Joining Tosen Basil in Australia is Group 3-winning sprinter Cassius and highly-rated Deep Impact colt Admire Robson, who will both be trained by Weir, while veteran stayer Happy Moment and Deep Impact colt Danon Roman will be trained by Freedman. The arrivals make eight Japanese horses purchased by Kheir in the past six months, and follow earlier purchases Ambitious, A Shin Rook, and the Chris Waller-trained Admire Winner. He is also importing sisters to Tosen Stardom and Brave Smash in foal to star stallion Lord Kanaloa. Kheir and his owners also have shares in Marmelo, Wall Of Fire and Mask Of Time.

Bob,Diamond,1237,http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/uk_national_news/16360281.former-barclays-boss-diamond-says-it-was-not-fair-he-took-blame-for-libor/,"Bradford 7°c Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond Former Barclays chief Bob Diamond has said he “didn’t think it was fair” that he took the blame for banking misconduct during the Libor scandal, but admitted he could have “done things better” during the financial crisis. The long-time banker – whose short stint as chief executive lasted from 2011 to 2012 – recalled the day he was asked to step down as chief executive, calling it “the most challenging” professional decision of his life. He had been told he had lost the confidence of the Bank of England, the Chancellor and the City watchdog despite Barclays having been the first to settle with authorities over Libor-rigging – paying £290 million in 2012. He begrudgingly bowed to board pressure. “The request for me to resign was, in my mind, not the right decision in terms of how I conducted myself, how I behaved, how I was doing in the institution, the support I had from the various constituencies.” Mr Diamond claims he decided to step down to protect both the bank and his family. “I decided that if I act according to everything I believe, then the number one is what’s good for Barclays and the second thing is what’s good for my family. “And I had to admit that I had become a lightning rod. I didn’t like that. “It didn’t feel like me, it didn’t look like me, I didn’t think it was appropriate, I didn’t think it was fair, but I had become a lightning rod and I thought it was better for me to step down and do the right thing than ask the board to support me.” When asked whether he thought it was fair that current Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has been able to keep his job despite having been fined by regulators for unmasking a whistleblower, Mr Diamond told the Press Association: “I don’t worry about that stuff.” Mr Diamond, who was speaking at a How to: Academy event in Westminster, also recalled how the Libor scandal brought him in front of the Treasury Select Committee, where he came face to face with its former chairman and Tory MP Andrew Tyrie. “It was gruelling to be in front of the Treasury Select Committee. There are few people I have met that I respect more than Andrew Tyrie. He had a tough job that day. I had a bit of a harder one, but I think he … is a good man.” The former Barclays boss – who now heads his own financial services firm Atlas Mara – stressed that Barclays remains one of the few to have survived the financial crisis without a Government bailout. But Mr Diamond said he was willing to admit he had not always done his best, particularly in the lead-up to the financial crisis. “There was no banker who didn’t make mistakes during this period, so could I have done things better? Absolutely. “I think what I’m proud of though, is that during that period Barclays survived, we were stable.” ­Looking ahead, he expects the banking landscape to become more localised, with successful strategies set to be more regional than global for international lenders. The transition away from “universal” banks will mean the sector will innovate and fail if necessary, without bringing down the entire financial system, he said. Mr Diamond added: “If I am correct and the exciting part of financial services is going to be more national, regional and less global – more focused on selective and less universal – then failure again is an option. “If these smaller, national firms fail, we’re not creating systemic risk. “It’s OK, some of them are going to fail and many of them are going to be very successful so … I’m very optimistic about the future of financial services.” Get involved with the news in your community This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

The course gave up forty-two birdies and three eagles as eight of the twenty-six participants finished with rounds in the seventies. It was also a special day as one family of golfers had a three -generation family day of golfing fun together as eighty-two-year-old Red Thompson was paired with his son Wayne and Grandson Adam from Mebane, NC and Grandson Phillip from Texas. The tournament was capped off with a delicious meal furnished by Vera Hopkins of Southern Hills. Steve Cummings led all scoring today as he carded four birdies to finish one under par at 71 in the A Flight. Cummings had finished tied for first place in the Tours last event only to lose in the play-off. The win today boosted him to the top of the season money winners list and gave him his second win of the season. PaulGriffin who had previously had two first place finishes tried to stay with Cummings as he carded three birdies and posted his best round of the season at 74; but had to settle for second place this time. Teddy Darnell also picked up his second win of the season in the B Flight with his round of 75. Darnell only had one birdie in the round but was able to hold off second place Warner Dyke who carded four birdies by posting 13 pars while Dyke only posted 7. Dyke finished with a 79 for the day.

Rick,McVey,1233,https://www.marketsmedia.com/fimsac-recommends-e-trading-regulatory-reform/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission staff might be toying with the idea of regulating electronic fixed-income trading venues at self-regulatory organizations, according to the line of questioning from the latest Fixed-Income Markets Structure Advisory Committee open meeting. During the last panel discussion, Brett Redfearn, director of the Division of Trading and Markets at the SEC, posed questions to the subcommittee on technology and electronic trading how they would address regulating the electronic fixed-income market starting from a clean slate. He raised the issues of which key regulatory objectives there should be, whether regulations should support operational transparency, system integrity, resiliency standards, as well as other typical topics that SROs face currently. The subcommittee went as far as proposing that the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board create a working group tasked with reviewing the regulatory framework for the corporate and municipal bond markets’ electronic trading platforms. The proposal also noted that any revised regulatory framework should ensure fair and effective markets without any regulatory gaps or hamper the innovation of new trading protocols and business models. At the same time, the proposal’s authors also recommended that the SEC should amend Regulation ATS and any other applicable rules to take in the account the nature of fixed-income market structure and trading protocols as well as the cost-benefit of existing and future regulations. Ben Macdonald,Bloomberg “It might have cost the industry $2.5 billion to implement MiFID II just to arrive at pre-trade transparency for about 400 bonds,” Ben Macdonald, global head of enterprise products at Bloomberg and president of Bloomberg SEF. “The cost-benefit of that is worth bearing in mind. With that said, what I think MiFID II does very well is laying the foundation of an ecosystem of trading that ultimately provides a funnel of post-trade reporting.” “There are a lot of lessons to be learned from that process,” agreed Doug Friedman, general counsel at Tradeweb. “The regulation must recognize the differences in how markets trade, the impact of trading, and reporting on liquidity, the time and cost of resources associated with any implementation, and also the opportunity costs. You have to prioritize regulatory and compliance over what might be commercial innovation potentially.” No matter what happens, regulators need to address the arbitrary nature of the existing regulatory framework regarding electronic fixed-income trading, stressed Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess and chairman of the subcommittee. Depending on whether a venue caters to click-to-trade retail investors or institutional investors who prefer requests-for-quotes, the SEC and FINRA may regulate them as an ATS operator or a broker-dealer, he noted. “There is at least one example of an e-trading participant in both retail and institutional markets that are not regulated by either FINRA or ATS regulations today,” McVey added. “The committee believes that the differences are based on trading protocols and not business models and, to a certain extent, revenue models.” And receive exclusive articles on securities markets Cantor Fitzgerald cites execution quality, customization, and access to liquidity as trading differentiators.

The bank was also named Worldâ€™s Best Bank for Financing, Worldâ€™s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, among other awards. Commenting on the awards, the President of Citi and Head of Citi’s Institutional Clients Group, Mr. Jamie Forese, said: “Citi has had a tremendous 12 months, delivering on our commitments by leveraging the synergies of our ICG platform. â€œWe continue to see evidence in our results that our major advantage when serving large, sophisticated clients is our global network — one that cannot be replicated by our competition. Being recognised by Euromoney is a testament to our capabilities.” On being named Worldâ€™s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, Citiâ€™s Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chair of the Citi Foundation, Ed Skyler said: â€œThe societal issues impacting our communities today require a different level of engagement from companies. Itâ€™s no longer about being a good corporate citizen. â€œWe must use our business, our philanthropy and our voice to stand for issues that matter most.â€ Also, the CEO of Citi Nigeria, Akin Dawodu, said the award was a further proof of the uniqueness of Citi’s footprint and its ability to put its expertise and products at the disposal of its customers, wherever they may be. â€œWe are all proud to be part of such a great and unique institution and will continue to put our clients at the forefront of everything we do,â€ Dawodu added. Commenting on Citiâ€™s success, Euromoney noted that: â€œThe rationale behind Citiâ€™s nomination as the worldâ€™s best investment bank this year is simple, but impressive. In every part of the world that Euromoney considered the credentials of the leading regional investment banks, Citi was a genuine contender.â€ Citi was also recognised across a number of regional categories namely Best Investment Bank in Central and Eastern Europe, Spain, Middle East and Chile, Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility in North America, Best bank for Financing in Africa and Latin America, Best bank for Advisory in Western Europe, Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Latin America and Best Bank for Transaction Services in Africa and Central and Eastern Europe

Andrew Davis speaks at a CivicCon presentation Monday, July 16, 2018, at the Rex Theatre in Pensacola.(Photo: Tony Giberson/tgiberson@pnj.com)Buy Photo Want to get rich? Target a niche. That's the simplified takeaway from Andrew Davis' CivicCon presentation ""The Laws of Attraction"" on Monday evening in Pensacola. Davis, a keynote speaker and bestselling author, spent three years crisscrossing the country searching for a common thread in ways thriving communities market themselves. He found most successful places have “staked a claim” and made themselves synonymous with an industry or lifestyle. In fact, through research he has found that communities that stake a claim earn over $3 billion more a year than comparable communities that don't. More: CivicCon: Learn the 'Laws of Attraction' with Andrew Davis Napa Valley is known for wine. Memphis is known for barbecue. Nashville is known for country music. Batavia, New York, is the “Greek yogurt capital of the world,” and Warsaw, Indiana, is the ""orthopedic capital of the world.” ""In the places that are really, really booming, every one of those businesses' owners market the place they do business just as much — if not more — than the businesses they do,"" Davis told the News Journal on Monday morning. “It creates an aura around the place.” CivicCon logo (Photo: CivicCon) According to Davis, there's a clear benefit to a community staking a claim. When any business owner, job seeker, prospective customer or supplier is figuring out where to target their efforts, they're not asking themselves if they should be in that particular community. They are asking themselves if they can afford to be anywhere else. Davis is the ninth speaker of CivicCon, a partnership between the News Journal and the Studer Community Institute to create community conversations on how civic engagement and smart planning can make Pensacola and better place to live, grow, work and invest. Past CivicCon speakers have addressed how important it is for Pensacola to plan for the future and to protect and preserve the things that make it unique. Davis weighed in on why it’s important that Pensacola learn to share its story. More: What is CivicCon? After hearing about the area’s growing renown in the realm of cybersecurity, he discussed what an economic driver it could be if Pensacola could stake a claim as the cybersecurity capital of the South, or even the world. “I can guarantee if I was at (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) right now and I heard that, and I was interested in cybersecurity, I'd start to wonder if … I should pick up and move to the cybersecurity capital of the world,” Davis said. More: UWF touts Gulf Coast's cybersecurity achievements in Washington, DC He described it as creating location envy. “You create this emotional connection in the mind of that audience where they believe they will be more successful here than any place in the world,” Davis said. “Then they show up.” When creating location envy, there are ""three laws of attraction"" regions must keep in mind to get people emotionally invested in their “place,” according to Davis. The first one is a cornerstone, a claim to excellence that you can support and maintain. He said something like “craft beer capital of the South” might sound good until you find out three other cities are all making the same claim. “You can't just claim you're going to be the ‘awesomest’ place on earth and you can't pick something other people are doing are already very well,” Davis said. Andrew Davis speaks at a CivicCon presentation Monday, July 16, 2018, at the Rex Theatre in Pensacola. (Photo: Tony Giberson/tgiberson@pnj.com) Davis added the second law is having an “origin story,” the tale of how your community came to be ""the"" place to be. In Batavia, a Turkish immigrant bought a rundown factory in New York and transformed it into a $3 billion yogurt brand. It screams to any other yogurt startup, ""if he can do it, so can I."" Warsaw's success started with one entrepreneur who started a company out of an old hotel in the 1890s. The company grew to become one of the country's most successful orthopedic companies, then leveraged that reputation to recruit more than 50 more orthopedic companies. The final law is a place needs a visionary — a person or a group who sees the place's potential and works to bring it to fruition. Davis added the visionary doesn't have to be an elected official or a millionaire. It can be the owner of the local coffee shop, the head of a neighborhood association or a homemaker with a vision for what the community can be. ""Everybody in here, whether your a businesses owner or just a person, you need to think about how you place your place in people's minds,"" Davis said. CivicCon's next speaker will be Gena Wirth, the design principal at SCAPE in New York. Wirth specializes in landscape architecture, urban planning and horticulture, and on Aug. 20, she will speak about urban waterfronts and coastal resilience.

Michael,Gordon,1228,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nz-cpi-rose-04-in-june-quarter-westpac-201807170423,"Michael Gordon, Senior Economist at Westpac, notes that New Zealand’s consumer prices rose 0.4% in the June quarter, lifting the annual inflation rate from 1.1% to 1.5%. Key Quotes “Fuel and food prices made the biggest contribution, but a range of ‘core’ measures of inflation also rose modestly on an annual basis.” “The details were firmer than the headline. Tradables inflation was soft, partly due to some unusual factors, but the more persistent non-tradables component was stronger than expected.” “Annual inflation rose from 1.1% to 1.5%, and we expect a further increase into year-end. However, this partly reflects soft CPI outturns a year ago; the underlying trend is more of a gradual pickup in inflation pressures.” “We continue to expect the Reserve Bank to keep the OCR on hold for some time.” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Michael,Gordon,1228,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/07/17/brennan-elated-with-rapid-progress-of-brimson/,"TITANS There has been at least one blessing for the Titans around the fall in form of high-expectations halfback Ash Taylor – the emergence of 19-year-old Alexander (AJ) Brimson. Brimson, in his eighth match since replacing Kane Elgey as Taylor's halves partner, has gathered the confidence and trust of teammates to become a second point of attack for the struggling Titans – even though coach Garth Brennan sees his future at fullback. In his seven games before being dropped, Elgey was a genuine 'go to' man for the Titans in attack and an effective ally for Taylor. He was responsible for four try assists and three line assists and ran for an average 71 metres, but Brennan didn't trust his defence. During his eight games in the No. 6 jersey, Brimson has been enormous defensively against bigger men who have targeted him however, while not shy to run and posing a threat, he was not engaging the line or provide a voice like Elgey did and hardly kicked. However, since the round 16 game against Wests Tigers it is obvious his confidence and willingness to call the play has improved enormously, and that performance – and Sunday's against Sydney Roosters – have been his best. And it is all aimed at taking the Titans away from being too one-dimensional in attack, particularly on last tackle plays, and taking pressure off Taylor who has succumbed to errors and stuttered with his game-flow in recent weeks. And the fact Brimson was backing up in his third game in eight days, after playing a prominent role in Queensland under-20s convincing victory over NSW on Wednesday night, made the effort even more admirable. ""AJ was enormous,"" enthused Brennan. ""He ran the ball and whenever a halfback runs the ball, he is threatening. ""Ash (Taylor) drifted in and out of the game. He had some good plays and some plays he'd like to have again but the difference was that AJ took it upon himself to take some pressure off Ash which is pleasing. ""We're starting to see AJ develop into the halfback to compliment Ash that we're looking for."" Taylor leads the NRL's try-assist list with 16, yet Elgey (71m) and Brimson (77m) run the ball a lot more than Taylor (42m) and Brimson has started to take on the last-play high kicks with good effect. He is also calling plays close to the try-line when they were often over-burdened on Taylor. ""I'm slowly getting more confident each week and easing into the role,"" said Brimson. ""I'm trying to take some pressure off Ash. Obviously he's the number one kicker and has a great kicking game. ""But teams are starting to realise that and put him under pressure so I'm trying to step up and give that second kick option and try to get the boys to believe in me and that I can get the job done. ""It comes with me being more confidence and the team having more confidence in me."" Brennan is keen to get Tyrone Roberts back to the club next season. Roberts has a close personal relationship with Taylor and they combine well on the field but there is likely to be no room in the salary cap unless other players are moved on. Fullback Michael Gordon turns 35 in October but has been in outstanding form and has another season to run on his contract. Elgey is looking elsewhere, so the mystery is where Brimson plays next season and long term with those machinations in play. Certainly, he is improving week to week and has shown no signs of being a teenager intimidated by the pressure.

Jimmy Matlock used commercials for his tire business to campaign for Congress in violation of federal election law, a complaint filed by his opponent claims. Matlock says it's a lie. Matlock, R-Lenoir City and owner of Matlock Tire Service and Auto Repair, seeks the Republican nomination for the 2nd District U.S. House seat long held by retiring Rep John J. ""Jimmy"" Duncan Jr. He faces several rivals in the Aug. 2 primary, including Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, whose campaign manager Andrew Davis filed the complaint Friday with the Federal Election Commission. ""Matlock Tire Service has funded a television advertisement campaign ... for the sole purpose of promoting congressional candidate Jimmy Matlock,"" Davis wrote in the complaint. ""This activity evidences a calculated effort to evade the prohibition on corporate contributions to federal campaigns and has resulted in illegal corporate contributions and illegal coordinated communications."" Matlock's campaign denies any wrongdoing and says it followed the law. Tim Burchett with his wife, Kelly, and their daughter, Isabel in the Town of Farragut's 31st annual Independence Day Parade Wednesday, July 4, 2018. (Photo: Michael Patrick/News Sentinel) ""Matlock Tire makes business decisions independent of the political environment, something a career politician like Tim Burchett would never understand, and Matlock Tire running television advertisements is nothing new,"" campaign spokesman Sean Lansing said in an email. ""The company is celebrating its 65th anniversary in the community and is advertising that similarly to their 60th anniversary — when Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett celebrated them with a proclamation."" Victor Ashe: GOP rivals blast Jimmy Matlock’s attendance in Legislature The complaint cites a surge in ""blatantly self-promotional"" advertisements for Matlock's business produced by the same ad agency, The Bingham Group, that has produced his campaign ads, sometimes using ""nearly identical"" wording. Matlock's campaign says a separate agency, Outlaw Media, produced its TV ads, and another agency, Flexpoint Media, handles broadcast ad buys. ""Bingham Group has not produced any television ads or placed any television buys for the campaign,"" Lansing said. The commercials often ran on the same channels — mainly Fox News, HGTV and the History Channel — as those targeted by ad buys for the Matlock campaign, according to the complaint. The ads are focused on Matlock rather than the business and appeared to be timed not to conflict with campaign commercials, the complaint claims.

The parade featured one veteran from each branch of the military serving as grand marshal, and all vets and active military were invited to walk behind the boat. (Photo: Michael Patrick/News Sentinel) Sometimes Matlock didn't even bother to change clothes between ads, Davis wrote. ""Matlock for Congress and its campaign consultants did not buy any broadcast airtime during the period that the Matlock Tire advertisement was on the air,"" Davis wrote. ""Furthermore, the corporate-funded TV ad features Jimmy Matlock, as well as images, language and themes substantially similar to those currently being utilized in materials promoting Jimmy Matlock's congressional campaign — which isn't surprising since all the same principals ... are involved in crafting both ad campaigns."" Federal election law bars candidates from using private business funds to campaign. The complaint cites a 2004 case involving an Illinois candidate for U.S. Senate, James Oberweis, who was fined by the FEC for using ads for his dairy business to pump up his name recognition while campaigning. ""Matlock Tire paid for the advertisements,"" Davis wrote. ""The TV ad campaign was within 90 days of the Tennessee primary. ... It was not until Jimmy Matlock declared his candidacy that Matlock Tire's advertisements began featuring him so prominently. Furthermore, these recent advertisements do not solicit business ... These advertisements' only purpose is to promote Jimmy Matlock's campaign using illegal corporate contributions."" Matlock called the complaint a distraction from real issues. ""Instead of debating the issues that matter to East Tennessee voters and explaining his liberal record, his campaign is attacking small business owners who serve our community with false claims,"" Lansing said. It's not clear how long the FEC might take to respond to the complaint.

Andrew,Davis,1226,http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41197-17th-Annual-Employee-Engagement-Summit-Tackles-Tough-Topics-and-Inspires-Action,"November 19, 2018 More than 135 leaders from companies including American Express, Best Buy, Campbell Soup Company, the Coca-Cola Company, Johnson & Johnson, KPMG, and PwC US joined forces at the 2018 Charities@Work Employee Engagement Summit to drive greater social impact Submitted by: Charities@Work Categories: Events, Corporate Social Responsibility Posted: Jul 16, 2018 – 08:35 AM EST ALEXANDRIA, Va., Jul. 16 /CSRwire/ - This year’s new Charities@Work preconference peer-learning workshop brought a sold-out crowd to PwC in New York City on June 27, where CSR experts and newcomers shared fresh ideas for success and aligning efforts with business objectives. “The expectations and awareness in the CSR field have grown considerably in the past several years,” said Heather Lofkin Wright, Director, Responsible Business Leadership, PwC US. “Today’s practitioners can make the biggest impact if they lead with intention and purpose and learn from each other. I’m glad we could host this strong group of leaders for this important dialogue.” An even larger group of leading global companies gathered at the annual Employee Engagement Summit on June 28 for frank conversations where everyone had a voice. Top trends discussed included keeping it real with authentic communications; understanding the corporate imperative to speak up on social issues and ignite employee activism; moving beyond numbers to impact; and aligning employee engagement and CSR efforts with business objectives. Andrew Davis, Global Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer at the Coca-Cola Company, kicked off the Summit, challenging companies to address today’s social issues head on and unlock the power of people. “By saying nothing, that’s a message,” said Davis. “Companies must make a stand. This is the new normal. Employees are no longer checking their conscience at the door.” Davis also discussed leveraging business resource groups and diversity and inclusion initiatives to drive company growth and continued success. Representatives from Campbell Soup Company shared how they engage employees through purpose-inspired communications, leveraging storytelling and internal platforms like Workplace by Facebook, Instagram takeovers, and employee crowdsourcing campaigns to explore new ideas and ensure authenticity and two-way communication. The results? A more than 234% increase in employee comments and 121% increase in views on their internal platform alone, reported Megan Maltenfort, Senior Manager, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Jackie Lagratta, Integrated Digital Marketing Manager, Campbell Soup Company. Many companies discussed the move to focus on tangible impact versus numbers. “It’s about lifelong learning and supporting the passions of our people. It’s not about the number of hours your employees volunteer anymore,” said Jennifer Flynn, Executive Director of Citizenship at KPMG LLP. “It’s about the impact you can have.” Michael Bzdak, Global Director of Employee Engagement in the Office of Global Community Impact at Johnson & Johnson, shared the importance of “collaborative glue” in partnerships to monitor, measure, and sustain progress. “The next time a team leader says they want to tack a three-hour skills-based project to an upcoming meeting, don’t burden a nonprofit if it won’t help them,” said Bzdak. “Instead, task that employee group with ideation and problem solving for your own CSR initiatives.” Attendees broke into workshops to delve deeper into connecting social issues and employee engagement with brand, led by Best Buy, as well as a panel on how to engage harder-to-reach employees through skilled-based volunteerism, hosted by Common Impact, John Hancock Financial, JPMorgan Chase, Marriott International, and Wells Fargo. “Through volunteering, companies have the opportunity to develop employee skills and acquire talent by serving communities where they do business,” said Jerome Tennille, Manager of Volunteerism at Marriott International. Matthew Nelson, CVP Corporate Responsibility, New York Life Insurance Company, served as Summit emcee. He joined Tiffany Calderon, Senior Manager, Community Relations, Best Buy; Michael Carren, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility, The Guardian Life Insurance Company; Heather Lofkin Wright, Director, Responsible Business Leadership, PwC US; Katherine Friesz, Executive Director, Winnebago Foundation and Corporate Responsibility, Winnebago Industries; and Peter Dudley, Corporate Social Responsibility Executive, most recently with Wells Fargo, as faculty for the preconference peer-learning workshop.

The data also revealed that the volume reported in Q4 2017 was the highest in the last seven years. The latest ONS data highlighted that the average house price in Northern Ireland increased by 4.2% in the year to Q1 2018. With house prices and construction output looking favourable, Development Finance Today asked a number of industry professionals whether we could expect to see more developers step into the Northern Irish market. Roxana Mohammadian-Molina, BDM at Blend Network, expected that there would be more developers looking at the Northern Irish market once the Brexit dust settles. “Despite the strength of the Northern Irish housing market, Brexit and its consequences for Northern Ireland still remain a key unknown (and therefore concern) for many developers and lenders. “We believe that once we gain more clarity around [what] the future NI will look like within the UK, developers (and lenders) will become more comfortable. “However, in our opinion, notwithstanding the likelihood of a special status for Northern Ireland after Brexit, shortage of housing supply in Northern Ireland remains a key worry.” Michael Gordon, director and head of planning for Northern Ireland at Turley, claimed that interest from UK and institutional investors in Northern Ireland had increased over the past three years – driven by a number of factors. “First, Northern Ireland’s land values have remained relatively low post-recession; while operator rents for commercial property have become more viable. “The council has been proactive in re-positioning Belfast externally with a return to MIPIM, and restructuring internally by appointing a new strategic director of place and economy, bringing together economic development and planning.” Michael also stated that Invest NI had been successful at leveraging foreign direct investment. Stephen Burns at Adapt Finance, said: ""I think the area is ‘specialist’, or a better term would be a little ‘unknown’. ""We have never dealt with a case over there, so I would say we are not fair to comment. ""Lenders will follow others, but only when cases have been repaid, so there is a future, but it won’t be quick."" Mark Dyason, managing director at Thistle Finance, claimed that capital was increasingly shifting away from Greater London, and Northern Ireland – like many English regions and Scottish hubs – was starting to benefit from this. “There’s a search for value and Northern Ireland is ticking ever more boxes on that front.” Mark explained that the property market in Northern Ireland was showing signs of stabilisation and steady growth. “Average prices are still well below what they are in England, Scotland and Wales, but many developers are increasingly seeing that as a positive rather than a negative.""

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Andrew Davis(Photo: Anne Emmanuelle - Thion) CivicCon has taught us that people have no reason or desire to go to some cookie-cutter city that looks the same as everyplace else. And we also already know that Pensacola has many unique charms that set us apart from anywhere else. We have the Blue Angels. We have the sparkling white sands of Pensacola Beach. We were the oldest multi-year European settlement in the U.S. We have many amazing stories to tell, but we don't always know the most effective ways to tell them. That's why Andrew Davis will be here Monday to help. Davis — a keynote speaker renowned across the country for his electric, energetic speaking style — has crafted documentary films and award-winning content for everything from tiny start-ups to Fortune 500 brands. He built and sold a thriving digital marketing agency, and before that he produced for NBC’s Today Show, worked for The Muppets in New York and wrote for Charles Kuralt. He's appeared in the New York Times, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, and on NBC and the BBC. Davis has also toured the U.S. noting the difference between towns that are booming and towns that have gone bust. In his experience, the towns that are succeeding are the towns that have targeted a niche and told stories that inspire people into action. More: What is CivicCon? From 6-7:30 p.m. Monday at the REX Theatre, 18 N. Palafox St., Davis will discuss how relatively unknown towns have filled their neighborhoods, hotels, restaurants and bars by marketing the place they do business just as much as — if not more than — the business they do. Davis will discuss “the laws of attraction,” and why efforts to attract everyone will inspire no one. And most importantly, he’ll teach attendees how to stake a claim and make their town synonymous with an industry, lifestyle or product. The presentation is part of CivicCon, a partnership between the News Journal and the Studer Community Institute aimed at starting conversations on how Pensacola can be a better place to live, grow, work and invest. Following Davis' presentation will be a question and answer session. Send your questions to potentially be included to lnelless@gannett.com. Online registration for Davis’ free presentation are filling up quickly, but the event will be streamed live on the News Journal’s Facebook page, facebook.com/pnjnews. The presentation will also be archived at pnj.com/civiccon, along with stories, podcasts, videos and other information about past and upcoming speakers.

Michael,Gordon,1221,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/inflation-tipped-be-sluggish,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. New Zealand's inflation should be at 2%, the mid-point of the Reserve Bank's 1% to 3% range but it is not likely to have reached that point in the three months ended June, according to forecasts from economists. In fact, economists have given a wider range of forecasts than normal, ranging from up 0.1% in the June quarter to 1.2% annually from ANZ, to up 0.6% to 1.7% in the same periods from Westpac. The Reserve Bank is forecasting inflation to be 1.5% at the end of June. Statistics New Zealand will release the consumer price index, the official measure of inflation, tomorrow. ANZ economist Miles Workman said the risk domestic inflation remained sluggish for longer was increasing. The Reserve Bank would remain cautious until there was more certainty inflation was increasing in a broad-based, sustainable way. The small quarterly rise reflected a mix of higher fuel prices plus some of the usual ups and downs in other categories, he said. A 3.5% quarterly rise in petrol prices was expected to make the largest contribution to quarterly headline inflation, followed by a seasonal rebound in international airfares. Higher airfares were exacerbated by higher fuel costs. A seasonal rise in fruit and vegetable prices would also contribute. As had been the case for some time, the housing group was expected to remain at the fore. Both rents and the purchase of housing were expected to rise, Mr Workman said. Quarterly rent inflation was likely to decelerate following the student-induced bustle of the March quarter. ""Stepping aside, we're starting to question how long housing-related inflation will last. After running hot for so long, anecdotes are beginning to suggest building cost inflation may be starting to decelerate. ""And given inflation outside of housing has been generally subdued, we wonder how much softer the overall picture will become if inflationary pressures fail to broaden."" Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said his forecast was higher than the Reserve Bank expected. The difference was forecasts on the tradables side of the consumer price index, some of which would reflect the jump in fuel prices late in the quarter. Fuel prices had played a major role in the gyrations of inflation in recent years and their influence was likely to linger for longer. Given the rise in oil prices to date, plus the planned rises in fuel taxes, Westpac expected annual inflation to reach 2.1% by the end of this year - above the Reserve Bank's 2% mid-point for only the second time in seven years. ""For this to be sustained into next year, we would need to see a further surge in world oil prices and/or a continued slide in the exchange rate."" Home-grown inflation pressures were increasing but tended to be gradual. It was still some way from the levels consistent with 2% inflation overall, Mr Gordon said.

Sara,Burns,1219,http://www.marshallindependent.com/news/local-news/2018/07/the-wilder-pageant-in-walnut-grove-was-back-with-a-special-flood-relief-night-for-area-residents/,"Jul 14, 2018 Photos by Deb Gau The Wilder Pageant Singers — Elizabeth Johnson, Sami Hotzler, Amy Hesse, Nathan Hesse and Kerry Knakmuhs — performed at the pageant’s opening night on Thursday. The pageant has added shows, including special Flood Relief Nights, to its performance schedule. WALNUT GROVE — Just the week before, the sets for the Wilder Pageant had been under three to 8 feet of water, after torrential rains flooded Plum Creek. And on opening night, thunderstorms brought more rain through the area, leaving wet spots backstage and on the road to the pageant site. But none of that could stop the performance, or keep audience members from attending. A few at a time, people were climbing the hillside at the pageant site, looking for the best spot to set up their lawn chairs. Wabasso residents Carrie Bliss and Sara Burns said they brought their families to the pageant after hearing about special admission prices Thursday night. Other audience members came to see family members perform. Don and Lori Johnson said their granddaughter was in the pageant. “It was opening night for her,” Lori Johnson said, so they decided to attend Thursday’s performance. The Laura Ingalls Wilder Pageant, “Fragments of a Dream,” kicked off its 41st annual production on Thursday with a special Flood Relief Night. Audience members in area communities affected by recent flooding could get general admission seats for a reduced price. “We thought, let’s give them a deal,” said pageant technical assistant Bill Richards. A second Flood Relief Night will be held July 19. It turned out the weather didn’t even let up for Thursday night’s performance. The pageant ended up being cut about 15 minutes short due to storms moving in. “We got through the first act, and we had a shorter second act,” Richards said. Although it was shortened, he said the second act kept important scenes in the pageant’s story, which focuses on Laura Ingalls Wilder’s childhood experiences in Walnut Grove. Flood Relief Night did bring out some area residents to see the pageant, pageant committee members Ron Kelsey and Dianne Raymond said. But there were a lot of people who had their tickets from last week’s cancelled performances instead, Raymond said. It’s rare for weather to stop the pageant — there have been only five rainouts in the event’s history, Richards said. But last week’s severe weather was much more than an ordinary rainstorm. Performances were cancelled, while volunteers gathered to help clean up after floodwaters receded from the pageant site. “On Friday, we had over 60 people here for four hours,” Richards said. Mud was washed away from sets with power washers. Lights and electrical systems that crew members removed when the flooding started were put back in place. There were some buildings at the site, as well as costumes and generators, that were damaged by floodwater, Richards said. Flood damage and lost revenue from the cancelled performances last weekend could add up to around $30,000 or more, he said. The Wilder Pageant has added performances, with Thursday shows on July 12 and 19. Cast members usually had Thursday rehearsals, so it was easier to add Thursday performances, Richards said. It also seemed like a good time to show support for area communities, with Flood Relief Night. “We’re more looking, on a Thursday, for it to be a local crowd,” he said. In some ways, southwestern Minnesotans today are going through similar experiences to the settlers of the Ingalls’ time, Richards said. Their families coped with natural disasters, like people are dealing with flooding now. “I think it can be a healing thing, when you see how people people got through it,” he said. The weather for today’s pageant performance is looking brighter. The National Weather Service in Sioux Falls is forecasting mostly sunny conditions Saturday and Sunday, with high temperatures in the 80s. A 20 percent chance of rain and thunderstorms is forecast on Sunday afternoon, and there could be more chances for showers and storms starting Tuesday night.

""In moments of crisis, the best communities find a way to come together,"" Neeli Bendapudi, president of the university, said in a statement. ""Over the last 24 hours our community has been fractured by the comments made by former UofL trustee John Schnatter."" Schnatter entered into a multimillion dollar agreement with the university back in 1996 to assist in constructing and equipping its football stadium. The naming rights were a $5 million arrangement — a $4 million contribution from Schnatter and a $1 million sponsorship from Papa John's, according to a report by the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting. However, KCIR said, as of May 2017, he had personally spent $12.5 million for 42 years of name recognition, or about $300,000 a year. According to the agreement, Schnatter could donate either cash or shares of publicly traded companies and change the name of the stadium at any point as long as he covered the costs of changing the logos and signage. Papa John's is also named as the exclusive pizza provider at the stadium and during university events. The incident during the May conference call came to light after Forbes magazine detailed it in an article Wednesday. Schnatter later confirmed he was on a call with marketing agency Laundry Service when he tried to downplay comments he had made about the National Football League last fall. He said, “Colonel Sanders called blacks n-----s"" and never faced any public backlash at KFC. In the wake of this report, Schnatter resigned as chairman from Papa John's board and stepped down from the University of Louisville board of trustees. His name name was also removed from a signpost of a gymnasium in his hometown of Jeffersonville, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal. Schnatter, who owns a 24 percent stake in Papa John's, remains on the company's board. Late Friday, Papa John's CEO Steve Ritchie issued a statement about the steps the company is taking to regain customer trust. These steps include an outside audit of its business to gauge its diversity efforts and removing Schnatter's image from its marketing. ""Papa John’s is not an individual,"" Ritchie said. ""Papa John’s is a pizza company with 120,000 corporate and franchise team members around the world. Papa John's has suffered backlash after Schnatter's comment became public. Major League Baseball indefinitely suspended its Papa Slam promotion — a campaign that both sides have collaborated on since 2016. The Miami Marlins, New York Yankees, New York Rangers, Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United have all suspended their relationships with the brand. In addition, Olson Engage, the public relations agency that was hired by the company in February, dropped them as a client. ""While Schnatter’s resignation as chairman of the board was a first step forward, Papa John’s needs to do more to show that that its corporate values are not aligned with its founder’s behavior,"" Michael Gordon, chief executive of Group Gordon, a strategic communications firm, told CNBC via email. ""With Schnatter remaining on the board, he also will remain a liability for Papa John’s. It doesn’t matter how much of a stake Schnatter has in the company or that the company is named after him – he needs to be extricated from the brand for Papa John’s to truly move on from this and other ugly episodes."" Papa John's shares closed Friday at $53.55, recouping the losses it logged Wednesday, and then some. In the aftermath of the report, the stock hit a 52-week low of $47.80, but is now up about 4 percent for the week as a whole. ""This reaction and backlash shows that customers play a much larger role than ever before, and people are only going to continue to cite how they feel publicly and become vocal about it,"" said Nat Sutton, a partner and head of Buffkin/Baker, an executive recruiting agency. ""This reaction shows that the community will come together and that this has more power than a large corporation."" Christopher Gilbert, a business ethics consultant at NobleEdge Consulting, told CNBC he doesn't expect this event to be ""a brand or business killer."" ""The Papa John brand image is strong,"" Gilbert said. Playing Share this video... Watch Next... Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Jamie,Forese,1217,https://www.exchange.co.tz/citi-harvests-bountifully-at-the-euromoney-global-awards-for-excellence/,"Citi has won several awards at the Euromoney Global Awards for Excellence. [Photo/VideoBlocks] Citi has been recognised as the World’s Best Investment Bank at the Euromoney Global Awards for Excellence. In the event held in London on July 11, the bank which boasts of approximately 200 million customer accounts and doing business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions, was also named the World’s Best Bank for Financing and the World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility. During the Euromoney Global Awards for Excellence, Euromoney noted that: “The rationale behind Citi’s nomination as the world’s best investment bank this year is simple but impressive. In every part of the world that Euromoney considered the credentials of the leading regional investment banks, Citi was a genuine contender.” “These arguments speak to two incontrovertible facts about Citi’s Institutional Clients Group (ICG) today: no other firm comes close to the scale and breadth of Citi’s wholesale banking operations, and Citi hasn’t just built and maintained a global network, it has built one that works and is increasingly valued by its clients, who view Citi as a true partner to their own global businesses. Competitors are now catching on that Citi has something they don’t. Clients realised this a lot earlier.” Citi was also recognised across a number of regional categories including: Best Investment Bank in Central and Eastern Europe, Spain, Middle East and Chile, Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility in North America, Best bank for Financing in Africa and Latin America, Best bank for Advisory in Western Europe, Best Bank for Sustainable Finance in Latin America and Best Bank for Transaction Services in Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. Citi President and Head of Institutional Clients Group Jamie Forese said that Citi has had a tremendous 12 months, delivering their commitments by leveraging the synergies of their ICG platform. “We continue to see evidence in our results that our major advantage when serving large, sophisticated clients is our global network — one that cannot be replicated by our competition. Being recognised by Euromoney is a testament to our capabilities,” he added. On being named World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, Ed Skyler, Citi’s Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chair of the Citi Foundation said: “The societal issues impacting our communities today require a different level of engagement from companies. It’s no longer about being a good corporate citizen. We must use our business, our philanthropy and our voice to stand for issues that matter most.” The Euromoney Global Awards for Excellence are recognised as the most prestigious in the financial services industry. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.

Andrew,Davis,1216,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44805745,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The 2018 Proms kick off on Friday, launching a season that includes a tango Prom, a Hungarian Gypsy Prom and a lot of Leonard Bernstein, whose centenary is being marked. The first night will commemorate the end of the First World War, with two works composed as a response to the conflict: Holst's much-loved The Planets and Vaughan Williams's choral masterpiece Toward the Unknown Region. There'll also be a new work by Anna Meredith, which draws on telegrams sent by young soldiers on the front line in 1918. After that, there are 74 more concerts to go before the famous Last Night on 8 September, which will see conductor Andrew Davis pick up the baton for his 130th Prom. Here are five of the highlights. Prom 32: Inside Shostakovich - Monday, 6 August The Aurora Orchestra have become a regular highlight of the Proms, their unconventional approach (they play standing up!) making audiences sit up and pay attention. That's not their only USP - as the small, but closely-knit ensemble commit to playing all of their pieces from memory. It sounds like a gimmick, but it somehow makes their performances more intimate and engaging. This year, they're tackling Shostakovich's 9th Symphony - not an easy piece even if you have the score in front of you. Before their performance, Radio 3's Tom Service and conductor Nicholas Collon will walk the audience through the piece, deconstructing its ""fleet-footed melodies and dance-filled rhythms"", and drawing the audience even deeper into the music. Prom 13: Pioneers of Sound - Monday, 23 July Sixty years ago, the most celebrated electronic music studio in the world was established at the BBC. The Radiophonic Workshop went on to produce some of the most ground-breaking sound effects and electronic music in the business - not to mention the thrilling whoosh of the Doctor Who theme. Their work will be celebrated at the Pioneers of Sound Prom on 23 July, which culminates with a performance of Daphne Oram's visionary, dreamy Still Point. Written in 1949, when Oram was just 23, it is thought to be the first work to combine an orchestra with turntables. Oram, who went on to found the Radiophonic Workshop, submitted it as a BBC entry for the Italia Prize, only to have it rejected by management, who dismissed it as weird and impenetrable. The work went unheard until 2016, when it was resurrected by The London Contemporary Orchestra, who now bring it to the Proms. They'll also play The Delian Mode - a spooky piece of incidental music that Doctor Who arranger Delia Derbyshire composed for a 1969 episode of The Sky At Night. More about the 2018 Proms Prom 29/30: The Brandenburg Project - Sunday, 5 August. On 5 August, the Swedish Chamber Orchestra will play Bach's six Brandenburg Concertos - which is reason enough for fans of Baroque to make the journey to the Royal Albert Hall. But in a fascinating experiment, each of the concertos will be paired with a newly-commissioned companion piece. It's a massive undertaking, spread across two concerts in a single day - and there are bound to be a few surprises along the way. The composers include Steven Mackey, whose previous works include an electric guitar; and Olga Neuwirth, whose use of laptops, turntables, and electronics have made her one of the most consistently surprising musicians of her generation. End of Youtube post by Royal Albert Hall Prom 59: Relaxed Prom - Monday, 27 August Attending the Proms can be a tough experience for young people and adults with autism, learning difficulties or sensory impairments - which is why the Relaxed Prom exists. The concert offers an informal and welcoming environment - with chill-out spaces outside the auditorium for anyone overwhelmed by the experience. There'll also be sign language interpreters and video screens showing picture symbols about the concert. Best of all, the music - from the The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra - is a world-class selection of pieces by Tchaikovsky, Holst and Bernstein. If you're thinking of attending, there are flash cards and videos on the BBC Proms website to help young people familiarise themselves with the event. Schoolchildren may also enjoy the Ten Pieces Prom on 29 July. Prom 3: BBC Young Musician - Sunday, 15 July Nineteen-year-old cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason has had a crazy year - with his debut album going to number one, and a starring role at the Royal Wedding. He made his Proms debut last year; and returns to the Royal Albert Hall this weekend to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the BBC Young Musician competition, which he won in 2016. The teenage prodigy will be joined on stage by Young Musician finalists from the last four decades, including Nicola Benedetti, Jess Gillam and Jennifer Pike - who was just 12 when she won the competition in 2002. There'll also be a chance to catch this year's winner, pianist Lauren Zhang, whose recital of Prokofiev's challenging Piano Concerto No 2 left judges ""breathless"". There are more than 90 concerts over the next eight weeks and they're all broadcast on BBC Radio 3 with many on BBC TV. You can also see Katie Derham presenting Proms Extra on BBC Two each Saturday.

Andrew,Davis,1216,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/die-hard-30-10-best-action-films-followed-classic-template-130001555.html,"Die Hard is an undisputed action classic, and proof of its enduring greatness is that, in the 30 years since its theatrical debut (July 15, 1988), it’s spawned a legion of imitators that could easily be summarized as “Die Hard on a…” Putting a novel spin on that movie’s trademark formula — a lone hero battling terrorists while trapped in a confined setting — those knock-offs confirm that John McTiernan’s Bruce Willis vehicle has a premise for the ages. And that fact will again be corroborated this Friday, when Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson plays a security guard (with one leg!) who has to brave a towering inferno to save his family from some bad guys in Skyscraper. Thus, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of this timeless tale, as well as the impending premiere of Johnson’s one-against-many high-rise adventure, we present the 10 (well technically 11, but who’s counting) finest films to take their cue from Die Hard. Watch the Skyscraper trailer: It’s Die Hard … on a battleship, as Steven Seagal’s cook (who’s also an ex-Navy SEAL!) fights back against a group of terrorists led by Tommy Lee Jones’s former CIA agent, who plans to steal the craft’s missiles. Seagal is at his cocky-beyond-belief best as a martial-arts badass, Jones is hilarious as an over-the-top villain, and director Andrew Davis (a year before helming the even better The Fugitive) gives the material the muscular energy it demands, even as he rips off some of his spiritual ancestor’s most famous imagery (e.g. Seagal leaping off an exploding structure while tied to a rope). It’s Die Hard … on a plane, as Wesley Snipes’s former Secret Service agent finds himself back in crime-fighting action when his flight is commandeered by a crazed terrorist (Bruce Payne) trying to escape federal custody. As with so many of Die Hard’s progeny, Snipes’s hero must overcome a past trauma throughout the course of his ordeal, although the best thing about director Kevin Hooks’s 1992 effort is Snipes himself, who’s preternaturally cool in one of his signature roles, thanks in part to his unforgettable one-liner: “Always bet on black.” It’s Die Hard … in a sports arena, as Jean-Claude Van Damme’s fire marshal is thrust into heroic duty when he discovers that the venue at which he works has been rigged to explode by an ex-CIA agent (Powers Boothe) during Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, which is being attended by the vice president. Van Damme punches people in the face, pretends to be the Pittsburgh Penguins goalie, scales the arena roof, and ultimately causes Boothe’s helicopter to crash onto the ice — all in a day’s work for the Muscles From Brussels. It’s Die Hard … on a bus, as Keanu Reeves’s LAPD officer hops aboard a city vehicle (filled with passengers, including Sandra Bullock) that’s been armed with a bomb set to explode if the bus’ speed drops below 50 mph. Reeves’s studly turn, Dennis Hopper’s mad bomber, and excellent direction from Jan de Bont made this outrageous 1994 film a hit, as did some thrillingly cartoonish moments, such as the bus leaping over a giant gap in an unfinished section of the L.A. freeway. It’s Die Hard … at the White House, as both of these 2013 films feature a scenario in which the president’s residence is attacked by terrorists, and a single-minded badass must come to the commander in chief’s rescue. Audiences preferred Gerard Butler’s revered Secret Service agent to Channing Tatum’s wannabe Secret Service agent, as evidenced by 2016’s sequel London Has Fallen. However, when it comes to paying homage to Die Hard, the latter has the former beat, if only because Tatum spends so much of White House Down taking out adversaries while wearing a Bruce Willis-style white undershirt. It’s Die Hard … in the mountains, as Sylvester Stallone’s expert climber is forced to deal with a group of terrorists (led by John Lithgow’s ex-military agent) who are searching for three cases of U.S. Treasury money that they stole, but then lost when their plane went down. Lithgow spends the majority of the snowbound film hamming it up with a British accent, which only further amplifies the deliriousness of director Renny Harlin’s 1993 hit, which remains one of Stallone’s most underrated adventures. It’s Die Hard … aboard a plane again! But this time, that plane is Air Force One, as Harrison Ford’s no-nonsense commander in chief gives a speech about not backing down to terrorists, and then puts his money where his mouth is after his aircraft is hijacked by Gary Oldman’s stark-raving-mad Russian. Nobody does noble toughness better than Ford, which helps make Wolfgang Peterson’s 1997 film — about a principled president who risks his own life to stop a Russian adversary from gaining the upper hand over America — a fantasy that only gets more timely with each passing day. It’s Die Hard … at an all-boys boarding school, as Sean Astin’s student combats a group of terrorists who storm the establishment looking for a particular kid (whose dad is presiding over the trial of a drug kingpin) and, upon failing to find him, take the rest of the residents hostage. Because Astin’s do-gooder is aided in his anti-insurgency quest by his best friends, he doesn’t quite fit the Bruce Willis/John McClane mold. Nonetheless, Toy Soldiers is, in most respects, a better-than-you’d-expect teen variation on Die Hard. It’s Die Hard … on a plane, yet again, except this time the aircraft has a horde of snakes been set loose at 30,000 feet by a crime boss to kill a man planning to testify against him in court. It’s a plot fit for a ludicrous B-movie, which is just what director David R. Ellis delivers with this internet-hyped feature starring Samuel L. Jackson, who plays off his tough-guy persona as an FBI agent compelled to contend with this slithering onslaught — and who gets to give one of the dumbest, and funniest, lines in action-cinema history. It’s Die Hard … but harder, and at an airport, as Bruce Willis reprises his role as John McClane for Renny Harlin’s 1990 sequel. Set exactly one year after its predecessor, McClane finds himself up against a new Christmas Eve threat at Washington Dulles International Airport. The place has been overrun with terrorists who plan to crash incoming planes until their demands are met — a big problem for McClane, given that his wife’s flight is circling overhead. Bigger and busier in every respect, it’s an outlandish follow-up that proves that no one does Die Hard (or Die Hard knockoffs) quite like Willis himself.

The work that the Legion has done has helped build communities and support veterans across the state, said Ensley Brown, 74, of Milwaukee. Brown served in the U.S. Army for 20 years and has been a Legionnaire in the state's 5th District for over a decade. ""Its a significant achievement,"" said Brown, who is a past department vice commander. The event also marked the centennial of the American Legion's founding in Wisconsin and the founding of the The American Legion Cook-Fuller Post 70 of Oshkosh.

Francis A. Mathe, 75, has been the commander of the Oshkosh post for two years. Before that, he was Oshkosh's sergeant at arms for seven years. Mathe served in the U.S. Army from 1961 to 1964, including 20 months in Germany. He said being a part of the American Legion for 13 years and being at the convention to celebrate the legion's 100th birthday is ""an extreme honor."" Oshkosh's post moves into a new building, 1332 Spruce St., Saturday with a ribbon-cutting and celebration from 3 to 6 p.m. The event is open to the public. Mathe said the new post is a historic moment for the group and will show the Legion's history in Oshkosh, including one of the founding member's original uniforms on display. ""It means a real step forward for us and a real achievement,"" Mathe said.

Brewer has been in the Legion for six years, though Oshkosh's was her first summer convention. She served in the Marine Corps from 1987 to 1991 as a field radio operator. She said the convention has been educational and inspirational, especially seeing the organization's efforts to better support female veterans. She said she's trying on her own end to get the women veterans she knows to see the benefit in joining the cause. ""I'm here to learn more of what I can do to help them help veterans like myself,"" Brewer said. Members of each of the state's 12 American Legion districts heard from speakers including Gov. Scott Walker, who presented a $100,000 grant to the group, Wisconsin National Guard Commander Maj. Gen. Donald Dunbar, Oshkosh Mayor Steve Cummings and Wisconsin Veterans Affairs Secretary Dan Zimmerman.

Steve,Cummings,1215,http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/5018/peloton-drafting-even-more-efficient-than-we-first-thought-new-study-finds,"Sign up for our newsletter Secondary menu Sections New research that cycling in a peloton is far more efficient than first thought, with aerodynamic drag at the back dropping to as little as 5% that being experienced at the front. In a study titled Aerodynamic drag in cycling pelotons: New insights by CFD simulation and wind tunnel testing, researchers at the Eindhoven University of Technology ran wind-tunnel tests on a 3D-printed mini-peloton of 121 terracotta cyclists based on input and feedback from WorldTour riders to establish the most energy-efficient area of the peloton. The analysis came to the conclusion that drag in the mid-rear of the peloton is only 5 per cent what a solo rider will experience riding at the same speed. This is considerably lower than previous research, which had the figure at around 70 per cent. The Dutch university's Professor Bert Blocken, who led the research, worked with professional riders from LottoNL-Jumbo and BMC Racing as well as a wind-tunnel filled with 121 3D-printed terracotta cyclists to gather data, which was then put through supercomputers using ANSYS fluid flow software to establish the most energy-efficient area of a peloton. Unsurprisingly, the data showed that the mid-rear of a peloton was the most efficient section, with the level of effort required steadily increasing the closer to the front you get. The least efficient part of the peloton, as would be expected, was the very nose with drag reaching 86 per cent of what a solo rider will experience. Blocken suggested that the misinformation surrounding previous testing was down to the method of testing used. 'Some teams use mathematical cycling models to calculate when exactly a rider should escape to stay out of the grasp of the chasing peloton,' wrote Blocken. 'These models assume that the riders inside the peloton have a resistance of 50 to 70 percent that of an isolated rider. 'These values result from old tests on small groups of up to four in-line drafting cyclists that showed reductions for the third and the fourth cyclist, both up to 50 percent. This has led researchers to believe that also inside a peloton, this 50 percent would apply.' Blocken then stated that their groundbreaking testing method showed that drag reduced to as little as 5 per cent for isolated riders at the same speed. Blocken has since spoken out at complaints from pro riders that this data suggests amateurs could comfortably sit in the wheel of a pro. Blocken reminded us that this data only applies to a perfect peloton that is riding on a straight and flat road with no external factors such a wind. What Blocken's findings do however, is increase our appreciation for solo breakaway artists such as Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal) or Steve Cummings (Dimension Data), who have made a habit throughout their careers of going on long solo breaks resulting in impressive stage victories at the world's best races.

Michael,Gordon,1213,http://kpic.com/news/local/at-work-or-play-take-steps-to-stay-safe-under-the-sun,"by Gabby Urenda Officials say to stay hydrated when working--or playing--in hot weather. (SBG) ROSEBURG, Ore. -- With the sun blazing, workers with Noble Roofing and Construction in Douglas County are hard at it in some very hot temperatures. Company owner Michael Gordon says he takes steps to make sure his guys are safe with tips anyone can use. ""Hydrate well, sunblock, maintain decent break times and everything,"" Gordon says, ""so if they get a little bit too hot up there, it would require them to get off the roof; get them in a little bit of shade and stuff like that."" Roseburg Fire Department Chief Gary Garrisi says to wear loose clothing and drink plenty of water on hot days because prevention is key. ""If you're staying hydrated, you're limiting your exposure at the heat of the day,"" the chief says, ""Make sure if you're not feeling well, that you stop what you're doing and make sure you cool down."" But Garrisi says cooling off by the river may not be the best choice. ""River temperature is 50-to-60-degree water so you want to be very careful to not get too much time in the river and watch out for hypothermia and that kind of thing."" And in or out of the water, heat exhaustion is something to keep in mind. Signs include muscle cramps and excessive sweating. That's why Gordon has his workers use the buddy system. ""They all look out for each other."" says Gordon, ""so if one guy starts to seem a little confused or dazed or anything like that, they make sure they get off the roof."" No matter how hot it gets, those extra steps can help keep you cool and safe this summer.

Michael,Gordon,1213,https://www.businessnewsaus.com.au/articles/blue-sky-bounces-back-in-june.html,"Written on the 13 July 2018 by David Simmons What started off as a rough second half has ended on a positive note for embattled investment fund Blue Sky. The group's Alternatives Access Fund (ASX: BAF) saw an increase in net tangible assets (NTA) per share for June 2018. The Alternatives Fund reported a pre-tax NTA increase to $1.14 per share in June; a gain of 0.7 per cent. Whilst slight, this increase can only be seen as a good thing for Blue Sky, which has been suffering over the past few months. The company attributes the slight increase to a 3 per cent positive return for the Blue Sky Water Fund for the month. The company's latest report completes its independent review of the carrying value of all funds within the Alternatives Fund's portfolio other than the Cove Property Group 441 Ninth Avenue Trust and investments which are exiting or contracted for sale. Blue Sky reports that The Alternatives Fund finished FY18 with a total post tax NTA of $235.3 million, including a cash position of $31.6 million. The investments firm has suffered from a string of bad news following the release of a controversial report from a US short seller in March. The Glaucus Research report claimed Blue Sky ""wildly exaggerated"" its fee earning assets under management (FEAUM) and that its share price was worth just $2.56. When the report was released BLA shares were trading at around the $11.50 mark, off an all-time high of $14.99, and since then they have slumped to $1.50. In mid-June the company exited a trading halt which saw Blue Sky shares spiral. Blue Sky's foreshadowed $60 million hit to annual net profits is expected to stem from its exit from a number of property managements rights businesses and regional real estate development projects. The group says it will continue to focus on private equity, private real estate and real assets, but will exit from a number of key business areas. Following the review, Blue Sky still has $3.4 billion of fee-earning assets under management and expects to save $3.8 million through cost reduction initiatives. The company forecasts net cash at 30 June to be $32.3 million. The fallout from the Glaucus report led to two board purges and the resignations of managing director Robert Shand, followed by chairman John Kain, along with board members Elaine Stead and Nicholas Dignam. Veteran board member Michael Gordon resigned for health reasons. Shares in Blue Sky are up 5.36 per cent to $1.48 per share at 10.10am AEST. Shares in The Access Fund are up 4.64 per cent to $0.79 per share at 10.11am AEST. Never miss a news update, subscribe here. Follow us on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter.

Michael,Gordon,1210,https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/technology/uber-london-europe/index.html,"With its London license at risk, Uber convinced a judge last month that it had embarked on a corporate overhaul that will change how it operates in the lucrative market. Criticized in the past for its pugnacious approach to business, Uber has now introduced free insurance for drivers in London and limited their operating hours. It opened a 24/7 customer helpline and promised to start reporting serious incidents to the police. The changes, which were bolstered by a major public relations campaign and an apology from CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, earned Uber a 15-month extension of its license. But there are major limitations to the approach that Uber used in London. The reforms will hike Uber's costs at a time when the regulatory and legal environment in Europe is only becoming more difficult for the company. ""They will have to slow down ... and adapt to a business model that is far more in line with being a traditional transport and taxi company,"" said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy in Brussels. Erixon said that clashes with regulators are likely to continue after the European Union's top court ruled last year that Uber should be regulated as a transportation provider. Uber had sought to avoid tougher rules by arguing that it is a tech platform that connects passengers and drivers. ""Even those countries that have taken a sympathetic approach to Uber will now be forced to put them into a national license routine for taxi services,"" said Erixon. Power shift André Spicer, a professor of organizational behavior at Cass Business School in London, said that London's ability to extract concessions from Uber would embolden regulators elsewhere in Europe. ""[It] signifies the change of the power balance between Uber and the regulators [who] will recognize they can gain more power and potentially win against Uber, whereas they often thought that wasn't the case,"" said Spicer. Related: Uber HR chief steps down after discrimination probe Uber has clashed with local officials in countries including Denmark, France, Spain and Germany. Authorities have taken the company to task for not having licenses to operate a taxi service, and they have questioned the way it treats drivers. It left Barcelona and Madrid in 2014 after protests by local drivers and transport companies. Reduced service Barcelona presents a cautionary tale: Uber returned to the tourist hotspot earlier this year, but as a slimmed-down service that connects riders with professional licensed drivers. Casual drivers can't use the app. The added cost of complying with regulations could spell trouble for Uber, which has sold itself to investors on its ability to quickly move into new markets and drive established companies out of business. ""Venture capital has been subsidizing every single Uber ride across the world on the promise of growth and when that funding begins to dry up, prices will inevitably go up,"" Spicer said. ""The hope was that by then they would have driven everyone else out of business ... now it looks like that is not going to be the case,"" he added. Uber could replicate its London strategy elsewhere in Europe, but it may not be worth it. ""London is one of the most significant markets, so Uber have pulled out all the stops to regain their license,"" said Alex Janes, a senior lecturer in strategy at the University of Exeter. ""In some other markets the firm may decide to quit or withdraw in the face of tougher regulation because it doesn't anticipate sufficient returns."" Related: Uber targets millions of new users with lite app A spokesperson for Uber said many of the changes made in London have been rolled out across Europe. ""We are taking a more constructive approach to partnering with cities across Europe,"" the spokesperson said. The company's global reach has already been scaled back. After years spent bulldozing its way into markets far from its home in Silicon Valley, Uber has sold its operations in China and Southeast Asia. But it is still fighting for another key market, India. The retrenchment has made European markets, including London, even more vital. ""What London and other cities will need to see is consistency from Uber as a good corporate citizen in their communities,"" said Michael Gordon, the chief executive of Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis communications firm.

Michael,Gordon,1210,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/islands/1518337/archaeologists-may-have-to-oversee-iona-shop-demolition-as-building-work-could-unearth-remains/,"©2018 Press and Journal The demolition of a shop on the isle of Iona could be supervised by archaeologists so that any human remains uncovered in the historic conservation area can be avoided or excavated. Michael Gordon, the owner of the Iona Craft Shop, has applied to Argyll and Bute Council for permission to knock the aging shop and adjoining residential unit down. He is seeking planning approval to build a new shop in its place, allowing the existing business to grow. The site is just north of the ferry terminal en route to the famous and iconic Iona Abbey. In a consultation response, West of Scotland Archaeology Service has told the council: “The application lies within an area of high archaeological sensitivity on the isle of Iona. “The site lies just to the south of the known high medieval period sites associated with the pre-reformation abbey complex and just east of an area where recent evaluation works by the National Trust for Scotland demonstrated the presence of buried prehistoric archaeology. “There is clearly potential here for there to be buried remains in this vicinity and any such features may be affected by the ground disturbance proposed in this application.” The service recommends that an archaeologist be hired to watch the works take place and deal with anything that may be found. The ground would be inspected for signs of buried archaeology. It added: “If buried remains are identified there may be a requirement for further stages of archaeological works.” Mr Gordon said of his plans: “We are just rebuilding what’s there. It will still be Iona Craft Shop, just bigger, better, warmer and drier. “The current building was built in the 1960s and it has had its day. Because we are committed to staying open all year, we need to build something more suitable for keeping us warm and dry through the winter. “If we do anything in Iona we have to an archaeology test done. It can be a bit of a hassle because we have to pay for that. Fingers crossed they won’t find anything too interesting. “We are a growing business and committed to being open all year round. We are trying to extend the season because people need an income all year round and we are committed to being open. “We have got a website and we will be working on web sales, particularly in winter. That will help us to stay open all year.” Iona, surrounded by its white sandy beaches and turquoise seas, is the cradle of Scottish Christianity. In AD563 St Columba and his followers arrived on its shores and today it is still a haven for spiritual retreats as well as a tourist destination. The island off Mull is the burial place of the early Scottish kings, including Macbeth. Today the 13th century Iona Abbey and Nunnery stands on the site of St Columba’s church. Four tall, intricately carved crosses, dating from the 8th and 9th centuries, once stood close to the abbey. Three can now be seen in the Abbey Museum, while one is still in place. Iona was a leading artistic centre from the 8th century, and sculptors, metalworkers and manuscript illuminators flourished there. © Aberdeen Journals Ltd 2018. All Rights Reserved.

Jamie,Forese,1208,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180712005041/en/Citi-Receives-Top-Honors-Euromoney-Global-Awards,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citi (NYSE: C) has been awarded World’s Best Investment Bank at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence, held in London on 11th July. The bank was also named World’s Best Bank for Financing and World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility. Commenting on Citi’s success, Euromoney noted that: “The rationale behind Citi’s nomination as the world’s best investment bank this year is simple, but impressive. In every part of the world that Euromoney considered the credentials of the leading regional investment banks, Citi was a genuine contender. These arguments speak to two incontrovertible facts about Citi’s Institutional Clients Group (ICG) today: no other firm comes close to the scale and breadth of Citi’s wholesale banking operations; and Citi hasn’t just built and maintained a global network, it has built one that works and is increasingly valued by its clients, who view Citi as a true partner to their own global businesses. Competitors are now catching on that Citi has something they don’t. Clients realized this a lot earlier.” Citi was also recognized across a number of regional categories including: Jamie Forese, President of Citi and Head of Citi's Institutional Clients Group commented: ""Citi has had a tremendous 12 months, delivering on our commitments by leveraging the synergies of our ICG platform. We continue to see evidence in our results that our major advantage when serving large, sophisticated clients is our global network -- one that cannot be replicated by our competition. Being recognized by Euromoney is a testament to our capabilities."" On being named World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, Ed Skyler, Citi’s Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chair of the Citi Foundation said: “The societal issues impacting our communities today require a different level of engagement from companies. It’s no longer about being a good corporate citizen. We must use our business, our philanthropy and our voice to stand for issues that matter most.” The Euromoney Awards for Excellence are recognized as the most prestigious in the financial services industry. About Citi: Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.

John,O'Neil,1206,https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/07/11/maine-man-who-killed-grandmother-with-golf-club-wrench-and-knife-seeks-to-have-sentence-reduced/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Derek Poulin's lawyer argues that his client was 23 at the time of the crime in Old Orchard Beach, and his brain was still developing. ALFRED — A convicted killer’s life sentence for the murder of his grandmother is too severe, his attorney said Tuesday, arguing that the crime wasn’t “the worst of the worst.” Derek Poulin, 29, is asking the court to reduce his life sentence for murder and a concurrent 30-year sentence for arson. When he was 23, Poulin murdered his 61-year-old grandmother, Patricia Noel, by beating her with a golf club and stabbing her about 70 times before setting fire to the Old Orchard Beach home she shared with Poulin and his father. An attempt to appeal the sentence in 2016 failed in the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Poulin, through his attorney Chris Nielsen, has asked the York County Superior Court to reconsider his sentence. Nielsen said the life sentence Poulin received was “cruel and unusual punishment,” as the court failed to consider Poulin’s young age and his mental health, as well as his lack of any prior criminal history. Poulin, with a shaved head and clad in an orange prison uniform, was in court Tuesday morning for an oral hearing with Justice John O’Neil, the judge who gave him a life sentence in 2015. The punishment for murder in Maine was 25 years to life, Nielsen said. He argued that a life sentence “should be reserved for the worst of the worst,” and while Poulin’s crime was egregious, it wasn’t the “worst of the worst.” Nielsen said that Poulin was only 23 at the time of the crime, and argued that the brain is still developing at that age. “I think the court may have heard that today’s 28 is yesterday’s 18,” Nielsen said. If Poulin was given a lesser sentence, the attorney said, he could leave prison and show that he had matured and become a better person. If the current sentence stands, “he will die in prison, your honor, he will never have that opportunity,” Nielsen said. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber pointed out the unfairness of Noel’s fate at the hands of Poulin as a counterpoint to Nielsen’s argument that Poulin’s sentence is unfair. If Poulin committed his crime in New Hampshire, he would have likely received the death penalty, Macomber said. “He was 23 at the time, he wasn’t 15, he wasn’t a juvenile,” said Macomber. “He was an adult in the eyes of the law.” Macomber noted that when Poulin tried to appeal the case in 2016, Poulin failed to claim the sentence was “cruel and unusual,” and therefore Poulin’s request should be dismissed. When he gave Poulin a life sentence in 2015, it was a very difficult decision that he struggled with, O’Neil said. He said that while Poulin was young and had no criminal record, the incident was brutal. The factor that weighed heavily in his decision was Poulin’s “absence of remorse,” O’Neil said. O’Neil will make a decision on Poulin’s request at a later date. Poulin’s aunt and Noel’s daughter, Darcy Daniels, were among family members at Tuesday’s hearing. Daniels said it was a very emotional experience listening to Nielsen’s attorney say that the crime wasn’t “the worst of the worst.” Daniels said she believes her nephew deserved the life sentence.

Andrew,Davis,1204,https://www.thesun.co.uk/uncategorized/6750422/sandition-itv-whos-in-the-cast-jane-austen-adaptation/,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. All we know so far about ITV's new epic period drama Jane Austen's unfinished and last novel Sanditon has just been commissioned into a lavish period epic. It's going to be a pretty big deal as it's being written by Andrew Davis, the man behind Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch and War & Peace - here's the what we know about it so far. The announcement was only made yesterday so there's no air date just yet. However it has been confirmed that filming will begin next spring. Head of ITV drama Polly Hill said: “It’s a rich, romantic, family saga built upon the foundations Jane Austen laid. “There is no one better to adapt her unfinished novel than Andrew, who has an incredible track record for bold and original adaptations."" There hasn't been any cast announcements yet. However big-time stars like Colin Firth and Kevin Spacey have starred in Davis' other epics like Pride and Prejudice, as well as House of Cards. Davis' works also often include a British-heavy cast. Austen wrote the first 11 chapters of Sanditon months before her death in 1817. It follows Charlotte Heywood, a spirited and impulsive woman who moves from her rural home to Sanditon, a sleepy fishing village attempting to reinvent itself as a seaside resort. Davis said: ""Heywood’s spiky relationship with the humorous, charming Sidney Parker is a key part of the story, which has a spirited young heroine, a couple of entrepreneurial brothers, some dodgy financial dealings, a West Indian heiress, and quite a bit of nude bathing.""

Andrew,Davis,1204,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Historic-town-hall-Trump-and-the-military/63455.html,"Dozens of retired U.S. military officers and former national security officials have joined states attorneys general, medical associations and leading civil-rights organizations in nine friend-of-the-court briefs urging the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to uphold the lower-court ruling in Karnoski v. Trump, and maintain the bar on implementation of the Trump administration's ban on transgender military service, a Lambda Legal press release stated. Some of the groups that have submitted briefs included The Trevor Project, The American Medical Association and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. More about the case is at https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/karnoski-v-trump. Under order from Donald Trump's Department of Defense ( DoD ), the U.S. Army has been discharging immigrant recruits and reservists who enlisted under a program initiated in 2008which can lead to a path to naturalized citizen status, LGBTQ Nation noted. DoD officials tell recruits that they pose ""security risks"" to the United States because they have family members abroad for whom the military cannot properly conduct background checks. President George W. Bush started the program, known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said he believes Jesus would approve of same-sex marriage, NewNowNext.com noted. Carter, who recently published the book Faith: A Journey For All, was asked by HuffPost Live's Marc Lamont Hill about his stance on the issue. ""That's no problem with me,"" he said. ""I think everyone should have a right to get married regardless of their sex."" Carter added that the only thing he wouldn't be in favor of would be churches being forced to perform same-sex weddings if they didn't want to do so. A teen was arrested near Boston after he allegedly locked up a gay man and beat him for four days, LGBTQ Nation noted. Jackson Sugrue, 19, is facing several charges ( assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, intimidation of a witness and a hate-crime charge ) because police say he locked Otoni Eliseu, 50, in a church bathroom and beat him for days. ""He attacked me on my back, on my butt, [saying] 'you're gay, you like me,'"" Eliseu, who is from Brazil, said, adding that Sugrue beat him with a fire extinguisher while shouting anti-gay slurs. South Carolina lawmakers inserted a little-publicized amendment into an appropriations bill to allow adoption agencies that receive taxpayer money to discriminate against same-sex couples and other prospective parents, Metro Weekly reported. The provision, inserted into a nearly 500-page bill, allows adoption and foster care agencies to refuse to place children with any family to which the agency, or an employee of the agency, objects, based on a ""sincerely-held religious belief or moral conviction."" If approved, the provision would make South Carolina the 10th state in the nation to exercise such a policy. Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage vetoed a bill that would have banned conversion therapy, the controversial practice to change a person's sexual orientation, because it was ""bad public policy"" and was a ""threat to an individual's religious liberty,"" Newsweek reported. LePage said there was no evidence presented that conversion therapy is currently being practiced in the state and said the bill would prevent therapists from having conversations with those who seek advice about their feelings. Thirteen states plus D.C. currently ban the practicewith four of those bans signed into law by Republican governors. This year, Huntington, West Virginia, recognized the month of LGBT awareness by hosting its second annual Pride Picnic, WVPublic.org noted. It's part of a LGBT-inclusion campaign spearheaded by the city's mayor, Stephen Williams. At the event, 20 vendors and exhibitors set up tents with local goods, resource materials and rainbow flags. Former pharmaceutical executive Bob Hugin is seeking to be the first Republican in 46 years to serve as a New Jersey senator who is pro-choice and supports marriage equality, EPGN.com reported. Hugina Marine Corps veteran who retired in January as executive chairman of Celgene Corp.is looking to unseat two-term Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez in the midterm elections in November. California is on its way to officially recognize June as LGBT Pride Month, Q Voice News reported. Nationally, June generally is recognized as LGBT Pride Month. LA Pride hosted the nation's first, permitted Pride Parade on June 28, 1970. California the first state in the country to recognize an official caucus of state legislators who identify as LGBT. A California official is under fire after proclaiming July ""Straight Pride American Month"" and using homophobic language in a local newspaper column, NBC News reported. Ted Hickmanthe vice mayor of Dixon, a town just west of Sacramentocaused outrage from both the local community and LGBTQ advocates across the state following the publication of his June 29 ""That's Life"" column in Dixon's Independent Voice. The column referred to LGBTQ Pride Month, which is celebrated in June, as ""LGBTQF-WTF month""; called gay people ""tinker bells"" and ""faries"" [sic]; and said heterosexuals should celebrate themselves in July. An online petition demanding Hickman's resignation has garnered more than 16,000 signatures. The Philadelphia pride flag has now inspired another new flag, Popbuzz noted. Designed by Daniel Quasar, the 'progress' flag aims to reconcile the differences of the Philly flag and give the pride flag ""more meaning"" for the wider community. The new flag keeps the original six-stripe LGBTQ flag, but adds the trans flag and marginalised community stripes ( black and brown ) to the hoist of the flag; there's also a new arrow shape. Action Wellness appointed three new officers to its board of directors as the organization looks to expand service to more individuals living with HIV and other chronic illnesses, EPGN.com noted. Action Wellnesspreviously known as ActionAIDSprovides medical, vocational, educational and family services for those living with HIV and other chronic illnesses in the Greater Philadelphia area. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin participated in a forum on civil rights under the Trump administration that took place during UnidosUS' annual conference in Washington, D.C., according to The Washington Blade. ""The LGBTQ community is as diverse as the fabric of our nation,"" said Griffin during the forum that UnidosUS President and CEO Janet MurguÃ�ï��a moderated. Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights President and CEO Vanita Gupta, NAACP Legal Defense Fund President and Director Sherrilyn Ifill, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden and Voto Latino President and CEO Maria Teresa Kumar also took part in the forum. The Delaware Valley Legacy Fund ( DVLF ) elected an executive director nearly seven months after the resignation of his predecessor, EPGN.com noted. Social-justice professional Juan Franco was one of 65 candidates who applied for the position at the LGBT grantmaking organization, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary. Fernando Gonzalez, president of DVLF's board of directors, said Franco's background in fundraising and building relationships made him the ideal fit. House Speaker Paul Ryan weighed in on accusations that Republican Rep. Jim Jordan ignored allegations of sexual abuse while he was an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University decades ago, USA Today reported. Through a spokesman, Ryan said the university was right to investigate the claims and that he would await the outcome of the review. In other Ryan-related news, CNN reported that Randy Brycea Democrat from Wisconsin running to replace Ryan in Congresswas arrested and pled guilty to driving while intoxicated in 1998, in addition to eight other arrests. Brycewho is facing Janesville School Board member Cathy Myers in a Democratic primary on Aug. 14has also been arrested in Wisconsin for marijuana possession, property damage, trespassing and theft, although the theft and trespassing charges were dropped. Renowned journalist/author Gwen Ifill is still being celebrated one year after her untimely passing, and now she's receiving an honor from her undergraduate alma mater, Essence.com noted. Just months after The Washington Press Club and PBS Newshour launched a fellowship program bearing her name, Simmons College announced that it plans to unveil the new Gwen Ifill College of Media, Arts and Humanity in fall 2018. The college will also reportedly house some of Ifill's papers and other personal affects, according to PBS. A division of the American Library Association voted unanimously to strip Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from a major children's literature award over concerns about how the author referred to Native American and Black people, NPR.org noted. The Association for Library Service to Children says the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award will now be known as the Children's Literature Legacy Award.

Phillip,Frost,1203,https://news.artnet.com/art-world/29-museum-exhibitions-summer-2018-1194011,"See our top picks around the globe. Sarah Cascone & Caroline Goldstein, July 10, 2018 There’s art to be seen all over the world this summer, so why not plan a vacation with an exhibition or two in mind? We’ve scoured the globe to bring you this list of the 29 most tantalizing art shows going on view in the next few months. Glexis Novoa, Wat [detail], 2013, graphite on canvas, 49 x 107 inches, Courtesy of the artist and David Castillo Gallery Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907). Courtesy of Neue Galerie. There are shows all over the world this year dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the deaths of Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, but only one of them features the famed “Woman in Gold,” Klimt’s gilded masterpiece Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. It’s the jewel of the Neue Galerie’s collection, and if you haven’t seen it yet, the museum’s upcoming show, which examines the two artists’ work in light of the so-called “joyous apocalypse”—the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I—is the perfect opportunity to do so. Susan Meiselas, Roseann on the way to Manhattan Beach, New York, 1978, from the series “Prince Street Girls,” 1975-90; © Susan Meiselas/Magnum Photos Since the 1970s, photographer Susan Meiselas has documented occurrences as wide-ranging as the armed conflict in Central America to the Kurdish genocide to carnival strippers. Timed here to the release of her new book, Mediations, an exhibition of the same name comes to SFMOMA from the Fundació Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona, and the Jeu de Paume, Paris. Joana Vasconcelos’s Lilicoptère (2012). Work produced in collaboration with Fundação Ricardo do Espírito Santo Silva, Lisbon. © Joana Vasconcelos, VEGAP, Bilbao, 2018. Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos named her current show after a Velvet Underground song, as a tribute to Nico, who sang vocals on the track. The title work, a massive carnival mask sculpture made of bronze and mirrors, is joined by some of the artist’s greatest hits, as well as new works. Robert Rauschenberg, L.A. Uncovered #1 (1998). Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, gift of the artist and Gemini G.E.L., ©Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. LACMA makes the case that Robert Rauschenberg, who lives between New York and Florida, is actually a Los Angeles artist. He was inspired to pursue a career in the arts after being stationed with the Navy at California’s Camp Pendleton in 1944 and ’45, and later worked closely with the LA print workshops Gemini G.E.L. and Styria Studio. The exhibition also touches on Rauschenberg’s work with scientists and engineers from Teledyne Technologies as part of LACMA’s Art & Technology program, as well as his 1981 photography project In + Out City Limits, and 1998 screenprint series LA Uncovered, both of which feature views of the city. Lee Friedlander’s Miles Davis (1969). Image courtesy of the artist and Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco. New York-based photographer Lee Friedlander made his first trip to New Orleans in 1957 and has been visiting ever since. Now, the New Orleans Museum of Art has brought together some of the artist’s earliest streetscapes, self-portraits featuring reflections and shadows, and documentation of jazz culture. The latter work captures not only the musical greats and second-line parades, but also New Orleans’s lesser-known jazz musicians. Choctaw-Cherokee painter and sculptor Jeffrey Gibson destroyed much of his early work before recommitting to his artistic practice in 2011. That date marks the starting point for this exhibition at the Denver Art Museum, which is known for its commitment to showing Native American art. Gibson’s colorful wall hangings, beaded punching bags, rawhide paintings, sculptures, and videos draw parallels between the Native American experience and the Civil Rights movement, all while reflecting the influence of the history of contemporary art. The show will later travel to the Mississippi Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art. Gabriele Münter, Portrait of Marianne von Werefkin (1909). Photo courtesy of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. The Louisiana Museum in Copenhagen will exhibit some 130 works by the late German Expressionist Gabriele Münter, many of which are being shown for the first time, in the artist’s first comprehensive retrospective in decades. A founding artist of the Blaue Reiter group (Blue Rider) with her romantic partner Wassily Kandinsky and artist Franz Marc, Münter has—surprise, surprise—long been overshadowed by her male contemporaries. With an oeuvre of more than 2,000 paintings, and some 1,200 photographs, watercolors, stained glass works, and prints—not to mention thousands more drawings—it’s hopefully just a start to an overdue reassessment of her career. Robert Delaunay, Circular Forms (Sun and Moon), (1913–31). Courtesy of Kunsthaus Zürich. A master of light and color, Robert Delaunay was a major figure of the Parisian avant-garde in the early 20th century. For its upcoming comprehensive show, the Kunsthaus Zürich has amassed 80 paintings and works on paper by the artist to complement two major Delaunay canvases from its permanent collection: Circular Forms (Sun and Moon) (1913–31) and the monumental Circular Forms (1930). The Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. In this historical exhibition, the Ashmolean Museum examines the way our lives are influenced by superstition and so-called “magical thinking.” Objects on view will include engraved rings meant to ensure another’s love and mummified cats. Laure Prouvost’s Ahead of Us (2018). Courtesy of the artist and Nathalie Obadia (Paris and Brussels), carlier | gerbauer (Berlin), and Lisson Gallery (London and New York). For her first Paris museum show, 2013 Turner Prize winner Laure Prouvost—on tap to represent France at the 2019 Venice Biennale—presents a world overrun by nature, a possible vision of the future inspired by global warming. Visitors enter through a corridor of woven tapestries, and can drink from the centerpiece, a large fountain of breasts. Miriam Schapiro, The Beauty of Summer (1973–74). Courtesy of Eric Firestone Gallery, ©Miriam Schapiro/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. Pioneering feminist artist Miriam Schapiro, who died in 2015, was a founding member of the Pattern and Decoration movement. The Museum of Arts and Design pairs 29 works by Schapiro, including her signature collage-painting hybrids, which she dubbed femmages, alongside 28 works by contemporary artists, such as Sanford Biggers, Jeffrey Gibson, and Sara Rahbar. The show reveals her widespread influence and her willingness to embrace disciplines traditionally relegated to the realm of craft and women’s work. Blending traditional Hungarian textile techniques with contemporary art influences—as well as the feminist art movement of the 1960s and ’70s—Anna Torma’s vibrant embroidered multimedia works straddle the line between domesticity and fantasy. “Mike + Doug Starn: Big Bambú,” installation in progress at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Photo courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, ©Mike and Doug Starn. Brothers Mike and Doug Starn have created a new version of their massive interactive project Big Bambú, which was a hit when it appeared on the rooftop of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2010. They’ve now built a multi-story installation of 3,000 bamboo poles at the MFA Houston, the first indoor edition of the piece. Guests who want to climb onto the upper levels should plan ahead and wear flat, rubber-soled, enclosed footwear. Guerrilla Girls at Abrons_preview (2015). Photo courtesy of Andrew Hindrake. In the wake of the #MeToo movement there couldn’t be a better time to revisit the work of the anonymous female art collective the Guerrilla Girls, known for their searing critiques of the art world. The Dallas Museum of Art has brought together 109 posters, books, videos, and ephemera created by the group between 1985 and 2016. Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg, Worship (2016). Film still courtesy of Lisson Gallery and Gio’ Marconi, Milan, ©Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg/Bildupphovsrätt, 2017. Nathalie Djurberg’s darkly fantastical stop-motion animated films are scored by Swedish producer Hans Berg. In their latest show, the duo will present new sculptures and installations, as well as their recent efforts in virtual reality. Eduardo Chillida, Mesa de Omar Khayyâm III (1983). Photo courtesy of the Telefónica Art Collection. The Rijksmuseum has secured loans of nine of Eduardo Chillida‘s monumental steel sculptures for an impressive outdoor exhibition. The Spanish artist is known for blending traditional artisanal iron-forging techniques with the innovations of Modernist abstraction. Don’t miss his Homenaie a Calder, inspired by the mobiles of Alexander Calder. Installation view of “The Music of Color: Sam Gilliam, 1967–73” at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Photo courtesy of the Kunstmuseum Basel. The Kunstmuseum Basel revisits the most radical period in the career of American artist Sam Gilliam, who, in 1967, began painting on unstretched canvases and then folding and crumpling the wet paintings to create works that border between sculpture and painting. The show also highlights Gilliam’s signature drape painting series, which he began in 1968. ©Viviane Sassen, Ra (2017). Courtesy of Stevenson Gallery, Cape Town, South Africa The Hepworth Wakefield showcases the work of Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen, who cites Surrealism as a major influence on her work. The exhibition is presented as a series of “image poems” in the tradition of Surrealist collage, featuring photography series from the last decade as well as the artist’s new work. For the follow up to her ground-breaking installation The Dinner Party, the pioneering feminist artist Judy Chicago set about creating works of art that depicted the miracle of birth—an act rarely pictured in the history of art. (Chicago has argued if men delivered babies, art museums would use much more space emphasizing this essential part of the human experience.) In making these bold female symbols, Chicago continued championing woman-centric art traditions historically denigrated as craft, working with professional textile artists—as she did with The Dinner Party—to help execute her vision. Works from the series will appear this fall at the ICA Miami, but see them in Pasadena first, as the museum has sadly announced its imminent closure. Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo, detail of The Charlatan (1756). Courtesy of the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, Francesc Cambó Bequest, 1949. ©Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, Barcelona. The adventures of Italian autobiographer Giacomo Casanova have become reduced in the popular imagination to his famed exploits with women. But his writings offer an unparalleled account of everyday life and customs in 18th-century European society. The MFA takes a look at Casanova’s world—and the persistently relevant issues of political, social, economic, and sexual power—presenting a selection of 250 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, decorative arts, furniture, costumes, and musical instruments. Richard Avedon, “Dovima With Elephants (1955), featuring a Dior evening gown. Photo courtesy of the Richard Avedon Foundation. The Getty presents 198 fashion-related objects, from magazine covers and ad campaigns to garments and photographs, in this in-depth survey of the history of fashion photography, which rarely gets institutional attention. The show takes as its starting point Edward Steichen, who took the first artistic photographs back in 1911. It then traces the century since, ending in the digital (but still pre-Instagram) age of 2011. The show includes some of the field’s most famous photos, as well as lesser-known masterpieces and experimental work by the likes of Man Ray and Dora Maar, which contributed to the art form’s development and challenge the notion that fashion photography is merely commercial. Winslow Homer with The Gulf Stream in his studio (c. 1900). Photo courtesy of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art. The Bowdoin College Museum of Art makes the case that landscape painter Winslow Homer was heavily influenced by the burgeoning art of photography. The exhibition presents photographs, paintings, and prints, as well as a professional-grade dry plate camera that was once owned by the artist. Frida Kahlo, by Guillermo Kahlo (1932). Photo: Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons. Perhaps art history’s most celebrated female artist, Frida Kahlo became an icon on the strength of her self-portraits, in which she often wore richly embroidered Mexican garb and colorful flowers in her hair. The Victoria and Albert Museum explores her work and identity through the lens of her fashion, bringing together her clothing and personal possessions, many of which have never been publicly shown before. Her famous wardrobe has remained untouched in the 50 years since her death. Paula Crown, The Architecture of Memory (2018). Photo courtesy of PAHC/studio. Timed to the 16th Venice International Architecture Biennial, the Dallas Contemporary presents an exhibition of work by artist Paula Crown, who has turned the simple red solo cup into an architectural building unit. “Germinal” at Portugal’s Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology. The eminent sculptor Pedro Cabrita Reis was a great champion of emerging Portuguese artists in the 1990s and amassed a collection of more than 400 artworks. This is the first time that the public will have access to a selection of his treasure trove. Chris Moore, photograph of an Alexander McQueen look from Autumn/Winter 2010.

Over the last 60 years, Chris Moore has become known as the king of catwalk photography, shooting fashion shows from all the major designers: Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, John Galliano, Comme des Garҫons, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Laurent, Vivienne Westwood, and many more. In the Bowes Museum’s current exhibition, Moore’s historic images ae paired with garments on loan from the world’s foremost fashion houses. Fanette Mellier’s Poster: Specimen (2008).

The San Francisco sensation Color Factory is participating in the exhibition with a chromatic-walkway that extends from the museum show into the garden, and corresponds with real-life colors encountered in New York City. Modernist master Constantin Brancusi transformed the field of sculpture with his sleek, elegantly simple forms, which often bordered on abstraction. MoMA has mined its own collection to present 11 sculptures by the artist as well as drawings, photographs, and archival materials.

Andrew,Davis,1202,http://www.classical-music.com/article/six-best-first-nights-proms,"Classical-Music.com The official website of BBC Music Magazine The BBC Music Magazine team sifts through the archives to find the best First Nights in history The very first First Night was back in 1895, at London’s Queen’s Hall. It was certainly a generous programme, with conductor Henry Wood limiting himself to pieces by a mere 22 different composers. Liszt, Bizet, Chopin, Wagner and Saint-Saëns are among the names still familiar, Cyrill Kistler, Joseph Gungl and Tito Mattei rather less so. 15 soloists joined The New Queen’s Hall Orchestra; the audience was large and enthusiastic. ‘If the succeeding concerts… are as brilliantly successful as the first of the series,’ wrote The Guardian’s reviewer, ‘No one interested in the venture, either financially or artistically, will have reason to complain.’ Three years after the BBC had taken over the running of the Proms, the organisation introduced its new ensemble to the great festival – for the first time, the First Night was performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, taking over from the Henry Wood Symphony Orchestra. For its debut outing, the BBC SO treated the Queen’s Hall audience to a lengthy programme of favourites by Stanford, Mendelssohn, Richard Strauss, Charpentier, Rossini, Tchaikovsky, Parry, Dvorák, plus the Proms premieres of Raymond Huntington Woodman’s An Open Secret and Henry Clough-Leighter My lover, he comes on a skee. A new era had began. To celebrate the centenary of the Proms, this First Night truly was one to remember as Sir Andrew Davis conducted Mahler’s massive Symphony of a Thousand. The stage was fit to bursting, with members of a trio of cathedral choirs, the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the Philharmonia Chorus and the City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus. As you can imagine, they really raised the roof! In the summer of 2012, we commissioned Mark-Anthony Turnage to write us a fanfare to celebrate BBC Music Magazine’s 20th anniversary. Canon Fever is riot of multi-layered brass and percussion with ‘Happy Birthday’ cunningly hidden within its textures. And, of course, we were delighted when the BBC Proms decided to kickstart that year’s season with the piece’s world premiere performance, the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s brass section deserving a medal for their virtuosity – and enthusiasm! What made this Prom particularly poignant was the impromptu rendition of the French national anthem to open the concert. Sakari Oramo led the BBC Symphony Orchestra in the anthem as a tribute to the victims of the Bastille Day attack, that had taken place the day before. The stage was lit in red, white and blue and the audience took to their feet. It was an incredibly moving gesture of solidarity for everyone there, and it is an evening the audience will struggle to forget.

Andrew,Davis,1202,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SAVOR-Mott-St-Silver-Fork-program/63441.html,"The spot specializes in mixing the familiar and unfamiliar, resulting in dishes that challenges patrons' taste budsand maybe even their mindsets. For example, the Asian-focused menu takes appetizers like grilled cauliflower and adds sahmjang butter, fennel seed and almonds. Brussels sprouts are wok-fried, with additions such as lamb pancetta and maple brown butter. ( I could've eaten this dish all night. ) The shrimp-and-kohlrabi salad ( which comes with chicken, peanuts, oranges, lime, fish sauce and fresh herbs ) was delicious and refreshing. And there is what many consider the restaurant's centerpiece: the Mott Burgera dish so popular that it's been hailed as Chicago's best burger ( even besting Au Cheval's, in some people's minds ). Mott St.'s concoction ( only available during brunch, at the bar during the week and in the restaurant for only the first hour of operation during the week ) is a work of art, indeed, consisting of double chuck patties, sweet-potato shoestrings, hoisin aioli, pickled jalapenos, dill pickles, miso butter and American cheese. This is a must-try. However, there are plenty of other enticing dishes as well. I was pleasantly surprised with the bone marrow ( accompanied by pineapple-pickled peppers and imperial black rice ) as well as the stuffed cabbage ( napa kimchi stuffed with pork butt and sticky rice ). Desserts are enjoyablealthough the apps and entrees set an almost impossibly high that the sweets fall just short. The mango sticky rice is a solid treat, although my friend dove into the ricotta donuts with relish, uh, joy. There's also a wonderful assortment of drinks, from cocktails to wine to sake. ( I highly recommend the Gin Cloudkicker, a cocktail with gin, shochu, lemon, sweet potato and egg white. ) Also, we were treated to small servings of coffee mezcal, post-dessertand that unique cocktail really hit the spot. The only possible drawback to this place, at least for me, involves the hours ( Tueday.—Thursday at 6—10 p.m., bar until 11 p.m.; Friday-Saturday at 6—11 p.m., bar until 12 a.m.; and Sundays at 10 a.m.—2 p.m. ). However, as my dining companion pointed out, that could also be construed as a smart marketing move. Regardless, if you manage to make it to Mott St., you're in for a culinary ride.

Michael,Gordon,1201,http://www.columbiatribune.com/obituaries/20180709/roberta-sue-hohl-richardson,"Roberta Sue (Hohl) Richardson, 85, of Moberly, passed away July 6, 2018 at Meadow Ridge Estates in Moberly, Missouri. She was born August 12, 1932 in Hamden, Missouri and grew up in Toledo, Ohio. Her parents were Jacob Henry Hohl and Rosa Goldean (Foudree) Hohl. Sue moved to Darksville after high school to be near the Foudrees, and it was there that she met her husband Hugh who had moved there after serving in World War II to be near his sister Sibyl Wolverton. They were united in marriage on March 28, 1952 in Hugh's hometown of Timbo, Arkansas. They were married for 66 years. They lived on a 10 acre farm in Huntsville until 2007 when they sold the farm and moved to Moberly. One full acre of the farm was planted as garden. Sue, Hugh, and family spent summers tending the garden, picking bushels of vegetables, and canning them for use during the winter. Sue was a homemaker and gifted cake decorator. She started baking and decorating cakes at home for family and friends. Word of her decorating skill reached John Gillan, of Gillan's Bakery in Moberly. He visited Sue at her home and asked her to work for him. She accepted the offer and worked there for many years. Sue was also a remarkable seamstress. She sewed matching outfits for her children, quilts and furnishings for the house, and after she retired from cake decorating, created many designer Barbie Doll dresses. She loved the challenge of creating the dresses by looking at a picture of the dress taken from a magazine. She was also active in the Huntsville 4-H Club for many years and was a member of the Huntsville First Baptist Church. Sue was especially proud that her four children and four grandchildren all obtained college degrees. Survivors include: husband, Hugh Richardson, of Moberly, MO, a son, David (Dena) Richardson of St. Louis, MO; three daughters, Sharon (Michael) Gordon, of Punta Gorda, FL, Vicki (Lyndon) Schutzler, of Monterey, CA, Dr. Mary Richardson of Allendale, MI, Grandchildren; Matthew (Chelci) Richardson, St. Charles, MO, Andrew Richardson, Washington, DC, Lindsay Schutzler, Monterey, CA, Lauren (Ronnie) Palmer of Greeley, CO, Great Granddaughters, Evie Palmer, Lia Jo Palmer, and Zoe Richardson. She was preceded in death by both her parents, and her sister, Mary Lou (Hohl) Caligiuri. Visitation will be held from 11:00 to 1:00 p.m. at the Patton Funeral Home in Huntsville. Funeral services will be held at 1:00 p.m., on Tuesday, July 10th, with burial in Huntsville City Cemetery. Memorial contributions are suggested to Mount Shiloh Cemetery Fund.

Michael,Gordon,1198,https://www.splicetoday.com/music/music-for-right-now,"Noah Berlatsky Contemporary classical recordings of Michael Gordon and Julius Eastman. Contemporary classical recordings of Michael Gordon and Julius Eastman. I've always felt a little dumb for not liking classical music more. I'm not entirely oblivious to the appeal of Mozart or Beethoven or Liszt, but generally if I have a choice between listening to classical music and something else, the latter’s very likely to win. I never learned how to read music, and my knowledge of theory is non-existent—though other people manage to love the classics without that background. In one of those Hollywood movies where responsiveness to classical music demonstrates soul, intelligence and taste, I’d be the dull lump who loses the girl or is executed by the villain while one of the great masters plays. There’s one odd exception to my general classical music philistinism, though. I often like contemporary classical compositions—or new music, as the cognoscenti call it. I'm largely oblivious to sonata form, but dissonance, weird squeaks, or ambient oddness are familiar to me from electronica, metal, and noise. Mozart can sound alien, but new music feels like a house I've been in before. For example, I've been listening, with pleasure, to two recent contemporary classical albums; Canadian pianist Vicky Chow's performance of Michael Gordon's Sonatra (Cantaloupe Records) and the Swiss Kukuruz Quartet's disc Julius Eastman Piano Interpretations (Intakt Records). Gordon is an American minimalist composer who didn't write much music for piano. In Sonatra, he jokingly said he was going to cover every note on the keyboard. The result is a piece that sounds as fiendishly difficult as it is; 15 minutes of manic tinkling designed to give your fingers blisters on their blisters. The music is percussive and repetitive, intricate patterns of notes played over and over before running down the keyboard to bash out another cluster, all the way from the delicate flutter of the high notes to rumbling bottom bashing. Chow, a member of the Bang on a Can ensemble, is a machine—both in the sense that her virtuosity seems inhuman, and because the music itself recalls aggressive electronic works like those of Aphex Twin (though even Richard D. James' laptop would probably overheat at the frantic pace set here.) And when Chow's finally finished, she runs through the piece again, with the piano in the unusual tuning of just intonation, producing an even more alien clatter. It's ferocious and bizarre, while also managing to be a little corny and ridiculous—like listening to a player piano crank out thrash metal. When you hear the name ""Kukuruz Quartet"" you probably think ""string ensemble."" It's not that, though; instead, Kukuruz consists of four pianos. The group's first disc is devoted to four compositions by gay African-American composer Julius Eastman, who died a virtual unknown in 1990. His work’s been revived from posthumous scores, though interpretations are still rare enough on the ground that this one feels like something of an event. Eastman's music was influenced by minimalism too, but he's more meditative than Gordon. The interlocking patterns of the four keyboards echo and shimmer in layers atop each other, creating a throbbing ambience interrupted by occasional storm-like thundering crescendos on the eight and a half minute ""Fugue No. 7."" One of his most famous compositions, ""Evil N****r,"" is built around an ominous melody that could serve as film suspense music, ringed around with rapid twittering. The track doesn't so much develop as breathe, with the same motifs drawing in and out over its 20-minute length. Much of ""Buddha"" sits on the edge of hearing; quiet shuffles and scratches on the keyboard that threaten to tip over into silence. It's not even clear how they got the noises from their instruments. It sounds like they've crawled into their pianos and are scrabbling with polite desperation to get out. Often new music—or new art of any kind—is seen as difficult or challenging; traditional forms are supposed to be more accessible. And no doubt they are for some people. It's also true, though, that old art requires a different context and perspective, which can be difficult to wedge yourself into. The great old composers are for the ages, but at the same time, we're all stuck in the time we're in. Nothing against people speaking across the centuries, but sometimes it's easier to connect with someone talking to you now.

Andrew,Davis,1196,https://wreg.com/2018/07/08/fireworks-prank-sends-people-into-panic-forces-lockdown-at-wolfchase-galleria/,"Police say it turns out, it was just a group of kids setting off fireworks inside. But after several shootings and brawls there in the past few years, shoppers weren’t taking any chances. Andrew Davis found himself in the middle of the pandemonium after stopping at the mall around 6 p.m. on his dinner break. ""I just sat down with my food and I heard people screaming, so I looked over, and that’s when I saw everybody running towards the door,"" he said. He watched as panicked crowds ducked behind walls and pillars and rushed for the exits, and stores raced to lock down. ""Initially, I assumed it was somebody shooting, that’s the first thing I thought,"" Davis said. He was afraid he’d be trampled, so he waited a moment before heading outside. That’s when he saw an officer running into the building and even more frantic people in the parking lot. ""I saw people on the phone, I guess trying to get in touch with family or whoever they had inside the mall,"" Davis said. ""People were upset and crying 'cause they didn’t know what had happened or if the people inside the mall were OK."" Police say a witness spotted three young girls setting off fireworks before taking off running. But the mall has had its fair share of problems in the past. Earlier this week, Anterrio Chambers was sentenced to 31 years in prison on attempted murder charges for shooting at two men in the parking lot in 2015. The following year, a 21-year-old was shot in the parking lot while the mall was packed with Black Friday shoppers. And a month later — on one of the busiest shopping days of the year — a massive flash mob broke out inside. Then, around the exact same time of year last Christmas, the mall was put on lockdown after another brawl and shooting. In March, there was gunfire in the parking lot again after another fight. Davis, who carries his gun everywhere he’s legally allowed, says even though last night's incident was a false alarm, he felt helpless. ""To me it would make more sense to let the law-abiding citizens carry guns so if that situation went the wrong way and there was somebody in there with a gun, somebody like me or somebody else who’s carrying, they have some kind of defense against it,"" he said. No one was hurt, but police still haven’t found the girls who lit the fireworks. Investigators say they were seen running out of the Dillards exit and jumping into a black Ford Focus.

Andrew,Davis,1196,https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/opinion/editorial-zero-tolerance-policy-hits-close-home/6eJpLPtUQMqPWJPIvr3XOP/,"Independence Day is a time to celebrate our freedom and our American ideals. Last week, as we celebrated what it means to be American, we continued to learn about the twists and turns of one community member’s immigration battle. Francisco Javier Gonzalez, the longtime, well-known manager at Pizza Al Fresco, was set to be deported to his native Mexico on Tuesday. A paperwork issue resulted in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reversing a removal order late last month. On Tuesday, Gonzalez reported to ICE in Miramar, where his ankle monitor was taken off. However, his removal order has been reinstated; his lawyers have 30 days to contest the reinstatement. His lawyers also have filed a petition in federal court. Gonzalez’s story has brought the immigration issue upfront in the part-time home of President Donald Trump. In many ways, Gonzalez epitomizes the American dream, becoming a family man with a wife and three daughters, and working his way up to become a manager at a popular Palm Beach establishment. But he is not a legal citizen. Despite that, Gonzalez has received a groundswell of support in this conservative town. His removal order stems from 16 years ago when Gonzalez, now 37, entered the United States from Mexico for the second time using what he thought was a valid visa. He was issued an expedited order of removal. At the time, Gonzalez did not speak English well and did not understand the order, attorney Richard Hujber said. Gonzalez was deported and issued a five-year ban, but he re-entered the country before the five years were up. So far, more than 130,000 people have signed a change.org petition asking to stop his deportation. Hundreds of people came out on June 25 to the Worth Avenue restaurant where he works to see him. Gonzalez has been embraced in a town where people line up on the motorcade route during Trump’s visits to show how much they support the president. We have that freedom of expression, and residents and friends of Gonzalez’s can contact their representatives if they want to see the laws changed. But many Americans agree with the administration’s zero-tolerance policy: Gonzalez entered this country illegally so he should be held accountable. Some of Gonzalez’s supporters have said they don’t disagree with the policy, but they don’t believe a hard-working family man with no criminal record should be deported. Meanwhile, like many others, Gonzalez is caught between competing philosophies and changing White House administrations. Trump has even said there should be no due process for illegals. That has not happened in Gonzalez’s case, but it remains to be seen if his lawyers’ actions or the groundswell of support will aid him. But it is obvious that, even in this conservative home of Trump, many are asking is a zero-tolerance policy really American? Is there no room for discretion in a society that extols liberty and justice for all? © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Bob,Diamond,1195,https://m.khaleejtimes.com/business/markets/a-little-throwback-to-barclays-big-bang-and-the-city-of-london,"Barclays' modest valuation could be compelling proposition.(AP) Barclays was a traditional, Quaker High Street clearing bank whose roots in Britain and its colonies literally went back centuries. The bank was a traditional and commercial bank with branches across the world Barclaycard was the best-known financial brand in the UK. The transformation of Barclays into Britain's only real bulge bracket investment bank began during London's Big Bank in 1986. I had the honour to interview Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd for the Wharton Journal and he literally predicated a transformation in global banking and the Eurobond market we both adored. My own career saw me shuttle between the Wall Street of the Sherman McCoy era and the late Mrs Thatcher's City of London, amid the trading rooms where Ivy League and Oxbridge brats moved billions of dollars of money across the digital arteries of world finance. Sir Martin and Lord Camoys knew that London's Big Bang was a game-changer event even as asset securitisation and the derivative markets changed the DNA of banking, with debt trading and capital markets the hottest game in deregulated Londonium. Not since Sir Sigmund Warburg had such visionary, cosmopolitan financiers built a global investment bank in a mere decade. Barclays exited equities, failed to compete in mergers and acquisitions with the financial gunslingers of Wall Street and incurred huge trading losses in the Asian/Russian meltdowns of 1998. This was the moment Bob Diamond, a Credit Suisse First Boston bond specialist, became chief executive of Barclays Capital and transformed it into Britain's only real bulge bracket global investment bank. I had the privilege of working with and knowing several Barclays Capital executives in London, Geneva, Dubai and Hong Kong and was awed by their prowess in trading fixed income and currencies across the world. It did not surprise me that Barclays Capital contributed 50 per cent of its parent bank's profit even before the multiple traumas of 2008 that culminated in the failure of Lehman Brothers. Bob Diamond's fall was a Sophoclean tragedy too, when hubris found its nemesis in disgrace and failure. Barclay botched a capital raising mission in the Gulf in 2008 to avert naturalisation by HM Treasury and a cap on banker bonuses, the ultimate anathema. Barclays traders were prominent in the post-crisis Libor and foreign exchange rate manipulation scandal. Bob Diamond was grilled by the House of Commons in Westminster and reputedly fired by Dr Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England. Diamond had made untold billions of dollars for Barclays shareholders but failed the basic tenets of risk compliance. Anthony Jenkins, Diamond's successor, failed to reinvent Barclays as a retail bank and lost the confidence of the board and the City's fund managers with his lack of a compelling strategic vision. Jenkins was fired in 2015 and replaced by Jes Staley, an American investment banker who has shed Barclays' African/Middle East and continental Europe footprint to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays still trades at well below tangible book value on the LSE. New York hedge fund Tiger Global has accumulated $1 billion in Barclays shares but has failed to act as a catalyst for a valuation rerating. In an age of Brexit, Barclaycard and its UK retail banking/mortgage business are obviously devalued, eclipsed by the Serious Fraud Office investigation of the 2008 capital raise and the UK mortgage misselling scandal. Barclays' modest valuation below 190 pence seems compelling to me, even in a world where the Stoxx 600 Bank Index has lost 16 per cent and is the worst-performing sector in Europe. True, the bank suffers from the flattening of the US Treasury, British gilt and German Bund yield curves and the old Lehman equities business in New York has hardly set the bottom line on fire. Thankfully, the Crown Court has dismissed criminal charges against Barclays for its 2008 capital raise since a conviction could have cost it its banking licence. Yet fund managers have still not forgiven the bank for its dividend cut or colossal litigation linked losses after the Libor scandal. Barclays paid $2 billion in March 2018 to a Department of Justice probe into the sale of toxic mortgage backed securities to investors.

Michael,Gordon,1194,https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/broncos-boost-points-differential-in-thrashing-of-titans-20180708-p4zq9z.html,"Brisbane have piled on the points in a crucial victory that has all but ended Gold Coast's faint NRL finals hopes. The Broncos' 34-0 win over the Titans on the Gold Coast on Sunday was their biggest all season, improving a for-and-against figure that stood at -40 before kick-off. Replay A third successive win kept them embedded in the eight and pushed the 6-10 Titans four wins off the pace with eight games remaining. None of the Broncos' nine previous wins this season had been by more than nine points. But poor discipline and consistent errors from the hosts made it easy for the Broncos to establish a 20-0 lead by the break and slowly build that margin in a scrappy second half. Never in doubt: Jonus Pearson shows his delight after adding to the Titans' woes with another try.Credit:AAP Trailing 8-0 after Kodi Nikorima opened the scoring in the second minute, the Titans looked to have a reply when Kevin Proctor busted through a gap. But Ashley Taylor's short pass was ruled forward, while a mysterious knock-on ruling against a sure-handed Ryan James soon after took the wind out of their sails in front of 18,005 fans. Exciting teenage centre Kotoni Staggs then jumped and gathered one-handed before throwing off Michael Gordon for a match-turning try. Darius Boyd crossed for the Broncos for a 20-0 lead after 30 minutes as the Titans routinely tossed in simple errors to sabotage any signs of a fightback. Halfback Taylor had a night to forget, throwing two forward passes and missing touch by a big margin when looking for extra metres following a penalty in a sloppy first half. He obstructed a chaser in the second half to continue an error-riddled night that had rookie coach Garth Brennan spinning in disgust in his chair. The lop-sided contest followed a club-worst 54-0 thrashing at the same ground last season and reinstated the Broncos' dominance over their Queensland rivals after the Titans' upset win in Brisbane earlier this season.

Proctor spent all night on his sick bed and was given an injection to stop him vomiting less than an hour before kick-off so he could take his place in a pack already missing Jarrod Wallace and Jai Arrow on Queensland Origin duties and had Ryan James absent until Saturday dues to the NSW Blues camp. The shaggy-haired Kiwi is used to playing 80 minutes on the right edge but could muster only 50 minutes over two stints in an undermanned pack that lost Keegan Hipgrave after 17 minutes and had to at times use centre Konrad Hurrell in the back row. The Titans never got into gear in the 34-0 loss to Big Brother, and Brennan was making no excuses for the team's poor performance. However, he revealed afterward that Proctor was almost taken out of the team before kick-off. ""What people didn't now is Kevin Proctor shouldn't have played, he was vomiting and had diarrhoea in the sheds before we ran out and had to have a needle to stop him vomiting,"" said Brennan. ""He was up all night and was only a last-minute inclusion to play. ""He wanted to play and not let his teammates down, that's why he came off a few times. I'm really proud of his performance and to do what he did on the back of his preparation."" Teammate Michael Gordon said only some players were aware of how ill Proctor was, and they were amazed he was able to play. Several of them attended a birthday party of Proctor's daughter on Saturday but hours later he fell ill. ""I think only a few guys knew, he doesn't like to carry on, Kevvie,"" said Gordon. ""And he never likes to come off. ""He would have lost a heap of weight before the game and they had to give him needles to keep him from throwing up but that's typical Kevvie, he doesn't want to let anyone down. ""It was a massive effort to play 50 minutes like that.""

This photo from an article by Wingate University shows Byrd consulting with Barbara Brown of Bruce's Fabulous Foods about the healthier items on the menu. McDowell County’s WorkFORCE Wellness program will be one of the highlights of an upcoming statewide conference about rural economic development. Local economic developers and civic leaders from more than 65 counties in North Carolina will gather Thursday, July 12 through Friday, July, 13 to discuss approaches to supporting five building blocks necessary for rural communities to capitalize on the state’s economic momentum. The conference “Energizing Rural North Carolina: The Building Blocks of Successful Economic Development,” to be held at The Carolina Hotel in Pinehurst, will explore how infrastructure, workforce, education, health and leadership shape economic outcomes in rural communities, according to a news release. A presentation about McDowell County’s WorkFORCE Wellness program is scheduled for the conference. This program, led by McDowell native Nick Byrd, brings diverse local health resources directly into worksites. Gov. Roy Cooper, state Sen. Harry Brown and state Rep. Jason Saine are scheduled to speak at the conference, which is open to registered participants and invited media. The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC) is presenting the conference with the support of the North Carolina Department of Commerce, the NC Rural Center, the Golden LEAF Foundation, the Institute for Emerging Issues at North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Economic Development Association. “I see the EDPNC’s role in this event as a convener,” said Frank E. Emory Jr., chairman of the EDPNC Board of Directors, “bringing rural stakeholders together to look at these five building blocks through a lens focused sharply on their impact on economic development.” Local economic developers from all 100 North Carolina counties were invited, with each asked to bring local influencers who can effect change in their communities. Economic developers attending are from counties ranging in size from Tyrrell (population 4,000-plus) in northeast North Carolina to Forsyth, the state’s fourth-most populous county. Westernmost counties represented include Graham, Cherokee and Clay. The event will examine how infrastructure, workforce support, education, health outcomes and leadership can contribute to long-term economic development results including employment growth, new business establishments, higher household income and greater economic output. Participants will hear from subject-matter experts and local leaders who have had success within each of the five building blocks, then break out into roundtable discussions about assets, needs and possible strategies within their own rural communities, according to the news release. The featured main speakers within each building block include: • Catherine Truitt, chancellor of the online Western Governors University North Carolina, examining K-12 challenges in rural communities. • Nathan Ramsey, director of the Mountain Area Workforce Development Board, addressing how rural communities can better align education and on-the-job learning to help grow existing workforce talent. • Dan Gerlach, president of the Golden LEAF Foundation, discussing why communities investing in infrastructure must have a clear vision of what business development will result. • Margaret Sauer, director of the state Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Rural Health, stressing the interconnectedness of community health, education and economic development and how broadband can advance all three. • Patrick Woodie, president and chief executive officer of the NC Rural Center, addressing the importance of building local leadership capacity. Along with McDowell’s WorkFORCE Wellness program, other presentation highlights include: • A Roanoke Electric Cooperative project expected to provide access to high-speed Internet to seven underserved rural northeastern North Carolina counties. • Rutherford County Schools’ providing one-to-one digital learning devices to every student as part of a broader plan to improve K-12 outcomes. • The Wilson Academy of Applied Technology, a high school centered around advanced manufacturing technologies and supported by local manufacturers. • A plan by Duke University family medicine to train more residents in rural North Carolina hospitals, because residencies influence where doctors remain to practice. • The Down East Partnership for Children and its support of birth to Grade 3 education in Nash and Edgecombe counties. • Leadership North Carolina's emphasis on bringing together leaders from different arenas and geographies. • Andrew Davis, bestselling author of “TOWN INC.,” who visited 54 U.S. towns and cities over three years to discover why some thrive while others struggle. Sponsors of this EDPNC event are North Carolina’s Electric Cooperatives, First Bank and the North Carolina Bankers Association. The Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina (EDPNC), which operates under contract with the North Carolina Department of Commerce, acts on the state’s behalf to recruit new businesses to North Carolina, support the needs of existing businesses, connect North Carolina exporters with customers, help small business owners get their start and attract tourists and visitors from around the world. Governed by a 17-member board of business and industry leaders representative of the entire state, the EDPNC proudly serves as North Carolina's statewide economic development organization.

So Travaile Speller has sued, claiming that his jailers and the Mecklenburg Sheriff's Office discriminated against his religious practice by forcing him to eat only two meals each day during Ramadan. ""That is clearly depriving me of necessary calories, as well as the recommend(ed) daily volume of nutrients that my body requires to function normally,"" Speller says in his hand-written complaint. ""They are intentionally eliminating one whole meal (lunch) which is cruel and unusual punishment directed towards all Muslims."" There's just one problem: During Ramadan (which took place this year from May 15 to June 15), practicing Muslims are limited to two meals each day. Those are known as suhoor, which can be eaten before dawn, and iftar, which is served after sunset. The daylight hours are off limits for food, drink and sex, a month-long ban that would appear to cover Speller's lost lunches. ""They withheld his lunch during Ramadan? They were supposed to withhold it during Ramadan,"" said Jibril Hough, a spokesman for the Islamic Center of Charlotte and a member of Sheriff Erwin Carmichael's faith advisory board. ""The jail was doing him a favor and actually respecting his faith."" Both approved Ramadan meals were provided to any Mecklenburg inmate who registered in advance to observe the fast, according to the copy of the sign-up form included with Speller's lawsuit. Speller added his name to the list on April 30, court documents show. As written, the form serves as almost a step-by-step guide on how to adhere to the four weeks of fasting. Inmates would remain on the approved list of Ramadan observers as long as they accepted the suhoor meal, did not drink fluids or eat commissary items during the day, and did not join the lunch line, the sheriff's office said. In other words, they had to fast. Followers of Islam believe fasting teaches patience, modesty, and spirituality. Two weeks after the Ramadan fast ended, however, Speller filed his complaint. He says the loss of a month of midday meals violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. ""My meals should not be diminished based on my religion, or because of my observance of my religious holiday,"" he wrote. It was not immediately clear how the jail came up with its Ramadan policy and how many inmates observed the fast. On Tuesday, Mecklenburg sheriff's spokeswoman Anjanette Grube said the office had not been served with Speller's complaint and could not comment. Helping Muslim inmates abide by the rules of the holiday would have required some adjustments by the jail kitchen. Hough says the morning meal can be served as early as 4:30 a.m. while iftar would come well after the jail's normal dinner schedule. Islam traditionally has been a popular religion in prisons and jails. A 2016 New York Times article said 11 percent of the state's prison population was Muslim. At the maximum-security Sing Sing Correctional Facility, 80 percent of the Muslim inmates had converted after entering prison, a prison Imam told the paper. Jail records indicate Speller has been arrested at least 10 times over the last two years. He has been in custody since January, when he was charged with a series of burglary and larceny offenses. According to the Qur’an, the Muslim holy book, ""Whoever fasts during Ramadan out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven ... It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Heaven."" For now, Speller appears fixed on more earthly rewards: His lawsuit calls for a jury trial, and $250,000 in damages. ©2018 The Charlotte Observer (Charlotte, N.C.)

Using ICFs and IFAs to enhance energy efficiency Effective sound control of doors Several U.S. projects are among the shortlisted contenders for this year’s World Architecture Festival (WAF) Awards. Now in its 11th year, the international program received more than 1000 entries from 81 countries. “This has been a terrific year for the WAF Awards, reaching our largest entry total to date,” said Paul Finch, program director. “This has not resulted in any decrease in quality—if anything the opposite. It has been extremely gratifying to review entries from more than 81 different countries and note the way in which architects are absorbing lessons from contemporaries across the world.” The shortlist contains 536 entries across 31 categories. Shortlisted projects represent a variety of building types, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, hotels, cultural/civic projects, and landscaping. Among the U.S. shortlisted projects is San Francisco’s Studio Dental II, which appears in the Health–Completed Buildings category. Designed by Montalba Architects, the facility is a redesign of a historical building in the city’s financial district, which features modern amenities and aesthetics, while simultaneously remaining true to its historic base. The Form4 Architecture-designed Innovation Curve in Palo Alto’s Stanford Research Park is cited in the category of Office–Completed Buildings. The project, which also made the shortlist in 2014 in the Future Projects category, is an open, flexible workspace design, which features sweeping metal curves that are intended as architectural metaphors for the ups and downs of exploratory research and development. Atlanta’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, designed by global design firm HOK, received mention in the Sport–Completed Buildings category. The 71,000-seat facility features eight triangular ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) “petals” that move together along 16 individual tracks, allowing the semitransparent roof to open and close like the aperture of a camera. Other shortlisted U.S. projects include: The United States is among the top five countries entering WAF 2018, alongside China, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The winners will be announced in November at the World Architecture Festival in Amsterdam. In addition to the awards presentation, the three-day event will include keynote addresses from architecture critic and theorist Charles Jencks; Caroline Bos, cofounder/principal urban planner at UNStudio; Aaron Betsky, president of the School of Architecture at Taliesin; and Sir David Adjaye, principal at Adjaye Associates, who recently spoke at AIA Conference on Architecture 2018 in New York City.

A sinkhole opened up at the spot near the Veterans Memorial Bridge on June 28. MnDOT filled the hole with eight yards of concrete and will work for a permanent fix once Minnesota River levels go down. File photo MANKATO — News from Minnesota Department of Transportation likely will raise the spirits of Mankato area motorists who have been subjected to plenty of detours and traffic delays this summer. A short-term fix put in place after a big dip in pavement appeared on Highway 169 has been holding up nicely and the long sinkhole that formed near an off-ramp has not grown. ""Our temporarily fix is stable,"" said Anne Wolff, MnDOT public affairs coordinator. A lane of northbound Highway 169 has been closed since a sinkhole formed near the Veterans Memorial Bridge was discovered June 28. The sinkhole has resulted in a lane restriction for northbound traffic in the section of Highway 169 under the bridge on Belgrade Avenue connecting Mankato and North Mankato. The sinkhole formed beneath a storm sewer grate, causing a six-foot section of concrete to drop about a foot, but it has not grown in size after the initial collapse. Crews have filled in the catch basin with 8 yards of concrete, Wolff said. ""We're taking the situation seriously, but we don't think there's any imminent danger to the flood-control system,"" Jed Falgren, maintenance engineer for MnDOT, said last week. Wolff said the area eventually will be reconstructed. Plans for a permanent fix for the sink hole area have been put on hold while MnDOT waits for the Minnesota River's high waters to subside. MnDOT has been exploring options with North Mankato and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. ""Right now, they (Corps of Engineers) don't have any concern about the integrity of the flood-control system,"" Falgren said last week.

Steve,Cummings,1189,http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2018/07/05/dungeons-dragons-evil-at-baldurs-gate-2-the-thieves-get-their-day/,"A fun adventure with a neat take on the splitting-up-the-party trope. Back in 1998, as a fresh-faced college student, I entered the Forgotten Realms through Baldur’s Gate. I had played in the Realms before, with pen, paper, and dice, of course, but this was a whole new experience. Twenty years on, gaming has evolved, but the memories of that original game live on, especially through IDW’s Dungeons & Dragons: Evil at Baldur’s Gate series by writer Jim Zub. For those not in the know, the whole series boils down to a man and his miniature giant space hamster. That’s not this particular story, but Minsc will always get the name drop. Zub has been writing Baldur’s Gate mini-series since 2014, focusing on Minsc as a member of a party of adventurers doing their adventurer thing in adventurous ways. In this most recent mini-series, IDW is taking a tack quite different from the earlier installments: Zub is writing an issue for each party member with a different artist for each issue. In issue #2, the two rogues are featured together as they deal with an unexpected return in Baldur’s Gate while they attempt to make nice with the local thieves’ guild. From a comics standpoint, EaBG is a straightforward story with art that matches the tone well. Artist Steve Cummings does a fine job with the dark streets of Baldur’s Gate, as well as the big battle scene standard in any good adventure. Speaking of adventure (have I used that word enough?), from a straight-up D&D point-of-view, EaBG covers what would be a good one-shot adventure for when most of your players can’t show up one week. That’s the main feel I’ve gotten from this series. If we look at the meta world here, how would our players fare if we took away the rest of the party, especially the ranger Minsc? On a random Tuesday night, life interferes and only our rogue players can make the table. Any Dungeon Master worth their salt would drum up a solo adventure like this. My hang-ups with the issue come during the big battle, really. The story is solid throughout, if neatly tied up like the one-off adventure I mentioned earlier. I honestly had no idea that Duke Ravengard, introduced in a mass city meeting, was a man. A few pages into the fight scene, the character’s face looks completely different, including coloring. It’s an inconsistency that makes me page back and forth to figure out if I’ve just seen two different people or not. The other thing that bugs me, this time from just a meta/D&D ridiculousness scale POV, is the character randomly introduced during the fight who is currently wearing a green mask, pink ruffled shirt, and purple cape like he’s the love child of Zorro the Gay Blade and Green Arrow. Who goes to a meeting, where everyone knows your name, and still wears a mask? Who takes that man seriously? I digress. In the end, Evil at Baldur’s Gate is a fun adventure with a neat take on the splitting-up-the-party trope, including using different artists for each issue. Even with my quibbles, it’s worth a pick-up for anyone who remembers fighting their way through the original game waiting for a random shout of “Butt-kicking! For goodness!” comic booksDungeons & Dragons: Evil at Baldur's GateIDWJim Zubreviewsteve cummings

Steve,Cummings,1189,https://www.intocycling.co.za/team-dimension-data-line-includes-climber-focused-team-tour-austria/,"This weekend Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka will not only be starting the Tour de France, but once again our African Team will be lining up at the UCI 2.HC Tour of Austria on Saturday, in Feldkirch. Austria’s premier national tour will consist of 8 road stages this year, with 2 mighty summit finishes, stage 3 finishing up the Kitzbuheler Horn and stage 5 up the Grosglockner, these being the two key stages of the race. The Tour of Austria has been a happy hunting ground for our African Team in the past, thinking back to just last year when Ben O’Connor soloed to victory on stage 5. For this years edition of the race it is not surprising that we will have a climber focused team for the 8-stage race. Louis Meintjes will head up our roster with Steve Cummings, Ben King, Jacques Janse van Rensburg and Lachlan Morton all ready for the uphill Austrian gradients. Scott Thwaites will make a welcome return to racing after recovering from a serious training crash in March. Completing our line-up will be a former Tour of Austria stage winner, Johann van Zyl. Alex Sans Vega – Sport Director The Tour of Austria is a race we enjoy coming to each year. It serves as a great platform for many of our riders to kick start the second part of their season and we have had some good success here in the past. Johann van Zyl and Ben O’Connor have both won stages at the Tour of Austria for us, and our team at this year’s edition will be hoping for similar stage success again. Lineup Louis Meintjes Steve Cummings Ben King Jacques Janse van Rensburg Lachlan Morton Scott Thwaites Johann van Zyl Cover Image Explained Austria famed for its Alpine ski slopes also boasts one of the world’s most beautiful Ski jumps in Innsbruck – the Bergisel Ski Jump, designed by the late Dame Zaha Hadid. The Tour of Austria doesn’t pass through Innsbruck (probably because the city hosts the World Champs later this year) but it isn’t short of steep slopes. An Austrian pass is not only one of the most beautiful but also most brutal to ascend on a bicycle. Kind of like riding up a ski jump; the view is nice from the top. Read more articles

Michael,Sylvester,1187,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/people-s-champa-packs-a-punch-dgtl-242691,"Is seventy the new thirty? Sylvester Stallone, who turns 72 today, definitely makes it look so. With a showbiz career spanning almost 50 years and counting, Sly is still one of the most recognisable and bankable stars ever since Rocky (1976) catapulted him to the league of Holly biggies. Is seventy the new thirty? Sylvester Stallone, who turns 72 today, definitely makes it look so. With a showbiz career spanning almost 50 years and counting, Sly is still one of the most recognisable and bankable stars ever since Rocky (1976) catapulted him to the league of Holly biggies. His latest movie Escape Plan 2: Hades released last Friday. The film has not been raking in the moolah, but trust Stallone to deliver a knockout punch (and no, we are not talking about the Rocky franchise that made him a worldwide name and a symbol of the underdog who comes out on top). That’s the Measure of A Man. Starting with a few blink-and-you-miss roles, some of which he was never credited for, Michael Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone had little option but turn up at numerous auditions and casting calls. Success would come later with a script he had written envisioning himself in the lead role, of Rocky Balboa. The producers liked the story but wouldn’t cast him as the lead, they probably had Ryan O’Neil, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, or James Caan in mind. When they gave in, the film was shot using handheld cameras for just $1 million. Rocky went on to win three Oscars, including that for Best Picture, and earned $225 million in global box office receipts. For the countless football fans, we’ll let you in on a trivia: In 1981, he starred alongside Michael Caine in Escape to Victory, a WW2 sports drama in which he plays a prisoner of war involved in a Nazi propaganda football match. The film also starred football greats Pelé and Bobby Moore. Sly went on to repeat the success of the Rocky series with the Rambo franchise, all along writing scripts and acting, not always successfully, but he wouldn’t cave in, always coming back with a stray hit once in a while to keep afloat — Cliffhanger (1993) is a case in point. He had a string of hits in his career and received critical acclaim in the 2003 American neo-noir crime drama Shade. He directed Staying Alive, the sequel to the cult Saturday Night Fever, and lent his voice to Paradise Alley, Rhinestone and Grudge Match. He also collaborated with composer Bill Conti and starred as himself in the 2009 Bollywood film Kambakkht Ishq, starring Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor. The action star has made sure his body is as memorable as his body of work. Dominating the ’80s action scene with his ripped torso, the one-arm push-ups, the workout montage in Rocky IV, the man has inspired millions to hit gyms. Stars from Jason Statham to Salman Khan and Hrithik Roshan to John Abraham, have called him an inspiration. “It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done!” Happy Birthday Champ!

BMW weighed in with similar comments soon after. Is Germany now orchestrating Project Fear Mark Zwei? Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond has agreed to discuss his controversial time at the bank in front of an audience in Westminster in a fortnight's time with author Philip Augar. His last public grilling on these shores was in front of the Commons Treasury Select Committee in 2011 to explain his role in the Libor-rigging scandal. Car crash stuff, as I recall, but then beaming Bob's never been one to hide his light under a bushel. Bank of England governor Mark Carney's apparent excitement about England's progress in the World Cup – he had a Three Lions badge fixed to his lapel yesterday – is unsurprising. The Canadian hasn't had much to cheer about down the years, footiewise. Canada has qualified for only one World Cup, in 1986, and failed to score a single goal. On the domestic front, Carney insists on backing perennial also-rans Everton. He began supporting them in the 1990s when visiting relatives in Liverpool while working at Goldman Sachs. Former Bank of England governor Sir Gordon Richardson is revealed to have advised Harold Wilson he should 'on no account' award legendary asset-stripper James Goldsmith a knighthood in the controversial Lavender List honours in 1976. Just months previously, Richardson approved Goldsmith becoming chairman of lender Slater Walker, which the bank had just had to bail out with £110million. What had Jimmy done to change his mind? Southend Airport owner Stobart Group's AGM today should be a lively affair, what with former boss Andrew Tinkler hoping to oust chairman Iain Ferguson. It is at the company's headquarters in Guernsey, which is a nuisance for shareholders who'll have to take a plane to the tax-friendly Channel Island.

Michael,Gordon,1183,https://wnep.com/2018/07/04/hot-weather-for-pineknotter-days/,"NORTHUMBERLAND, Pa. -- A 46-year-old tradition in Northumberland County brought people to King Street Park in the borough of Northumberland. Pineknotter Days is held every year during the first week of July. Food, games, live music, and crafts are some of the ingredients of a fun event. And it perfectly describes Northumberland's 46th annual Pineknotter Days. Some people tell Newswatch 16 they consider Pineknotter Days the official Fourth of July kickoff. ""I've been coming here ever since I was 7 years old. I've been here when it first came out. They had rides on Second Street School, and it's a yearly thing. You come down here and you meet old friends you haven't seen in a long time,"" said Michael Gordon of Northumberland. Organizers say this year's event hasn't been as busy as in years past. They believe that's because of the heat. ""Some of our vendors didn't show up, and some of our crafters didn't show up because of the heat,"" said Pineknotter Days co-chair Michael McWilliams. So what is a pineknotter? It's a tough person because a pine knot is where the branch goes into the tree and forms a tight knot. Many people attending the street fair had cold treats in hand. Aura Lee of Sunbury tells Newswatch 16 she comes every year but won't stay long this time. ""We're sitting here melting, so we won't be here long today. We might come back after the sun starts to hide,"" Lee said. It was especially hot for food vendors. Something else that could be keeping people away? Construction from the Duke Street project. To help with that, there is a free parking shuttle running from the old W and L Subaru on Route 11.

John,O'Neil,1182,https://www.journaltribune.com/articles/front-page/family-member-speaks-out-about-sentencing-of-oob-man/,"Today’s E-Edition | | Full Forecast By egotthelf@journaltribune.com | on July 05, 2018 Derek Poulin is escorted into York County Superior Court on July 14, 2015. GREGORY REC/Journal Tribune OLD ORCHARD BEACH — The aunt of an Old Orchard Beach man who killed his grandmother believes he deserves the life sentence he received.Derek Poulin, 29, was convicted of murder and sentenced to a life sentence and a concurrent 30-year sentence for arson by Justice John O’Neil in York County Superior Court in 2015. He is now asking the York County Superior Court to review his case and give him a lesser sentence. Poulin when he was 23 murdered his grandmother, 61-year-old Patricia Noel in the Old Orchard Beach home she shared with him and his father in 2013. Poulin beat his grandmother with a golf club and stabbed her about 70 times before setting fire to the house. Poulin tried to get his sentence appealed in 2016, arguing that he did not get a fair trial. The appeal was denied by the Maine Supreme Court. His attorney, Chris Nielsen, stated in court documents field on June 6, that giving a life sentence to Poulin constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Nielsen argued the court failed to adequately consider the Poulin’s young age and his mental health, as well as his lack of any prior criminal history. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber, in court documents filed two days later, stated he court did consider Poulin’s lack of criminal history as well as his young age and mental condition, but those factors were outweighed by the “sheer brutality” of the crime as well as other factors including the victim impact and Poulin’s lack of remorse. Poulin is due at York County Superior Court at 9 a.m. on July 10 for a one-hour oral hearing with O’Neil. Poulin’s aunt, Darcy Daniels, said it’s been difficult dealing with the loss of Noel, who was her mother. “She was the glue of the family. It’s been quite a loss not having her here anymore,” she said. “I live with my brother now in my mom’s house. I’m reminded every day what happened.” Daniels first heard about her nephew’s request last week, and she said his request to appeal the case and now review it have been upsetting and she has had anxiety and not been sleeping very well. “I wish he would take ownership of what he’s done and just accept it and let us move on,” said Daniels. She said her nephew has shown no remorse for what he’s done and she hopes the court will stand by the decision it made in 2015. “I think the judge did the right thing when he sentenced my nephew,” said Daniels. — Staff Writer Liz Gotthelf can be contacted at 282-1535, ext. 325 or egotthelf@journaltribune.com.

Andrew,Davis,1181,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6356751-151/cocc-student-life-director-seeks-bend-council-seat,"Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life is the latest candidate seeking election to the Bend City Council, which will have two open seats and its first elected mayor on the November ballot. Andrew Davis, 34, said Wednesday that he’s running for City Council to serve the community where he was born and raised. “We need people to get involved who care about the community,” Davis said. “I really like Bend, and I’m proud to call it home.” He said he’s still working out what his priorities would be if he were elected, but he cares strongly about affordable housing and improving city infrastructure. Davis hasn’t run for elected office before, though he has served as vice chairman and secretary of the Orchard District Neighborhood Association. Davis joined COCC in 2016. He previously worked at Oregon State University-Cascades for seven years in its student life department. He said his day-to-day work involves a lot of working with people and facilitating discussion, skills he wants to bring to the City Council. “Something that’s sort of spurred me on is that it feels like at a more national level, politics has gotten more combative,” Davis said. “I want to help facilitate a moderate conversation.” Davis graduated from COCC and OSU-Cascades and has an MBA from Eastern Oregon University. He has three young children. In 2002, he was one of 11 valedictorians from Mountain View High School and was asked to rewrite his speech because it focused too much on his belief in God, according to Bulletin archives. Davis seeks the same City Council seat, position 5, as perennial candidate Ron “Rondo” Boozell. Mayor Casey Roats is running for the other open council seat, position 6. City Councilor Barb Campbell, whose term also expires in 2019, has not yet announced whether she plans to seek re-election. Five people — Mayor Pro Tem Sally Russell, Councilor Bill Moseley and Bend residents Charles Baer, Brian Douglass and Timothy Heckler — are running to become Bend’s first elected mayor. All council and mayoral candidates must collect at least 150 signatures from Bend voters to qualify for the ballot. Only Russell and Baer have turned in signatures thus far. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.

Andrew,Davis,1181,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SHOWBIZ-Sam-Smith-Portia-de-Rossi-Brendon-Urie-Beyonce/63395.html,"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi said they embrace tabloid gossip, to a degreebecause it means their same-sex marriage is viewed as normal, Page Six noted. ""The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,"" de Rossi told Us Weekly. ""I'm not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, 'Oh, now we're finally accepted.' We get the same st as every celebrity couple."" The Arrested Development star and DeGeneres tied the knot in 2008. Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is starting a human-rights organization called Highest Hopes Foundation, Page Six revealed. The rock singer said the nonprofit will support ""communities subject to discrimination or abuse on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity."" Panic! at the Disco will donate one dollar of each ticket from U.S. dates of its ""Pray for the Wicked Tour"" to Highest Hopes. The tour starts July 11 in Minneapolis and will also visit cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Tampa and New York City. Urie also announced on June 29 on the Today show that he's pledged a $1 million gift to GLSEN to provide resources, training, and support to students working to create student-led GSA clubs in their K-12 schools, through his foundation, a press release noted. Rolling Stone has released a list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Farand topping the list is Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love,"" ETCanada.com noted. Filling out the rest of the top five, in order, were ""Paper Planes"" by M.I.A., ""Seven Nation Army"" by The White Stripes, ""Hey Ya!"" by Outkast"" and ""99 Problems"" by Jay-Z. A few of the other songs included Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" ( #95 ), Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" ( #87 ), LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"" ( #77 ), Kendrick Lamar's ""DNA"" ( #64 ), Sia's ""Chandelier"" ( #52 ), U2's ""Beautiful Day"" ( #40 ), Outcast's ""Ms. Jackson"" ( #23 ), Adele's ""Rolling in the Deep"" ( #8 ) and Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" ( #14 ). Olympic figure skater and Dancing with the Stars winner Adam Ripponthe first openly gay U.S. athlete to medal in the competitionrecently explained in InStyle how, for him, coming out was ( and still is ) an ongoing process. In part, he stated, ""My coming-out wasn't one moment. It's a process never really ends. Coming out is about about finding out who you are in stages, through moments of self-discovery."" An executive in the luxury Hakkasan nightclub firm, Beth Bartolini, caused controversy after calling Katy Perry BFF and nightlife maven Markus Molinari a ""tr—ny"" in a text messagethen accidentally sending it to him, Page Six noted. Molinari posted the misdirected texts to Instagram, and received support from Hollywood pals Milla Jovovich, Lydia Hearst and Mia Moretti. Molinari posted Bartolini's texts with the caption: ""Normally I wouldn't reply or give any attention to negativity people may say about me because it doesn't effect my universe, but it being PRIDE MONTH and you being a longtime 'friend' I decided to post this because this type of bullying/ignorance/ and just out right mean girl behavior should NEVER be tolerated & should be brought to light."" Bette Midler was accused of homophobia after posting ae tweet about President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Gay Star News noted. ""Trump and Putin are meeting in Finland next month,' she wrote., adding, ""That's a long way to travel for a blowjob, but hey  Putin's got the money."" Some criticized Midler, while others defended her. In 2016, Midler apologized after a transphobic tweet about Caitlyn Jenner. One lucky queen took home the crown on the season-10 finale of RuPaul's Drag Racebut the episode itself scored a win of its own, EW.com noted. VH1 announced the grand finalewhich ( spoiler alert ) had New York City native Aquaria winning the titlebroke a ratings record for the Emmy-winning reality series, posting its most-watched conclusion in its nine-year history. Roughly 527,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic tuned in to watch the finale. Terry Crews said he was threatened with retaliation for speaking out about a sexual assault by a Hollywood agent, saying the producer of The Expendables 4 warned of vague ""troubles"" unless he withdraws his civil suit, according to Deadline.com . In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Crews said Expendables producer Avi Lerner called his manager and asked that the actor to drop his sexual-assault case against Adam Venit in order to appear in the fourth installment of the action film. Lerner himself has been sued for sexual harassment, hostile work environment and gender discrimination by a woman identified only as Jane Roe. On a related note, rapper/actor 50 Cent ridiculed Terry Crews for testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is a survivor of sexual assault, Out.com revealed. The rapper took to Instagram to post a photo of Crews shirtless with the words, ""I got raped / My wife just watched"" and then another photo of Crews with a rose in his mouth that said ""Gym time."" The post has since been taken down. Crews told TMZ of 50's post, ""I prove that size doesn't matter when it comes to sexual assault."" NBC has made a final decision on the show Champions, opting not to renew the freshman comedy for a second season, Deadline noted. Reportedly, there have been discussions with Netflix about picking up the series. Created by Charlie Grandy and Mindy Kaling, Champions centers on Vince ( Anders Holm ), a gym owner who lives with his younger brother, Matthew ( Andy Favreau ), and is on the verge of secretly selling the gym and moving to Florida when his high school fling, Priya ( recurring guest star Kaling ), unexpectedly drops off their 15-year-old son, Michael ( J.J. Totah ) on his doorstep. Totah, who's out, was often applauded for his depiction of an openly gay teen. Lee Daniels has been slapped with a $5 million lawsuit by Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder Damon Dash, who alleges that Daniels stiffed him out of a producer credit on a biopic about legendary comedian Richard Pryor, TheWrap reported. The suit says that attorneys for both sides went back and forth for years in an effort to mediate the situation. Alleging breach of contract and other counts, the suit seeks damages ""in an amount to be determined at trial, but estimated at no less than $5 million."" ""He believed in me when nobody else did,"" Daniels later said of Dash, with a promise to end the lawsuit, Deadline noted. A judge has ordered Sony to disclose the names of people it interviewed as part of an internal investigation into its former Kemosabe Records CEO Dr. Lukefollowing claims by singer Kesha that he raped her, Page Six noted. The record label has previously argued that information is protected by attorney-client privilege, but Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter disagreed in her order, demanding they name names within 20 days. Dr. Lukereal name Lukasz Gottwaldsued Kesha in 2014 after she went public with allegations that he'd raped her. Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse is teaming with tennis champion Serena Williams to fight domestic abuse, ReelChicago.com noted. Since 2005, Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse has empowered more than 1.3 million survivors on the road to safety and security through its educational resources, including The Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse Moving Ahead curriculum. Beginning this summer, Purple Purse will team with female artists in six cities: New York, Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles; Williams unveiled the first mural, by artist Isabel Castillo Guijarro, in New York City. Sony Music Entertainment announced y that it has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Prince's estate for 35 previously released albums from the legendary musician's catalog, CBS Los Angeles noted. The music will be distributed by Legacy Recordings, a division of SMEwith worldwide rights beginning immediately for 19 previously released album titles originally released between 1995-2010. However, several of Prince's biggest albums, including Purple Rain, are not part of the new deal due to their status as soundtrack recordings, Complex added. Camila Cabello has become the first artist to top the Billboard pop and adult pop charts with the first two songs from a debut album, according to the publication. Cabello's ""Never Be the Same"" reaced the top of Billboard's Adult Pop Songs radio airplay chart, dated June 30. The set's lead single, ""Havana,"" featuring Young Thug, led Pop Songs for seven weeks ( beginning Dec. 9 ) and Adult Pop Songs for one frame ( March 3 ). Multi-platinum award-winning singer/songwriter and global superstar Josh Groban announced his eighth studio album, Bridges, which will be released on Sept. 21 via Reprise Records, a press release noted. The album is available for pre-order at joshgroban.lnk.to/Bridges, and fans who pre-order the album will receive three downloads of new songs including the new single, ""Granted,"" along with songs ""Symphony"" and ""S'il Suffisait D'Aimer."" The album will also be available as in a deluxe version with two bonus tracks. Oscar winner Jared Leto ( Dallas Buyers Club ) will star in and Daniel Espinosa will direct Morbius, based on the Marvel comic, TheWrap.com noted. The Morbius character was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic book in 1971. In the comics, Michael Morbius is a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who is transformed into a vampire while attempting to cure a rare blood disease. A Manhattan judge had a message for Madonna: Stop messing with your neighbors, Page Six noted. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gerald Lebovits said the pop superstar was ""merely harassing"" fellow residents of her Upper West Side co-op for continuing to seek records from the board after she lost a legal bid challenging a rule that required her to be physically present in her $7.3-million home when any of her family or staff are there. Drake has confirmed that he is a fathervia music on his new album, Scorpion, JustJared.com noted. The rumors dropped over a year ago that Drake got former porn star Sophie Brussaux pregnant and now he finally is confirming that he is the father of her baby. On the song ""Emotionless,"" Drake raps, ""I wasn't hiding my kid from the world, I was hiding the world from my kid."" Following a $20-million suit over his song ""Photograph"" ( which was settled out of court ) and another over ""The Rest of Our Life,"" which he composed for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, singer Ed Sheeran is facing another lawsuit over ""Thinking Out Loud,"" Variety noted. Owners of that song's copyright claims that it lifts from Marvin Gaye's 1972 classic ""Let's Get It On"" and are seeking $100 million in damages. Neon has acquired worldwide rights to Sharp Edges, a 1986 documentary about Tonya Harding competing at the National Figure Skating Championships at the age of 15, Page Six reported. Yale University student Sandra Luckow made the film as part of her senior thesis. It follows Harding going to her first National Figure Skating Championships, where she placed sixth. The movie features interviews with Harding and her mother, LaVona Golden. ( Alison Janney won an Oscar this year for portraying Golden in the film I, Tonya. ) Already facing rape and criminal sex act charges and a potential 25 years behind bars, Harvey Weinstein has been hit with even heavier legal weight from the Manhattan D.A.that could see him in jail for life, Deadline noted. ""A Manhattan Grand Jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York's Penal Law,"" said District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Joining the two women identified in the previous indictment in late May, the new indictment also includes two counts of predatory sexual assault. In a new interview, Australian actor Guy Pearce suggested that Kevin Spacey inappropriately touched him during their time together filming the 1997 movie L.A. Confidential, TheWrap noted. When asked by TV host Andrew Denton about his time working with Spacey, Pearce said, ""Yeah… yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor; incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He's a handsy guy. ... Thankfully I was 29, and not 14."" Actress Heather Locklear has gone to rehab, according to a Page Six item that cites TMZ. The former Melrose Place star voluntarily agreed to check herself into a long-term treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health issues after she spent time in a psychiatric ward. She was recently arrested after drinking a bottle of tequila, crashing her Porsche at her California mansion and then attacking cops when they arrived. Wynonna Judd's daughter, Grace Pauline Kelley, has been sentenced to eight years in prison after violating probation in November, according to Page Six, which cited Radar Online. The country star's 22-year-old daughter has landed herself time at West Tennessee State Penitentiary after leaving a drug recovery program last year and violating her probation. Jerry Seinfeld questioned ABC's decision to cancel Roseanne Barr's rebooted sitcom in the wake of her incendiary tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, TheWrap noted. ""I didn't see why it was necessary to fire her,"" Seinfeld told Entertainment Tonight ""Why would you murder someone who's committing suicide? ""I think they should get another Roseanne. They brought Dan Conner backhe was dead and they brought him back. So, why can't we get another Roseanne?""

Tournament winners pictured from left to right are David Turner- A Flight, Danny Daniel-B Flight, Tony Burtt-C Flight, and Brian Martin-D Flight. There were 25 area golfers who left home on Tuesday, June 26 heading to Olde Mill Golf Resort in heavy fog and 100% rain in the forecast to participate in the Laidback Golf Tours first MAJOR of this season. Upon arrival they found the fog lifted and a beautiful seventy degree overcast perfect golfing day. It was like God had an umbrella over the course as clouds and rain mist surrounded the area. The fifty- year old breath-taking Ellis Maples designed course again proved it’s worth giving up only three rounds in the seventies, one eagle and twenty birdies to the entire field. The A Flight had to be determined by a play-off by the same top two finishers from the 2017 event here. Both David Turner and Steve Cummings finished regulation play tied at 76. They proceeded to the par 5 first hole where the both made par. On the second play-off hole a par 3; David Turner claimed his first win of this season as he again made par while Cummings bogied the hole. This was the third year in a row Turner has taken the top spot here at Olde Mill. Turner also claimed a skin with one of his three birdies of the day. Cummings got his fourth second place finish of the season to go along with one win in his five season starts. Johnny Gauldin collected third place with his round of 78. Danny Daniel captured his first win of the season by carding two birdies for a score of 84 in the B Flight. Both his birdies were capped by Turner in the skins game but aided in holding off second place finisher Lyle Heath. Heath who was playing in his first tournament of the season had one birdie on his way to finishing at 86. Tony Burtt shot ten strokes below his average today in the C Flight. Burtt whose average score is 92 posted three birdies today and turned in a score of 82. It was his second lowest round in four seasons on the Tour and gave him his first win since the two he won back in 2016. Mike Reynolds claimed the flight’s second place with his round of 86. This was Reynold’s second outing since joining the Tour. Brian Martin has only played in two tournaments this season due to his work schedule but has won both times. Martin carded one birdie on his way to claiming his second win of the season in D Flight with a score of 87. Jody Myers who won the flight here back in 2016 finished second today with a score of 89. It was Myers first outing of the season also due to heavy work schedule. With double points being awarded today at the Major; Randy McCann was able to pass Bob Foyle and Willard Vicks slightly in the season points race.

Andrew,Davis,1178,http://www.tribune242.com/news/2018/jul/03/privy-council-orders-new-appeal-policemans-killers/%3Fnews,"Jump to content Clockwise from above left: Stephen ‘Die’ Stubbs, Andrew Davis and Clinton Evans, pictured outside court previously. As of Tuesday, July 3, 2018 By NICO SCAVELLA Tribune Staff Reporter nscavella@tribunemedia.net THE Privy Council has ordered a new hearing of Stephen “Die” Stubbs and two other convicts’ appeal of their convictions and sentences for the murder of a policeman at a nightclub almost 20 years ago. This country’s highest court ordered that the appeal by Stubbs, Clinton Evans and Andrew Davis be remitted to the appellate court for a rehearing. A statement from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said the matter was remitted to the Court of Appeal to be heard before a differently constituted panel of justices. The statement noted that until such time as the new hearing takes place, the three men remain in “lawful custody” at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services. On March 29, 1999, Constable Jimmy Ambrose, an officer in plain clothes, was shot and killed outside the now-closed Club Rock Disco after a fight between two rival groups of men broke out. According to the brief facts of the case provided by the Privy Council’s website, Evans is said to have pointed his weapon at two other police officers as they chased him from the scene. The three men were first convicted in May 2002, but their convictions were overturned on appeal. The second trial before then-Supreme Court Justice Jon Isaacs, who now sits as an appellate judge, was aborted on the first day of the summation of the case. In a second retrial in July 2013, the three men were convicted of murder and attempted murder, while Evans was further convicted of two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to put another in fear. A week before sentencing, Crown prosecutors gave notice of the Crown’s intent to seek the death penalty. However, then-Supreme Court Justice Roy Jones, who also now sits as an appellate judge, ruled that the case did not meet the “worst of the worst” requirements for the death penalty, and even if it had, the Crown had failed to follow sentencing guidelines by giving notice of their intention in the specified time. The men were ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment, on the basis that Sections 290 and 291 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act requires that either a death sentence of life imprisonment be imposed where a police officer has been murdered in the execution of his duties. Following the verdicts in the second retrial, the appellants appealed successfully against their convictions and, with the exception of Stubbs, their sentences. Prior to the substantive hearing of the matter before Justice Isaacs and since departed appellate Justices Abdulai Conteh and Neville Adderley, Stubbs’ attorney Murrio Ducille requested that Justice Isaacs recuse himself on the basis that the judge had presided over the second aborted trial. However, the Court of Appeal refused Mr Ducille’s application for recusal. Commenting has been disabled for this item. Contents of this site are © Copyright 2018 Ellington. All rights reserved.

Andrew,Davis,1178,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Abused-child-bisexual-health-electoral-news/63393.html,"LGBTQ Nation noted that a study in the LGBT Health Journal stated that bisexual men face a higher risk for heart disease than either straight or gay men. The study looked at a sample of 7,731 men, placing each in one of four categories: gay-identified men, bisexual-identified men, heterosexual-identified men who have sex with men ( MSM ) and exclusively heterosexual men. Several risk factors were considered in the study, including tobacco use, diet, hypertension, cholesterol and binge drinking; bisexual-identified men faced higher rates of mental distress, obesity, elevated blood pressure and an increase in glycosylated hemoglobin ( which is linked to diabetes ). Openly gay Congressman Jared Polis claimed the Democratic nomination for governor in Colorado with a clear victory June 26 after he spent $11 million of his own money to defeat three rivals, The Denver Post reported. The five-term Boulder congressman would become the nation's first openly gay man elected governor if he wins in November. Mayor Annise Parker, president and CEO of LGBTQ Victory Fund, said in a statement, ""While it is a historic and promising night for the LGBTQ community, primary voters chose Jared not because he could be a historic first, but because of his unquestionable integrity and positive vision for Coloradans."" Speaking of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, it announced its endorsement of 37 more LGBTQ candidatesraising to 170 the total number of candidates endorsed this cycle, a press release noted. They include ""Spotlight Candidates"" Amelia Marquez ( Montana House of Representatives, District 52 ), Cody Thompson ( West Virginia House of Delegates, District 43 ) and Elias Rojas ( Alaska House of Representatives, District 20 ). Sharon Brackett has become the first trans woman to be elected to a public office in Maryland, a press release noted. Brackett, competing against 14 other candidates, was elected to the 46th District Democratic Central Committee representing the neighborhoods of Canton, Locust Point, Federal Hill, Brooklyn, Curtis Bay and Cherry Hill, located in Baltimore. Another trans woman, Laura Hart, was elected to the Democratic Central Committee in St. Mary's county; that race was uncontested. Transgender Human Rights Campaign worker Charlotte Clymer, who identifies as female, has said that when she got up to use the woman's bathroom at a restaurant, she said she was asked to show her IDand was ejected when she refused, CNN.com reported. Clymer said she was at Cuba Libre Restaurant and Rum Bar in Washington, D.C., with a group of friends for a bachelorette party when the incident happened. Cuba Libre apologized about the incident on Twitter, saying, ""As a rule, we support safe bathrooms and welcome guests of all gender identifications."" SAGE and the Movement Advancement Project ( MAP ) released ""Nursing Home,"" the latest in a series of ads illustrating the harms LGBT Americans face as a result of not having nondiscrimination protections, a press release noted. Among other things, the release stated that LGBT older adults are particularly vulnerable to discrimination, because religiously affiliated organizations provide a majority of the services they rely on for their most basic needs. The ad is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h83ATneXX78&feature=youtu.be. Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump's daughter, donated $50,000 to a church in Texas that has a history of anti-LGBTQ activism, according to LGBTQ Nation. CBN News reported that an anonymous source said that Trump gave $50,000 to the Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano after she read a tweet that said that the church wanted to help immigrant children. While the church is possibly doing commendable work for immigrant children, it also has a history of anti-LGBTQ activism; the church's website calls being LGBTQ ""sexual identity confusion."" President Trump has nominated a former head of gay organization Log Cabin Republicans to a senior position at the State Department for political and military affairs, The Washington Blade reported. The White House announced that it had designated R. Clarke Cooper, who's gay and led Log Cabin during 2010-12, as assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs. The announcement also included news for two other unrelated nominees. In Texas, San Antonio had a rainbow crosswalk installed June 27, WKYC.com reported. The milestone came three years after the day the U.S. Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal across the country. District 1 City Councilman Roberto Trevino said San Antonio is the second city in Texas to have a pride crosswalk. Montana voters rejected a ballot initiative that the ACLU of Montaina said was intended to intimidate and harm transgender and non-binary Montanans, a press release noted. I-183 failed to gather the necessary 25,468 signatures to make it on the November ballot. I-183 sought to block transgender and non-binary Montanans from public life. The initiative would have prevented them from using public facilities that correspond with their gender identity in places such as libraries, parks, and schools. The state legislature rejected an almost identical measure in 2017. The Department of Justice filed federal hate-crimes charges against James Alex Fields Jr.the driver accused of killing and harming counterprotesters at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, according to a Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights press release. Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the conference, said, ""This is a very important, robust, and decisive indictment by career prosecutors in the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. It stands in stark and painful contrast with a president who still refuses to unequivocally denounce the white supremacists, some of whom were marching in his name, in Charlottesville that day."" St. Petersburg authorities are looking into an incident where a group of men, in hooded black masks, harassed a crowd of partygoers during St. Pete Pride, WFLA.com noted. One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she shouted to the men to go awayto which they reportedly responded, ""Go kill yourself."" Nearby businesses are checking their cameras to see if any images of the men were captured. To mark the rainbow flag's 40th anniversary, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has installed one of the banners in one of its galleries, PhillyVoice.com noted. Artist Gilbert Baker and 30 volunteers hand-dyed and stitched the two original flags to highlight LGBTQ+ issues as both a global struggle and a matter of civil rights. The Rainbow Flag will be on display in Gallery 124 through Sunday, July 8. An attorney for six current and former students at Pennsylvania's Boyertown Area Senior High School vowed to appeal a judicial ruling that upholds the right of transgender students to use restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identities, EPGN.com noted. Randall L. Wengerchief counsel for Independence Law Center, a conservative civil-rights organizationsaid the appeal will seek review of the ruling by all 12 active judges of the Third Circuit along with Senior Judge Richard L. Nygaard. If the ruling isn't overturned, Wenger said he may petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the matter. In an upset, 10-term U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley was defeated by 28-year-old Bernie Sanders supporter Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a Democratic congressional primary in New York, NBC News noted. Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who has never held elected office. She ran a low-budget campaign and was outspent 18 to one. The only three Black U.S. senators have introduced a bill that would make lynching a federal hate crime, CNN.com noted. Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey teamed with Democrat Kamala Harris of California and South Carolina Republican Tim Scott to introduce the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act of 2018. he senators said the legislation will amend the US Code ""to specify that lynching is a crime in itself that would warrant an enhanced sentence under existing federal hate-crime statues."" The NEA ( National Education Association ) honored Chris Sgro for his dedication and many years of work to expand the rights of LGBTQ people with its 2018 Virginia Uribe Award for Creative Leadership in Human Rights, a press release noted. Sgro was among 12 people recognized at the 2018 NEA Human and Civil Rights Awards, which took place July 1 in Minneapolis. Other award recipients include First Lady Michelle Obama, the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance and football quarterback Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp. U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney ( D-N.Y. ) said he tried to buy tampons for his office but was denied permission by the House Administration Committee, Roll Call noted. However, a House Administration spokeswoman said it ""did not send an email or provide any guidance to Rep. Maloney's Office."" According to Maloney ( an openly gay politician who's running for New York attorney general ), his office was told that tampons were ""not an office supply but a personal care item"" and that it would have to pay back $37.16. Bruce Turkel, a Miami advertising executive who had been a frequent guest on Fox News, said in a letter that he will no longer appear on the network because of its coverage of immigration, The Huffington Post noted. ""Quite simply, the position Fox has taken on our government's policy of separating children from their parents is too heinous for me to accept,"" Turkel wrote in an open letter to Fox News. In part, Turkel wrote, ""Separating innocent children from their parents and jailing them is just plain wrong."" Days before the mass shooting in a Maryland newspaper office, controversial openly gay alt-right poster boy Milo Yiannopoulos said he ""can't wait for the vigilante squads to start gunning [down] journalists,"" Gay Star News noted. Yiannopoulos claimed he trolled 'hostile' journalists days before the mass shooting as way of telling them to ""f—k off."" Yiannopoulos said the journalists ( Davis Richardson at the Observer and Will Sommer of The Daily Beast ) should not have made his message public, arguing the onus of the June 28 shootings was on them for making the message public.

His identity was in doubt until tests matched his DNA to a series of sexual assault cases. A link has been sent to your friend's email address. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Surveillance footage from 2009 shows Adrian Cruz, on trial and accused of kidnapping, rape and sexual conduct with a minor, walking out of a Maricopa County Superior Court holding room. Maricopa County Superior Court Eleazar Cruz Colin also Adrian Cruz.(Photo: Phoenix Police Department) First there was Adrian Cruz Hernandez. Then Adrian Gonzalez Cruz. Now there is Eleazar Cruz-Colin. One of them impregnated a 9-year-old girl in 2004. The second raped two women and then escaped custody in 2009. The third was found not guilty of escape in 2016. Last month a Maricopa County Superior Court judge ruled that they are all the same man, and that Cruz, whatever his given name and second family names are, can be sentenced and sent back to prison. It's a story too twisted for fiction. Adrian Cruz Hernandez was a skinny 22-year-old in 2005 when he pleaded guilty to raping his girlfriend's 9-year-old daughter in the ice cream truck he drove. The girl got pregnant and had to have an abortion because she was too young to carry a baby. He was sentenced to life in prison with a chance of release after 35 years. Then in 2008 law enforcement matched his DNA to two earlier sexual assault cases, one of them involving a minor. He went back to trial in 2009, this time a buff 26-year-old who had spent four years pumping iron in prison and who called himself Adrian Gonzalez Cruz. One day during the trial, he was left under-attended in a room in the old East courthouse of the downtown Superior Court complex, and he walked away and disappeared, first into and then in Mexico. The trial continued without him, and the jury found him guilty of three counts of sexual assault, two counts of kidnapping and one count each of sexual abuse and sexual conduct with a minor. The latter would earn him another mandatory life sentence. Even if a suspect can be tried in absentia, he has to be present to be sentenced. It took six years for law enforcement to catch up with Cruz and extradite him back to Arizona. But he had yet another new look and another new name. Eleazar Cruz-Colin, 36, is trim and athletic, with glasses and a goatee. Before prosecutors sentenced him for the 2008 sex charges, they decided to try him for escape. The jury found him not guilty. The court next moved to sentence him on the sex charges. But his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kevin Brady, argued that the sentencing could not go forward under a legal principle called collateral estoppel, which is akin to double jeopardy. You can't undo a ruling in one case over the course of a related case. The man who escaped the courthouse was guilty of rape, Brady reasoned. But Eleazar Cruz-Colin was found not guilty of that escape and therefore was not the man who committed the rapes — unless prosecutors could prove otherwise. That was in August 2017. Nearly a year later, after DNA samples obtained from Cruz-Colin were matched to the 2008 sex-assault DNA, and after fingerprints were taken and retaken and matched to all of the crimes, and over Brady's objections, Superior Court Judge Michael Gordon ruled on June 18, 2018, that Cruz-Colin and Gonzalez Cruz were the same man. Gordon set sentencing for July 18. READ MORE:

John,O'Neil,1176,https://www.journaltribune.com/articles/front-page/oob-man-asking-for-reconsideration-of-life-sentence/,"Today’s E-Edition | | Full Forecast By egotthelf@journaltribune.com | on July 03, 2018 ALFRED — An Old Orchard Beach resident convicted of killing his grandmother is asking for a lesser sentence. Derek Poulin, 29, was sentenced in 2015 to a life sentence for murder and a concurrent 30-year sentence for arson. In Maine, those sentenced to life in prison must serve the full sentence, as there is no parole granted for such a term. In 2015, Poulin was convicted of the murder of his grandmother, 61-year-old Patricia Noel, in her Old Orchard Beach home and setting fire to the house on Oct. 23, 2012. Poulin was 23 years old when he killed his grandmother by beating her with a golf club and stabbing her about 70 times. Poulin and his father lived with Noel at the home. Poulin was described by prosecutors as an unemployed young man more interested in playing video games than a getting a job. According to letters written by Noel, Poulin blew smoke in her face and called her derogatory names, and she wanted him to find a new place to live. In 2016, the Supreme Court denied an appeal by Poulin, who had argued that he did not receive a fair trial in 2015. Poulin is asking the York Count Superior Court to review his case. Paulin’s attorney, Chris Nielsen, stated in court documents filed at York County Superior Court on June 6, that giving a life sentence to Poulin constituted cruel and unusual punishment and is therefor illegal. Nielsen asks in court documents for Poulin’s sentence to be reduced. The attorney argues that the court failed to adequately consider the absence of any prior criminal history as well as Poulin’s young age and his mental health. Assistant Attorney General Donald Macomber responded in court documents dated June 8 since the claim that the sentence was “cruel and unusual” was not raised during the June 2016 appeal, the petition should be dismissed. Macomber says the court did consider Poulin’s lack of criminal history as well as his young age and mental condition, but those factors were outweighed by the “sheer brutality” of the crime as well as other factors including the victim impact and Poulin’s lack of remorse. Poulin is scheduled to appear at York County Superior Court for a one hour oral hearing with Justice John O’Neil at 9 a.m. on July 10. — Staff Writer Liz Gotthelf can be contacted at 282-1535, ext. 325 or egotthelf@journaltribune.com. 6 Digital Drive, Biddeford, Maine 04005 (207) 282-1535 jtcommunity@journaltribune.com Our Hometown DMCA NoticesNewspaper web site content management software and services

Photo courtesy Minnesota Department of Transportation COURTLAND — Crews continue to clear mud and debris from a closed section of Highway 68 between Courtland and New Ulm. A mudslide Sunday afternoon blocked the roadway just west of Blue Earth County Road 45 near Courtland. The section will re-open after Minnesota Department of Transportation has completed the removal of 8 feet of mud and debris and determines the road is safe for motorists to use, said Anne Wolff, MnDOT public affairs coordinator. ""We are monitoring an additional shelf (of earth) above the road to make sure it is stable,"" Wolff said. Drivers should seek alternate routes as the road will remain closed until crews have cleared the area. High river water levels and recent rainfall can cause mudslides without warning, and MnDOT is closely monitoring area roads, Wolff said.

Andrew,Davis,1174,https://ewnews.com/breaking-stephen-die-stubbs-granted-appeal,"The Privy Council has allowed an appeal by convicted murderer Stephen Romel “Die” Stubbs, Andrew Davis and Clinton Evans today according to a statement released to the press by the director of Public Prosecutions. “The matter was remitted to the Court of Appeal for a re-hearing before a differently constituted panel of Justices in the Court of Appeal,” the statement read. Stubbs was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 murder of police constable Jimmy Ambrose at the now-closed Club Rock. Davis, also known as “Yogi”, and Evans, also known as “Russ”, were all charged for the murder. The prosecution sought the death penalty for the three men. They were convicted in 2001 when the death penalty was automatically imposed for murder, however, that conviction and sentence were quashed on appeal in 2004. Stubbs, Davis, and Evans remain in lawful custody at the Bahamas Department of Corrections (BDOC).

Steve,Cummings,1173,http://www.wirralglobe.co.uk/news/16327234.cycling-champion-steve-cummings-welcomes-return-of-leverhulme-grand-prix/,"Wirral 22°c WIRRAL Olympian Steve Cummings has welcomed the return of top-class professional cycling to Birkenhead Park later this month. Taking place in the iconic venue on July 22, The Leverhulme Grand Prix will see more than 100 cyclists compete in a series of races. Apart from the elite racing, there will be races to suit a range of different levels as well as events for women and juniors. It will be the first time Wirral has hosted such a racing event in over half a century. Looking forward to its return, Steve, a former Olympic and Commonwealth Games medallist, said: ""I remember there being many races in Birkenhead Park when I was growing up. ""There was always a good presence of riders and spectators who enjoyed the racing and the social aspect. ""Birkenhead Park was part of my racing education and I'm very grateful to all of the people who have supported the races over the years. ""It is important for our local cycling community. ""Birkenhead Park has a fantastic cycling history. ""I wish all the riders taking part in the Leverhulme Grand Prix the best of luck and hope that they have a great day.” Steve won gold in the team pursuit at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, following silver two years earlier at the Olympic Games in Athens. Other major honours include the Tour of Britain in 2016 and stage wins in the Tour de France and Vuelta (Tour of Spain). The 37-year-old developed his cycling ability while a member of Birkenhead North End Cycling Club, one of the organisers of the Leverhulme Grand Prix. Almost 100 cyclists have now signed up for the event. In addition to the elite men, there will be a number of other races including The Bike Factory Criterium, the FUEL10K Women’s Open, the Bikeline Youth Series and British Cycling national series paracycling. Food and drink on the day will be provided by Willow Catering with other stands including British Cycling, Cycling UK, Birkenhead North End Cycling Club, Merseyside Police, Visit Wirral and The Hive. The event is the brainchild of Pedalare, a Wirral organisation that promotes cycling as a healthy leisure pursuit. Leverhulme Estates agreed to come on board as Principal Sponsor. Race headquarters will be Birkenhead Park Rugby Club and the races will start and finish in the Upper Park from 9.30-4.30. There is a total prize fund of over £2,500. Andy Mills, a Director of Pedalare, said: “It is great to have the endorsement of one of the region’s best current cyclists. He has a particularly close bond with the park having ridden as a junior for Birkenhead North End Cycling Club. “We continue to receive terrific support for the July 22 event, but there is still time for more cyclists and stall-holders to get involved.” For more details, visit www.pedalare.co.uk Get involved with the news in your community This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Joe Minicozzi discussed why investing in downtowns and density is a wise move for cities Monday at CivicCon Brandon Girod/cgirod@pnj.com Andrew Davis(Photo: Photo Special to PNJ)Buy Photo Here's a question: If you wanted to become a famous actor, where do you think you would have the best shot at success? More than likely, you thought to yourself, ""Hollywood."" But why is that? There are acting gigs to be found in New York City, New Orleans, Austin, Miami, occasionally even here in humble Pensacola. As a matter of fact, the state of Georgia now outpaces California in the number of films it produces. So why is it that Hollywood is still considered to be ""the movie capital of the world"" in the hearts and minds of most people? Because, as Andrew Davis would phrase it, Hollywood has ""staked a claim,"" intentionally making itself so synonymous with an industry or lifestyle that people are convinced it is the one and only place they need to be in order to thrive. ""It's location envy, just this simple idea and emotional belief you’ll be more successful in that place than you’ll be anyplace else in the world,"" said Davis, a bestselling author and keynote speaker. ""If you want to be successful in country music, everyone says move to Nashville. No one says go to Atlanta. You don’t need any stats to convince you of this. You just believe this."" Davis travels the country teaching business leaders how to ""grow their businesses, transform their cities and leave their legacy,"" and he teaches that staking a claim is a crucial step to being successful. Davis will be in Pensacola on July 16 discussing how it's done as part of CivicCon. More: Pensacola CivicCon offers a perfect 10 in speaker Joe Minicozzi CivicCon is a joint project of the News Journal and the Studer Community Institute to promote conversations about how we can use smart planning and civic engagement to make the Pensacola area a better place to live, grow, work and invest. And for a city like Pensacola to thrive, it needs to do something to set itself apart from everywhere else, according to Davis. Davis learned that lesson over the course of several years traveling the country giving presentations about marketing. What is CivicCon? ""I started to realize some of the cities and towns I was visiting seemed very, very successful,"" Davis said. ""The economy seemed to be growing, the energy seemed to be very positive, there was no parking downtown, you could just feel these cities were doing great. You'd drive 15 minutes down the road to another city of a similar size and they'd have the complete opposite. They were struggling to get by, the downtowns were empty, there were a lot of empty and old factories."" Davis eventually realized the difference maker was that successful towns had staked a claim. In a phone interview Wednesday, he used a little town called Warsaw, Indiana, as an example. Warsaw is a picturesque lake town with a population of less than 15,000 people. It probably wouldn't be particularly notable except for one thing: Warsaw is the orthopedic capital of the world. It began with just one highly successful orthopedic company, but the town began marketing to orthopedic businesses that it had a trained workforce, a dependable supply chain and a history of innovation. Now, three of the seven largest orthopedic companies in the world are headquartered there, and there are dozens of other smaller startup businesses, suppliers and research companies. With every new business that comes to the area, it's easier to attract the next one. Warsaw-based orthopedic companies now represent 50 percent of the world’s joint reconstruction market and the annual revenue generated by the region’s orthopedic companies is about $17 billion. Davis said that like Warsaw, every town should give people specific reasons why they should live there. ""An effort to attract everyone will inspire no one,"" according to Davis. More: Watch: Ed McMahon speaks about preserving what makes Pensacola special He said here in Pensacola, our task should be figuring out why people shouldn't just want to live here, but need to live here. What specific niche do we fill best, what assets and resources do we possess that no one else does? ""Why are you in Pensacola,"" he asked rhetorically. ""We live in a world where you can work from anywhere. So ask yourself, why are you here?"" Once you have your answer use it to create location envy. Stake a claim. ""Anytime you travel, you want to use the things you really think are unique and express that to other people,"" Davis said. ""The picture you paint really stays in people's mind."" Davis will dive deep into how origin stories create location-envy, why building on existing success stories is the fastest path to growth and how to inspire people to live in places they never imagined during his presentation 6-7:30 p.m. July 16 at the REX Theatre, 18 N. Palafox St., in downtown Pensacola. The event is free and open to the public. Registration is available by searching CivicCon at eventbrite.com.

Andrew,Davis,1172,http://www.eveningtribune.com/sports/20180702/stronghornell-handles-heatstrong,"HORNELL — The sun gave its best effort in reaching 90-degree temperatures, but the 11-12 year old Hornell Little League All-Stars bats were the hottest part of the day as they caught fire in the later innings of Saturday’s game to defeat Corning/Painted Post in a 7-4 ballgame at the Smith-Gleason Memorial Field in Hornell. Despite the game being held in Hornell, the hosts were technically the away team, meaning they would have to bat in the top half of each inning. And after CPP took a 1-0 lead after the first inning, Hornell went right to work in the top of the second in tying the game. Jared Ainsworth got things rolling with a base hit up the middle, and was joined on the base paths moments later when Brayden Vaughn walked. Dan Barrett then ripped a hard shot to first base, which was cleanly fielded to get Barrett out, but in a double play attempt, a throwing error at third base allowing Ainsworth to easily make it home. After CPP scored two more runs in the bottom of the third, Hornell once again responded immediately in the top of the fourth, and this time it took the lead for good. Jake Ponticello started things off when he walked and stole second base. An RBI base hit from Ainsworth brought home Ponticello. Andrew Davis was brought in to pinch-run for Ainsworth, and it paid off as the speedy Davis flew around the base paths on an RBI double from Breydon Drew to tie the game at 3-3. Then with two outs, Kurt Carrier put a perfectly placed ball into right field that allowed Drew to score and give Hornell its first lead of the game at 4-3. After an infield single from Gates Miller moved Carrier to third, he scored moments later on a passed ball to Hornell the 5-3 lead. Corning/Painted Post scored one in the home half of the frame, but Ponticello quickly gave Hornell the two-run lead back when he crushed a monster home run over the right field fence. Hornell added one more insurance run in the seventh inning as Gates Miller started things off with a single. Shawn Rose then blasted a line drive into right field for a triple that easily scored Miller and brought the score to its 7-4 final. Ponticello got the start on the hill for Hornell, and he battled through six innings of work in order to get the win. Brayden Vaughn came in for the sixth and final inning, picking up the save as he recorded three consecutive outs to end the game. The 11-12 year old All-Stars are back in action Monday night at 6 p.m. when Big Flats comes to town. Choose the plan that's right for you.

( Remember those? ) Even the menus come in vinyl-record sleeves. Second, Optima has menu offerings that fit the vibeand they mostly succeed. There's even a little attitude with dishes like Yesterday's Soup, which comes with the description ""Whatever we want."" Shareable appetizers include the Optima V ( which I still don't know is pronounced like ""five"" or ""vee"" )but it's a more-than-satisfying selection of meats, cheese and accountrements. And the pretzels and cheese ( housemade pretzels with fontina fonduta and porter beer mustard ) is practically addictive. As for the sandwiches, the double cheeeseburger is definitely a step or six above what you might get at most of the fast-food chains. ( Vegetarians can get an Impossible Burger if they wish. ) However, the intriguingly named Morning, Noon & Night ( toasted ciabatta, giardiniera, avocado, lettuce, tomato, ham, fried egg and Swiss ) should lose a couple ingredients; maybe ""Morning & Noon"" would be enough. But Ma's Meatloaf ( a spectacular dish ) more than made up for the second sandwich. Dessert ( a trio of ice creams ) was pretty impressiveeven if it was our only choice because the spot was out of the other two choices. I hope that's not the case the next time I visit. By the way, the restaurant's name comes from the word ""optimum,"" meaning to get most out of an experience. I don't know if Optima reaches that rung necessarily, but for a casual spot, it's pretty close. ( BTW, Optima now has weekend brunch ( 10 a.m.-3 p.m. ), with items like avocado toast, chicken-and-waffles Benedict, savory French toast and cinnamon rolls. Rock on! ) Booth One A few blocks away from Optima is Booth One ( 1301 N. State Pkwy.; boothone.com/ )the space formerly known as the esteemed Pump Room. There's definitely a more upscale atmosphere here, down to the sweeping curtains and weekend brunch items. ( It's open for breakfast through dinner the rest of the week as well. ) There are some standard brunch itemsbut with this spot, there are certainly some elevated dishes. Even the egg sandwiches have variations such as smoked turkey ( with fried egg, avocado and harissa ). However, the caramel monkey bread is a must-try. And I'd definitely return just for the black truffle scrambled eggs, which are just as delectable as they sound. The only drawback for some might be the prices; after all, Booth One is a Gold Coast hotel. Yang's Imperial lobster toast ( which I didn't try ) is $28.95, the aforementioned scrambled eggs are $24.95 and even the monkey bread is $8.95. And, yes, there is a Booth One in the spotand although Beyonce could sit there, you and I would have to just gaze and sigh. I do recommend Booth One; just be advised that the prices are not on par with a lot of restaurantsalthough the quality is above the bar as well.

Gold Coast ruined the anticipated Leichhardt comeback of former captain Robbie Farah with a 30-12 win over the Wests Tigers. Scores were locked at 12-12 after almost an hour on Sunday when Titans fullback Michael Gordon gave his side the lead with a penalty goal. Tries to AJ Brimson and Anthony Don in the final 20 minutes silenced a sellout crowd that had hoped to celebrate the emotional return of Farah and injection of fellow mid-season signing Moses Mbye. And despite a late mini-break by Farah that got the sellout crowd of 16,984 into a frenzy, many of them walked out early as the Titans joined the Tigers on 14 points - six adrift of the top eight. READ MORE: * Ponga learns Origin fate * Cronk, Smith's icy exchange * Warriors won't dwell on defeat The defeat for the early-season surprise packets, who also had five-eighth Josh Reynolds battling a shoulder injury for most of the match, extends their losing streak to four. Almost 700 days after Farah farewelled the Tigers faithful by drinking beers while sitting on the ground's famous scoreboard, the veteran turned back the clock with a vintage performance. Three times the former NSW State of Origin captain broke into the backfield, and finished the afternoon with three tackle busts, two offloads and a try assist. Mbye also impressed with a team-high 158 metres and six tackle busts, but it wasn't enough as a gritty Titans outfit went toe-to-toe before coming through in the clutch. Titans forward Jai Arrow, who was arguably his team's best, sealed the win with a 78th minute try. Farah was intent on delivering on his return to the club from the kickoff, making two of the first three tackles and playing a hand in what should've been an early try to Corey Thompson. Instead it was another veteran Tiger in Chris Lawrence who kick-started the scoring when he sent Kevin Naiqama on a 60-metre dash to the line, only for Ryan James to respond under the posts minutes later. The locals roared again when Reynolds finished off another long-range try off a Farah break, but the visitors again hit back through Ash Taylor to keep scores locked at halftime. Tigers forward Michael Chee Kam was on report for a first-half crusher tackle on Dale Copley. - AAP Unqualified Kiwi woman who practised psychiatry in UK for 22 years sparks review Black Caps captain Kane Williamson hails 'one of our best' wins Driver who allegedly fled scene of fatal crash charged with manslaughter Fletcher Building forecasts 2019 half year earnings to fall by 10 per cent Abortion: Separating the facts from the fiction Lack of signage to blame for poaching at Auckland marine reserve, residents say Marae pushes back against fast food culture with fish head offerings Debut director explores culture and identity Fridges, furniture, toilet, mattresses, all dumped outside ex Red Cross charity store No miscarriage of justice for beach rapist Police still treating Porirua three-month-old baby's death as 'unexplained' Medium-sized scrub fire on Te Mata Peak Wellingtonians to pay $16.7m to strengthen historic St James Theatre Schoolgirls crammed in like 'sardines' on Auckland school bus Woman sentenced for online posts that outed sex worker to her family How did that happen?

Phillip,Frost,1169,https://www.enca.com/south-africa/csir-pinpoints-cause-of-devastating-knysna-fires,"Fire in the Knysna area are now under control. Knysna Municipality Fire in the Knysna area are now under control. Knysna Municipality Fire in the Knysna area are now under control. Knysna Municipality Fire in the Knysna area are now under control. Knysna Municipality KNYSNA - Phillip Frost from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) says drone data has helped explain the deadly Knysna fires that killed at least seven people and destroyed hundreds of homes last year. The fires affected almost the entire town, which is some 400-kilometres from Cape Town. According to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, dry and windy conditions resulted in the flare-up of the fire at Elandskraal, northwest of the small town. Frost says: “We were able to detect a positive lightning strike on the 22nd of March, 2017. It fell right between two satellite overpasses between the 19th and 29th of March. We were able to detect vegetation normally, which showed that vegetation was starting to die after that lightning strike. And from there we were able to use satellite to actually detect the growth of this smouldering fire, which was an underground fire probably, caused by this lightning strike.” The Western Cape’s unprecedented drought also contributed to the devastating blaze. READ: Knysna declared a disaster area “The problem with these disasters and this is the type of a hundred years event, is you’ve got a combination of a number of factors such as the worst drought in a hundred years, the worst storm in thirty years. All of these factors together, plus people living in an urban wildland interface, has created this scenario, unfortunately, where a lightning strike occurring on a north-facing slope in a drought situation creates an underground fire. The fire spreads into the root system and starts spreading slowly, day by day.” As the town marks one year since the deadly Garden Route fire, residents are still picking up the pieces and rebuilding their lives. The fire destroyed hundreds of formal and informal homes. Businesses also took a hit and are still recovering. View the discussion thread. © 2018 eNews Channel Africa , an eMedia Holdings company.

Steve,Cummings,1168,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-5905947/Cavendish-massively-motivated-maintain-Tour-love-affair.html,"By Press Association Published: 07:04 EST, 1 July 2018 | Updated: 07:05 EST, 1 July 2018 Team Dimension Data are looking to Mark Cavendish and the Tour de France to turn around what manager Doug Ryder admits has been a “terrible” season so far. The African-based squad find themselves dead last in the WorldTour rankings in a campaign wrecked by injuries and illnesses. Ryder had high hopes for 2018 after beefing up the roster with the likes of Louis Meintjes, Tom-Jelte Slagter and Julien Vermote, but it is yet to pay off. 🇫🇷#TDF2018 Here is what will await the riders next summer. How do you like the course? We are already excited! 🖐 pic.twitter.com/RkaK86WQrL “Every year we have moved forward in terms of quality in line with our goals, but we’ve had such a terrible season,” Ryder told Press Association Sport. “Now when I go to races the other team managers come and put their arm around me and say, ‘Doug, we’re so sorry’, because people love our team, we all need to thrive together. “Other teams are feeling for us in terms of the shocking luck and incidents that have happened.” It is a long list. Illness and a string of crashes – some spectacular, some farcical – have limited Cavendish to two wins since the start of 2017. Experienced road captain Bernhard Eisel needed emergency brain surgery following a crash at Tirreno-Adriatico and Edvald Boasson Hagen had his gallbladder removed. Health Update: @EiselBernhard Eisel undergoes successful surgical decompression of a chronic subdural haematoma on the brain.Full Update: https://t.co/ngQHhlwuQ8 pic.twitter.com/SYNLYRHkJX After Meintjes was forced out by illness, Australian Ben O’Connor looked poised to save the team’s Giro d’Italia only to crash out on stage 19 while leading the young riders’ classification. Vermote, Steve Cummings, Reinardt Janse van Rensburg, Mekseb Debesay, Nic Dougall, and Scott Thwaites have also been sidelined during a wretched first half of the year. Plenty of reason for them to feel sorry for themselves then, but Ryder says his team’s unique purpose within the WorldTour helps them keep perspective – Dimension Data race for the Qhubeka charity, which distributes bikes in South Africa to improve access to education and employment. Incredible to have the support of @TeamDiData for @Qhubeka. The team races all over the world raising funds for over 5 000 bicycles to change lives in South Africa.#BicyclesChangeLives 🖐🏽📷 @ZoonCronje for @ZCMCSocial pic.twitter.com/JgLYP1UwJY “Every single day when times are tough and things go wrong, you sit in the team bus and you look at a bunch of depressed guys. But after an hour of sadness the guys are thinking this team is about more than us,” he said. “We’ve got an opportunity to stand up and do something that will benefit so many others.” Cavendish, and the global spotlight of the Tour, could provide the chance to do just that. Can honestly say this is the most beautiful way I’ve ever found out which teammates & I have been selected for @LeTour. These incredible touches are what make @TeamDiData such a special team. Delighted to be part of it & proud we can race for a bigger purpose #BicyclesChangeLives https://t.co/3HMhPsNYrx The Manxman’s form is uncertain after a string of crashes this year, but the Tour – a race in which he is four stage wins short of Eddy Merckx’s all-time record of 34 – has so often been the place for him to shine. “The Tour de France is a race that defined him and got him going on his incredible career to this point,” Ryder said. “The interest around him, the 100 per cent commitment of the team, it gives him massive motivation.” Dimension Data announced their squad for the Tour with a video featuring students from Lofentse Girls High, a school in Orlando East, Soweto, who recently received bikes from Qhubeka. The video was another reminder of the team’s purpose, which Ryder believes gives Cavendish another edge on the bike – and another reason why he has reached an agreement in principle to sign a new contract beyond this season. 2017 Tour de France - Stage 7 - Troyes - Nuits-Saint-Georges “Mark is an incredible human being and this stuff resonates so deeply with him,” he said. “That’s when magic happens.” The Tour has given Ryder’s team the biggest moments in their history to date – Cummings’ Mandela Day stage win in 2015 and Cavendish’s opening stage win in 2016 to take the yellow jersey. Can it deliver again? “We’ve had magic happen to us,” he said. “Steve winning on Mandela Day, how amazing was that? Mark wearing the yellow jersey for the first time in 10 Tour starts, something he had been trying to do how many times? And it happened with us. “Cool stuff happens when you connect passion and dedicated individuals and partners. Let’s hope there’s some more magic in July.” Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Andrew,Davis,1167,https://www.sunlive.co.nz/news/183171-burlings-americas-cup-efforts-backed-toyota.html,"Tuesday, November 20, 2018 Posted: 1:29pm Saturday 30 Jun, 2018 Peter Burling will have Toyota at his back as he defends the Auld Mug in 2021 One year on from Peter Burling’s electrifying America’s Cup triumph at the helm of Team New Zealand in Bermuda another of the team’s longstanding family of sponsors has climbed back on board. Toyota New Zealand have announced their continued support for Emirates Team New Zealand for the 2021 defence campaign in the waters of Auckland’s Hauraki Gulf. The 36th America’s Cup will be the Toyota’s eighth as a supporter of Kiwi quests for the Auld Mug, making it the longest continuous sports sponsorship in the country. “We’ve been proud and honoured to stick with the team through thick and thin,” says Andrew Davis, General Manager of Marketing for Toyota New Zealand. “The team’s philosophy of imagination, experimentation and innovation was the winning ingredient in Bermuda last year and represents what we stand for as a company and a country.” Toyota’s announcement follows Television New Zealand’s decision to return to the fold earlier this month. “We are really proud to have Toyota back on board with the team again,” says Emirates Team New Zealand CEO, Grant Dalton. “They have been a staunch supporter of the team for over 25 years now since the 1992 campaign. We have grown together and Toyota is very much part of our DNA.” Toyota first joined an America’s Cup campaign in 1992 and was involved in Black Magic’s victory in 1995 and successful defence in 2000. It has also stayed with the team in darker times when the trophy went to Switzerland in 2003 and the challenges in 2007 and 2013.

Michael,Gordon,1166,http://leagueunlimited.com/news/32083-wests-tigers-v-titans-preview/,"Round 24 Round 24 Round 24 Round 24 Round 20 Round 20 Round 24 Round 20 Moses Mbye and Robbie Farah, formerly of the Canterbury Bulldogs and South Sydney Rabbitohs respectively, will make their first appearance in the orange, black and white this season and shake up an already puzzled spine combination. With Mbye at fullback and Farah at hooker, they are tasked to sync with Luke Brooks and the returning Josh Reynolds. Reynolds has had an injury interrupted debut season with the Tigers, but is named to return for this clash and yet to play his best football. The Tigers have lost seven of their last nine matches and were thoroughly beaten 48-12 by the Canberra Raiders at Campbelltown Stadium in their last match. From being surprisingly comfortable in the top four after six rounds, they're now in 10th spot and closer to what the public expectation has been. They've looked a tired team of late, what was a formidable defence in the opening rounds is leaking points. Inspirational centre Mahe Fonua will be missed as he's recovering from a broken arm. A big win for the Titans against the Bulldogs has brought positivity and optimism that missing the finals isn't a foregone conclusion. With coach Garth Brennan playing some of his highest paid players week-after-week in reserve grade, it's been an achievement to be placed higher than five other NRL teams on the ladder at this point in the season. Two more wins from their remaining 10 matches would see the club equal their 2017 season win tally. After this game three of their next four matches are against top eight teams, this makes victory essential on Sunday. Jarrod Wallace returns from Origin and suspension to bolster the forwards. Their best performers, primed for a big game, have been captain Ryan James and Jarryd Hayne's replacement Michael Gordon. James has been snubbed from State of Origin twice this season, toyed with by the Blues over the years, yet to debut in that competition and doesn't let the disappointment show on the field. Scoring three tries in his last two games must make it easier to gloss over. Only a handful of players in the NRL outwork James. Gordon at 34 years of age is yet to slow down and produced a man of the match performance against the Bulldogs in round 15, accumulating four line breaks. He gets another chance to attack his opposite number from that match, Moses Mbye. Last meeting: Round 21 2017 - Titans 4 Wests Tigers 26 The blowout loss for Gold Coast was the first time the Wests Tigers defeated the Titans since Round 1 2015, a 19-18 win sealed by a Pat Richards field goal in the 80th minute. Who to watch: What Ivan Cleary will be asking of Moses Mbye can't be much different to Dean Pay's ideas at the Bulldogs. Mbye's been a bright spot in what's proven to be a dull Canterbury season. His attacking instinct and running with the football could be the difference in this match. The last match he played was a loss to the Titans, the keys to victory should be fresh in his mind. While this year's State of Origin victor has been decided, the opportunity still exists for Ash Taylor to play himself into the Queensland side for game three. It may not be for the halfback jersey, because Kevin Walters has dismissed some of the heavy criticism aimed at Ben Hunt, but to be the next halfback in line and possibly 18th or 19th man for the Maroons should be a goal of his. The favourite: Tipsters are ignoring form as the Tigers are heavily favoured to shut down the Titans. The return of club legend Robbie Farah and the expected impact of Moses Mbye, coupled with the difficulty away sides experience playing at Leichardt Oval has convinced many. Gold Coast has only achieved a back-to-back win once this season and they are in need of stringing wins together as their chance at the finals depends on it. My tip: The home side has reason to be nervous. With a loss they risk falling potentially six competition points away from the top eight and level with the Titans depending on other results. Expect a recharged Tigers outfit not defensively solid because of new combinations, but with enough attack and home crowd support to get the job done. The Titans have continuity in their top 17 and firing forwards, but the weakness of the backline will cost them. Tigers by 4. 1. Moses Mbye 2. Malakai Watene-Zelezniak 3. Esan Marsters 4.

Steve,Cummings,1165,https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sport/cycling/clancy-faces-fierce-competition-for-national-title-1-9229072,"The quest to join some of the titans of British cycling as winners of their national road race takes place in Northumberland tomorrow. Some of the finest exponents of their art have worn the coveted national jersey after triumphing in the British road race championships and there is no shortage of riders lining up to challenge for the honour once more. Of all the titles and accolades Ed Clancy has won in his time, a national road gold medal would rank right up there given his propensity for the track. For ever a secondary interest, the 33-year-old has enjoyed rare success on the road this year, winning in World Tour company in Australia at the beginning of the year, and on the OVO Energy Tour last month. Competing against road lumninaries like Mark Cavendish, Geraint Thomas and defending champion Steve Cummings might have proven beyond him in recent years but the form he has shown makes him an outsider worth considering over the 185.6km circuit. Other Yorkshire interest lies in Adam Blythe of Sheffield, whose victory over Cavendish to win this title two years ago remains his career highlight. Rotherham’s Ben Swift, meanwhile, has been on the podium before but never the top step. There is no defending champion in the women’s race – four-time winner Lizzie Deignan is pregnant – but no shortage of quality contenders. The 2016 champion Hannah Barnes will be among the favourites to regain her title, while Dani Rowe will be targeting the national champion’s jersey following her impressive third place finish at the recent OVO Energy Women’s Tour and second place at the Tour de Yorkshire. Great Britain’s most decorated female Paralympian, Dame Sarah Storey, and Olympic and Commonwealth track champion Elinor Barker will also be seeking a podium finish, as will Alice Barnes, who finished second behind her sister in 2016. “The strength-in-depth in women’s domestic racing bodes really well for the future, and it’ll be interesting to see who takes my title this weekend,” said Yorkshire’s Deignan. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

John,O'Neil,1163,http://ideastations.org/radio/news/virginia-teachers-union-not-affected-supreme-court-decision,"A Supreme Court decision this week outlawed public sector unions – including those representing educators – from mandating what’s called an agency fee. Virginia’s teacher union, the Virginia Education Association, has responded. Across the U.S., teacher unions in 22 states take part in what’s called collective bargaining – requiring payment from both members and non-members. But Virginia isn’t one of them. “In Virginia, our professional association has always been voluntary,” said John O’Neil with Virginia’s Education Association. A 1977 ruling by Virginia’s Supreme Court outlawed collective bargaining altogether for public employees in the Commonwealth. That means the recent U.S. Supreme Court judgment won’t have an operational or legal impact in the Commonwealth. But O’Neil says it’ll push unions in other states to take a more aggressive approach in convincing people to join unions.

Photo by Pat Christman A sinkhole opened up along the northbound lanes of Highway 169 near the Veterans Memorial Bridge Thursday. Photo by Pat Christman The sinkhole caused the closure of one lane of northbound Highway 169 Thursday. Photo by Pat Christman MnDOT workers examine a sinkhole that opened up along the northbound lanes of Highway 169 near the Veterans Memorial Bridge Thursday. Photo by Pat Christman MANKATO — A lane of northbound Highway 169 has been closed after a sinkhole formed near the Veterans Memorial Bridge. While the hole is at the base of a highway off-ramp that serves as part of the North Mankato flood-control levee, officials are not concerned that the levee has been weakened. ""We're taking the situation seriously, but we don't think there's any imminent danger to the flood-control system,"" said Jed Falgren, maintenance engineer for the Minnesota Department of Transportation. MnDOT, which announced the problem just before 3 p.m. Thursday, is exploring repair options with North Mankato and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the designers of the flood control system. The sinkhole formed beneath a storm sewer grate, causing a six-foot section of concrete to drop about a foot, but it did not grow in size after the initial collapse, Falgren said. The Army Corps' emergency response office was contacted, and engineers there were reassured by the fact that the hole was not growing and had not reached the slope leading to the off-ramp that doubles as the top of the levee between the Minnesota River and lower North Mankato. After several drenching June rains, the river has been at ""minor flood stage"" since Sunday and is expected to remain above flood stage until later Friday or Saturday. ""Right now, they don't have any concern about the integrity of the flood-control system,"" Falgren said of the Corps of Engineers. ""If it grew and moved into the ramp, they'd be more concerned. ... We'll monitor it overnight."" A sinkhole opened up along the northbound lanes of Highway 169 near the Veterans Memorial Bridge Thursday. Photo by Pat Christman The storm sewer grate at the site of the sinkhole is located at the base of the bridge that carries Belgrade Avenue over the northbound lanes of Highway 169. More than a dozen grates are in the area to drain a low point in the highway, each grate draining into a large concrete cylinder, which also collects subsurface drainage from the highway's foundation. The collected water moves from the base of each cylinder through a pipe that ultimately is discharged into the Minnesota River about 650 feet to the northeast. Because the river is currently so high, the drainage water has to be elevated by a pump station over the flood levee. MnDOT believes movement of underground water eroded a cavity beneath the northernmost of the concrete cylinders at some point in the past. The currently saturated soils and high ground water apparently caused the cylinder to drop down into the cavity. MnDOT engineers were examining the cavity with flashlights, and a MnDOT truck was driven over the affected lane — which held up to the weight — at about 3:30 p.m. Crews also stacked sandbags around the next sewer grate to the south in an apparent effort to keep any drainage from future rains from entering that part of the drainage system. ""Any rain right now is something we'd obviously prefer not to see,"" he said. The sinkhole caused the closure of one lane of northbound Highway 169 Thursday. Photo by Pat Christman If the sinkhole continues to be stable, the traffic lane might eventually be reopened with only the shoulder remaining closed. MnDOT will not be rushing repairs to the section of road, preferring to avoid moving earth so close to the flood control system when river levels are so high, Falgren said. North Mankato is being similarly cautious in tackling a sinkhole affecting a sewer line further downstream. ""Both of us are reacting very cautiously about moving any material until the river goes down,"" he said. ""It just makes sense. Let's not tease Mother Nature too much."" Motorists on Highway 169 are asked to drive with caution and watch for workers, equipment and traffic control devices in the affected area.

(Submitted photo) Edina Community Editor Unfurling an Alzheimer’s Association flag, Andrew Davis of Edina poses atop Denali, the highest peak in North America. For the past four years, Davis has climbed a different mountain in memory of his father, who died from dementia in 2014. (Submitted photo) Every year on the summer solstice, the Alzheimer’s Association encourages people to pursue an activity that they love to create awareness and raise funds in the fight against dementia. Some people golf. Some people play bridge. Andrew Davis climbs mountains. “This is my fourth year I’ve climbed a mountain in association with The Longest Day,” the Edina resident said, referring to the Alzheimer’s Association event. Davis summited Alaska’s Denali, the highest peak in North America, on June 5, a preamble to the June 21 summer solstice. It makes sense for Davis to mark the day by climbing mountains, since that’s one of his passions, but the activity is also appropriate because it was his father, Woods Davis, who introduced him to the outdoors growing up on the edge of the Boundary Waters in Ely, Minnesota, where the family owned a canoe outfitting business. “I sort of fell in love with the outdoors growing up as a kid, and I credit my dad,” Davis said. In 2014 at the age of 77, Woods Davis died from frontotemporal dementia, which causes the degeneration of part of the brain. “I’m trying to give back to him,” Davis said. But it’s not just his dad. His father’s older sister recently died from Alzheimer’s. Davis is motivated by his family’s connection to the disease, but also by the ravages the disease is expected to bring to an aging population. “It’s only going to increase. That’s the scary thing,” he said.“It’s going to be a tsunami of memory loss,” not to mention Alzheimer’s being a “death sentence of a diagnosis.” Andrew Davis and his father, Woods Davis, pose with the rest of their family, in what would become the last picture taken of the whole family before the death of the patriarch. From left: Ben Davis, Woody Davis, Elizabeth Davis, Woods Davis, Mary Jane Davis and Andrew Davis. (Submitted photo) Davis knows all too well what it’s like to watch that play out. “They just slowly lose contact with who they once were, and there’s just nothing you can do about it,” he said. As for his father, “I don’t know if he recognized who I was, so that was hard,” Davis said. “The experience was awful. He had a very aggressive form of dementia. … It was basically about three years from diagnosis to death.” A health care executive at the time of his father’s passing, Davis has become heavily involved in the Alzheimer’s Association as a board member for the organization’s Minnesota-North Dakota chapter. “He got the disease, and I was like, I can sit back and be a victim, or I can stand up and try to fight,” Davis said. He works to raise funds for research, but also advocates for services and legislation that supports victims of dementia and their caregivers. In that mission, Davis first summited a 10,000-foot peak outside of Provo, Utah, with his wife, Kristin. The peaks grew taller from there. The next year, he defeated a 26,000-foot peak in the Himalayas, followed by a 21,000-foot summit in Bolivia. On his expeditions, Davis always carries an American flag, a Minnesota Vikings flag and an Alzheimer’s Association flag, along with the memory of his father. While climbing, the matter at hand typically requires all his focus, but the emotions break through when he arrives at the top. “This is the third year in a row that I lost it emotionally,” Davis said of his Denali summit. “I carried my dad with me the whole time. I carried my wife with me, my mom, my siblings, my friends.” Davis, currently working as a consultant, is writing a book about leadership inspired by his mountaineering experience, but climbing is just his latest pursuit as an endurance athlete. As an ultra-marathoner, he grew accustomed to running 100 miles at a time, and he warmed up for that challenge by taking on the grueling Ironman triathlon. “You can kind of see the progression there,” he said. Having progressed to mountain climbing, Davis said every attempt has resulted in a successful summit – a notable feat, considering the odds. Climbers of Denali, for example, enjoy about a 50 percent success rate, he noted. For his run of triumphant climbs, he credited favorable weather conditions and a dose of fortune. “I’d like to thank the Alzheimer’s Association for all the good luck I’ve had,” Davis said. – Follow Andrew Wig on Twitter @EdinaSunCurrent Copyright © 2018 at Sun Newspapers/ APG Media of East Central Minnesota.

Bob,Diamond,1153,https://news.efinancialcareers.com/au-en/318535/bob-diamond-panmure-gordon-kepler-cheuvreux,"by Sarah Butcher 28 June 2018 Bob Diamond is a busy man. After taking over loss-making British stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon in March 2017, the former CEO of Barclays this week invested in Kepler Cheuvreux, a French brokerage firm created from the combination of the former equity brokerage arms of Crédit Agricole, Julius Baer, UniCredit, Dexia, Swedbank and Rabobank. Diamond now owns 27.7% of Kepler Cheuvreux in a deal funded by his Atlas Merchant Capital investment vehicle and by Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies. - He's up to something. That something may well involve expanding his new mid-cap empire. Diamond's hiring intentions at Panmure are well known. In April, the British bank hired Bill Dale, formerly head of research at Nomura, to expand its coverage of small and mid-cap companies in the UK. In May, Panmure also let it be known that it plans to double its UK headcount as it pushes into corporate finance. What's less well known is that there's been quite a lot of hiring at Panmure already. Analysis of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register suggests that the number of registered employees at Panmure has risen 17% since Diamond took the helm 15 months ago. Following the addition of 13 people, Panmure Gordon now has 88 UK registered employees in total. Recent additions include Emma Earl as a director in corporate finance (formerly of Cairn Financial Advisors), Charles Lesser as head of natural resources banking (formerly of Macquarie), Matthew Webb as an equity researcher covering food and beverages (also formerly of Macquarie), and Sandra Bjorck as an associate in the investment bank. There have also been a handful of exits, including Duncan Monteith, a healthcare banker who went to Numis, and Mark McGuinness, a sales trader who left in February 2018 and has yet to resurface. Even so, the direction of travel is clear. Not everyone at Kepler Cheuvreux is enamoured of their new part-owner. ""Everything in the press concerning us is now about Bob Diamond,"" says one senior employee at the French firm. ""But he is just one of several shareholders and doesn't have the controlling vote. Our aspirations are much bigger than Bob."" Laurent Quirin, chairman of Kepler's advisory board, said Diamond's investment will help the brokerage expand globally in an environment where MiFID II and bank disintermediation are creating opportunities. Kepler's traditional method of growth has been to create alliances with banks looking to outsource business areas, although Quirin said there may be organic growth too. Some market observers have suggested that Diamond could look to combine Panmure and Kepler - a move which could lead to layoffs in London, where both firms have equity brokerage staff. The insiders we spoke to suggested this is unlikely, however. ""This is just about growth,"" said one. ""Kepler is looking for expansion opportunities both internally and through external alliances."" Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you’d like to share?

Ex-Barclays CEO Bob Diamond’s investment vehicle Atlas Merchant Capital and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild’s equity strategy arm have acquired stakes in French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux. Atlas acquired a 19.7% stake in Kepler Cheuvreux, while Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies (ERES) acquired an interest of 8%. Purchase prices were not revealed. Last year, Atlas partnered Qatari investment firm Qinvest to buy UK-based stockbroker Panmure Gordon. Atlas managing director and head of UK and European business Matthew Hansen said: “The decision to invest in Kepler Cheuvreux was based on an analysis of their market leading positions in pan-European Research, Advisory and Execution. In Research, which is the cornerstone of their business, they have the largest research coverage in mainland Europe and are prospering in the post Mifid II research environment. “The Advisory business is perfectly suited to the firm’s partnership model. In Execution, they have an algorithmic trading capability which competes head-to-head with the global brokers.” The French broker also has equity capital markets partnerships with UniCredit, Credit Agricole CIB, Rabobank, Swedbank and Belfius. Italian lender UniCredit has now increased its stake from 5.2% to 10.3% in Kepler Cheuvreux, while French private equity firm BlackFin Capital Partners and its co-investors have offloaded their stake. The shareholding changes are subject to regulatory nod. Kepler Cheuvreux chairman of the supervisory board Laurent Quirin said: “We now look to leverage the contacts and expertise of Atlas Merchant Capital and Bob Diamond, its founding partner and CEO, on a global scale. “Both Atlas and ERES will help us to invest in our organic expansion and in our targeted acquisition strategy. We believe that Mifid II and bank disintermediation create opportunities. We envisage signing more alliances with banks which are looking to outsource processes or businesses.” Kepler Cheuvreux offers research, execution and advisory services. The group employs nearly 550 staff across offices in Paris, Amsterdam, Boston, Brussels, Frankfurt, Geneva, London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Oslo, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich.

Bob,Diamond,1153,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/28/how-to-get-away-with-financial-fraud,"Thu 28 Jun 2018 01.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 4 Jul 2018 06.14 EDT ‘Guys, you’ve got to hear this,” I said. I was sitting in front of my computer one day in July 2012, with one eye on a screen of share prices and the other on a live stream of the House of Commons Treasury select committee hearings. As the Barclays share price took a graceful swan dive, I pulled my headphones out of the socket and turned up the volume so everyone could hear. My colleagues left their terminals and came around to watch BBC Parliament with me. It didn’t take long to realise what was happening. “Bob’s getting murdered,” someone said. Bob Diamond, the swashbuckling chief executive of Barclays, had been called before the committee to explain exactly what his bank had been playing at in regards to the Libor rate-fixing scandal. The day before his appearance, he had made things very much worse by seeming to accuse the deputy governor of the Bank of England of ordering him to fiddle an important benchmark, then walking back the accusation as soon as it was challenged. He was trying to turn on his legendary charm in front of a committee of angry MPs, and it wasn’t working. On our trading floor, in Mayfair, calls were coming in from all over the City. Investors needed to know what was happening and whether the damage was reparable. A couple of weeks later, the damage was done. The money was gone, Diamond was out of a job and the market, as it always does, had moved on. We were left asking ourselves: How did we get it so wrong? At the time I was working for a French stockbroking firm, on the team responsible for the banking sector. I was the team’s regulation specialist. I had been aware of “the Libor affair”, and had written about it on several occasions during the previous months. My colleagues and I had assumed that it would be the typical kind of regulatory risk for the banks – a slap on the wrist, a few hundred million dollars of fines, no more than that. The first puzzle was that, to start with, it looked like we were right. By the time it caught the attention of the mainstream media, the Libor scandal had reached what would usually be the end of the story – the announcement, on 27 June 2012, of a regulatory sanction. Barclays had admitted a set of facts, made undertakings not to do anything similar again, and agreed to pay fines of £59.5m to the UK’s Financial Services Authority, $200m to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a further $160m to the US Department of Justice. That’s how these things are usually dealt with. If anything, it was considered quite a tough penalty. But the Libor case marked the beginning of a new process for the regulators. As well as publishing their judgment, they gave a long summary of the evidence and reasoning that led to their decision. In the case of the Libor fines, the majority of that evidence took the form of transcripts of emails and Bloomberg chat. Bloomberg’s trading terminals – the $50,000-a-year news and financial-data servers that every trader uses – have an instant-messaging function in addition to supplying prices and transmitting news. Financial market professionals are vastly more addicted to this chat than tween girls are to Instagram, and many of them failed to realise that if you discussed illegal activity on this medium, you were making things easy for the authorities. The transcripts left no room for doubt. Trader C: “The big day [has] arrived … My NYK are screaming at me about an unchanged 3m libor. As always, any help wd be greatly appreciated. What do you think you’ll go for 3m?” Submitter: “I am going 90 altho 91 is what I should be posting.” Trader C: “[…] when I retire and write a book about this business your name will be written in golden letters […]”. Submitter: “I would prefer this [to] not be in any book!” Perhaps it’s unfair to judge the Libor conspirators on their chat records; few of the journalists who covered the story would like to see their own Twitter direct-message history paraded in front of an angry public. Trading, for all its bluster, is basically a service industry, and there is no service industry anywhere in the world whose employees don’t blow off steam by acting out or insulting the customers behind their backs. But traders tend to have more than the usual level of self-confidence, bordering on arrogance. And in a general climate in which the public was both unhappy with the banking industry and unimpressed with casual banter about ostentatious displays of wealth, the Libor transcripts appeared crass beyond belief. Every single popular stereotype about traders was confirmed. An abstruse and technical set of regulatory breaches suddenly became a morality play, a story of swaggering villains who fixed the market as if it was a horse race. The politicians could hardly have failed to get involved. It is not a pleasant thing to see your industry subjected to criticism that is at once overheated, ill-informed and entirely justified. In 2012, the financial sector finally got the kind of enemies it deserved. The popular version of events might have been oversimplified and wrong in lots of technical detail, but in the broad sweep, it was right. The nuanced and technical version of events which the specialists obsessed over might have been right on the detail, but it missed one utterly crucial point: a massive crime of dishonesty had taken place. There was a word for what had happened, and that word was fraud. For a period of months, it seemed to me as if the more you knew about the Libor scandal, the less you understood it. That’s how we got it so wrong. We were looking for incidental breaches of technical regulations, not systematic crime. And the thing is, that’s normal. The nature of fraud is that it works outside your field of vision, subverting the normal checks and balances so that the world changes while the picture stays the same. People in financial markets have been missing the wood for the trees for as long as there have been markets. Some places in the world are what they call “low-trust societies”. The political institutions are fragile and corrupt, business practices are dodgy, debts are rarely repaid and people rightly fear being ripped off on any transaction. In the “high-trust societies”, conversely, businesses are honest, laws are fair and consistently enforced, and the majority of people can go about their day in the knowledge that the overall level of integrity in economic life is very high. With that in mind, and given what we know about the following two countries, why is it that the Canadian financial sector is so fraud-ridden that Joe Queenan, writing in Forbes magazine in 1989, nicknamed Vancouver the “Scam Capital of the World”, while shipowners in Greece will regularly do multimillion-dollar deals on a handshake? We might call this the “Canadian paradox”. There are different kinds of dishonesty in the world. The most profitable kind is commercial fraud, and commercial fraud is parasitical on the overall health of the business sector on which it preys. It is much more difficult to be a fraudster in a society in which people only do business with relatives, or where commerce is based on family networks going back centuries. It is much easier to carry out a securities fraud in a market where dishonesty is the rare exception rather than the everyday rule. The existence of the Canadian paradox suggests that there is a specifically economic dimension to a certain kind of crime of dishonesty. Trust – particularly between complete strangers, with no interactions beside relatively anonymous market transactions – is the basis of the modern industrial economy. And the story of the development of the modern economy is in large part the story of the invention and improvement of technologies and institutions for managing that trust. And as industrial society develops, it becomes easier to be a victim. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described how prosperity derived from the division of labour – the 18 distinct operations that went into the manufacture of a pin, for example. While this was going on, the modern world also saw a growing division of trust. The more a society benefits from the division of labour in checking up on things, the further you can go into a con game before you realise that you’re in one. In the case of several dealers in the Libor market, by the time anyone realised something was crooked, they were several billions of dollars in over their heads. In hindsight, the Libor system was always a shoddy piece of work. Some not-very-well-paid clerks from the British Bankers’ Association would call up a few dozen banks and ask: “If you were to borrow, say, a million dollars in [a given currency] for a 30-day deposit, what would you expect to pay?” A deposit, in this context, is a short-term loan from one bank to another. Due to customers’ inconvenient habit of borrowing from one bank and putting the money in an account at another, banks are constantly left with either surplus customer deposits, or a shortage of funds. The “London inter-bank offered-rate” (Libor) market is where they sort this out by borrowing from and lending to each other, at the “offered rate” of interest. Once they had their answers, the clerks would throw away the highest and lowest outliers and calculate the average of the rest, which would be recorded as “30-day Libor” for that currency. The process would be repeated for three-month loans, six-month loans and any other periods of interest, and the rates would be published. You would then have a little table recording the state of the market on that day – you could decide which currency you wanted to borrow in, and how long you wanted the use of the money, and the Libor panel would give you a good sense of what high-quality banks were paying to do the same. Compared with the amount of time and effort that goes into the systems for nearly everything else that banks do, not very much trouble was taken over this process. Other markets rose and fell, stock exchanges mutated and were taken over by super-fast robots, but the Libor rate for the day was still determined by a process that could be termed “a quick ring-around”. Nobody noticed until it was too late that hundreds of trillions of dollars of the world economy rested on a number compiled by the few dozen people in the world with the greatest incentive to fiddle it. It started to fall apart with the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, and all the more so after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when banks were so scared that they effectively stopped lending to each other. Although the market was completely frozen, the daily Libor ring-around still took place, and banks still gave, almost entirely speculatively, answers to the question “If you were to borrow a reasonable sum, what would you expect to pay?” But the daily quotes were published, and that meant everyone could see what everyone else was saying about their funding costs. And one of the telltale signs that a bank in trouble is when its funding costs start to rise. If your Libor submission is taken as an indicator of whether you’re in trouble or not, you really don’t want to be the highest number on the daily list. Naturally, then, quite a few banks started using the Libor submission process as a form of false advertising, putting in a lowballed quote in order to make it look like they were still obtaining money easily when, in fact, they could hardly borrow at all. And so it came to pass that several banks created internal message trails saying, in effect, “Dear Lowly Employee, for the benefit of the bank and its shareholders, please start submitting a lower Libor quote, signed Senior Executive”. This turned out to be a silly thing to do. All this was known at the time. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about it. I used to prepare PowerPoint slides with charts on them that had gaps for the year 2008 because the data was “somewhat hypothetical”. Even earlier, in late 2007, the Bank of England held a “liaison group” meeting so that representatives from the banks could discuss the issue of Libor reporting. What nobody seemed to realise is that an ongoing fraud was being committed. There was a conspiracy to tell a lie (to the Libor phone panel, about a bank’s true cost of funding) in order to induce someone to enter into a bargain at a disadvantage to themselves. The general public caught on to all this a lot quicker than the experts did, which put the last nail in the coffin of the already weakened trust in the financial system. You could make a case that a lot of the populist politics of the subsequent decade can be traced back to the Libor affair. Libor teaches us a valuable lesson about commercial fraud – that unlike other crimes, it has a problem of denial as well as one of detection. There are very few other criminal acts where the victim not only consents to the criminal act, but voluntarily transfers the money or valuable goods to the criminal. And the hierarchies, status distinctions and networks that make up a modern economy also create powerful psychological barriers against seeing fraud when it is happening. White-collar crime is partly defined by the kind of person who commits it: a person of high status in the community, the kind of person who is always given the benefit of the doubt. In popular culture, the fraudster is the “confidence man”, somewhere between a stage magician and the trickster gods of mythology. In films such as The Sting and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, they are master psychologists, exploiting the greed and myopia of their victims, and creating a world of illusion. People like this do exist (albeit rarely). But they are not typical of white-collar criminals. The interesting questions are never about individual psychology. There are plenty of larger-than-life characters. But there are also plenty of people like Enron’s Jeff Skilling and Baring’s Nick Leeson: aggressively dull clerks and managers whose only interest derives from the disasters they caused. And even for the real craftsmen, the actual work is, of necessity, incredibly prosaic. The way most white-collar crime works is by manipulating institutional psychology. That means creating something that looks as much as possible like a normal set of transactions. The drama comes later, when it all unwinds. Fraudsters don’t play on moral weaknesses, greed or fear; they play on weaknesses in the system of checks and balances – the audit processes that are meant to supplement an overall environment of trust. One point that comes up again and again when looking at famous and large-scale frauds is that, in many cases, everything could have been brought to a halt at a very early stage if anyone had taken care to confirm all the facts. But nobody does confirm all the facts. There are just too bloody many of them. Even after the financial rubble has settled and the arrests been made, this is a huge problem. It is a commonplace of law enforcement that commercial frauds are difficult to prosecute. In many countries, proposals have been made, and sometimes passed into law, to remove juries from complex fraud trials, or to move the task of dealing with them out of the criminal justice system and into regulatory or other non-judicial processes. Such moves are understandable. There is a need to be seen to get prosecutions and to maintain confidence in the whole system. However, taking the opinions of the general public out of the question seems to me to be a counsel of despair. When analysed properly, there isn’t much that is truly difficult about the proverbial “complex fraud trial”. The underlying crime is often surprisingly crude: someone did something dishonest and enriched themselves at the expense of others. What makes white-collar trials so arduous for jurors is really their length, and the amount of detail that needs to be brought for a successful conviction. Such trials are not long and detailed because there is anything difficult to understand. They are long and difficult because so many liars are involved, and when a case has a lot of liars, it takes time and evidence to establish that they are lying. This state of affairs is actually quite uncommon in the criminal justice system. Most trials only have a couple of liars in the witness box, and the question is a simple one of whether the accused did it or not. In a fraud trial, rather than denying responsibility for the actions involved, the defendant is often insisting that no crime was committed at all, that there is an innocent interpretation for everything. In January this year, the construction giant Carillion collapsed. Although they had issued a profits warning last summer, they continued to land government contracts. It was assumed that, since they had been audited by KPMG, one of the big-four accounting firms, any serious problems would have been spotted. At the time of writing, nobody has been prosecuted over the collapse of Carillion. Maybe nobody will and maybe nobody should. It’s possible, after all, for a big firm to go bust, even really suddenly, without it being a result of anything culpable. But the accounting looks weird – at the very least, they seem to have recognised revenue a long time before it actually arrived. It’s not surprising that the accounting standards bodies are asking some questions. So are the Treasury select committee: one MP told a partner at KPMG that “I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge.” In general, cases of major fraud should have been prevented by auditors, whose specific job it is to review every set of accounts as a neutral outside party, and certify that they are a true and fair view of the business. But they don’t always do this. Why not? The answer is simple: some auditors are willing to bend the rules, and some are too easily fooled. And whatever reforms are made to the accounting standards and to the rules governing the profession, the same problems have cropped up again and again. First, there is the problem that the vast majority of auditors are both honest and competent. This is a good thing, of course, but the bad thing about it is that it means that most people have never met a crooked or incompetent auditor, and therefore have no real understanding that such people exist. To find a really bad guy at a big-four accountancy firm, you have to be quite unlucky (or quite lucky if that was what you were looking for). But as a crooked manager of a company, churning around your auditors until you find a bad ’un is exactly what you do – and when you find one, you hang on to them. This means that the bad auditors are gravitationally drawn into auditing the bad companies, while the majority of the profession has an unrepresentative view of how likely that could be. Second, there is the problem that even if an auditor is both honest and competent, he has to have a spine, or he might as well not be. Fraudsters can be both persistent and overbearing, and not all the people who went into accountancy firms out of university did so because they were commanding, alpha-type personalities. Added to this, fraudsters are really keen on going over auditors’ heads and complaining to their bosses at the accounting firm, claiming that the auditor is being unhelpful and bureaucratic, not allowing the CEO to use his legitimate judgment in presenting the results of his own business. Partly because auditors are often awful stick-in-the-muds and arse-coverers, and partly because auditing is a surprisingly competitive and unprofitable business that is typically used as a loss-leader to sell more remunerative consulting and IT work, you can’t assume that the auditor’s boss will support their employee, even though the employee is the one placing their signature (and the reputation of the whole practice) on the set of accounts. As with several other patterns of behaviour that tend to generate frauds, the dynamic by which a difficult audit partner gets overruled or removed happens so often, and reproduces itself so exactly, that it must reflect a fairly deep and ubiquitous incentive problem that will be very difficult to remove. By way of a second line of defence, investors and brokerage firms often employ their own “analysts” to critically read sets of published accounts. The analyst is meant to be an industry expert, with enough financial training to read company accounts and to carry out valuations of companies and other assets. Although their primary job is to identify profitable opportunities in securities trading – shares or bonds that are either very undervalued or very overvalued – it would surely seem to be the case that part of this job would involve the identification of companies that are very overvalued because they are frauds. Well, sometimes it works. A set of fraudulent accounts will often generate “tells”. In particular, fraudsters in a hurry, or with limited ability to browbeat the auditors, will not be able to fake the balance sheet to match the way they have faked the profits. Inflated sales might show up as having been carried out without need for inventories, and without any trace of the cash they should have generated. Analysts are also often good at spotting practices such as “channel stuffing”, when a company (usually one with a highly motivated and target-oriented sales force) sells a lot of product to wholesalers and intermediaries towards the end of the quarter, booking sales and moving inventory off its books. This makes growth look good in the short term, at the expense of future sales. Often, an honest auditor who has buckled under pressure will include a cryptic-looking passage of legalese, buried in the notes to the accounts, explaining what accounting treatment has been used, and hoping that someone will read it and understand that the significance of this note is that all of the headline numbers are fake. Nearly all of the fraudulent accounting policies adopted by Enron could have been deduced from its public filings if you knew where to look. More common is the situation that prevailed in the period immediately preceding the global financial crisis.Analysts occasionally noticed that some things didn’t add up, and said so, and one or two of them wrote reports that, if taken seriously, could have been seen as prescient warnings. The problem is that spotting frauds is difficult and, for the majority of investors, not worth expending the effort on. That means it is not worth it for most analysts, either. Frauds are rare. Frauds that can be spotted by careful analysis are even rarer. And frauds that are also large enough to offer serious rewards for betting against them come along roughly once every business cycle, in waves. Analysts are also subject to very similar pressures to those that cause auditors to compromise their principles. Anyone accusing a company publicly of being a fraud is taking a big risk, and can expect significant retaliation. It is well to remember that frauds generally look like very successful companies, and there are sound accounting reasons for this. It is not just that once you have decided to fiddle the accounts you might as well make them look great rather than mediocre. If you are extracting cash fraudulently, you usually need to be growing the fake earnings at a higher rate. So people who are correctly identifying frauds can often look like they are jealously attacking success. Frauds also tend to carry out lots of financial transactions and pay large commissions to investment banks, all the while making investors believe they are rich. The psychological barriers against questioning a successful CEO are not quite as powerful as those against questioning the honesty of a doctor or lawyer, but they are substantial. And finally, most analysts’ opinions are not read. A fraudster does not have to fool everyone; he just needs to fool enough people to get his money. If you are looking to the financial system to protect investors, you are going to end up being disappointed. But this is inevitable. Investors don’t want to be protected from fraud; they want to invest. Since the invention of stock markets, there has been surprisingly little correlation between the amount of fraud in a market and the return to investors. It’s been credibly estimated that in the Victorian era, one in six companies floated on the London Stock Exchange was a fraud. But people got rich. It’s the Canadian paradox. Although in the short term, you save your money by checking everything out, in the long term, success goes to those who trust.

Michael,Gordon,1152,https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Christian-Reif-to-Make-NY-Conducting-Debut-At-Lincoln-Centers-Mostly-Mozart-Festival-20180628,"German-born conductor Christian Reif, described as ""the complete package"" by the San Francisco Chronicle, makes his New York conducting debut on Thursday, August 2, 2018 at 7:30 pm at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, part of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival. A former conducting student of Alan Gilbert at The Juilliard School, Reif leads the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE) in a program celebrating the fusion of piano and technology, centered around John Adams's Grand Pianola Music. The concert also includes Courtney Bryan's Songs of Laughing, Smiling, and Crying and a newly revised version of George Lewis's epic chamber piece Voyager using Artificial Intelligence technology. One of the most promising conducting talents of his generation, Christian Reif is currently the Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony and Music Director of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra. He began his tenure in San Francisco during the 2016-17 season following two years in Miami as Conducting Fellow with the New World Symphony, working closely with Michael Tilson Thomas. His April 2018 San Francisco Symphony subscription concerts prompted Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle to write: ""He's a conductor of considerable stature, and everything felt like the work of a significant musical artist."" In the 2018-19 season, Reif will conduct Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and the world premiere of Andrew Norman's Cello Concerto with Johannes Moser on subscription with the San Francisco Symphony and a program that includes works by Britten, Shostakovich and Haydn with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. Additionally, he will make debuts with the Indianapolis Symphony, Omaha Symphony, and Hong Kong Philharmonic and return to work with the Berkeley Symphony and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He will also conduct a production of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at Opera San Jose and a new chamber version of John Adams's El Niño with the American Modern Opera Company as part the Metropolitan Museum of Art's MetLiveArts series in New York. In the 2017-18 season, Reif made a highly praised subscription debut with the San Francisco Symphony and led concerts with the Orchestre National de Lyon, Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, Brucknerorchester Linz and Berkeley Symphony. As part of his duties as Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, Reif regularly conducts the orchestra in many different concert formats, including performances of Hansel and Gretel, an Oktoberfest concert, and two successful Soundbox shows - the orchestra's cutting-edge late-night series. Previous performance highlights include the Juilliard Orchestra, Israel Chamber Orchestra, Nürnberger Symphoniker, Meininger Hofkapelle, Georgian Chamber Orchestra, Salzburg Chamber Soloists and the Munich Chamber Opera in performances of Mozart's La finta semplice. Reif was a Conducting Fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center in the summers of 2015 and 2016. During his time there, he stepped in for Seiji Ozawa to conduct the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland, and he led the TMC Orchestra in Shostakovich's 14th Symphony with soprano Dawn Upshaw, baritone Sanford Sylvan and TMC vocalists. He has worked as cover conductor for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and New York Philharmonic at the NY PHIL BIENNIAL. Reif's enthusiasm in performing contemporary music has led to several world premieres. Among those are Michael Gordon's El Sol Caliente - a city symphony in honor of Miami Beach's centennial - and concertos for DJ and orchestra performed at New World Symphony PULSE events where the concert hall is transformed into a nightclub. A dedicated and enthusiastic educator, Reif has taught piano, and he coaches instrumentalists and works with singers as a répétiteur. He has worked as a Teaching Fellow in the Juilliard School's Ear Training Department and a Music Master Teacher in Miami's National YoungArts Foundation. In his work at the New World Symphony from 2014 to 2016, he regularly hosted and conducted the orchestra's education concerts which were viewed by a global online audience. Christian Reif studied with Alan Gilbert at the Juilliard School, where he completed his Master of Music in Conducting in 2014 and received the Charles Schiff Conducting Award. Prior to that, he studied with Dennis Russell Davies at the Mozarteum Salzburg, where he received a diploma in 2012. He is winner of the 2015 German Operetta Prize, awarded by the German Music Council, and two Kulturförderpreise awards given to promising artists of the region who promote cultural advancement in their communities. Reif is a member of Germany's Conductor's Forum (Dirigentenforum) and is one of the forum's 2017-18 and 2018-19 featured ""Maestros of Tomorrow"".

Steve,Cummings,1150,http://www.cyclingweekly.com/cycling-weekly/geraint-thomas-wins-british-national-time-trial-384503,"The Team Sky rider shows he's in good form ahead of the Tour de France, winning with a substantial margin Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) at the British National Time Trial. Image: SWPix Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) will wear the stripes of British national time trial champion in the year ahead, having bettered second place rider Harry Tanfield (Canyon-Eisburg) by over half a minute. Tanfield – who had trained on the roads and knew them well – crossed the line in 49 minutes 31 seconds to Thomas’ 48-54. Third place went to five-time National champion, Alex Dowsett (Team Katusha-Alpecin) in 49-48. Defending champion Steve Cummings (Team Dimension Data) did not take to the start line of the 39.7 kilometre course. Tao Geoghegan Hart (Team Sky) set a benchmark at the first intermediate time check, with a time of 18-14. Tanfield was the first rider to post a faster split of 17-38. Tanfield – like his brother Charlie who won the under-23 race – had trained on the course, but Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) showed his post Critérium du Dauphiné form by cruising through in 17-25. Dowsett was not able to match the pace, at 17-45. The second intermediate time check saw Thomas clock 31-16, to Tanfield’s 31-46, Dowsett continuing to lose time to his rivals with 32-03. At the finish, John Archibald (Ribble Cycling) was left in the hot seat for a considerable period, with a finishing time of 50-41. Even Geoghegan Hart – who posted an intermediate time check 15 seconds faster – was not able to better him, clocking a finish time of 51-00 to hold second place until the leaders rolled in. The first rider to knock Archibald off the top spot was Tanfield, but Thomas quickly followed, with Dowsett eventually pushing him off the podium. Archibald was able to hold on to fourth – still an impressive performance for the Scottish rider. Last year’s under-23 champion, Chris Lawless (Team Sky) did not make it to the finish, with reports suggesting he crashed out during the race. “It’s great. Winning Dauphiné was a big boost. I’ve done a good bit of training since and to come here and win the nationals for the first time is great,” Thomas commented after the race. “I’m really happy. I was confident but I really didn’t know what to expect. Obviously Tanfield has been riding really well this year and Dowsett, it’s what he does. “Time trial in the UK is a strong discipline anyway – to come and win is super nice. It’s going to be great, especially in the Tour, to wear that jersey.

The 21-year-oldwas joined on the podium by a surprising addition of Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling) who clocked in at 36-29, with the less surprising podium appearance of Tom Pidcock (Team Wiggins) rounding off the podium in 37-23. Tanfield placed third in the competition last year, but has had an exceptional season, already taking World and Commonwealth titles in the team and individual pursuit respectively. >>> British National Road Race course Tanfield said after the race: “It’s a local course for me so I’ve spent the last few weeks riding on it on most days.” “I knew exactly what I wanted to do coming into it and how I wanted to ride it so it’s about executing the plan and making sure nothing went wrong on the day. “I’m really happy to have finished it off today, I had two road targets this year – the national time trial and trying to get to the worlds as well. I wanted to show everyone what I could do – it’s my last year in the U23s as well and I wanted to make the most of it.” 1 Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg) in 36-01-85 2 Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling), at 27s 3 Thomas Pidcock (Team Wiggins), at 1-21 4 Ethan Hayter (100% Me), at 1-23 5 Robert Scott (Team Wiggins), at 1-33 6 Matt Langworthy (Saint Piran, at 1-41 7 Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling), at 1-45 8 Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins), at 1-47 9 Joey Walker (Team Wiggins), at 1-54 10 William Perret (University of Derby Cycling Club), at 1-54 The British Road National Championships continue on Sunday, with the women’s and men’s events taking place on the same day.

Steve,Cummings,1150,https://www.eurosport.com/cycling/deignan-praises-strength-in-depth-of-women-s-road-racing_sto6824079/story.shtml,"27/06/2018 at 17:00 The 29-year-old won her fourth national title on the Isle of Man last year but will sit out this weekend's British National Road Race Championships after announcing that she was pregnant with her first child in March. And Deignan admits she will be watching with keen interest on Sunday to see who claims her crown in Northumberland from a field that she believes possesses incredible strength-in-depth. ""It's always an honour to wear the national champion's stripes and although I haven't been racing this year due to pregnancy, I made good use of them last year and will hopefully be back next year to try and win them back,"" she told British Cycling. ""The field for the women's road race at this year's championships is really strong though and whoever takes the jersey will have to put in a fantastic performance to earn it. ""The strength-in-depth in our women's domestic racing bodes really well for the future and it'll be interesting to see who takes my title this weekend."" Among the favourites to claim the title will be 2016 champion Hannah Barnes, while Dani Rowe will be looking to back up her impressive third-place finish at the recent OVO Energy Women's Tour. The start list also includes Great Britain's most decorated female Paralympian, Dame Sarah Storey, and Olympic and Commonwealth track champion Elinor Barker. Alice Barnes, who finished second behind her sister in 2016, will also be seeking to finish on top of the podium as she attempts to claim the national champion's jersey for herself. The women's race is not the only event taking place on Sunday in Northumberland, with a stellar list of names set to compete in the men's road race. Defending champion Steve Cummings will line up against the likes of Mark Cavendish, Ed Clancy, Ian Stannard and Owain Doull after both the time trial events take place on Thursday.

Bob,Diamond,1148,https://www.reuters.com/article/kepler-investors/bob-diamonds-atlas-edmond-de-rothschild-to-buy-stakes-in-kepler-idUSP6N1T100N,"3 Min Read * Kepler: eyeing possible acquisitions, IPO * Bob Diamond’s Atlas Merchant to take stake * Edmond de Rothschild firm also buys stake in Kepler * UniCredit ups stake in Kepler to 10.3 pct vs 5.2 pct By Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - Paris-based independent brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said on Wednesday that former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild had agreed to take minority stakes in the firm, which has eyes on a possible flotation. Atlas Merchant Capital, the firm Diamond co-founded in 2013 after his departure from Barclays, will buy a 19.7 percent stake, while Edmond de Rothschild will take 8 percent. Kepler added it was counting on its new partners to help it keep growing through acquisitions, and did not rule out looking for potential targets in the United Kingdom once Brexit terms were clearer, or in the United States. Kepler, which has grown rapidly over the past 10 years through purchases and partnerships with large European banks such as Italy’s UniCredit, also said it could ultimately carry out an initial public offering (IPO) within the next five years. “It’s not unthinkable, it’s part of our plans,” Laurent Quirin, the chairman of Kepler’s supervisory board, told reporters. “We’d need to keep on growing at a good pace.” Kepler did not give financial details of the transactions. As the new investors come in, French-based private equity fund Blackfin Capital Partners, which held 19.7 percent, and French bank Credit Mutuel ARKEA, which held 4.2 percent, will sell out of their current holdings. The company’s management will reduce the stake it holds collectively to 25.5 percent from 31.9 percent, although they will keep 40 percent of the voting rights. UniCredit, meanwhile, will raise its stake in the brokerage to 10.3 percent from 5.2 percent, while French state-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) will trim its holding to 5.2 percent from 7.8 percent. Since Kepler’s management bought out the company in 2009, its revenue has jumped fivefold, reaching 252 million euros ($294 million) in 2017. It is expected to hit 270 million euros this year with a 40 million net profit, Quirin said. $1 = 0.8585 euros Reporting by Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sarah White/Sudip Kar-Gupta All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Andrew,Davis,1147,https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/06/27/inenglish/1530095986_934611.html,"The regional premier of Catalonia, Quim Torra, has made a fiery speech in Washington in defense of Catalan independence during his first official tour to the United States. “I want to announce that I have, more than hope, the firm conviction that Catalonia will soon join the rest of the free nations of the world,” he said on Tuesday at the opening of the Catalonia American Council, a private lobby group aimed at strengthening ties between the United States and the northeastern Spanish region. Torra promised to reopen Catalonia’s diplomatic office in Washington “The Catalan people have the right and the will to create our independent state,” he added. Torra is a hard-line separatist who has promised to continue down the road of unilateral secession for the region. He was voted in as premier in May in a 66-to-65 vote in the Catalan parliament, after being nominated by ousted premier Carles Puigdemont, who is in Germany fighting extradition to Spain for charges of rebellion and misuse of funds in connection with his unilateral independence drive last year. The Catalan premier traveled to the US to open a folkloric festival organized by the Smithsonian Institution featuring Catalan performers. During his four-day trip, Torra is also scheduled to meet with a legal firm specializing in conflict resolution. His official agenda does not include any meetings with Congress members or representatives of the government of President Donald Trump, who strongly supports the territorial unity of Spain. At the inauguration of the Catalonia American Council – his first event in Washington – Torra lambasted the “damaging effects” of Article 155 of the Constitution, an emergency measure invoked by former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in response to the illegal referendum of October 1 and the following unilateral declaration of independence. The Catalan people have the right and the will to create our independent state Catalan premier Quim Torra The measure, which suspended autonomous powers in the breakaway region, sent Catalonia into a “state of emergency” and led to the return of “political prisoners, exiles and victims of repression,” said Torra, in reference to the Catalan separatists in pre-trial detention for their involvement in the separatist drive, and fugitives of justice, such as Puigdemont. “The Catalan government is fighting against the sinister effects of the state of emergency and condemning the injustice suffered by our premier Puigdemont, who now lives in forced exile,” he told the audience. “This regression of democratic values in Spain is intolerable for any democracy.” Direct rule in Catalonia was lifted on June 2 and the Spanish government of Pedro Sánchez has also removed spending controls on the region. In his speech, Torra also announced plans to reopen the region’s overseas diplomatic offices, which were closed as a result of Article 155, promising to open the Washington delegation – previously led by Andrew Davis, the head of the Catalonia American Council – as soon as possible. Torra’s visit to Washington is a strong reminder of the tour Puigdemont made to the United States in March, 2017 “I want to thank all the men and women of the delegation who have been unjustly removed from their jobs by the Spanish government,” he said. Addressing Davis, Torra added: “The work all your team has done has been essential to defining us as a nation before the world. But the Spanish government wanted to silence us by closing our delegations.” Torra’s visit to Washington is a strong reminder of the tour Puigdemont made to the United States in March, 2017. During this trip, the ousted premier made a strident speech against Spain at Harvard University and met with various US Congress members in Washington to promote his plans for Catalan independence. But the political panorama has changed a lot in a year. With Puigdemont in Berlin awaiting extradition orders, it is Torra who is now campaigning to strengthen ties between Catalonia and the United States – places that, quoting former US president Thomas Jefferson, both share the values of “freedom, the respect for human rights and peace,” said Torra.

On a good batting track at Finchampstead, Sussex openers Scott Stratton (47) and skipper Rajesh Sharma shared 72 for the first wicket, their partnership only ended when the former was stumped by Andrew Davis off the bowling of John McDonald. McDonald (2-20 off nine overs) struck again shortly after as he bowled Mike Pannett before Peter Randall had Sharma caught by Myles to make it 98-3. Myles (2-56) then accounted for David Robertshaw and Damian Cummins, but a timely unbeaten 53 from Jason Robinson ensured Sussex set a respectable 220-6. Berkshire fell to 47-2 in reply, but Loveday (71no) and Myles (90no) took control of the game and knocked the runs off in 40.3 overs. Berkshire Over 50s 2nds picked up an excellent seven-wicket win at Middlesex. A useful opening burst from Rob Barrett (3-28) put the visitors in a good position, and Steve West (3-23 from seven overs) kept the pressure firmly on as Middlesex were restricted to 176-9, wicketkeeper Grery Bacon collecting a catch and a stumping. Dean Allen-Turner and captain Peter Henly (45) put on 102 for the first wicket as Berkshire’s reply started well, and Allen-Turner went on to score an unbeaten 100 to lead his side home with almost eight overs to spare. A brutal 81 not out from only 68 balls by Mark Simmons helped Berkshire Over 60s to a comfortable 73-run win against Sussex. Captain Dave Tooze also added 72 and Ronnie Brock 49 as Berkshire totalled 243-5, and Sussex were always behind the rate before eventually closing on 170-4. Berkshire Over 60s 2nds lost by 69 runs at Hampshire. Captain Tony Adams (91no) and Peter Tapper (69) put on 148 for the third wicket as the hosts racked up 225-3 in their 45 overs, and outside of Don Townsin’s 51, there was little of note for Berkshire as they were bowled out for 156.

Michael,Gordon,1145,https://www.tweeddailynews.com.au/news/inspired-tweed-juniors-meet-super-boot-gordon/3452704/,"GOLD Coast Titans fullback Michael Gordon returned to where it all began yesterday when he visited his junior club Tweed Coast Raiders. Gordon, 34, signed autographs, posed for photos and thrilled youngsters by launching many a long bomb with his prodigious right boot. Tweed Coast Raiders JRL Publicity Officer Anna Bourne said Gordon, the Gold Coast Titans' ambassador to the Tweed juniors, was always welcome down at the club. ""He was absolutely lovely. Being a local junior himself Michael always likes coming down and visiting, and the kids thought it was great,” Ms Bourne said. ""He even kicked a few long bombs for them to get underneath and try to catch.” Gordon's presence down at Les Burger Field in Cabarita could well be a sign of things to come, with the NRL journeyman indicating to club officials he still has plans to return to the Tweed Coast Raiders after he retires from first grade football. Last year Gordon said it was simply ""a matter of when” he would return to Tweed Coast, keen to ""bring some experience...and pass on any knowledge” to his childhood club. ""It's definitely going to happen,” he told the Tweed Daily News in May last year. ""The way I'm going I might be 40 when I'm back.” It looked more than likely to happen in 2018 before the Titans offered Gordon a contract to replace a want-away Jarryd Hayne. Lauded as a reliable club-man with a calming influence on his peers, Gordon has been widely praised for his impact at the Titans. If it is only a matter of when, Gordon's inevitable return to the Tweed leaves plenty for the Raiders to look forward to.

John,O'Neil,1144,http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20180626/gammons-neighbors-not-going-away,"YORK � The neighbors of Gammon Lawn Care on York Street say they are not letting up in their effort to fight for their rights as abutting property owners to a commercial business. Most recently, abutter Dan Raposa plans to go before the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to appeal a lower court decision in this back-and-forth saga. But the group is also continuing to concentrate its efforts on the Board of Selectmen, who it said has not fulfilled its responsibility in dealing with what they see as incorrect decisions of both town staff and boards. �I�m not shutting up and I�m not going away,� Raposa said. �I live in this town. I�m proud to be a citizen of York and the right of a citizen is to do what our group is doing.� Earlier this month, Raposa filed a �notice of appeal� with the Supreme Judicial Court, of a York County Superior Court decision rendered last January. The issue in that case involved use of the property � whether the lawn care business was a grandfathered continuation of the use started when Peter Marcuri and his father ran an excavation business on the property in the past. Superior Court Justice John O�Neil argued a Board of Appeals decision on this matter was advisory only, and did not have legally enforceable status. He ruled the town, through its Board of Selectmen, has authority to take action, and the court therefore had no standing to hear an appeal. He dismissed the case. Although no documents have yet been filed with the SJC, Raposa said he is basing his appeal on the fact the underlying issue of use was not decided by O�Neil, and that issue must be addressed. Gammon�s attorney Matt Howell said he doesn�t think Raposa�s case will be successful. �The appeal�s likelihood of success is very remote,� he said. �The law is pretty clear on this issue, and Justice O�Neil issued a very comprehensive and well-reasoned decision. I simply don�t see the Law Court (Supreme Court) reversing the decision.� There are a couple of other issues that are distressing the neighbors as well, said Raposa. Another underlying issue has to do with the fact Gammon has not had enough land to operate a nonconforming use in a shoreland zone. Last year, he agreed to purchase property from abutters Ron and Susan Peris and swap land with abutter Diane Marcuri in order to comply with that town zoning requirement. The BOA in January reversed an earlier Planning Board decision and ruled the resulting lot was legal. As a result, Code Enforcement Officer Amber Harrison lifted a notice of violation she had earlier imposed against Gammon. First of all, said Raposa, Gammon has to date still not purchased the land from the Perises, although under terms of the BOA decision he had to do so within 120 days � which comes due this week. So lifting a notice of violation on a lot that doesn�t yet exist is �an absurdity� on Harrison�s part. Gammon is still operating on his original and too-small property, Raposa said. Howell agreed Gammon has not finalized the sale of the Peris land, but said the underlying issue of the validity of the lot has been appealed to the Superior Court in a separate case and is pending. �No bank and certainly no title company is willing to finalize the transfer while a court case is pending,� he said. �Josh has gotten the green light for funding, but we haven�t been able to do it. All this is not Ron�s fault, so Josh has already made a payment on what he owes Ron.� When Harrison lifted the notice of appeal, the neighbors appealed that action to the BOA, which was supposed to hear the appeal in early May. But town attorney Mary Costigan said Harrison�s action was not a �decision� under town ordinance. As a result, the night the matter was supposed to be heard, the BOA took no action. Raposa said he felt the neighbors� due process rights were violated. They were unable to lay out their arguments before an appellant body, which they said is their right as citizens. And they dispute that Harrison�s action was not a decision. �It was a flagrant miscarriage of justice. We as citizens have a right to bring any action to the Board of Appeals,� Raposa said.

Andrew,Davis,1143,http://www.voxy.co.nz/sport/5/314529,"Toyota will continue its support for Emirates Team New Zealand for the America’s Cup defence on the Waitemata Harbour in March 2021. New Zealand’s largest motor vehicle importer and distributor is also Emirates Team New Zealand’s most loyal supporter, having first joined the team in 1992. The 2021 Cup defence in Auckland will be the eighth America’s Cup campaign that Toyota New Zealand has been involved in, making it the longest continuous sports sponsorship in the country. ""We’ve been proud and honoured to stick with the team through thick and thin,"" said Andrew Davis, the General Manager of Marketing for Toyota New Zealand. ""The team’s philosophy of imagination, experimentation and innovation was the winning ingredient in Bermuda last year and represents what we stand for as a company and a country."" ""Last year’s successful challenge for the America’s Cup aligns even more closely with our brand values of continuous improvement and over the last four years this focus led to some exciting innovations and culminated in victory."" ""We are really proud to have Toyota back on board with the team again,"" said Emirates Team New Zealand CEO, Grant Dalton. ""They have been a staunch supporter of the team for over 25 years now since the 1992 campaign. We have grown together and Toyota is very much part of our DNA."" Toyota New Zealand first joined an America’s Cup campaign in 1992 and was involved in Black Magic’s victory in 1995 and successful defence in 2000. It has also stood behind the team when the trophy went to Switzerland in 2003 and the challenges in 2007 and 2013. Toyota’s support of Team New Zealand since 1992 is one of the most successful sports sponsorships in the country’s history, said Mr Davis. New Zealand is the second most successful country in the 167-year history of the America’s Cup (after America) and is the only country to successfully challenge for the ""Auld Mug"" on more than one occasion. ""The team has achieved a remarkable success in a short time and it is the people who have gone the extra mile to deliver great results,"" said Mr Davis. The 2021 defence of the America’s Cup will be contested in AC75 mono-hull yachts, which will be designed to foil, like the catamarans used in the last two contests at San Francisco in 2013 and Bermuda last year.

When he first started hitting the news recently, it was because of a falling out between himself and his son, Brandon Lee. Now, the former Motley Crue drummer is back in the news, this time over his other ex-wife, Heather Locklear. According to the Daily Mail, Tommy Lee — who was married to Locklear back in the 1980s during Motley Crue’s peak period — took to Twitter to unleash his animus against shock-jock radio host Howard Stern. Stern, who joked on his show that the Melrose Place actress “went crazy” after being married to both Lee and former Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, claimed that his remark was “tongue in cheek.” That didn’t stop Lee from going off the proverbial deep end on his Twitter account, though. Lee was so angry about the slight, in fact, that he posted the same status twice. Calling Stern the “queen of all media,” Lee reminded the DJ that the marriage was nearly 25 years ago, and told him that he should be “wishing her well” instead of bashing him. Almost immediately, fans began responding to Tommy Lee’s remarks, telling him — basically — to calm down and take several chill pills. Lee’s response comes in the wake of his ex-wife’s arrest — which, as has been previously reported by the Inquisitr, occurred after the former actress hit both a police officer and a first responder. This arrest marked the second arrest of its kind this year, and fans and friends alike are telling the press that the troubled star “needs help” for her addiction to booze and pills. Meanwhile, over in Tommy Lee’s world, things aren’t looking so great, either. As has also been previously reported by the Inquisitr, Lee isn’t exactly winning any awards for “father of the year” anytime soon, especially since he took to Instagram to call his two sons, Brandon and Dylan (whom he shares with Pamela Anderson), “a–holes.” Brandon Lee returned the favor not long thereafter, reminding his Daddy Dearest that the last time he talked that trash about him and his mother, he was “knocked out” by the younger Lee. He went on to say that the elder Lee needed rehab for his addictions. The two continue to trade barbs on social media, to this day, with Tommy Lee commenting that he paid several thousands of dollars towards Brandon Lee and his various expenses.

The new acquisition represents one percent but brings its holding in the bank to 49 percent and signposts Atlas Mara’s intent to maintain its presence in Nigeria and perhaps, also a bigger plan for the Nigerian economy, say analysts covering the banking industry. The financial services company said it was pleased “that it has agreed to acquire an additional 280,956,166 shares of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, approximately a 1.0% shareholding in UBN, following which its combined direct and indirect shareholding in UBN will increase to 49.0% from 48.0%. The company will issue 2,360,032 ordinary shares as consideration for the UBN shares acquired,” it said in a statement. It also said it had made applications for the new shares to be admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange, noting that “admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the new shares are expected to commence, at 8:00 am BST on 27 June 2018.” The new shares are expected to rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares. “Following admission of the new shares, the company will have 174,618,767 ordinary shares in issue, of which 1,545,764 shares are in treasury and 3,298,298 shares are held in escrow as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Finance Bank Zambia Limited, as disclosed to the market on 1 July 2016. Atlas Mara hereby confirms that the total number of voting rights in Atlas Mara is 169,774,705. This figure should be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the company under the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules,” the statement concluded.

Five-time national time trial champion, Alex Dowsett will start as another favourite in the elite men’s time trial this week. The Katusha-Alpecin rider will be looking to improve on recent good form in time trials during the Giro d’Italia and Tour of Slovenia. 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné winner Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), who is fine form will be looking to cause an upset and add another British champion jersey to his collection before taking on the Tour de France in July. An intense challenge will most certainly come from last year’s bronze medallist James Gullen (JLT Condor) and 2018 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Harry Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg). Cummings’ Team Dimension Data team mate and four-time under 23 National Time Trial champions Scott Davies will also compete in the elite men’s category for the first time. Start list Elite women Hannah Barnes (Canyon SRAM Racing) who finished second in last years’ time trial and Dani Rowe MBE (WaowDeals Pro Cycling) who secured the best British rider in the Women’s Tour earlier this month are two notable early favourites to win the national champions jersey. Two-time national time trial champion Hayley Simmonds (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) will return to challenge for her third title. Last year’s winner in the elite women’s time trial Claire Rose (Cervélo-Bigla Pro Cycling) and third placed Katie Archibald (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) are both notable absentees from this year’s start list, both currently recovering from injury. Anna Christian (Trek-Drops) the 22-year-old will be looking to have a big impact against her older competitors, using her gold medal in the under-23 championship from last year as motivation. Multiple Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey will also ride the 28.6km course in Northumberland alongside her Storey Racing team mates Neah Evans and Melissa Lowther. Start list Under-23 men Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling) and Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), second and third placed in 2017 respectively will dreaming of wearing the national jersey come Thursday with the exclusion of Scott Davies (Team Dimension Data). Four-time winner Davies has had a stronghold on the jersey in the under-23 time trial championship for the last four years consecutively, and this year steps up to compete in the elite men’s competition. Having recently being promoted to the Great Britain Cycling Team Podium Programme, Ethan Hayter will be looking to impress alongside his 100% ME team mates Matthew Bostock and Joe Holt. Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins) winner of this year’s Rutland - Melton Cicle Classic is another one to watch alongside team mate and one of cyclists most promising talents, Thomas Pidcock. Start list The women and under-23 men will complete two laps of the course, while the elite men will race three.

Steve,Cummings,1139,https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20180626-road-Race-Guide--Road-Race---2018-HSBC-UK---National-Road-Championships-0,"The riders will compete for the elite men’s, women’s and under-23 coveted national champions’ jersey. The 2018 women’s road race will be contested by a number of household names and on-form elite riders, including Dani Rowe, Dame Sarah Storey and Elinor Barker to name a few. Dani Rowe has been in fine form this season, finishing third in the Commonwealth Games road race and following up that performance with an overall third place in the OVO Energy Women’s Tour. Fellow Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker will ride for Wiggle High5 in Northumberland this weekend. Storey comes into the National Championships having recently tasted victory in the North East after winning stage one of the Tour of the Reservoir this past weekend. Storey will race both the TT and the road race for Storey Racing in a packed weekend of competition. Also competing in both events will be 2016 national champion Hannah Barnes (CANYON // SRAM RACING), who will be one of the favourites for this year’s title. She edged out her sister Alice in 2016, also racing this year and looking to improve on two runner-up finishes. Whatever the outcome of this year’s women’s road race, a new national champion will be crowned - with the 2017 champion Lizzie Deignan absent due to the upcoming birth of her first child. Another notable absentee is Olympic and world gold medallist Katie Archibald, who is injured and unable to race. Rider List The finale of the National Road Championships sees two-time champion Steve Cummings attempt to defend his title in a star-studded men’s road race. Cummings will have to fend off a host of challenges, not least from previous winners Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Adam Blythe – whom have all triumphed at National Road Championships in recent years. Other high-profile contenders include Team Sky star Geraint Thomas and the previous national champion and sprint ace Mark Cavendish. Thomas will be riding high on the back of his victory in the 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné and the Welshman will lead a strong Sky cohort into the weekends action. Cavendish was recently in action in the Tour de Yorkshire after a lengthy injury lay-off, but the Team Dimension Data rider is a perennial contender at the Nationals, with one victory and two second place finishes to his name already. One of cycling’s most exciting prospects, Tom Pidcock, who secured a win in the second round of the Spring Cup Series, leads an exclusively under-23 line-up for Team Wiggins. Elsewhere in the under-23 category, Team Wiggins’ Gabriel Cullaigh and Charlie Tanfield of Canyon Eisberg are tipped to be ones to watch. Rider List The road races will both start and finish in the picturesque village of Stamfordham, situated around 20km west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The women’s race will be in the morning over 106km – consisting of three laps of the long route (see map above), with the hotly contested men’s race due to place over a total distance of 185km in the afternoon – consisting of two short loops and four long loops. Spectators are invited to watch the action unfold in what promises to be a spectacular weekend of cycling and festival fun. Admission is free for spectators and there’s something for everyone to enjoy thanks to an eclectic mix of food and drink (cash only), music, amusement rides, HSBC UK Go-Ride and a bicycle stunt team. Arriving by car? A £3 car parking fee will be payable on arrival (cash only) in both the main car park in Stamfordham and the Ryals climb. Cash machines are not available. Sunday 1 July 8:45am – Women’s road race starts 1:00pm – Men’s road race starts The championships will take place from Thursday June 27 until Sunday June 30. The OVO Energy Women's Tour will also increase from five days to six, and will move to a new, weekday-focused position. With a redesigned S-Series we talk to Philip Spearman, Product Education at Cervélo.

Paula,Lunder,1137,http://www.colby.edu/news/2018/06/26/lunder-institute-receives-mellon-foundation-grant-to-support-inaugural-programming/,"June 26, 2018 Colby College has been awarded a $600,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the Colby Museum’s Lunder Institute for American Art and its inaugural programming. The award will add depth to the institute’s programs, which have already made an impact on Colby students and faculty, Waterville school children, and visiting artists. In 2014 the Mellon Foundation generously supported the Colby Museum’s academic programming, and this new grant will further expand opportunities for student and faculty research and scholarship in all disciplines. “As Colby continues to build on its strengths in the arts and humanities, we are grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s enduring commitment to these disciplines, said President David A. Greene. “We have already begun to see the ways in which the Lunder Institute is becoming the premier place for the study of American art, and this grant will be critical to the next phase of the institute’s development.” The Mellon grant will support four key areas: advancing American art scholarship and artistic practice through multidisciplinary, multi-genre residencies and convenings; engaging students and faculty by creating teaching and research opportunities with visiting artists and scholars that reach across the curriculum; sharing and archiving scholarly and artistic projects through exhibitions and publications; and increasing local and global collaborative opportunities that engage with the artistic and scholarly initiatives of the Lunder Institute in partnership with Colby students and faculty. In its first full academic year, the institute played host to two renowned artists who worked closely with Colby students, faculty, and members of the local community. In the fall semester, Theaster Gates worked with Colby students in an American studies class on urban renewal projects and met with community partners and residents. Richard Blanco, inaugural poet for President Obama’s second inauguration, spent the spring semester on campus, most notably teaching a course titled “Teach This Poem” in which Colby students learned to be poetry ambassadors for local school children. Blanco also conducted workshops for area schoolteachers. The future holds even more, says Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “As we continue to launch the Lunder Institute, this grant will significantly expand our ability to bring artists and scholars to Colby while making the programs of the Lunder Institute accessible to Colby students and faculty and our broader communities,” she said. “We are honored and grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s support.” The institute recently named four outstanding individuals to key leadership positions. Lee Glazer will serve as founding director of the institute, bringing experience as curator of American art for the Smithsonian Institution’s Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and expertise in the art of James McNeill Whistler, Romare Bearden, and others. Joining Glazer are Gates, the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives, and Tanya Sheehan, the distinguished scholar and director of research. Sheehan is currently Colby’s William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art. Most recently, the institute has brought on Daisy Desrosiers, an arts leader from Montréal, as program director. “The Mellon Foundation grant signals the importance of arts programming and will support the work of the institute’s creative and intellectual individuals,” said Glazer, who arrives at Colby in September. “This grant will enhance all of our work, from our cross-disciplinary collaborations to our scholarly symposiums to our community projects.” About the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Founded in 1969, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation endeavors to strengthen, promote, and, where necessary, defend the contributions of the humanities and the arts to human flourishing and to the well-being of diverse and democratic societies by supporting exemplary institutions of higher education and culture as they renew and provide access to an invaluable heritage of ambitious, path-breaking work. Additional information is available at mellon.org. Lunder Institute for American Art Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the museum’s program, the Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby museum and partner institutions around the world. To advance critical and creative research in American art and related fields, the institute hosts a residential program for scholars and artists on campus and in downtown Waterville. Residencies are offered to graduate students, scholars, curators, and emerging and internationally renowned artists who may develop new site-specific works on campus and in the community.

Tess de Quincey performs in her characteristically off centre style.Credit:VSEVOLOD VLASKINE Articulate Project Space and the Platform events by De Quincey Co is a partnership that not only works well but also appears to inspire ideas and uses of the gallery's three levels, odd shapes, stairs and corners. Platform 2018 brought together dancers – mostly butoh based – musicians and visual artists in an invigorating mix curated by Tess de Quincey, Linda Luke and Marcus Whale. De Quincey also directed the audience in changing configurations as well as performing, cloaked by a hoodie, in her characteristically slow, off-centre style. Luke had an evolving piece partnered by rocks close to the size of bricks, which she manipulated and balanced as if they were floating. Raghav Handa appeared in a witty video in which his splendid Indian Maharajah costume was magically replaced by casual Western gear, then a dandified suit and on and on down to his undies. After that, the images were split up so he was wearing combinations of them in fast-moving changes, a reflection presumably of his and others' dizzying multicultural lifestyles. The video was made by Martin Fox, who also contributed a delightful video to a shadowplay presented by Farangis Nawroozi and Susan Doumit, from Iran and Syria. Ryuichi Fujimura danced vigorously with a bowl balanced on his head – alas, where I couldn't see him well, always a problem in a promenade audience, but the laughter on the faces of those who could, told me he was also funny, a rare quality in contemporary performance. Visual artist James McAllister and his musician daughter Audrey collaborated with senior dance performer Peter Fraser in an eerie other-worldly piece titled Explaining the Living to the Dead, a memorable inclusion. Karen Cummings sang with divine and lingering purity. Gary Warner made poetic sounds out of almost nothing, including small stones dropped down a hanging daisy chain of empty soft drink bottles. Jacques Emery played double bass and Marcus Whale harmonica and saxophone. And there was more in this refreshing glimpse of ideas in performance. I look forward to next year's.

(Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) Officials from the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s Mankato office said Monday the Highway 99 bridge at St. Peter remained opened but may have to close later in the week due to the rising river. (Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) The Minnesota River is rising, has forced the closure of three valley roadways. Minnesota Department of Transportation officials closed Hwy. 19 east of Henderson Saturday evening, then on Sunday issued the closure of Hwy. 93 south of Henderson, which celebrated its annual Sauerkraut Days over the weekend. Late Monday night, MnDOT Public Affairs Cooordinator Anne Wolff issued an email announcing the closing of Highway 93 from U.S. Highway 169 to Le Sueur due to flooding and the rising Minnesota River. Wolff had reported Monday morning that while Hwy. 93 from U.S. Hwy. 169 to Le Sueur remained open, its “closure (is) anticipated later today or early tomorrow (Tuesday).” And it did. Wolff also said department maintenance engineers continue to monitor “the potential closure near St. Peter” of Hwy. 99 east. Heavy rains in south central Minnesota on Sunday and Monday resulted in another one-foot increase in projected crest levels, according to MnDOT officials and “extended the expected duration of high water on the Minnesota River,” according to Wolff. The Minnesota River remains the District 7 MnDOT office’s “primary area of current impact,” Wolff reported. But it’s not the only southern Minnesota area recently impacted by heavy rains and rising waters. In the city of Blue Earth, MnDOT officials closed U.S. Hwy. 169 on Sunday afternoon after three to six inches of rain fell in about a one-hour period. That roadway, Wolff reported, later reopened after waters receded. MnDOT officials also had reduced lanes due to flooding on Hwy. 30 east of Mapleton and on Hwy. 4 by Sherburn on Friday. The Sherburn roadway closed on Saturday morning; approximately six inches of water remains on the highway on Monday, with water still rising, “and it could be awhile until water recedes,” Wolff said. MnDOT officials were monitoring the Minnesota River late last week and were suggesting that Hwys. 19 and 93 near Henderson were the most likely to close due to anticipated flooding. Originally, MnDOT said the rising river was expected to close Hwy. 93 into Le Sueur on Sunday. That closure occurred late Monday night. The eastern portion of Seven Mile Creek Park on Hwy. 169 in Nicollet County is also closed. Log jams carried and caused by the swift-moving current still potentially may cause problems at bridges in St. Peter, Le Sueur and Henderson, according to MnDOT officials. Visitors to Henderson’s Sauerkraut Days were as early as Friday were being encouraged to enter the community from the west on Hwy. 19. Regular travelers were also able to access the city from the north on Sibley County Road 6, commonly referred to as the Scenic Byway Road. Henderson chamber representatives suggested that the news of potential road closures might have held down attendance a bit, but it was the steady rains which more likely kept some away.

Andrew,Davis,1133,http://www.jwire.com.au/an-evening-with-sir-andrew-davis-anne-sophie-mutter-and-the-mso/,"News FeedCommentsDonate to J-Wire Digital Jewish news daily for Australia and New Zealand The Melbourne Symphony orchestra conducted by Sir Andrew Davis played a memorable concert on Saturday evening…writes Ron Jontof-Hutter. Ron Jontof-Hutter The program consisted of works that are not often played, with the exception of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto which was both refreshing and educative. The evening commenced with Igor Stravinsky’s “The Fairy’s Kiss,” based on Hans Christian Andersen’s tale. Commissioned in Paris by Ida Rubinstein in 1928, it marked the end of Stravinsky’s relationship with Diaghilev and his fabulous Ballets Russes, which was instrumental in establishing Stravinsky’s western career. Utilising materiel from early Tchaikovsky songs and piano pieces, Stravinsky pays homage to his predecessor, recalling fond childhood memories of attending concerts of Tchaikovsky’s music at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg with his father Feodor ,who apparently was also a coffin bearer at the great man’s funeral. Like Tchaikovsky who did not identify with the nationalist “The Five, “but looking more towards the cosmopolitan west , Stravinsky pays tribute to his hero from the start of the Divertimento with its Tchaikovskyesque style interspersed with “classic” Stravinsky. Sir Andrew elegantly brought out the best of the MSO with beautiful solos and ensemble work, reflected in the exposed soft spiccati in the upper strings, highlighting a graceful performance that delighted the audience. The star of the evening was undoubtedly Anne –Sophie Mutter. Generously supported by Marc Besen and Eva Besen, Ms Mutter is the MSO 2018 Soloist in Residence. Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto had a troubled history. He was infatuated with a violin student, Josef Kotek at the Moscow Conservatorium, who in turn became infatuated with another (female)student. Soon thereafter, a disappointed Tchaikovsky proposed to Antonina Milyukova. Their marriage lasted two months. Nonetheless Tchaikovsky and Kotek remained friends with the latter assisting in the development of the concerto. Initially dedicated to the celebrated virtuoso Leopold Auer, who considered it “unplayable,” Adolf Brodsky actually premiered it in Vienna in 1881 where the much feared critic Hanslick trashed it, referring to the concerto as “ vulgar… the smell of vodka … and music that stinks to the ear.” Anne-Sophie Mutter and Sir Andrew Davis Photo: Dan Aulsebrook Anne Sophie-Mutter’s performance was more characteristic of a rich and elegant glass of red, depicting many diverse flavours that were a delight to both the palate and olfactory system! Her playing exudes power with warmth and passion which she achieves with intelligent use and fullness of the bow to great effect. Her glissandi, prominent at the start are tasteful, enhancing the character of the piece that Tchaikovsky must surely have intended. Interestingly, Ms Mutter chose to play the second movement with a mute. This was very effective in bringing out the most of the Canzonetta’s song- like quality while blending beautifully with the woodwind integrating the right balance. The sotto voce quality of the opening melody was enhanced by the very effective use of non-vibrato playing, followed by a more intense vibrato, yet always maintaining the balance of power and restraint. Following the beautiful Canzonetta, Ms Mutter played the final “allegro vivacissimo” movement, emphasising its “vivacissimo” character at an unusually blistering speed and pace with the orchestra in tow. Anne-Sophie Mutter connected very well with the MSO and audience. She received a standing ovation from an appreciative full house and graciously thanked Mr and Mrs Besen for their philanthropic support. Her warmth and appreciation of the Melbourne audience was certainly mutual. After the interval ,Ms Mutter played John Williams’ “Markings” for violin, strings and harp. Written for her in 2017, Williams, famous for Oscar nominated film music, departs from his usual melodious tunes and here writes in an atonal style that is both intimate and extroverted. “Markings” brings out diverse and extreme sonorities from the g-string and ending at the violin’s highest range which Ms Mutter sustained with power and richness in sound to its conclusion. Anne-Sophie Mutter is not only a wonderful ambassador for Germany but also for music. She has an interest in promoting newly commissioned pieces and also engages with aspiring violinists through master classes. Her visit to Australia has certainly been inspiring in various ways, hopefully to be repeated. The evening ended with Carl Nielsen’s Third Symphony, “Sinfonia espansiva.” Written in 1911, the year of his violin concerto, the death of his contemporary Mahler, and with Elgar establishing himself in England, Nielsen’s Third Symphony became his first European success with him conducting the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. The first movement starts dramatically with twenty-six Morse code like strikes, which he described as a “gust of energy and life affirmation blown out into the wide world.” Nielsen utilised the Brahms symphonic forms especially the developing variations principle whereby an original seed theme develops into variations and new motifs. The second movement, Andante pastorale, recalls Nielsen’s childhood on the Danish rural island of Funen. Idyllic and ambivalent with minor and major keys, the Andante includes a baritone and soprano in orchestral roles singing a wordless vocalise. Nielsen described this movement as the mood that one could imagine in Paradise before the fall of our first parents, Adam and Eve. Nielsen created this rich and ethereal movement to reflect impressionism in painting. In contrast to the first movement with its energy and inconclusive resolution, the second movement is sublime, tender and beautiful. It was played at Nielsen’s funeral. The third movement depicts the conflict between good and evil while the final movement is a hymn to work, happiness and daily activities. Nielsen was prone to bouts of depression including diminished energy. However, he insisted that this symphony was not programmatic, but a private matter between the music and himself. Nielsen’s other contemporary Sigmund Freud, stated that a healthy life consisted of a balance between “lieben und arbeiten, (loving and working) which is what Nielsen appears to express in this hymn. Nielsen said that “music is the sound of life.” He was also an important bridge between romantic and post romantic music which would set the stage for Schoenberg and his Second Viennese School. Sir Andrew conducted this symphony with insight and sensitivity, dispensing with the baton. Engaging deeply with the orchestra, paying attention to detail, nuances and dynamics, Sir Andrew continued to bring out the best of the MSO which the audience and musicians clearly enjoyed and appreciated. Nielsen’s compositions are not often played outside Denmark as they deserve to be. Exposing audiences to Nielsen and the other “unconventional” pieces in this concert, is both artistically desirable and educative for which the MSO deserves credit.

Not only will the Titans walk into Farah's return match provided he is selected first-up by Tigers coach Ivan Cleary, it will be a unique match not just for them, but for the NRL as well. Farah returns to the club from which he was shown the door amid controversy in 2016 while Moses Mbye will play his first match in the black and gold after his mid-season transfer from the Canterbury Bulldogs. That means the pair will have played their final game for their previous clubs against the Titans and their ""first"" match for their new club against the Titans as well. The Titans have played South Sydney with Farah at hooker (round 14), the Bulldogs with Mbye at fullback (round 15) and now the Tigers in round 16 with both players lining up against them for a second time. Farah did not play for the Rabbitohs in round 15. Yet while Mbye will be a threat in the backs, it is the wily Farah that the Titans must prepare for. ""I'm sure the fans there suffered an emotional toll when he was shown the door so I'm sure all the diehard Tigers fans will be out there cheering for them and particularly welcoming him [Farah] home,"" Titans centre Dale Copley said on Monday. ""He was a very important part of the club for a very long time and played a big part in their 2005 premiership. ""He's definitely still a threat on the field. He was playing behind probably the form hooker of the competition in Damien Cook at Souths, so the fact he wasn't getting a run there was more a reflection of how Cook was going, not Robbie Farah. ""He'll be very keen to get back to playing regular first-grade football and particularly at the Tigers, a club that would mean a lot to him considering the time he spent there. ""He's a crafty number nine who has seen it all and offers a kicking game out of dummy half on the left foot and he will provide some threats that will be new to the Tigers."" Titans fullback Michael Gordon says that while it is rare to be playing Farah and Mbye in different jerseys in the same month, it just shows what rugby league is all about these days with the number of playing transfers after the Telstra Premiership has begun. He is wary of the Tigers' form and enthusiasm they have displayed before the return of Farah came into the mix. ""I'm sure the hill will be full and the crowd will be very vocal; they always are at Leichhardt,"" he said. ""They're a tough team in good form as it is, but then Farah comes back and there's an extra element of emotion to it now. ""I feel we have been building well I the past four to six weeks and it's been little lapses in games here and there that have costs us the results that we have wanted. ""But I feel we're building to where we want to go, and this will be a good test for us, coming off the bye. ""We know we will be a better team at the back end of the year than the start and it’s going that way but results are becoming more crucial now."" Wests Tigers are two points ahead of the Titans on the competition ladder and will be desperate for a victory to stay in touch with the top eight.

Andrew,Davis,1123,https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/06/21/alzheimers-climb/,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — On this longest day of the year, a Minnesota man shined light on a disease that robbed him of his father. Andrew Davis is raising awareness for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia by using his love of the outdoors. “We were facing temperatures from anywhere between minus-20 to minus-50 [degrees] … with really high winds,” Davis said. He braved impossible conditions to climb the largest peak in North America. “We were on the mountain for 19 days, and thankfully we summited on day 17, so 19 days entirely on snow and ice,” he said. Davis climbed Denali in honor of his dad, Woods Davis. Andrew Davis (credit: CBS) “My father passed away four years ago from complications of frontal temporal dementia after being diagnosed for three years, and it was a very painful process,” Davis said. Davis’ dad was the person who first introduced him to the outdoors. He uses the pain from his death to push forward in the name of research. “Climbing for a Cure” is his blend of his passion for mountaineering with his passion for advocacy. “This is the fourth year in a row that I’ve climbed a significant mountain in honor of my father, and to try to make an impact with the Alzheimer’s Association,” Davis said. Alzheimer’s is the most expensive disease in America. In 2018, it will cost our nation $277 billion. By 2050, these cost could rise as high as $1.1 trillion. “It’s the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, but it’s the only-leading cause of death in the top ten … where there is no prevention, no treatment and no cure,” Davis said. He said raising awareness on the longest day of the year is meant to honor those living with the disease and their caregivers, for whom every day is the longest day of the year.

Andrew,Davis,1123,https://news.uga.edu/residency-program-graduates/,"Many of the new doctors will stay in Georgia Georgia needs more doctors. In fact, the entire country does. The University of Georgia and Augusta University are working to address this need. In June, 10 residents from the initial class of the Medical College of Georgia at the Augusta University/ University of Georgia Medical Partnership Internal Residency Program marched in recognition of finishing their three-year residency program. Each was surrounded by their family members, mentors and other physicians who guided them along the way. Several graduates accepted positions in the state. According to a 2017 study by the American Association of Medical Colleges, the U.S. is expected to face a shortage of between 40,800–104,900 doctors by 2030. This is fueled by a growing population, and an increase in the amount of aging Americans and retiring physicians. And in order to meet the national average of 36.6 physicians per 100,000 people, Georgia needs an additional 1,456 graduate medical education positions in various specialties such as family medicine, internal medicine and general surgery. The Internal Medicine Residency Program, a joint effort of the AU/UGA Medical Partnership and St. Mary’s Health Care System, received accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in January 2014, becoming Athens’ first medical residency program. This program takes three years to complete and concentrates on producing community-based physicians. Since the inception of the Medical Partnership residency program, an additional internal residency program has been established at Piedmont Athens Regional bringing an additional 15 residents to the Athens community each year. Combining the two programs, the total number of resident positions in Athens is now 85. Following graduation from UGA, Brian Brewer knew he wanted to attend the Medical College of Georgia at the AU/ UGA Medical Partnership in Athens. Attracted to the smaller class size with active learning methods, he was a member of the second class of graduating physicians. Resident Dr. Brian Brewer checks on patient May Chafin of Crawford, Ga during the first weeks of his residency at St. Mary’s Hospital. Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA Photo This month marks the achievement of another one of Brewer’s milestones: He graduated from the AU/ UGA Medical Partnership Internal Medicine Residency Program, where he also happened to be a member of the inaugural residency class. “I wanted to be hands on from the beginning,” Brewer said. “I knew that by being at a new program I would be first in line for all the training activities. In addition, the strong connections to the city that I made in undergrad, as well as in medical school, afforded me the opportunities to organize rotations around my professional interests.” Following graduation, Brewer will complete a sports medicine fellowship at the University of Kentucky Medical School. As a former running back for the Georgia Bulldogs, this is a natural fit for the physician. Brewer said that he received a lot of support from the team physicians at UGA while pursuing his career in sports medicine. There are many challenges to starting a graduate medical education program including funding, the need for a teaching hospital, and the perceptions of medical staff as well as their willingness to take on additional duties and responsibilities. “I’m grateful for the partnership we found with St. Mary’s Healthcare Systems,” said Dr. Shelley Nuss, Medical Partnership campus dean. “Without their help, the residency program would have never come to fruition. It takes commitment and dedication not only from the community physicians and hospital leadership, but from every employee that is part of the organization.” Studies have shown that residency programs help states retain their medical school graduates. According to a 2014 survey by the Georgia Board for Physician Workforce, Georgia kept 80 percent of those students who went to high school, medical school and completed their residency in the state. This has proven to be true with this inaugural residency class. Out of the 10 residents graduating from the Medical Partnership Internal Residency Program, three will remain in the Athens area. Dr. Andrew Ke will work at as a hospitalist at St. Mary’s Hospital, Dr. Narayana Gowda will be the Chief Resident at the AU/ UGA Medical Partnership Residency Program and Dr. Akhil Reddy will be the Chief Resident at Piedmont Athens Regional. Three more of the program’s graduates will return to Athens to practice in the upcoming year. Dr. Christina Elstead will be joining Athens OB/GYN, Dr. Parker Smith will join Piedmont Athens Regional as an emergency care physician, and Dr. Chip Carnes is joining Athens Urology Group. Brewer also plans to return to Athens after his fellowship., “I have now lived in Athens longer than anywhere in my life. I consider it home. I feel that I could provide a lot of service to the area in the field of non-operative orthopedics, as well as preventative care” he said. “I am excited to see the impact our class will have on the field of medicine.” The graduates: A list of graduates and their destinations include:

Michael,Gordon,1122,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article213582519.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com June 22, 2018 10:44 AM In what may be literally described as a court fight over nitpicking, two Charlotte companies are at the center of a patent dispute concerning the treatment of head lice. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Pediatric Hair Solutions Corp. and partner FloSonix Ventures LLC, which share the same south Charlotte address, stand accused of illegally copying a patented technology that involves the shooting of hot air onto the scalp to eradicate the pests. The tool, originally developed by scientists at the University of Utah, was first marketed, colorfully, as ""the LouseBuster."" It now goes by the more gentrified ""AirAlle',"" and is built and sold by Larada Sciences Inc. of Murray, Utah. Larada says it received protective patents on its device dating back to 2010. Now it's accusing Pediatric Hair Solutions, which bills itself as the Carolinas' only licensed medical provider for head-lice treatment, of infringing upon those patents. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Pediatric's Owner, Sheila Fasser, said during a Thursday phone interview that the allegations are baseless. ""I vehemently deny I copied anything,"" she said before referring additional questions to her attorney. According to lawsuit, Larada developed its breakthrough technology more than a decade ago. The company claims that the original LouseBuster was the first lice treatment that did not involve either the use of harsh chemicals, to which the critters have developed a resistance and many patients remain averse; or the time-honored ritual of nitpicking, in which the tiny lice eggs — known as nits — are manually and painstakingly removed from their moorings near the scalp. Business appears to be booming due to a simple fact. Despite decades of medical advances, head lice keep hanging on. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that up to 12 million infestations occur every year among U.S. children ages 3 to 11. The pests can spread through homes or classrooms with the touch of an infected head. Once established, females lay up to six eggs a day. Once hatched and hooked in with the use of its claws, a louse can live for up to 30 days, feeding on its host's blood. Larada says it has more than 250 license and franchise agreements across the United States, with 200 clinics using the AirAlle' to treat patients. Pediatric Hair Solutions was among those clients, the lawsuit says. Fassler even appeared in a 2012 YouTube video extolling the safety and effectiveness of the LouseBuster, describing it as ""the final solution"" to lice infestation, the lawsuit says. In its complaint, Larada alleges that the Charlotte firm used Larada expertise and technology to build a lice-treatment practice that grew to nine clinics — including eight in the Carolinas — by 2017. That all began to change in March of that year, the lawsuit says. First, Larada severed the lease agreement with Fassler's company when Pediatric Hair Solutions stopped making its AirAlle' lease payments, the lawsuit says. That same year, the Charlotte clinic began advertising a ""very similar"" device on its website called ""the FloSonix."" As with the AirAlle', the FloSonix shoots hot air of up to 200 degrees to clear an infected area. The Pediatric Hair Solutions website says that its treatment combining a liquid solution to kill live bugs followed by a hot air treatment to wipe out the eggs is 99 percent effective. The site also include a prominent photograph of the FloSonix in action. The lawsuit claims the Charlotte defendants developed, manufactured and marketed their knock-off device while ""recklessly disregarding"" Larada's existing patents. The Utah company is asking the courts for triple damages and a jury trial. It also wants wants the Charlotte companies to ""destroy or deliver"" all the products, documents and marketing plans that may be violating Larada's patents.

Roy Cooper is “playing the bias card” is yet another cheap shot at anyone who stands up to the Republican attempts to make their reign permanent. As one of the thousands of people who have contributed to Gov. Cooper’s campaign and who supports his “agenda,” I, a furious old, white educated woman, will continue to do so until we rid this state of the horrible racial and economic bias blatantly reflected in Republican efforts to restrict voting, Medicaid, textbooks, and our right to clean water and air. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Bobbie Zamora, Shelby In response to “Why another push for voter ID? (June 21 Forum): I think Forum writer Jill Blumenthal misses what Tim Moore and the Republican-controlled legislature really have in mind. If they can get voter ID on the November ballot, conservative leaning, Trump-voting North Carolina will probably approve it. Then, of course, it winds up in the court system and has a full two years to make it to the conservative Supreme Court, where it stands a very good chance of becoming law. Give Tim Moore and the Republicans credit. I think their tactic is sheer genius. I just wish Democrats were as expert. Bonner Mills, Mount Holly In response to Our View “Donald Trump’s push for a whiter America” (June 21): Thursday’s editorial was a five-column assault on Donald Trump and any one who may feel he is a force for good in this country. I know you hate Trump, we all get that. However, many Americans believe the POTUS is doing what should have been done by the previous POTUS. Now, wages are rising, jobs are being created, blacks are seeing the lowest unemployment levels ever, regulations have been reduced so jobs can be created, VA changes for the better have been enacted, TPP has been terminated, the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, and on and on. Michael Nellenbach, Indian Land, S.C. Article I Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution clearly says it is the duty of Congress to enact uniform rules for naturalization. Our members of Congress do not have the guts to do their job. They are afraid to make a decision for fear they will not be re-elected. They are letting our country drift downhill while they sit around and blame someone else for the declining state of our democracy. Shame on them, each and every one of them. Be a man/woman. Do your job. Bob Burroughs, Charlotte The time has come for the print and broadcast media to point all of its weapons at a dysfunctional Congress. We criticize our presidents, especially President Obama and President Trump, over excessive power leading to executive orders. Many of these orders exist because of our cowardly Congress, which passed the power on to the president. As Congress abdicates its authority our presidents will gradually become dictators. A lot of print and broadcast time is spent on Trump. Spend the same time and effort investigating Congress. Why is Congress inept, self-serving and non-compromising? Do your duty, free press. William Kouri, Charlotte Regarding family separation and President Trump – it’s too late, the damage has been done. Thousands of children’s lives have been brutally traumatized. Hundreds of families have been literally destroyed. Working relationships of several allied nations have been eternally strained. The world’s view of America has been tarnished and smeared. This ploy was effective; now who wants to come to America! Leonard Jarvis, Concord In response to “Mom’s boyfriend pleads guilty in girl’s death; mom pleads guilty in son’s” (June 20): I cried when I read Michael Gordon’s article on the death of two little children. I also felt nauseated to think that these monsters could even do these horrific acts to helpless children. Our laws must be changed to protect these babies from criminal actions. The automatic punishment should be life without parole. No plea deals. They should never be released to carry out these unspeakable actions. How in God’s name do these killers sleep at night?

Michael,Gordon,1122,http://www.classical-music.com/blog/trip-oranjewoud-festival,"Classical-Music.com The official website of BBC Music Magazine Freya Parr visits the Friesian festival that’s taking inspiration from its incredible surroundings It is rare to listen back to an interview recording and be transported back to the space in such an impactful way. The recordings from my trip to Oranjewoud Festival in the north of the Netherlands are all accompanied by the overwhelming noise of birds chirping, delivering me straight back to the beautiful Dutch landscape. Artistic director Yoram Ish-Hurwitz says this sound has become an intrinsic part of the concert series they run every year in the small village of Oranjewoud, home to the former summer residence of the royal family. ‘In our outdoor concerts, birds fly overhead,’ he tells me on our walk around the festival site. ‘We have a lot of woodpeckers and owls. On the opening night, we commissioned a composer to write a piece and she intentionally left several pauses throughout the piece, but of course here it is never really silent. It was an opportunity for the birds to come in and be part of the music.’ The surroundings really make this festival what it is. I visited the festival on one of its quieter days, which meant that I got the opportunity to explore the grounds and all the exceptionally varied concert venues. From an underground bunker used in the Cold War to a contemporary art gallery straddling the canal via the Dutch royal family’s orangery, the spaces are eclectic and full of character. Photo by: Freya Parr Yoram Ish-Hurwitz discussed the point at which he began to diversify the concert venues and programming: ‘When we started in 2012 we used only the older houses and the museum, and it was a very small, traditional festival. We started pushing the boundaries with a percussion concert in the woods, featuring Michael Gordon’s percussion sextet, Timber, using logs which made different sounds.’ Ish-Hurwitz’s experimental style has meant that the festival has become more of an immersive multi-sensory experience than a regular concert series. Although there is a main programme of concerts, there is also an event called ‘The Night of the Park’, in which guests move in groups from one performance space to another. Photo by: Lucas Kemper Surprise performances take place along the paths between the main venues, Ish-Hurwitz explains. ‘There will be musicians with traditional instruments performing with body sensors that will distort the sound, and within a hidden area of forest a singer will perform, beckoning people in to join her with an old copper megaphone. We’ve included lots of surprises along the way. I call these performers fireflies and moths, because they appear so quickly and are gone again before you know it.’ It really is quite a magical setup. There is also an area of food and drink stalls with a stage in which everyone from the main programme plays for 15 minutes. This part of the festival is free, meaning that children are invited after school, and families oftencome and enjoy the music for a whole evening. It is called the ‘Proeftuin’, which loosely translates as ‘the garden of delights’, but Yoram and I decide that this sounds too much like an all-you-can-eat buffet! Photo by: Jantina Talsma One of the more innovative concert spaces I was introduced to was the bubble. Created by artists Marco Canevacci and Yena Young of Plastique Fantastique, a studio that creates temporary structures to engage with the natural surroundings, it is an inflatable concert venue. I was not expecting such a dramatic change in acoustic when entering the bubble – it was like no sound I’d ever heard before. Speech sounded strange enough, but then a musician started playing the soprano saxophone in the space and I was tranfixed. The sound was completely otherworldly. ‘It’s a really artificial environment inside the bubble, but then the trees cast shadows over it, creating a lovely contrast of the natural and unnatural,’ says Yoram Ish-Hurwitz. He’s entirely right – it’s a stunning structure before you even consider the incredible acoustic potential inside. Photo by: Freya Parr ‘This is a place where you can experiment,’ says Ish-Hurwitz, with real excitement and pride. ‘You can put on a pilot series and see how it works – then you can take things on and use them in future or disregard them.’ Over the years, both the musical genres and the venues have diversified. ‘Although we have traditional concerts too, which I think are very important, we have taken the festival beyond the boundaries of classical music. We spend too much time deciding what can be deemed ‘classical music’, whereas actually classical music is just what is considered worthy in hindsight, with the benefit of historical perspective. What stands the test of time is truly classical. We need to stop worrying and start embracing all genres and all forms and experimenting with where and how they intersect.’ Photo by: Freya Parr Radio 3 broadcasts classical music, jazz, world music, new music, arts programmes and drama.

John,O'Neil,1121,http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-nws-forks-township-zoning-hearing-20180621-story.html,"A developer seeking a rezoning in Forks Township in order to build apartments will make his case before township supervisors next month. Bethlehem developer Richard Bartolacci, who filed suit against the township late last year over where apartments are allowed under its zoning map, will go before the board for a zoning hearing. The hearing will be held during the supervisors’ meeting at 7 p.m. July 19 at the municipal complex at 1606 Sullivan Trail. Solicitor Wendy Nicolosi said Thursday the hearing was continued because of the unavailability this month of members of Bartolacci’s team, as well as township Supervisor John O’Neil. “They want to be able to present to the entire board,” she said. Bartolacci is proposing a rezoning of 38 acres west of Sullivan Trail and north of Uhler Road and Braden Airpark to allow for upscale apartments, including 548 units, as well as retail uses and more than 1,100 parking spaces. Problems with the township’s zoning ordinance came to light in 2017, when the township’s settlement with Woodside Associates allowed the developer to build multifamily units on seven acres at Sullivan Trail and Meco Road in the town center district. After that, supervisors sought to insulate themselves from further legal challenges, known as curative amendments, by amending the township’s zoning map to specify where in the township apartments would be allowed. Bartolacci’s curative amendment, filed in court last November, effectively beat the township to the wire before it adopted changes to its zoning map, which came in December. The revisions allow apartments along Sullivan Trail north of Forks Avenue in the town center zoning district, and east of Kesslersville Road/north of Newlins Drive. Density limits were set at 15 dwelling units per acre, with buildings capped at 2½ stories or 35 feet in height. Representatives of Bartolacci then went before the township last February with a conceptual proposal for apartments north of the airport, which require a rezoning to move forward.

Mnuchin attempted to quell growing uncertainty within Congress as President Trump ratchets up a trade war with China. It if the trade war's toll on the economy hasn't been seen yet, recent data from a CFO survey conducted by CNBC suggests the economic hit is coming. And Congress took notice of that data during Mnuchin's hearing. ""CNBC does a survey of CFOs of major U.S. companies and 65 percent have reported that they fear U.S. trade policy will negatively impact their firms over the next six months. How does the administration think about business uncertainty as it calculates its trade policy?"" Republican congressman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, asked Mnuchin. ""I can assure you that the President is very much focused on economic growth and I can also assure you that I am motoring the situation very carefully,"" Mnuchin told Hensarling. ""We have not yet seen any negative impact."" Trade uncertainty has risen to be the biggest risk for corporations, according to the latest CNBC Global CFO Council quarterly survey. To that point, 35 percent of global CFOs say U.S. trade policy is the biggest external risk their company faces, up from 27 percent in Q1 and tripling from the 11.6 percent who cited trade policy in the fourth quarter of 2017. Amid strong gross domestic product and job growth and profit-friendly corporate tax cuts, nearly 65 percent of North American CFO respondents said U.S. trade policy is likely to negatively impact their firms over the next six months; 20 percent of CFOs indicated the impact would be ""very negative."" Sixty-six percent of Asia-Pacific region CFOs expect a negative impact on their firms. ""What is interesting is business leaders as well as investors don't like uncertainty, and I think we are being exposed to an abnormal amount of sausage-making in the process,"" said MongoDB CFO and CNBC Global CFO Council member Michael Gordon on CNBC's Worldwide Exchange earlier this week. The uncertainty has taken a toll on stocks. Seven of the 16 biggest Dow declines this year appear to have been sparked by trade concerns, according to CNBC data. There have been 35 moves of 1 percent or more in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, 12 of which CNBC found were entirely or substantially related to trade-related news. There has been an even greater rattling of global markets. Still, 60 percent of North American CFOs say the full benefits of the Trump tax cuts remain, regardless of the trade risks. Forty percent say that uncertainty around trade is hurting their firm's ability to take full advantage of tax reform. And despite the trade uncertainty, the CFO Council's global economic outlook remains rosy. Not one global region was seen as worse than ""stable"" for the sixth straight quarter. The United States was seen as ""improving"" for the eighth straight quarter. (Note: The CNBC Global CFO Council represents some of the largest public and private companies in the world, collectively managing more than $4.5 trillion in market capitalization across a wide variety of sectors. Forty-three of the 103 current members of the CNBC Global CFO Council responded to this quarter's survey, including 20 North American-based members, 17 EMEA-based members and 6 APAC-based members.

Michael,Gordon,1118,https://www.goodreturns.co.nz/article/976506703/construction-slump-slows-gdp.html,"by Dan Dunkley Residential, non-residential and other construction fell 1% in the quarter to March, as the overall economy grew by a lacklustre 0.5%. Leading economists said the figures were a troubling sign for the country. The Reserve Bank and Treasury had both forecast 0.7% growth for the period. The figures did not impress economists at the major banks. ANZ chief economist Liz Kendall said 0.5% GDP growth meant New Zealand’s economy had grown “a bit below trend”. She said it was likely the country’s economy would “struggle to achieve strong growth rates from here”. The slowdown could boost borrowers, however, with interest rates likely to remain on hold for a longer period. ANZ said it believed the lacklustre growth would impact the Reserve Bank’s thinking. Kendall added: “In the current climate interest rates will remain on hold for some time yet.” ASB was slightly more upbeat about the country's growth prospects. The bank’s economists said they “expect stronger growth in Q2” as forward looking indicators suggest the Q1 weakness was ""temporary"". The bank believes there will not be an OCR rate increase until “at least August 2019”, in light of Thursday's data. Meanwhile, Westpac’s Michael Gordon said the New Zealand economy had “lost some momentum in recent times, with growth in the last three quarters barely exceeding population growth.” He said the subdued growth could be partly attributed to “uncertainty about the new government’s policies”. Gordon described the slowdown in construction as the “biggest drag” on the economy, something that was exacerbated by the end of rebuilding after the Kaikoura earthquake.

Steve,Cummings,1117,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/grivko-becomes-new-ukrainian-time-trial-champion-news-shorts/,"Dimension Data take fourth place in Adriatica TTT despite six-man team, Nino Solari passes away Astana's Andriy Grivko became the 2018 Ukrainian national time trial champion on Wednesday, winning the 40km test against the clock in Bohuslav. Grivko, 34, who won a stage and the overall title at the 2016 La Méditerranéenne stage race, took both the Ukrainian time trial and road race titles in 2012, and now has the possibility of again doing the national double. The Ukrainian began his career in 2005 with Italian team Domina Vacanze, and went on to ride for German outfit Milram for three seasons, from 2006 to 2008. After a season with ISD, Grivko joined Astana in 2010, and has ridden for the Kazakh team ever since. He was banned from racing by the UCI for 45 days during the 2017 season for punching German sprinter Marcel Kittel in the face on a stage of the Dubai Tour, after objecting to the way Kittel had pushed in front of him while fighting for position in the race's crosswinds. Dimension Data rode to fourth place in the team time trial opening stage of the Adriatica Ionica Race in Lido di Jesolo on Wednesday, despite starting the race with only six riders rather than the permitted seven. Britain's Steve Cummings was initially listed in the team's starting line-up, but was a non-starter in Piave, in Italy's Veneto region, at the new UCI 2.1-ranked stage race on Wednesday. The squad includes Mark Cavendish and his lead-out man Mark Renshaw, who will be fine-tuning their sprint tactics at the race before the start of the Tour de France on July 7. ""If you look over the entire performance, the team did a good job considering we were the only team with six riders on the start line,"" said Dimension Data sports director Jean-Pierre Heynderickx. ""On a course like this, with one less rider, you pay a bit at the end. So to end in fourth position definitely wasn't a bad result for us."" Quick-Step Floors won the opening stage, with sprinter Elia Viviani their first man over the line to take the lead in the new five-day race, which continues with a 152.5km road stage on Thursday. Nino Solari, an influential figure in Australian cycling throughout the late 20th and early 21st centuries, passed away in Adelaide this week at the age of 80. Solari affected and influenced the careers of a number of elite Australian cyclists, and in particular many of those who followed a path via the Australian Institute of Sport. He was instrumental in setting up an AIS presence in Varese in his native Italy, which allowed a number of cyclists to taste European racing before going on to race on the continent as professionals. Solari emigrated from Italy to Australia in 1955, and became the South Australian track champion in 1960, reported Adelaide's The Advertiser newspaper. Later, he became a coach, and managed national teams that included the likes of 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans and 2007 Paris-Roubaix winner Stuart O'Grady. Kathy Watt, Olympic road race champion in Barcelona in 1992, posted on Nino's son David Solari's Facebook page: ""Very sorry to hear the sad news. Condolences to you and your family. I can remember Nino as a real character on trips away with national teams, and cooking for the AIS when I first came to AIS Adelaide. He loved cycling and helping many young riders who remember him fondly."" © Immediate Media Company Ltd. 2017 The website is owned and published by Immediate Media Company Limited.

Search archives Search Yukoners will have to dig a little deeper into their pockets on Canada Day By Palak Mangat on June 20, 2018 Yukoners will have to dig a little deeper into their pockets on Canada Day if they want to enjoy booze in the territory – but not draught beer, the premier assured Tuesday. A letter sent by the Yukon Liquor Corp. (YLC) to wholesale licensees late last week which laid out some of the details of the planned price increases. The letter from the YLC shows that increases to both retail and wholesale alcohol will take effect July 1. Table wine is expected to see a slight decrease in average by about 13 cents a bottle. Hard liquor will increase on average by more than $2 a bottle. The letter also indicates that packed beers and ciders will rise on average by about 38 cents while draught beer and ciders will be bumped up by 27 cents per liter. That stands in contrast to what Premier Sandy Silver told the Star Tuesday afternoon, when he suggested his government did not approve a specific increase. “When it comes to this, I want to be very clear: we’re not increasing the price of draught beer,” Silver said. He noted that the government has asked the YLC to communicate this to restaurants and the public. While he said the corporation is sometimes affected by market price changes, Silver reassured Yukoners that there was “no decision made by us to increase the price of draught beer.” The letter, sent by Steve Cummings, the YLC’s director of operations, says that come July, prices “will reflect current supplier pricing, freight, excise, duty, revised mark-up, cost of service differential, liquor tax and other fees and deposits.” While the territory’s official Opposition party may not be questioning that justification, it said the issue raises questions about the level of communication between departments. “I think price fluctuations are normal,” admitted Stacey Hassard, the Yukon Party’s interim leader. But with less than two weeks left until the Canada Day long weekend, Hassard wondered whether “the government is either trying or sneak this increase through, or they have no idea what they’re doing with their departments.” Meanwhile, Silver continued to offer clarification on the planned hikes, suggesting the opposition party’s release may be misleading. “I think the Yukon Party has really gone out on a limb,” he said, maintaining that his government did not approve any hike to the price of the specific type of beer. He added he was “not going to be speaking on behalf of other price changes.” The impacts of the hike will be felt strongly, according to some local bar and restaurant representatives. A Whitehorse general manager of a bar, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed to the Star that the hike could have negative impacts on both the business and consumers. The manager added that staff had only heard about the increases through media reports. “That leads back to my comment about certainty and business,” said Hassard. He said he is disappointed, as there seems to be a “disconnect somewhere” between the YLC and government. CBC Yukon obtained an email written by the owners of Dirty Northern and The Miner’s Daughter, which has a location on Main Street. Sent to the premier, John Streicker, the minister responsible for the YLC, and YLC president Matt King, it estimated the hikes could cost their business up to $3,000. Nobody from the liquor corporation – including King – was made available to the Star either Tuesday afternoon or all of this morning to comment on the round of price increases and their impacts on businesses and consumers. Years ago, the liquor corporation issued news releases explaining any price increases in its products. Now, its price boosts are unannounced. Up 0 Down 0 @ reality Booze is a tremendous strain on the social safety net. Alcohol related illnesses and deaths are a massive problem in Canada and even more so in the Yukon. I’m all for taxing the hell out of booze and tobacco. People who choose to use cost us all. Up 5 Down 0 I don't know how anyone could be losing money when alcohol is marked up so much. Buy a 5oz glass of wine in the restaurant or bar and it's usually about $6-7/glass, or more, on a bottle of wine that costs you $10 at the store. Don't even get me started on the mark up of 1oz of hard liquor. We all know that any increase would only directly affect the customer. And, I am not naïve, I know that there is overhead, but I really don't think it's the liquor that they are losing on--it's likely trying to keep up with the continuing increasing costs of rent, power, etc. Up 6 Down 1 But beer is really expensive in the Yukon. Up 5 Down 5 Still cheaper then Gas. if these little increases are going to break the bank, then perhaps you should stop drinking. Everything else moves up in price, why all the hoopla on few cents. I remember when draft was a $1.00 and a hi-ball or beer was $2.50, every price hike the bar industry proclaimed there customers would face hardship and it would be bad for business, yet they are still here still thriving and creating social problems like the have been doing since they were first invented. If you don't like the prices, don't buy, better yet make your own, its not that hard. Up 8 Down 0 What's really crazy is that our local brewers only have to haul up the ingredients to make their fine brews without having to haul up water. Their tasty beers should be very low cost but oddly are as expensive as beers from Outside. That's just nuts. And then throw on a carbon sin tax on top of regular sin taxes and it's nothing more than a sleazy cash grab. Bottom line, having a low cost locally brewed beer is not and never will be a sin. Up 22 Down 1 ...."" ' Hassard wondered whether “the government is either trying or sneak this increase through, or they have no idea what they’re doing with their departments.' "" I think it's the latter Stacey.... Y'know, I, like plenty of others, voted these guys in for a change. Sandys a good guy, but man, this next territorial election, this group is going to get booted out of office so hard it'll hurt to sit down for a week. Up 13 Down 1 I can understand that there might be an increase in price but a couple weeks before Canada Day is bs. Plus, when you don’t get a proper explanation from anyone then there’s gonna be problems, especially if your gonna lose money from the customers not buying another beer. Sorry to go off topic a little bit at the same time regarding prices and shipping or as they state freight which a lot of companies use as an excuse, I was looking for a new vehicle and decided to visit a local dealership. They quoted me a price then I decided to check down south. Well, another dealership south quoted me 10 thousand dollars difference in price, all said and done. When talking to the dealership in Whitehorse again they told me sales tax, freight and so on. So who is telling the truth? Up 16 Down 2 Each year YLC profits are going up according to their posted annual reports. But apparently our Liberal government needs even more money from consumers. Booze prices will be increased again when the truckers increase their prices due to the (revenue neutral) carbon tax...another brilliant Liberal inflation builder. I suspect the government marijuana enterprise will not generate the revenue they are hoping for and YG's cost of sales will be much greater than anticipated, so $8/gram is just a starting point for the retail price of pot. It will go higher. Up 27 Down 1 Fact: Canadians pay 5x more beer tax than their American neighbours. Fact: 47% of the price of beer is government tax. Fact: The escalating beer tax is going to keep going up. On their drink of choice, middle class Canadians already pay enough tax. Yet, the government has passed an automatic escalator tax on beer that will: Happen in perpetuity every year! Without a vote! Forever increasing taxes on Canadian hospitality. axethebeertax.ca Up 27 Down 4 Getting harder and harder for an average working person to afford the odd cold beer after work or a nice glass of wine for a special dinner. For many though, with good jobs with our number one Yukon employer, they won't even notice this or any other increase in taxes, so-called sin or not. The have and have-not divide grows, not good Liberals. In order to encourage thoughtful and responsible discussion, website comments will not be visible until a moderator approves them.

Andrew,Davis,1114,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/MUSIC-Out-musician-Dave-Koz-releases-his-own-Summer-sequel/63240.html,"On June 22, he'll drop Summer Horns II: From A to Z, five years after releasing Summer Horns, a Grammy-nominated album that paid tribute to classic songs featuring killer horn sections. ""From A to Z"" features collaborations with musicians such as Gerald Albright, Rick Braun, Richard Elliot and Aubrey Logan, with guest vocalists Jonathan Butler, Kenny Lattimore, Sheleaand Gloria Estefan; songs include remakes of everything from the late Natalie Cole's ""This Will Be ( An Everlasting Love )"" to the oft-covered classic ""Route 66."" The conversation picks up after Windy City Times and Koz exchanged pleasantries. Windy City Times: Since the last time we talked, in 2015, there's been a massive change in the political landscape. Dave Koz: Yes, that's true. No comment. [Laughs] So that's kept you busy, I'm sure; I hope you're not going insane. WCT: I'm trying not to. Now, this new album is a sequel. What led to Summer Horns II: From A to Z? DK: Well, the last time we did it was five years ago. The first Summer Horns project was like a one-offjust a little project. We did two tours of summer shows behind that and had such a blast. In the back of my head, I knew we would do another album; we were just waiting for the right timeand it seemed like late last year was the right [time] to do it for this summer. One of our principals from the last go-round, Mindi Abair, had already committed to something else so she couldn't do it. We thought about delaying it, but we decided to move ahead, thinking about how we can change the sound in this new iteration. We decided to incorporate brass this time; the last time, it was just four saxophones. This time, we added trumpet, with Rick Logan; we also added Aubrey Logan, who's an amazing singer but who also blows the bejesus out of a trombone. She's really on the cutting edge of music. This new lineup gave us an opportunity to look at a lot more of the repertoire because this is a full horn section, with brass and woodwinds. The sound itself is so powerful. What happened was a very inspired project in which we reimagined these classic songs in a new wayand, hopefully, it'll bring a lot of smiles and happy memories to people.� WCT: I certainly recognize some of your longtime collaborators, like Gerald Albright and Kenny Lattimore. And Jonathan ButlerI remember him from his [1987] hit ""Lies."" DK: Oh, yeah! The core of the group is Gerald, Richard Elliot, myself, Rick Braun and Aubrey Logan, but we wanted some great vocalists. Aubrey does a great job with Gloria Estefan's ""Conga""and then Gloria wanted to sing on the album after giving us her blessing, which blew us all away. Aubrey was a psycho fan of Gloria growing upand, now, she had her idol singing back-up for her. Kenny Lattimore and Shelea gave a very inspired performance on ""This Will Be."" Jonathan Butler, with his South African influence, was tailor-made for the Paul Simon classic ""Late in the Evening.""� There were a lot of fun collaborations and mash-ups. We took the Duke Ellington song ""The A Train"" and mashed it up with the Jay-Z song ""Roc Boys""which gave the album its title: from ""A Train"" to Jay-Z. This was such a fun project, Andrewand now we're going to take it on the road. WCT: Having Gloria Estefan sing back-up is a bit intimidating, isn't it? DK: Yes, but she's a giver. I remember doing a PBS special with her; she was out there for MY sound check, talking to the people to make sure I was comfortable. She wanted to make sure we were taken care of; she's a mama bear. It's one of the many reasons I love her so much. WCT: I heard a few songs on the album. I had reservations about ""Getaway,"" to be honestbut you guys pulled it off. [DK: Thanks!] You've alluded to it a bit with a few songs, but how did you decide which songs would be on this album? DK: Last year, in December, we were all on the road, we'd have weekly conference calls with the principals and the record companies. We'd have these spirited, good-natured sessions in which people suggested songs. It was fun because it gave us a chance to fight for the songs we wanted. The first song list had about 150 songs, and we had to get down to 11. We felt very confident about those 11; there wasn't any fluff. It was almost alchemicthe right notes, arranges and songs, and they fell into place. I'm really proud of how it came outgreat sound and a lot of energy. WCT: Last time we chatted, we talked about younger artists you would like to collborate with, like Janelle Monae, Frank Ocean, Alicia Keys... Have you had a chance to connect with them? DK: No, I have notbut there's always that possibility of the future, and that's what keeps me going. I had a fun one last year in which I got a chance to play on the Foo Fighters album. Then, Dave Grohl asked me to perform with them at this huge rock festival in Southern California. Of course, I didand that was one of the greatest experiences of my life. I've had a long career, and I feel very blessed that it's still going strong. This is actually just the ""gravy"" part; I just try to savor everything right now with his long career. WCT: Long career? You told me you were 28! [Laughs] DK: That's right. ... I'm 28. [Laughs] It's interestingit's one thing to come out as gay, but to come out as gray.! That's happened since the last time we talkedand it was the best decision I ever made. It was like taking off another mask. Some people say I actually look younger with gray hair. WCT: It's interesting because the younger people have been dyeing their hair gray. DK: I know! I've been trying to get rid of mine for 25 years, and now they're doing this. I'm, like, ""Geezhave some of mine!"" [Interviewer laughs.] I started dyeing my hair in my 20s, and you get hooked on it. After, you're thinking, ""Why did I let that drive me for so long?"" It's about letting the real me out, now. WCT: Of course, your album is dropping during Pride Month. What does Pride mean to you? DK: It's certainly changed over the years. I was a very closeted gay kid, and had no resources, like a lot of other gay people. It's a generational thing, of course. When I was a kid, I was a stranger in my own family. The saxophone became my best friend; I could work out all my emotions. Thank God I had thatit kinda saved my life. But when I finally got enough strength to come out to my friends and family, Pride became a very important part of my life. I went to all the Pride parades in Los Angeles, and got addicted to that feeling to showing up with my full breadth of colors, you know? That was a great experience for me during my formative years. Then there was coming out to the public at 4015 years ago. It was the best thing I ever did, but Pride became a different feeling for me. Now, seeing how far we've come, Pride has again changed; I feel like we've come so far, but we have a long way to go. It's a complex world we live in regarding gay rights, but it's been amazing to see how things have [changed]. I didn't think, when I was a kid, that same-sex marriage would happen in my lifetime.

Michael,Gordon,1111,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/consumer-confidence-fall-put-down-slowing-economy,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Consumer confidence fell in June but Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon says there is no obviously political slant to the trend. The Westpac McDermott Miller Consumer Confidence Survey showed confidence fell 2.6 points to 108.6 in June, taking it to slightly below its long-term average. The drop in confidence was widespread and was consistent with recent signs the edge had come off the economy, he said. Confidence initially fell after last year's election, suggesting consumers were apprehensive about how the new Government would work out. Much of the fall had been reversed by March. ""What's more, the initial post-election reaction was mixed across household types. Some were expecting to do better and some worse under the new Government,"" Mr Gordon said. In contrast, the drop in the June survey was widespread and confidence was down across most regions, age groups and income levels, he said. The widespread fall reinforced evidence the edge had come off the economy in response to a slowing housing market, Mr Gordon said. The pace of growth slowed in the second half of last year. GDP figures released today were expected to show a further cooling in the March quarter. ""The drop in confidence hasn't been particularly large to date. That speaks to more of a general malaise among households, rather than specific worries about the direction the economy is heading."" Confidence was down in terms of both households' own financial position and their views on the overall economy, he said. There was a particularly sharp drop in economic expectations for the year ahead, although that only placed the measure at a two-year low. The attitudes households had towards saving would be an important area to watch. He expected little in the way of capital gains on housing over the next few years as a result of the Government's housing policies and an eventual rise in interest rates, Mr Gordon said. Some households could be left feeling uncomfortable with the high levels of debt they were holding, relative to their incomes. Is that it? What are the outcomes of shaken consumer confidence? Do they purchase less?

Key Quotes “The drop in confidence was widespread, and is consistent with the recent signs that the edge has come off the economy’s upturn.” “More households say that now is a good time to buy major household items, but this may reflect an expectation of price rises rather than a greater appetite to spend.” “Households’ inclination to save remains low.” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Byron Beers | Daily Press Tahlequah linebacker Tristan King goes up for an interception attempt over Sequoyah receiver Michael Gordon Tuesday evening at a 7-on-7 camp in Fort Gibson. Byron Beers | Daily Press Tahlequah quarterback Tate Christian, a move-in from Pauls Valley, throws a pass Tuesday at a 7-on-7 camp in Fort Gibson. FORT GIBSON -- Tahlequah head football coach Brad Gilbert talked about the significance of reps while watching his defense from behind the end zone Tuesday evening. Gilbert had just wrapped up his day with the offense at the Tigers' second session of 7-on-7 camp competition at Fort Gibson High School. It's a critical time for the Tigers. They're breaking in a new quarterback, new receivers, and fresh faces in the secondary. A perfect moment. ""The importance of the passing league right now with how young we are at the skill positions is very important,"" Gilbert said. ""Every rep we get is an opportunity for us to get better. They get to hear our verbiage more, they get to run through the concepts more both offensively and defensively. There's a lot of things to be gained from passing league. A lot of people don't like it, but this is one of those years that we really need it."" Gilbert saw the good and the bad from his quarterbacks -- juniors Tate Christian and Simeon Armstrong. ""The quarterback play was good at times, and not so good at times,"" he said. ""But that's to be expected in a passing league. We're working in a few things and haven't gone over all of the details to the concepts that we're working. That's why we're out here, to get a lot of reps. ""I think it's always good to get out here and get as many reps as you can get. It's just one more opportunity you have to get just a little bit better. ""They both had their moments, and they both at times looked like inexperienced quarterbacks. That's kind of how it works at this time."" In a battle to replace Cayden Aldridge, Christian and Simeon took a majority of the snaps. Cole Goodnight, another candidate, saw all of his action at receiver. Right now, Gilbert is focused on Christian, a move-in from Pauls Valley, and Armstrong, who saw limited snaps last year. ""We went ahead and talked to Cole about how important he is across the board for us in so many different areas,"" Gilbert said. ""I think we're going to be just fine at quarterback and take advantage of Cole's abilities as a receiver. It's going to be Tate and Simeon from here on out getting all of the reps. We'll see where they're at when it's all said and done."" The Tigers also have to replace standout receiver Braxton Stopp, as well as Seth Berry. Stopp had over half of the team's catches in 2017 and had 767 yards and five touchdowns. Berry had 12 grabs for 205 yards with five TDs. Kobey Baker and Jaxon Jones were two of the receivers that Gilbert highlighted from Tuesday's session. Baker, who played in the slot, will be a sophomore, while Jones will be a junior. ""Some kids made some plays at receiver for us,"" Gilbert said. Kobey Baker made some plays across the middle, and Jaxon Jones made some plays."" With a strong nucleus returning on the defensive line and at linebacker, Tuesday was valuable for the Tigers' defensive backs. ""We have some guys that can do some things, make some plays, and we've got some veterans out there with Simeon Escalera, Colton Booth, Cole Goodnight and Dylan Parish. We've got a lot of guys that can do some things on that side of the ball. We've got a ways to go but I think when it's all said and done we'll be pretty good again defensively. We need to get better in all phases, but the group that lacks the experience is our secondary, there's no question about it."" Parish started all 12 games as a sophomore and was second on the team in total tackles with 101. Booth had two interceptions and logged 34 tackles, Goodnight finished with 50 tackles and led the team with 6.5 sacks, and Escalera recorded 31 tackles and caused two fumbles. The Tigers will continue with 7-on-7 drills on June 26 and July 10 at Fort Gibson. Whenever Byron Beers posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

In the absence of reigning women’s champion Claire Rose, 2015 and 2016 champion Hayley Simmonds will be looking to reclaim her time trial title, while Hannah Barnes will be looking to upgrade the silver medal that she picked up at last year’s event on the Isle of Man. Also bidding for a national title in the women’s time trial will be Storey, who with 14 Paralympic titles to her name is one of Britain’s most decorated athletes, and has recently returned to competition following the birth of her second child. She will also take her place on the start line for Sunday’s road race, where, with reigning champion Lizzie Deignan absent due to the impending birth of her first child and Olympic, world and Commonwealth track champion Katie Archibald absent through injury, a host of riders will fancy their chances of claiming the red, white and blue stripes. Barnes was victorious in Stockton in 2016, as she edged sister Alice into second place, and both will be in the hunt for glory in Northumberland. Joining them on the start line will be Olympic, Commonwealth and multiple world track champion Barker, while her fellow Welsh Olympic gold medallist Dani Rowe will also be targeting a medal off the back of her third-place finish at the recent OVO Energy Women’s Tour. Rowe’s brother-in-law Luke forms part of a sensational start list for the men’s road race later that day, as Cummings looks to defend the second title he won on the Isle of Man last year. Cavendish, Thomas and Dowsett will be joined by the likes of double former champion Peter Kennaugh, 2012 winner Ian Stannard and 2016 victor Adam Blythe on the start line for what is set to be a fiercely contested finale to the championships. This year’s HSBC UK | National Road Championships will be hosted by the popular Cyclone Cycling Festival. The elite events – Thursday’s time trials and Sunday’s road races – will sandwich mass participation events on the Friday and Saturday, which will allow members of the public, regardless of ability, to take part in what promises to be a true festival of cycling. Women's time trial Men's under-23 time trial Men's time trial Women's road race Men's road race The championships will take place from Thursday June 27 until Sunday June 30. The OVO Energy Women's Tour will also increase from five days to six, and will move to a new, weekday-focused position.

Steve,Cummings,1110,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-liquor-prices-restaurants-bars-1.4711771,"The owners of a Whitehorse bar and restaurant are taking Yukon Premier Sandy Silver to task over planned increases to liquor prices in the territory. CBC News obtained an email sent on Saturday to Silver, as well as the minister responsible for the Yukon Liquor Corporation (YLC), John Streicker, and YLC president Matt King. It was sent by Katja Schmidt and Christine Kent, who own the Dirty Northern and The Miner's Daughter, a joint bar and restaurant. Schmidt and Kent were responding to a letter sent by the liquor corporation to all wholesale licensees the day before, explaining that the YLC will bring in a new pricing structure on July 1. According to YLC's letter, the new prices ""will reflect current supplier pricing, freight, excise, duty, revised mark-up, cost of service differential, liquor tax and other fees and deposits."" The letter was written by Steve Cummings, director of operations at the YLC. Schmidt and Kent responded with a blistering message to Silver, Streicker and King, questioning the planned increases. The changes ""just cost our business about $3,000/month on draught beer alone,"" Schmidt and Kent's email says. ""Don't try and pass it off as an effort to maintain compliance with trade agreements while underhandedly increasing costs on the businesses that create jobs and drive the economy,"" they wrote. The email was copied to about 60 other Yukon bars and restaurants. The CBC requested an interview with the president of the Yukon Liquor Corporation, but did not receive a response before the close of business day Monday. Schmidt told CBC News that bars and restaurants operate on razor-thin margins, and she worries that some will be forced to close. ""Even being extremely busy, you don't make a lot of money. So you're looking at a margin of three to nine per cent [as] your profit. Here is an industry where I'm employing, let's say, 50 people. Now I have to run my [business] even tighter or lay people off to try to compensate for this price increase."" The YLC's letter shows planned increases to all alcohol — retail and wholesale — with the exception of a very slight average decrease (13 cents per bottle) to table wine. Hard liquor will see an increase of an average of $2.40 per bottle. James Maltby, owner of Woodcutter's Blanket cocktail bar in Whitehorse, said price increases will have a ""significant"" impact on businesses like his. He estimated the hikes could add about a dollar to his drink prices. Meanwhile, he'll have to figure out how to manage the ""substantial construction"" his business is undergoing, at the same time. ""The actual profit margins are so thin,"" he said. ""To be honest, I've had to have another job for three years and haven't taken any profit from my business, I've just put [money] into it. And only recently have I been able to sort of expand to grow the business in order to realize a profit."" Maltby said there was some consultation last summer, but little was known about the impact any changes would have on businesses. Schmidt and Kent's email urges the government to ""learn something about the industry before you implement an increase like this."" ""Mining is not the only industry in this territory. You'd have to be daft not to have noticed the businesses in this sector that have closed in the last three years. Is it just that we don't matter?"" Schmidt told CBC the increase came out of the blue, with no consultation with affected businesses. ""No warning, no nothing. I'm not looking for handouts — I'm just not looking to get screwed over."" Schmidt says she's particularly disappointed because Silver made a commitment in the 2016 election campaign to protect small Yukon businesses. ""Small business my ass, Sandy,"" the email concludes.

Steve,Cummings,1110,http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/4927/team-sky-and-cavendish-descend-onto-national-championships,"Sign up for our newsletter Secondary menu Sections Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Mark Cavendish (Dimension Data) and Dani Rowe (WaowDeals) headline a strong lineup of riders heading to the British National Championships, which begin next Thursday in Northumberland. Thomas is scheduled to race both the men's elite time trial and road race while Cavendish has been confirmed for the road race. Welshman Thomas, who is aiming for a high General Classification finish at next month's Tour de France, will be joined by six Team Sky teammates, which should ensure a high standard of racing. Among those joining Thomas will be former road race champion Ian Stannard and the in-form Tao Geoghegan-Hart. Cavendish, meanwhile, will be joined by fellow Dimension Data rider and defending champion across both disciplines Steve Cummings. They will also have the support of first year professional Scott Davies. Pete Kennaugh (Bora-Hansgrohe) has also been listed in the field for the men's road race and will look to put a troubling season behind him while Ben Swift (UAE-Team Emirates) will also take to the start line. Alex Dowsett (Katusha-Alpecin) will compete in both events but will no doubt be focusing his efforts on securing what would be a sixth national time trial title. Besides the threat of Thomas and Cummings, Dowsett will also be wary of world team pursuit champion Daniel Bigham (Team Ribble) and Harry Tanfield (Canyon-Eisberg). The under-23 road race will also be of interest. Seldom do more than 10 riders in the category finish the race due to it being merged with the elite men's category. Tom Pidcock (Team Wiggins), despite being just 18, will be many people's favourite although WorldTour pro James Shaw (Lotto-Soudal) and Charlie Tanfield (Canyon-Eisberg) should offer formidable competition. In the men's under-23 time trial, all points towards a two-rider showdown between junior time trial World Champion Pidcock and individual pursuit Commonwealth champion Charlie Tanfield. The women's road race will be headlined by Dani Rowe who will be looking to springboard from her recent third place at the Women's Tour to claim a national title With no WaowDeals teammates, however, her work could be cut out against Hannah and Alice Barnes (Canyon-SRAM) and the Wiggle-High5 trio of Elinor Barker, Lucy Garner and Grace Garner. Rowe will also target the time trial earlier in the week with multiple-Paralympic gold medalist Dame Sarah Storey (Storey Racing) and Hayley Simmonds (WNT-Rotor) sure to be hot on her heels. The Championships will start with the time trial events from Thursday, with the road races set to take place on the weekend with reduced sprints predicted in both races due to the lack of testing hills towards the finish of the race.

Steve,Cummings,1110,https://www.cgmagonline.com/2018/06/20/best-comics-to-buy-this-week-tony-stark-returns-in-iron-man-1/,"Feature This week’s Best Comics list is highlighted by Dan Slott’s first issue of Iron Man, Catwoman and Joker’s faceoff in Batman #49 and the beginning of the end in Wayward. Written by: Jim Zub Art by: Steve Cummings Published by: Image Comics After 25 issues of fighting and isolation, the heroes of Wayward are finally all back together in this week’s issue #26. For longtime readers, this reunion has been a long time coming, and since the series is almost over, it promises to be an action-packed one. For those who haven’t read Wayward, the series first debuted four years ago, and the story revolves around a conflict between the old gods of Japan and the new gods of Japan. The catch is that the old gods are ageless deities, while the new gods are kids with angst and parental issues. Since it launched, Wayward has been one of the best books on store shelves, and writer Jim Zub and artist Steve Cummings have crafted a vibrant world full of high stakes and lots of action. This is a series that is almost over, and one that is more than worth owning in trade paperback format. Written by: Rick Remender Art by: Wes Craig Published by: Image Comics Deadly Class is the best comic series of the past five years. Now that may seem like a bold claim given the wide assortment of stellar stories that have graced the comic book format in the past half-decade, but it’s also true. For the past 34 issues, the series has crafted a tense tale about a school for assassins that has been full of over the top murder and regular teenage problems. This issue is the fourth part of the current story arc, and there have already been a number of world-changing revelations in the first three parts. At the end of the last issue, readers were treated with a cliffhanger that involved main character Marcus potentially shooting and killing his longtime adversary, Victor. Marcus’ choice to shoot or spare Victor will no doubt set the tone for the series going forward, and if the cover for this issue is any hint, then it’s bound to get a whole worse before it gets better. Written by: Ian Flynn, David Williams, Gary Martin Art by: Kelsey Shannon, David Williams, Gary Martin, Jack Morelli Published by: Archie Comics Archie and the gang can be a handful. After all, Archie’s extremely clumsy, Reggie’s a conceited jerk, Veronica’s snooty, Moose is dumb as a row of bricks and Jughead eats everything. Throw in the hijinx that occurs as a result of Betty, Archie and Veronica’s love triangle, and it’s safe to say that any teacher tasked with teaching them would end up becoming at least a little unhinged. That concept comes to life in this week’s Archie Superteens vs. Crusaders #1, as a substitute science teacher becomes fed up with the gang’s antics and decides to gain revenge by becoming a supervillain. Archie Comics has shown a passion for telling unexpected stories in the vs. format such as Archie vs. Sharknado and Archie vs. Predator, and this one promises to continue that wonderful trend. It’s also been a while since readers have seen the Archie Superteens, and this issue actually marks the first meetup between them and the Archie Comics‘ superhero team, the Crusaders. If you’re a fan of all-ages fun with a whimsical Archie twist then this is an issue that deserves a look. Written by: Tom King Art by: Mikel Janin Published by: DC Comics A few years ago, it seemed like there would never be another marriage between DC Comics characters. The thinking back then was that the company wanted their characters to be timeless, and adding relationships and children tended to age them. Thankfully, this streak is ending with a bang in issue #50 with the wedding of Catwoman and Batman. However, in this week’s issue #49, there is an entity set to stop the marriage, and although this time it’s not DC editorial but the crown prince of crime instead. The last issue was all about the Joker and Batman, as writer Tom King and artist Clay Mann pitted the two foes in a tense standoff that ended up being some of the best characterizations that we’ve seen from either character in some time. In this issue, it’s Catwoman’s turn to shine as she is tasked with saving her husband to be. Stories involving Catwoman and Joker have been few and far between, and so this issue is extra special. Also, since this is the last issue before the big wedding day, it’s no doubt going to be one to remember. Written by: Dan Slott Art by: Valerio Schiti Published by: Marvel Comics After more than five years on the character, Dan Slott is finally concluding his run on Spiderman this week in an extra-sized annual issue. However, while that ending is exciting it is what he’s working on next that lands a spot on the Best Comics list this week, and that is Tony Stark: Iron Man #1. At his best, Slott has shown to be a revolutionary writer who is not afraid to take characters in bold new directions. And while not much is known about this issue, Slott has shown that he more than deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to launching a new series. This could very well be the start of a lengthy run, and this week’s issue is a rare chance to be locked in right from the beginning. Liked this article and want to read more like it?

Michael,Gordon,1106,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article213198029.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com June 19, 2018 01:03 PM In a courtroom usually set aside for the violence adults unleash on each other, the names of two dead children hung like ghosts. Then detail by wincing detail, a Mecklenburg prosecutor brought Drakeford Watts and Mariya Owens back to life as he told the public for the first time how they died. Both are listed among 223 North Carolina homicides for the decade ending in 2016 in which the victims were no older than 4. In 2016, Drakeford and Mariya died six months apart in Charlotte. The cases of their accused killers both came up on a homicide docket last week. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Drakeford, according to Assistant District Attorney Jay Ashendorf, suffered through repeated instances of abuse before he died on July 25. He was not yet 2. On the night before Christmas that same year, a 911 call brought medics rushing to Mariya's home. She was 4. In both cases, the mothers' boyfriends were charged with the killings. The children's mothers also appeared in the courtroom. But Jenipher Fofana and Tenisha Wells played starkly different roles. For court on Thursday, Fofana wore a ""Justice for Mariya"" T-shirt that bore her daughter's image. It was Mariya who always made the rest of the family laugh, Fofana said. Fofana talked through tears as she told Superior Court Judge Bob Bell that after hearing the details of her daughter's death a few minutes before, she found it hard to forgive Demarcus Heath for what he had done. Heath, who was seated a few feet away, did not look up. Moments earlier, he admitted his guilt as part of a plea deal with prosecutors in which he will serve at least two decades in a state prison for second-degree murder. In doing so, Heath avoided a first-degree murder trial and a possible mandatory life sentence. On Christmas Eve 2016, according to Ashendorf, Heath lied to police for several hours about how Mariya died. First, Heath told police the girl had been sucking on a toy she had received as an early Christmas present. Later, Heath said he had been arguing with Fofana so much that he feared they would break up and he would never see Mariya and her two sisters again. So Heath said he gave Mariya a long hug goodbye, then heard something pop in the little girl's back, Ashendorf told the courtroom. A medical examiner found that Mariya had died from a shredded aorta caused by a fractured lower spine — injuries that were not consistent with a hug, Ashendorf said. A possible clue in what really happened emerged after Heath's arrest. Ashendorf said a Mecklenburg County Jail inmate came forward to say Heath had confided that he would discipline Mariya and her sisters by making them hold a pushup for up to two minutes. On Christmas Eve, according to the inmate's account, the 230-pound Heath had put Mariya in one of these plank positions, then pressed down on her back with his foot. That could have snapped the girl's lower vertebrae and punctured her aorta, the medical examiner said, according to Ashendorf. After her former boyfriend's hearing, Fofana told the Observer she had never seen any signs of abuse in her home, and that she felt her daughter had received a portion of the justice she deserved. ""I just want him to know that he still has to answer to someone about this,"" she said of Heath. ""Twenty years doesn't bring my daughter back."" Patrick Chambers often lectured Tenisha Wells that she had to quit babying her son, Ashendorf said. What if Drakeford Watts grew up to be a sissy? Chambers said, according to the prosecutor. What if he turned out to be gay? Both Chambers and Wells were initially charged with first-degree murder in connection with the little boy's death. Chambers awaits trial on the murder charge and has pleaded not guilty. On Thursday, Wells pleaded guilty to felony child abuse and was sentenced to 22-30 months. She entered the courtroom between two deputies, then gave yes-or-no answers to a series of required questions that were part of her plea. Ashendorf then told the judge that Wells had been aware of Chambers' mistreatment of Drakeford but had never done anything to stop him, much less notify police. Two months before his death, the boy had suffered a mysterious burn on his inner thigh. Chambers told Wells that it had been caused by a piece of hot charcoal during a cookout. Authorities said the burn appeared to have been caused by a cigarette lighter. The toddler had begun to cry whenever Chambers was around him, Ashendorf said, and two days before his death Drakeford was seen walking with a limp. Despite these and other incidents, Wells ""continued to let Chambers be in Drakeford's life,"" Ashendorf said. The nature of Drakeford's final injuries remain unclear. On the last night the child was alive, Chambers asked Wells if she had ever seen the boy sleep with his eyes open or while foaming at the mouth, Ashendorf said. When police arrived, Wells gave police different versions of what had happened, while maintaining that Chambers did not discipline her children. Two days after Drakeford's death, Wells and Chambers were seen ""laughing and joking"" at a parenting class, Ashendorf said. While the prosecutor spoke, Wells sat stoically next to her attorney. Her expression did not change as she was led away, the courtroom emptied, and her son's name was said no more.

Michael,Gordon,1102,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/06/18/nrl-fantasy-winners--losers-round-15/,"FANTASY Brought to you by There was good news and bad news on the injury front in round 15 as the NRL's rep stars prepare to line up for their states and countries in the standalone representative round. Here are the biggest NRL Fantasy talking points from the weekend's matches. Play NRL Fantasy presented by Youi. It's free, fun and totally addictive Winners Newcastle fullback Kalyn Ponga is the man of the moment and he only seems to be getting better, posting a season-high 89 Fantasy points against a star-studded Melbourne team in Newcastle's 28-10 loss on Sunday. Ponga scored a try, had two line breaks and made a season-high 14 tackle busts on Sunday ahead of a likely call-up for Queensland's State of Origin team. Raiders forward Joseph Tapine was the next best in round 15 with 84 points including a tryscoring double against the Wests Tigers on Sunday while Rabbitohs winger Robert Jennings had a wowser of a game with four tries against the Eels and finished with an 82-point effort. Ryan James backed up last week's 105 with an 80 in the Titans' big win over Canterbury, with Gold Coast fullback Michael Gordon also cashing in with 78 points. Roosters prop Jared Waerea-Hargreaves had his best game of the season against Penrith's highly-rated pack, leading his side to victory and earning 77 Fantasy points in the process, while Cameron Munster had two try assists and six tackle busts for the Storm against Newcastle for 73 and Jason Taumalolo carried the Cowboys again for 71. Adam Reynolds thrived in another big Rabbitohs win for 66, Jai Arrow bounced back after a quiet round 14 score with 62, with Tohu Harris making the same score for the Warriors. There were also wins of sorts for Fantasy coaches with Harris and Shaun Johnson in their side, as both Warriors stars were left out of Michael Maguire's new-look Kiwis side to face England in next weekend's Denver Test. Warriors coach Stephen Kearney has said he plans to rest all his New Zealand representatives from that game, which would include Issac Luke and Peta Hiku. Losers Cowboys and Queensland star Michael Morgan has been ruled out for the season with a biceps injury, which is not only a major blow for North Queensland and Morgan's Fantasy owners but had ramifications elsewhere – with Ponga's odds of becoming an Origin player shortening significantly. There was mixed Origin news for NSW Blues duo Reagan Campbell-Gillard (broken jaw, 6-8 weeks) and Latrell Mitchell, who was cleared of a neck injury and is now expected to not miss an NRL round. NRL Casualty Ward: Morgan, Campbell-Gillard sidelined Elsewhere breakout Broncos star Tevita Pangai jnr suffered a ribs injury, Tigers centre Mahe Fonua suffered a suspected fracture to his forearm, Eels workhorse Nathan Brown suffered a corked arm but should be back next round, the Sharks may lose Luke Lewis to a calf strain but are expecting Josh Dugan back in round 16, Manly lost Moses Suli to a sternum injury while Martin Taupau played on despite suffering a hyperextended elbow, and Billy Slater and Josh Reynolds both withdrew from their teams with hamstring injuries this week. After a run of good scores Tyrone Peachey finished with just 3 in the Panthers' loss to the Roosters, Adam Doueihi played just 12 minutes for Souths for 7 points, Dylan Napa was cleared of a serious ankle injury but was still kept to 13 points in limited game time, while James Maloney had his lowest score since round 2 with 15.

Michael,Gordon,1102,https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Grammy-Winning-Choir-The-Crossing-Announces-2018-2019-Season-Aniara-20180618,"Winner of the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance, The Crossing, with conductor Donald Nally, today announces its 2018-19 season, titled Aniara. The season-which is centered around exploring mankind's place in the universe, the relationships between humans, navigating through space and life, and the passage of time - features The Crossing's New York Philharmonic and Peak Performances debuts, the world premiere of the choral-theater work Aniara: fragments of time and space; and world premieres by Gavin Bryars, Michael Gordon, Thomas Lloyd, and Toivo Tulev. The season kicks off on Sunday, September 16, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. with a performance at FringeArts in Philadelphia as part of the Philadelphia Fringe Festival, featuring a world premiere from Ted Hearne, co-commissioned by Park Avenue Armory and The Crossing, together with Toivo Tulev's setting of Walt Whitman's ""A child said, what it the grass?,"" a rare performance of David Lang's depart for 3 cellos and women, plus works by Louis Andriessen, Benjamin C.S. Boyle, Sebastian Currier, Suzanne Giraud, Gabriel Jackson, David Shapiro, and Kile Smith. The program, Arms and the Man, explores themes of nationalism and war, victory and loss, and joy and despair; it is also performed at New York's Park Avenue Armory on Wednesday, September 19, 2018 at 7:30 p.m. and Thursday, September 20, 2018 at 7:30 p.m. in an expanded concert experience that winds through the Armory's historic reception rooms. The Crossing makes its debut at Peak Performances at Montclair State University in Montclair, NJ on Saturday, September 29 at 7:30 p.m. with a program entitled the national anthems, in collaboration with the strings of the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE). The concert explores where patriotism ends and nationalism begins, and looks at the ways humans use words to describe desires, fears, and needs as pertaining to homelands, human relationships, and homelessness. The program is anchored by David Lang's the national anthems together with Ted Hearne's Consent and What it might say, in addition to Caroline Shaw's To the Hands, an exploration of diaspora and displacement. The Crossing presents the world premiere of Gregory Spears' The Tower on Saturday, October 27, 2018 at 8:00 p.m. at The Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill in Philadelphia. The new work, on texts of Thomas Merton and Denise Levertov, explores the relationship between technological innovation and its dangers that can often lead to haunting sociological change. The concert also includes other works written for The Crossing, including Joel Puckett's I enter the earth (2015) and a new work by James Primosch set to an excerpt from Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping. On Friday, December 14, 2018 at 8:00 p.m. at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Rittenhouse Square, Philadelphia, PA, The Crossing gives its annual Christmas concert, The Crossing @ Christmas, presented by Annenberg Live. The concert is in memorial of Jeffrey Dinsmore, co-founder of The Crossing, and features a major world premiere by Gavin Bryars, composer of The Fifth Century, for which The Crossing won the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance. The Crossing @ Christmas is repeated on Sunday, December 16 at 5:00 p.m. at The Presbyterian Church of Chestnut Hill. The Crossing makes its New York Philharmonic debut performing the world premiere Julia Wolfe's Fire in my mouth on Thursday, January 24, 2019 at 7:30 p.m., Friday, January 25, 2019 at 8:00 p.m., and Saturday, January 26, 2019 at 8:00 p.m. at David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center, led by New York Philharmonic Music Director Jaap van Zweden. The work is based on the garment industry in New York at the turn of the 20th century, specifically focusing on the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City - which killed 146 garment workers, most of them young, female immigrants - and how women's protests instigated changes in labor laws. The performances are part of New York Stories: Threads of Our City, the New York Philharmonic's exploration of musical expressions of the immigrant experience. David Lang's the little match girl passion and music by Louis Andriessen, ?riks Ešenvalds, Ted Hearne, and Gabriel Jackson are featured in The Crossing's five-city tour on Wednesday, February 6, 2019 at 7:00 p.m. at Holloway Hall at Salisbury University; Thursday, February 7, 2019 at 7:30 p.m. at The Delaware Art Museum; Friday, February 8, 2019 at 7:00 p.m. at Pfleeger Concert Hall at Rowan University; Saturday, February 9, 2019 at 8:00 p.m. at Baldwin Auditorium at Duke University; and Sunday, February 10 at 2:00 p.m. at Leighton Concert Hall at Notre Dame University. On Saturday, March 30, 2019 at 8:00 p.m. and Sunday, March 31, 2019 at 5:00 p.m. at The Philadelphia Episcopal Cathedral, The Crossing presents the world premiere of Thomas Lloyd's In the Light, a choral-theater work for 20 voices. In the Light explores the strange and oppressive culture of a Cape Cod religious community with an internationally recognized choir, examining the desire to belong and the fear of exclusion. This is the second choral-theater work Lloyd has composed for The Crossing; his previous work Bonhoeffer, written for The Crossing, was nominated for a 2017 Grammy Award. The Crossing returns to the LA Philharmonic for the orchestra's 100th anniversary season in its new music marathon, Noon to Midnight on Saturday, June 1, 2019. The Crossing will perform a world premiere by Toivo Tulev with additional works representing its history and future, and will be the only vocal ensemble appearing in this new music festival. The Crossing gives the world premiere performance of the choral-theater work Aniara: fragments of time and space, with five performances - Thursday, June 20, 2019 at 7:30 p.m., Friday, June 21, 2019 at 7:30 p.m., Saturday, June 22, 2019 at 3:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., and Sunday, June 23, 2019 at 8:00 p.m. - at Christ Church Neighborhood House in Philadelphia. Based on the epic science fiction poem of the same name by Nobel Prize-winner Henry Martinson, Aniara explores the relationships humans have to each other, to Earth, and to the passage of time, while following the physical and emotional voyage of a group that has left a dying earth and is thrown permanently off course, heading toward the constellation Lyra. The new work was developed with the Klockriketeatern of Helsinki over a period of three years, and is composed by Robert Maggio, with artistic direction by Dan Henriksson and Donald Nally and featuring Beijing Opera-inspired choreography and dance by Antti Silvennoinen of Wusheng Company, costumes by Erika Turunen, scenic and lighting design by Joonas Tikkanen, and sound design by Nick Tipp. To close the 2018-19 season, The Crossing returns to The Big Sky Choral Initiative for a 2-week residency July 15-28, 2019 at the Warren Miller Performing Arts Center in Gallatin Gateway, Montana. The Crossing will join composer Michael Gordon and filmmaker Bill Morrison in their second year of collaboration on a new work specific to this unique gathering at Big Sky. This work draws on the history, beauty, and expanse of Montana as inspiration for this extended composition for unaccompanied choir and film. The residency will culminate in several performances of this developing work, details to be announced. ""Aniara is a season of questions: periodic pauses in a year of self-reflection, a view of our world from the inside, as we race through space with the progress of a bubble in glass. The 24 voices of The Crossing will perform new works that look at conflict, change, regression, spirituality, hope, cultures of oppression, cultures of love, a dying earth, and the search for meaning in a world that has no tomorrow,"" said The Crossing's conductor Donald Nally. ""These questions will propel us across the country, from our home in Philadelphia, to join like-minded ensembles, venues, and festivals with greater breadth than ever before. We sing for understanding, for clarity, for authenticity."" Program Information Of Arms and the Man with Thomas Mesa, Arlen Hlusko, and Sujin Lee, cellos Program includes the world premiere of Of Arms and the Man by Ted Hearne, plus works by Louis Andriessen, Benjamin C.S.

Michael,Gordon,1102,https://realsport101.com/news/sports/rugby/rugby-league/canterbury-bankstown-bulldogs-vs-gold-coast-titans-five-things-we-learned/,"A try, 3 tackle breaks, 126 metres gained and 51 tackles made by the Titans captain and front rower has catapulted him into the box seat to debut for the Blues next Sunday. Touted as a future Origin blue early in his career, much was made of his maturity for such a young man. His performances in 2016 were herculean amassing 11 tries in one season and dominating opposition packs. Endured a much quieter season last year however with the rise in form of Jarrod Wallace, Jai Arrow and Kevin Proctor alongside him James' game has gone to a new level this year. Is the type of no nonsense forward that can own the Origin arena for years to come and his performance for the Titans yesterday was typical of what league fans have come to expect from the front row forward. Moses Mbye is being starved of possession and is off now anyway and Matt Frawley is probably a fill in first grader. Jeremy Marshall-King is still young and Michael Lichaa only ever performs when his contract is about to run out. The Bulldogs have no inspirational leader within their spine and possibly Mbye leaving is a blessing in disguise with Hopoate going back to fullback, his support play was immense when previously playing in the number one jersey. Yesterday towards the end of the match, David Klemmer took out his frustration at his teams performance in trying a chip and chase kick of his own. Before this match I believed the Cowboys to be the worst attacking team in the competition at the moment however the Dogs would give them a run for their money. It's a shame for a season that loomed as a rebuild and promised so much more after a proud round one performance against the Storm in which they were in the contest for 60 of the 80 minutes. Their forwards are aiming up and present go forward for their spine, however their inexperience is costing them dearly. Once one of the NRL's most feared grounds the Bulldogs have not enjoyed much success at this ground upon returning recent years. A last gasp win last year against the Knights restored some pride playing at their spiritual home ground but the Bulldogs do not present the same imposing figure they once did. Their fear factor is gone even with Klemmer in their side forward packs aren't intimidated when they come up against the Bulldogs and they have completely lost their mojo. Gone are the days of an imposing pack consisting of Mark O'Meley and Willie Mason, or the days of Barba terrorising opposition defences. There is not a single player within their side that an opposition would look at, and that player strikes fear into the opposition. The Titans now possess an imposing forward pack that is committed to the Titans and that can match the best the NRL has to offer. Their halves are certainly more settled with the inclusion of AJ Brimson of late, the Titans are no longer signing fill in players, or players that can do a job but ultimately won't bring them closer to Grand Final glory. ﻿Dropping Bryce Cartwright has been the correct decision and has showed the new no-nonsense direction of Garth Brennan that shows the Titans are not settling for mediocrity anymore. In Ash Taylor they do possess a star of the future and who yesterday showcased many of his brilliant traits they now need another quality players in their spine with an again Michael Gordon and Nathan Peats lacking punch from dummy half to take the Titans up another few levels. Since 2015 the Bulldogs have won two from six at Belmore Sports Ground inclusive of a last-gasp victory against the rebuilding Knights last year. Yesterday they did not for one second look likely of achieving victory with the Titans pulling them to shreds and being afforded far too much space through the middle. They take on the Raiders in Round 17 at the same ground on a Saturday night, however they will have to be much improved to attune for their poor record over recent years at the ground. Once a heralded fortress the club is in dire straits and no matter which way you look at it, their season and direction as a club doesn't look like it's going to get better any time soon. What did you takeaway from the Titan's big win over the Bulldogs at Belmore? Let us know in the comments below. Want to share your opinion? Why not Write For Us? A Rugby League die hard, and supporter of 17 North Queensland Cowboys players, means I rarely have the time to support others.

Michael,Gordon,1102,https://www.zerotackle.com/nrl-power-rankings-round-15-33952/,"Seasons were almost literally on the line in a monster weekend of footy. As we break for rep weekend we take a look at the Round 15 Power Rankings. 1. Rabbitohs (Last week: 1) The Bunnies are absolutely flying right now. They ran in eight tries on Thursday night inclyding four tries to Robert Jennings. You’d have to think his re-signing is not far off. Two late tries to the Eels made this game look closer than it was, which sounds silly considering the scoreline. An 89% completion rate will bring a smile to fans of the red and green especially with the style of footy they are currently playing. Eight line breaks makes for exciting rugby league. Cody Walker is a genius. 2. Roosters (6) This weekend’s big movers the Roosters have now won their last four games and six of their last seven. Friday night’s 32-6 thumping of premiership heavyweights the Panthers sent a massive message to the rest of the competition. They were dominant in every aspect of the contest and reduced the Panthers to spectators. Three tries in the opening 15 minutes all but ended the contest. 67% possession is downright insanity. Victor Radley is an excitement machine. 3. Dragons (4) The Premiership leaders are right back in form after a huge win over the Sea Eagles on Saturday evening. Last week the Red V were lucky, this week they were ruthless. A six try to one flogging has ended Manly’s season and reaffirmed the Dragons’ title aspirations. 62 tackle breaks is a pretty crazy stat. They kicked for almost 200 metres more than the DCE-led Sea Eagles. That’s game management 101. Things are good for the Dragons. 4. Storm (5) Hmm. Anyone starting to feel a little nervous about the purple machine that is starting to really roll? Sunday afternoon’s 28-10 win over the Knights is their third in a row despite them not playing overly brilliant. Josh Addo-Carr simply cannot stop scoring at the moment and added another two. An 82% completion rate is much more Storm-like than in previous weeks. Cam Smith is in supreme form right now. Cameron Munster too. Yikes. 5. Panthers (2) The Panthers were dealt a harsh lesson on Friday night at the hands of the Roosters. Completing at a dismal 69% with only 33% possession makes for horrible reading. They conceded three tries in the opening 15 minutes and never really recovered. A brief moment of belief came in the 17th minute after a Dean Whare try but to be honest it was all Roosters all night. RCG is out for up to two months with a broken jaw. Horrible night for the Panthers. 6. Warriors (7) The Warriors were far from their red hot best on Friday evening but got the job done against the Cowboys in Townsville. Johnson’s last minute field goal iced a 23-16 result that probably should never have been in doubt. The match finished with three tries each but Johnson’s 5/5 with the boot was the difference. They won with only 42% possession and an inferior 75% completion. They are a dangerous side as shown by their four line breaks to two on Friday. The Warriors’ kicking game was the difference here. 7. Sharks (3) The Sharks can probably feel a little hard done by after a few unlucky moments but ultimately were not good enough on Saturday night in the Shire. The Sharks started awfully with their first kick leading to a Broncos try. 69% completion rate is awful for a side that is not exactly throwing the ball around. The Sharks made eight line breaks to five yet couldn’t convert. 12 errors and two penalty goals conceded is far more damaging than any refereeing decisions. 8. Broncos (8) A brilliant Corey Oates try has the Broncos back in a comfortable position. They are hardly flying right now but continue to do just enough to stay in the finals. An 86% completion rate will always make it tough for opponents. The Broncs had a far superior kicking game on the night kicking for 530 metres. They dictated the game for the large majority despite almost dropping it late. TPJ got the visitors off to the perfect start with a charge down try in the first minute. 9. Raiders (10) The Raiders are back in a big way. It’s no shock the Green Machine’s best win of the season came on the back of Josh Hodgson’s return. He was in literally everything early on and it was good to watch. The Raiders’ big men had a field day with Liam Knight scoring his first try and laying on an assist. Blake Austin played like a man possessed and must be looked at for a contract extension if he keeps that up. The 48 points to 12 win came on the back of eight line breaks and 500 more running metres. 10. Tigers (9) 62 missed tackles. 62! That is just not up to first grade standard. The Tigers spent the entire second half clutching at air and standing under the posts. The Raiders big men bossed their pack and delivered a huge reality check. Moses Mbye will join the club and the Tigers need the attacking spark. They made almost no use of a huge wind and looked the second best team in the ten minutes the Raiders were down to 12 men. This game could have put themselves well clear of the pack but have been dragged back. Horror result. 11. Titans (15) The Titans are back in the winner’s circle after a dazzling display at Belmore against the hapless Dogs. Michael Gordon looked 25 again in a two-try effort. The Gold Coast side made an incredible nine line breaks to one and probably could and should have scored more than the 32 points they did register. The stats don’t indicate the Titans were dominant but in reality this was one way traffic for the majority of the contest. Brilliant performance. Ash Taylor was impressive. 12. Knights (11) Sunday’s 28-10 loss could have ended the Knights 2018 season. Unfortunately in the absence of Mitchell Pearce it has become the Kalyn Ponga show. Despite yet another try and another brilliant effort, it’s a one man show in the Hunter. 66% completion rate is pretty bleak. They made almost 300 metres less than their opponents despite a 50% possession count. They’re being beaten up the middle and need to tighten up. 13. Cowboys (13) The Cowboys are done and dusted for 2018. I cannot believe what I am seeing from the 2017 Grand Finalists. They had 58% of the ball, had a better completion rate, made 450 more metres than the Warriors, and forced six line drop outs to zero. Yet they still lost. Incredibly the Cowboys had seven more kicks in general play but recorded 150 metres less. The kicking game is absolutely where this game was won and lost. 14. Sea Eagles (10) Any crazy thoughts of their season being salvaged is now well and truly gone for Manly fans after a horror performance on Saturday evening. They were played off the park by the Dragons but certainly contributed to their downfall. 15 errors, a massive 63 missed tackles and only 293 kicking metres made it very difficult to win a game at this level. Tom Wright’s solo try was incredible. I cannot believe he hasn’t been there since the start. 15. Eels (14) The poor Eels are looking for answers after being taken apart by the red hot Bunnies on Thursday night. They did manage to score five tries which is a huge plus, but when you’re conceding eight it is all for naught. They completed at over 85% and only missed 32 tackles, both very surprising considering the 42 points conceded. Jarryd Hayne looks good since his return which is a positive. Other than that there’s probably not a whole lot to like about the Eels right now. 16. Bulldogs (16) The Dogs would have fancied their chances against the Titans at Belmore but were never in the game. They conceded nine line breaks to a side struggling to score points. Michael Gordon tore them to shreds. The Dogs much talked about forward pack were battered by a much better pack. The Dogs had more ball yet hardly used it. I don’t know where the points come from but this current six, seven and nine just aren’t getting it done. Moses Mbye leaves the club. Its starting to take shape, Sydney Roosters vs South Sydney Rabbits, a dream game with the only two foundation clubs battling it out in the 111th grand final🐓🏆🐇 Or I should say at the end of the 111th season What’s wrong with the cowgirls atm?

Simon,Stertzer,1101,https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2018/06/gene-editing-technology-may-improve-accuracy-predicting-heart-disease-risk,"Scientists may now be able to predict whether carrying a specific genetic variant increases a person's risk for disease using gene editing and stem cell technologies, according to new research in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation. For the first time, the study demonstrates the unique potential of combining stem cell-based disease modeling (induced pluripotent stem cells) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology as a personalized risk-assessment platform for determining the disease-causing ability of a yet undescribed genetic variant, known as a variant of uncertain significance, or VUS. Numerous genetic variations are identified as related to a medical condition, but it is uncertain if they actually lead to disease, Joseph C. Wu, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and Simon Stertzer, professor in the Department of Medicine, Cardiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said. ""Random genetic testing will create a lot of stress for a healthy individual who may be getting echocardiograms, MRIs or medications that they may not need,"" Wu said. ""Results from this study will help improve the interpretation and diagnostic accuracy of gene variants, especially in the era of personalized medicine and precision health. The goal is to optimize the decision making of clinicians in their choices of therapy by providing a much clearer result for the variant of uncertain significance carriers."" Researchers studied genetic variants associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle thickens. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and young athletes. The reseachers harvested DNA from 54 healthy or symptom-free individuals without heart disease, then they sequenced their DNA using a custom DNA panel of 135 cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease genes associated with sudden cardiac death. The sequence results uncovered 592 unique genetic variants, with 78 percent of genetic variants being classified as benign, likely benign, or a variant of uncertain significance. However, 17 genetic variants were annotated as likely pathogenic or disease-causing. One individual who had multigenerational family members carrying a variation in gene MYL3, which is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was chosen in this study. After collecting the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the cells were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs and genome edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to engineer cells with the same genetics such as isogenic iPSC lines. Comprehensive analysis was next performed on the engineered cell lines to determine the MYL3 variant could lead to disease. Traditionally, treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy depends on whether a patient has symptoms and the severity of those symptoms. People who have silent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without symptoms are not treated. For those with symptoms, physicians may recommend lifestyle changes such as adopting a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress and incorporating exercise while treating underlying illnesses that can make the condition worse. They may also prescribe medications for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, typically reserving surgery for more severe cases. ""Given the diversity of the human genome, no one of us is identical to another. It is difficult to determine whether a genetic variant is meaningful or not. As a result, we risk treating patients with medications or more for a variant that, in the end, is benign,"" Joseph Hill, chief of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said. ""This study combined two new powerful technologies, induced pluripotent stem cells and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, to model a patient's heart in a dish and to test whether those heart cells manifested signs of disease. This approach heralds a new era of in vitro disease modeling and drug testing as pivotal elements of precision medicine."" View the discussion thread.

Michael,Gordon,1099,https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/104753570/construction-slowdown-and-weak-confidence-could-see-economy-enter-the-doldrums,"© 2018 Stuff Limited New Zealand's economy could be entering a ""danger zone"", economists warn, where a weak start to the year feeds falling business confidence, which could see the economy lose momentum throughout 2018. On Thursday Statistics New Zealand will release economic growth figures for the first three months of 2018, which are expected to show the economy expanded by around 0.5 per cent. Three of the New Zealand's four major banks are tipping growth of 0.4 per cent. If the figures turn out to be correct, annual growth would have slowed to around 2.6 per cent, the slowest rate of annual expansion since 2014. While the pace of the economy is likely to have bounced back in the current quarter, which ends on June 30, economists are increasingly warning of a loss of momentum. READ MORE: * Treasury beds in rising tax take, giving Robertson room to add billions in the future * New Zealand unemployment rate falls to the lowest level in nearly a decade * Business confidence plunges in lead-up to the election ""We have been warning for some time of the likelihood of a soft patch in growth over the first half of this year, as uncertainty around the new Government's policies weighs on firms' expansion plans and households' willingness to spend,"" Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said. ""A lift in government spending will help to support growth, but this is more of a prospect for next year's growth rate."" Westpac expects Thursday's figures will show the economy expanded by 0.4 per cent, well below the 0.7 per cent predicted by the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. Weaker than expected growth ""would put some pressure on the Government's revenue and spending projections, and would reinforce the message that official cash rate hikes are quite a way off,"" Gordon said. A 'self-fulfilling prophecy'? Since September, the month of the general election, headline business confidence has fallen sharply. While the ""own activity"" measure - which asks individual businesses how they are performing - held up initially, the figure has been drifting steadily lower in the early part of 2018. Ultimately, lower business confidence would tend to see businesses invest less and be more reluctant to take on new staff. ASB senior economist Jane Turner said, so far, there were few indications that lower business confidence was having any impact in actual activity, with investment indicators so far remaining strong. However, she warned that investment tended to lag confidence, meaning the impact of weaker sentiment was still to come. ""These [investment] decisions have been in the pipeline, potentially since before the election, so what we would expect to see going forward is an impact on investment because of lower confidence, that's where our concern lies,"" Turner said, describing the situation as a ""danger zone"". ASB said there was a risk that corporate New Zealand could enter a weak period even though many drivers of the economy, such as low interest rates and strong migration, remained positive. ""Confidence is low, but our fundamentals are actually quite strong, so there is a risk that businesses talk themselves into weaker growth, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When they invest less, and employ less and demand falls."" ANZ said economic growth had expanded at an average of 0.9 per cent per quarter since 2014, but this was unlikely to continue. ""The underlying pace of growth is already slowing, ANZ senior economist Liz Kendall said, adding that ""downside risks"" had increased. ""Construction and net immigration – key drivers of recent growth – are expected to have topped out, and we believe consumption growth will cool in the face of a softer housing market."" Kendall said businesses were facing credit and capacity constraints as well as ""policy uncertainty"" which was already hitting activity, which based on recent data was ""looking fairly lacklustre"". However ANZ said the cycle growth was not expected to ""completely roll-over"", with few signs of major imbalances which have tended to precede previous downturns. ""Supported by strong income growth (in large part a result of elevated export prices) and fiscal expansion, our base case is that the economy will grow around trend (or thereabouts) over the next couple of years.""

Michael,Gordon,1099,http://iriefm.net/police-probe-death-of-st-mary-farmer/,"Detectives of the St. Mary Division are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of 60-year-old Michael Gordon, otherwise called ‘Country’, a farmer of White Spring, Windsor in the parish, on Friday, June 15. Reports are that a relative, who was walking along a dirt track smelt a foul odour, went to investigate and found Gordons’s decomposing body; it had wounds to the head. Gordon was last seen by relatives on Tuesday, June 12. The Police were summoned and the crime scene was processed and the body removed to the morgue pending post-mortem. Investigations continue.

Michael,Gordon,1099,https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/i-feel-sorry-for-fans-dogs-coach-dean-pay-slams-ca/3443825/,"CANTERBURY coach Dean Pay says he feels sorry for fans after they were forced to watch their side put in another woeful performance against Gold Coast on Saturday. Canterbury will mount a fortnight of soul-searching after slumping to their worst start in 54 seasons following a 32-10 thumping at the hands of Gold Coast. The Bulldogs had everything to play for at their spiritual home of Belmore Sportsground on Saturday, with Moses Mbye playing his last game for the NRL club. Instead, they turned in an insipid performance that coach Pay admits he felt coming amid a host of distractions during the past several months. Mbye will turn up to Wests Tigers training on Monday following a mid-season move brought on by the club's salary cap problems. With just three wins under their belt this year, the Bulldogs have had their worst start through 14 games since their wooden-spoon season in 1964. Pay said he felt the six-tries-to-two defeat coming after his side lacked energy and application at training. He spoke to the side on the eve of the game and before they ran out about their sub-par preparation but couldn't hold back the onslaught. ""Physically, we just weren't good enough. The way they turned up, the way they trained during the week wasn't good enough,"" Pay said. ""I thought one of these was coming for a while. We've been competitive when we play our best but what we dished up today wasn't good enough. ""We addressed it yesterday and I addressed it again today. ""I feel sorry for the fans."" The Bulldogs fell to 15th on the ladder after what was their biggest loss under Pay this season. The coach is in a difficult position after inheriting his squad and a club fraught with off-field problems. They have been competitive in recent weeks, going down by six points or fewer on four occasions in their previous six games, but Pay said they would go in search of immediate answers. They were never really in the game and Michael Gordon's early double had the Titans scoring at nearly a point a minute. Halfback Ash Taylor was chief destroyer, setting up three of the Titans' six tries, while Ryan James made a compelling case for a NSW call-up, racking up 121m, 44 tackles and a try in a 73-minute effort. ""We came out there and you could just tell we were on,"" Titans coach Garth Brennan said. ""Defensively, our resolve was really good. For a side that's been criticised about our defence, and quite rightly so, I thought today on both sides of the football we showed some quite pleasing things."" Bulldogs and NSW prop David Klemmer could come under the scrutiny of the match review committee for a late shot on Alexander Brimson in the final minutes.

Newest Hillie Haverhill High football has hired former Wakefield head coach Steve Cummings as its new defensive coordinator. The Hillies announced the hire on their Twitter page (@Hilliefootball). Cummings spent three seasons (2015-17) as Wakefield coach, going 10-21. Prior to that he spent four seasons (2011-14) as the Warriors’ defensive coordinator. He played football at Marshfield. Cummings was replaced as Wakefield head coach by longtime North Andover football coach John Rafferty, who was hired two weeks ago. Pure domination One of the unsung heros of Pinkeron lacrosse’s Division 1 state championship upset of Bishop Guertin was Astros faceoff man Gennaro Marra. The senior-to-be was absolutely dominant in the circle, using his body to out-muscle opponents then scooping up the ball. A reporter said he lost just one faceoff for the entire game. That proved crucial as Pinkerton dominated ball possession. One Bishop Guertin fan could be heard lamenting Marra’s dominance throughout the second half. Marra’s name is familiar to Astro fans. He was a starting running back (466 rushing yards, 6 TDs) for the Division 1 finalist football team last fall and is a forward in hockey. Captain Ferullo Makayla Ferullo has been named the captain for Methuen girls basketball for the 2018-19 season, the Rangers’ girls hoops Twitter (@rangerhoops) announced.

Canterbury’s attack is just about the worst in the competition, and their defence didn’t look much better as they lost 32-10 to a plucky Titans side on Saturday. The blue and white faithful could barely manage to get along to their beloved Belmore Sportsground as a small crowd watched their team suffer their 11th loss of the season. And it was veteran custodian Michael Gordon who put the Dogs to the sword in a first-half demolition. Gordon scored the opening two tries of the game, then set up another in a dominant opening half-hour. All up he ran for 183 metres including seven tackle breaks, four linebreaks, a linebreak assist and a kick. For the Bulldogs, they now face the remainder of their season without fullback Moses Mbye. Mbye now packs his bags and heads to Wests Tigers on Monday to begin his new career at Concord. MATCH CENTRE: Bulldogs v Titans LIVE Stream every game of every round of the 2018 NRL Telstra Premiership on FOX SPORTS. SIGN UP NOW > THE REPORT It took five minutes for Gold Coast to draw first blood, and it was set up by new Origin forward Jai Arrow. Arrow put a shot ball onto the chest of Kevin Proctor who slid through a hole, then offloaded to fullback Michael Gordon who scored the try. Gordon’s kick made it 6-0. Gordon scored his second a few minutes later on the end of a nice backline play that went through AJ Brimson and Ash Taylor. Gordon converted again to make it 12-0 after just 13 minutes. The Titans extended their lead in the 21st minute when skipper Ryan James got the ball close to the line and busted through two defenders to score next to the posts. They went in again soon after through a flying Anthony Don, when the lanky winger soared over the corner post to score a freak superman try. The sideline conversion was missed but it was 22-0 and the Bulldogs looked cooked. Canterbury finally got on the board just seconds before half time when departing Moses Mbye slid through a hole to score on the left edge. Mbye missed the conversion and it was 22-4 at the break. The Bulldogs copped a blow after half time when they lost Clay Priest to a bad head knock. Then the Titans heaped on more pain when Taylor set up a great try for Phillip Sami to extend the lead. But Canterbury wouldn’t go away, hitting back soon after when John Olive pounced on a Gold Coast mistake to get one back for the home side. Mbye knocked the conversion over to make it 26-10. Gold Coast were next to go in when Proctor bumped off one defender and charged to the line in the 60th minute. Taylor knocked over the kick to make it 32-10. The game entered a stalemate and that’s where the scoreboard remained. Originally published as Woeful Dogs put to the sword by tenacious old Titan To join the conversation, please log in.

Steve,Cummings,1092,http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/4900/mark-cavendish-to-race-nationals-before-tour-de-france,"Sign up for our newsletter Secondary menu Sections Mark Cavendish (Dimension Data) will complete his preparation for this summer's Tour de France by racing the British National Road Race Championships on Sunday 1st July, British Cycling confirmed. He will joined by teammate and current champion Steve Cummings in Northumberland. Taking place six days before the start of the Tour, Cavendish will target a second national title, having sprinted to victory in 2013, while also trying to build form ahead of the three week stage race. This season has been one to forget so far for the 33-year-old. Consecutive crashes at Abu Dhabi Tour, Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo forced him into an extended period away before returning at the Tour de Yorkshire in May. This has lead the sprinter to have only have one victory so dar this season, Stage 3 of the Dubai Tour back in February. The Manxman is now currently racing at the Tour of Slovenia, which finishes this weekend, and will head to the inaugural Adriatica Ionica Race in Italy on 20th June before returning to the UK to take part in nationals in a bid to get fit for the Tour. He will be joined on the startline of the national road race by defending champion Steve Cummings who has also struggled this season. The veteran rider pulled was unable to finish the recent Criterium du Dauphine and also withdrew from the Tour of Romandie in April due to allergy problems. A flat 30km before the finish line of the men's elite road race means that the parcour certainly favours Cavendish over Cummings but it is likely the latter will be active during the race as he fights to earn a spot in the Dimension Data tour team. Cavendish has been national champion once before, taking the title in 2013, while also finishing in second place in both 2015 and 2016 behind Peter Kennaugh and Adam Blythe respectively. The course for the elite men's road race covers 185km with various laps of two circuits of 22km and 35.4km in length. The peloton's last test will be the climb of Ryal but this falls 30km from the finish. Joining the Dimension Data duo in Northumberland will be Dame Sarah Storey and Katie Archibald as well as young Team Wiggins rider Tom Pidcock. Alex Dowsett will also head to nationals in a bid to regain his national time trial champion, which was won in 2017 by Cummings. If Dowsett manages to take the title it will be his sixth victory in eight years. Live coverage of the men's road race will be shown on ITV however the women's race will only be covered in a highlights show.

Andrew,Davis,1089,https://rollingout.com/2018/06/15/andrew-davis-shares-how-he-became-the-global-diversity-leader-for-coca-cola/,"When Andre Davis was 12 years old and living in Spanish Town, Jamaica, a Coca-Cola in a classic glass bottle was a special treat on a hot day. But the company that made Coke was a world away. No one could have convinced him that, one day, he’d be so closely connected to the famous company. Today, one of Davis’ favorite childhood treats is a large part of his life. As the global chief diversity and inclusion officer of The Coca-Cola Company, he is tasked with the responsibility of creating an environment that promotes fairness, respect and appreciation of the similarities and differences within the company. With humble beginnings in the food service industry, he prepared for this position by gaining an understanding that every role, no matter the level, matters. Here, Davis shares his journey and the experiences that have shaped him. How did you determine that this would be your career path? The job picked me and this has been true for probably most of my career as well. I never saw myself in the diversity role specifically but there has been a greater force at work throughout my career that seems to land me exactly where I need to be. I will say that when you demonstrate the ability to drive positive change, lead and inspire people, doors can open up for you. From a human resources standpoint, I’ve always had an affinity to do this work. You can get so much more out of people when you find a way to understand them, what their drivers are and what environment they thrive in. It’s been a privilege and honor to serve in leadership positions throughout my career. What has been the secret for you to get where you are? Having a mindset of adaptability, resilience and taking advantage of opportunities as they present themselves. If you can be adaptable in moments when you’re not comfortable, life will reward you. If you can be resilient when things aren’t going well and fight through, it will build your character. When you view small opportunities as a stepping stone, it’s a game changer. The first job I ever had was washing dishes at a Pizza Hut restaurant. I was a teenager in high school, and even then, a job like that would have been beneath most people but I looked at it as an opportunity to achieve a goal. That mindset of seizing opportunities has set me apart in my journey. It has helped to keep me humble. If you can embrace even the smallest opportunities, the big ones will come. What are your thoughts on professional mentors? I believe they are critical partners, development coaches and sounding boards. Mentors are a really important part of the equation in terms of helping you see your blind spots, navigate company culture and giving you insights into being a great leader. What was it like living in Asia? I spent nine months on an international assignment working in Southeast Asia, living in Cambodia. Before I arrived in Cambodia, I considered myself well-traveled and senior enough to grasp a completely different culture, even one on the other side of the world. However, I quickly learned that you don’t know what you don’t know until you experience it. Living and working in Southeast Asia was an amazing life and career-enriching experience that has given me an even greater appreciation for diversity and Inclusion. My biggest learning there was that people are people wherever you go, and at our core, we need the same things. We need direction; which is leadership, we need to grow our capabilities; which is development and we need a great place to work; which is culture. Operating from this core principle is where diversity and inclusion can play a critical role. Reflect on your role, the journey and tell us what you see as your future? I see my role simply as the ultimate air traffic controller for diversity, inclusion and equality. My job is to build awareness of differences, which leads to understanding, then to appreciation and ultimately to inclusion of those differences. Operating from that framework is where diversity and inclusion can change the future.” “I’m not sure what the next chapter will bring, but I plan to embrace it,” he said. “For now, I will draw from all the life experiences that have made me who I am today, and as I continue to evolve, I will continue to lean on my life principles of living by faith, appreciating family and pursuing purpose. I am a blogger, journalist and media enthusiast. I am passionate about covering entertainment, fashion and beauty.

Held at Hope Community Church, in Surgoinsville, the ministry gathered taff and volunteers from Rogersville, Church Hill and Sneedville to honor some of the 400 people that volunteer. Ministry leaders had the banquet set up with balloons and banners and Whitney Roberson and Michael Gordon, Culinary Arts teachers at Cherokee High and Volunteer High, respectively, brought their classes to prepare and serve volunteers a wonderful meal. Betty Brennan’s Medical Therapeutics Class at Volunteer High School volunteer at the Church Hill Medical Mission which is one of Of One Accord’s programs, did a fundraising program by selling “dill” pickles. Brennan, with some of the members of her class, presented the ministry with a gift of $200 to be used by the Medical Mission towards supplies. Rep. Gary Hicks spoke to the volunteers thanking them on behalf of the state for their service and how fortunate he feels having Of One Accord in his district. County Mayor Melville Bailey and former Agriculture Commissioner Ken Givens attended thanking volunteers for their service to the people in our region. Several of the Program leaders presented certificates to volunteers that have given outstanding performance in their areas. Tammy Helton presented a certificate to Brenda Lawwson for her service to The Shepherd’s Center and Lynn Brown for her service to the new Shepherd’s Boutique. Donna Ramos presented certificates to Rolax Jones, Opal Hagood and Jeanette Abernathy for outstanding performances in our food pantry programs. Rita Jones director for senior meals presented a certificate for Gene Skelton long term service delivering meals. Jennifer Kinsler presented certificates to Eva Heapes for her help with Christmas for the Children and Gary Snyder for his photography at those events. Mickey Wilcox presented a certificate to Rayne Wilcox in Home Repair. Mike Gibson, representing The Shepherd’s Corner in Sneedville, presented certificates to Charlene Mullins (18 years service), and Phylis Delph (19 years service) and Maudie Hurley (20 years service). Sheldon Livesay gave thanks to all volunteers giving some three-decade anniversary totals. Livesay stated that in the last 30 years, “you have given 1,116,000 hours of volunteer service, served 1,382,193 people, given out 17,528,964 pounds of food to 602,069 people, delivered 117,852 meals to seniors at their homes, served 91,338 meals from the Lunch Box Buses, served 24,069 children at Christmas and given families 22,000 Christmas food boxes.” Volunteers in the Medical Clinic have served 19,422 patients, given out 78.509 prescriptions and done 16,176 lab tests, he added. Through the home repair program, 469 families have had teams come and work on their homes. But continuing he said the best news is this: 2,610 people locally and 49,000 overseas through the work started by Charlie Price have given their lives to Christ through the efforts of those volunteers.

Michael,Gordon,1088,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/aap/article-5847039/Titans-coach-open-signing-Eels-Norman.html,"By Australian Associated Press Published: 01:32 EST, 15 June 2018 | Updated: 01:32 EST, 15 June 2018 He's not dismissing the prospect of signing Parramatta's Corey Norman but Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan says local feeder clubs are the priority ahead of the June 30 NRL transfer deadline. Brennan has confirmed an informal approach from Norman's management after he fell out of favour at Parramatta over off field dramas. The Eels playmaker was fined $20,000 two weeks ago for drinking alcohol while injured, adding to speculation Parramatta may cut ties with him before June 30. ""If he (Norman) became available then a quality footballer would certainly be brought to the attention of our recruitment committee,"" Brennan said ahead of Saturday's NRL clash with Canterbury. ""Corey can play five-eighth and fullback. This year we are pretty comfortable in those positions but you need depth and some experience and Corey brings that as well."" Brennan said he was happy with current halves Ash Taylor and AJ Brimson plus veteran fullback Michael Gordon but did not rule out rejigging his side to accommodate Norman. ""AJ is more than capable of playing (fullback) and Michael Gordon can play on the wing - there are some options there,"" he said. However Brennan said feeder clubs Queensland Cup outfits Tweed Heads Seagulls and Burleigh Bears were in their recruitment committee's immediate sights before June 30. ""It's important we don't rush in and sign someone for the sake of it,"" he said. ""We will look at Burleigh and Tweed first ... to see if someone can come in for the rest of the year and do a job for us. ""We are determined to look there first but if there is nothing there then obviously we will look outside the area."" Dumped Titans half Kane Elgey may be the first plucked from Queensland Cup after impressing for Tweed since being relegated by Brennan two months ago. An NRL return would be a shot in the arm for the off contract five eighth who has been in limbo while mulling offers from NRL and UK Super League rivals. Brennan said Elgey was ""nipping at the heels"" of Brimson and did not rule out re-signing him. ""We are still talking to Kane's management. They are testing the market and seeing what is out there and I can see there are a few options there for him,"" he said. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Peter,Lunder,1087,http://www.colby.edu/magazine/a-bold-move-with-big-possibilities/,"Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art Lee Glazer wrestled with the decision to leave her home in Washington, D.C., and the security of a curatorial job with the Smithsonian Institution to move to Waterville and become the founding director of the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby. Glazer grew up in Washington, raised her family there, and made her mark as a Whistler specialist and curator of American art at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Taking the Lunder Institute job—launching a research center for American art at an undergraduate liberal arts college in northern New England—is in some ways a bold move. Typically these centers are nestled in big research universities with large populations of graduate students. Ultimately, Glazer decided to trade her life in the nation’s capital for Mayflower Hill because she shares President David A. Greene’s vision for the institute and his commitment to the arts. “It’s so encouraging and unusual that David Greene is putting the arts and creative endeavors at the heart of his vision for Colby,” Glazer said. “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, his investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” As they discussed the institute, Greene told Glazer to think of it as a mash-up between the experimental mid-century North Carolina arts school Black Mountain College and the Aspen Institute, a contemporary humanities-driven think tank, where new ideas are nurtured by cutting-edge scholarship. Established with a gift by Paula and Peter Lunder ’56, the institute is designed for scholarship, creativity, dialogue, and mentorship among the College’s many communities. Glazer will set the Lunder Institute’s scholarly and creative direction, working with artists, faculty, and students, as well as the curatorial and educational teams of the Colby College Museum of Art. She also will collaborate with the institute’s first director of artist initiatives, Theaster Gates, recently appointed to a three-year term. “I love Theaster’s work, and I am excited to see what this relationship is going to look like.” “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, [David Greene’s] investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” —Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art The institute will actively participate in Colby’s ongoing revitalization of Waterville, an aspect of the job that particularly excites Glazer. “We see the institute as one of the many institutions driving the creative revitalization of Waterville and the region generally, and doing so in a way that does not disrespect the history of the community and the people who live there and have roots in the community,” she said. Glazer’s background includes some history in Maine. For about 15 years, she and her family have spent a summer week or two at a cabin on Attean Pond near Jackman. They usually stay at a hotel in Waterville the night before heading into camp, and their trips have often included stops at Colby. “We have this abiding affection for the great beauty of the state of Maine,” she said. Glazer has worked at Freer|Sackler 11 years and curated almost 20 exhibitions. A Whistler scholar, she was drawn to the Lunder position in part by the Colby museum’s deep Whistler collection. The Lunder Collection of James McNeill Whistler includes more than 300 etchings and lithographs, as well as oils, watercolors, and pastels and more than 150 books, journals, and photographs. Glazer is eager to explore exhibitions that compare changes in Whistler’s London to changes in Waterville today—and perhaps the changes experienced on the south side of Chicago, where Gates makes community-based work. “Whistler witnessed an incredible transformation and gentrification of certain parts of London in the late 19th century,” she said. “Maybe we can bring in scholars to research the changes in Victorian London and draw parallels to the south side of Chicago and the changes happening in Waterville today. As I started thinking about those possibilities, that’s what catalyzed for me, in concrete terms, the kinds of things the institute can do and the ways in which we can bridge the gaps of time and place.” Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the Museum’s program, The Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby Museum and partner institutions around the world.

Michael,Gordon,1083,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article213184854.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com June 14, 2018 02:23 PM Inside a Mecklenburg courtroom on Thursday, a Charlotte mother was not allowed to talk to the accused killers of her son. Afterward, Tara Finch had a few things she wanted the say. ""You didn't know him. You had no right to take his life,"" she said through tears, holding a framed photograph of her 21-year-old son, Zack. ""He would have been your friend."" For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The mother's remarks were directed at Jahzion Wilson and Demonte McCain, two of the three Charlotte teenagers accused of shooting Zack Finch last June. Both made brief appearances in court as at least a dozen of Zack's friends and family watched. Tara Finch cried throughout. Zack Finch was a scholarship baseball player and one year short of graduating from the University of the Cumberlands in Kentucky when he went online last year to find a cellphone to buy. He thought he found one on the marketplace application LetGo. He went to pick up the phone on Father's Day in southwest Charlotte, and was shot and killed near Clanton Road. The people who Finch thought wanted to sell him a phone had come to rob him instead, prosecutors say. Two of the accused killers were 15 at the time. “As far as what the victim did, there doesn’t appear to be any type of defense or fighting that led to the shooting,” Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Capt. Chris Dozier said at the time. “The motive here seemed to be robbery, but to have this happen and have such a disregard, for such a young person to commit this kind of crime is disturbing.” Zack Finch did not know any of the people he would be dealing with when he drove off to buy his phone. In response to his death, police set up 14 ""exchange zones"" at QuikTrip convenience stores across the Charlotte area where buyers and sellers can safely close online deals. In the courtroom, Tara Finch waited close to an hour before her son's shooting case came up on the schedule. Wilson, 16, entered first. He wore a dress shirt and tan slacks, and his handcuffs made it difficult for him to hold up his beltless pants. His attorney, Chiege Okwara, asked Superior Court Judge Bob Bell for a delay so Wilson could take the GED. ""Motion denied,"" Bell said, and Wilson was led away. The 18-year-old McCain, short and slender, had long hair that hung far down his orange inmate jumpsuit. His attorney, Norman Butler, asked Bell for a two-week delay so Butler could have a better grasp of the case and McCain could understand the charges against him. ""Two weeks,"" Bell said. A third defendant in the shooting did not appear. He has not been identified and will be tried in juvenile court. Afterward, Tara Finch described her time in court had been ""awful"" because she had much she wants to say to the defendants but is not allowed to address them until the case is resolved. When asked what she wanted to say to the youths she had seen in the courtroom, Tara Finch fell back on a description of her son. ""He was innocent. He was young. He was a baby,"" she said, holding a photo of Zack in his college baseball uniform. ""He was kind. That's why he trusted you.""

Pictured is Joe Evans, who was the D Flight winner in the Laidback Gold tournament. There were 22 golfers who competed in the Laidback Golf Tours sixth tournament of its 2018 season today at Plantation Golf Club. Even though they found the greens very slow due to recent rainfall amounts seven players turned in rounds in the seventies while carding twenty-six birdies. In their 2017 outing held here there were only three scores in the seventies and twenty-one birdies made. As in previous years the tournament was followed by a super meal furnished by Annette Mink of Plantation Golf Club. While there were no repeat winners from last year’s event here; Steve Williams made it two tournaments in a row with his win in A Flight today. Williams who won last week at Stoney Creek in a playoff used five birdies to hold off last years winner Steve Cummings by a single stroke. Williams claimed his second win in three starts this season with a daily low gross score of 72. Cummings won here last year with his score of 73 but claimed second today. Phyllis Parrent kept her season going in the right direction as she claimed her third win in four starts in the B Flight. Parrent carded two birdies on her way to finish at 74 for the top spot. Bob Foyle had one birdie but once again came up just a little short as he finished with a 78. Foyle was tied for first last tournament only to lose b a stroke on the playoff. Warner Dyke from Forest has only made two appearances this season but captured his first Tour victory with a score of 82 in the C Flight. Neither Dyke nor second place finisher Jimmy Watlington were able to card any birdies. They started the day with Dyke recording a bogey while Watlington started his round with a double bogey. Watlington finished with an 84. The D Flight used net scores to determine their winner, but Joe Evans would have got his first win in two season starts even if it had been determined by gross score. Evans carded a birdie on his way to his best finish of the season at 89 or net 61. Kenny Powell had two birdies and finished with a score of 92; but Dan Curtin claimed the flight’s second place spot with a score of 94 or net 68. The Tours next outing will be the first MAJOR of the season. Double points are awarded at Majors toward the Season Points Championship.

During his inaugural address, Nadda said that India as a Global leader is committed to eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) transmission and disease burden so that our future generations are free from Lymphatic Filariasis. He further stated that India will always welcome newer initiatives and research to translate into the Filariasis elimination programme. At the event, Shri Nadda also gave away the GAELF awards to 11 countries- Cambodia, Cook Islands, Egypt, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Tonga and Vanuatu, for successfully interrupting the transmission. The Union Health Minister also released the Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) 2018 for India.Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Dr. Karen Cummings, Hon’ble Minister of Guyana, Prof. Balram Bhargava, Secretary DHR & DG-ICMR, Prof. Charles Mackenzie, Chair GAELF, Dr. Promila Gupta, Director General of Health Services and Dr. Jonathan King, WHO Head Quarter, also graced the occasion. Addressing the participants, Shri Nadda said that significant progress towards the filariasis elimination has been made by India. “With the concerted efforts of Government, state governments and development partners, 100 districts out of total 256 endemic districts have achieved elimination target and stopped Mass Drug Administration after successful validation by Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and are under post MDA surveillance,” Shri Nadda added.The Union Health Minister further said that the strategy to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis in India is based on twin pillars of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) once in a year for interruption of transmission i.e no new case and to cater to the patients already afflicted with the disease with morbidity management. Shri Nadda further said that there is also an urgent need for total integration of different departments for mobilizing the community. I am sure “Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis 2018” released today will also expedite the last leap for elimination of LF,” Shri Nadda stated.Shri Ashwini Kumar Choubey stated that it is critical to enhance awareness among the affected communities about the disease and its treatment. “I am sure during 3 days deliberations, experts will come out with pragmatic approach towards elimination of LF. There is a need to all stakeholders to work in integrated manner in order to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as public health problem,” Shri Choubey said. Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) or commonly known as Elephantiasis is one of the oldest and most debilitating neglected disease, which is currently endemic in 73 countries of the world, including India. LF disease is caused mainly by Wuchereria Bancrofti and spread by Culex mosquito. This mosquito grows in dirty accumulated water. The disease affects the poorest population in society, particularly those living in areas with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. LF does not kill the affected people, but may cause permanent disfigurement, reduced productivity and social stigma.GAELF is an alliance of partners from 72 LF endemic national country programmes, NGOs, private sectors, academic and research institutes and international development agencies that assists WHO's Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and was formed in year. Since then the meeting are held biennially. The second meeting was held in 2002 in Delhi and India is again hosting the 10th meeting which recognizes that India has highest burden of Lymphatic Filariasis and there is need of taking leadership role to Eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Participation of LF programme managers in this meeting will provide an insight of larger global programme and enable them join discussion and contribute to solutions. 5 Dariya News S.C.O.

Karen,Cummings,1078,https://tecake.in/indias-strategy-for-elimination-of-lymphatic-filariasis-gets-an-upgrade,"On the occasion of the 10th meeting of the Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) conducted in New Delhi, the Union Health Minister JP Nadda flagged off the launch of India’s Accelerated Plan for Lymphatic Filariasis (APELF). The minister recognized the urgency for improving the LF elimination programme in India and commented that the APELF would act as a much needed boost for the existing frameworks for LF elimination. The APELF programme would include community engagement to foster successful implementation of MDA and the use of DEC-medicated salt and the Triple Drug Therapy otherwise known as IDA (Ivermectin, DEC or diethylcarbamazine and Albendazole. The GAELF meeting involved donor governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, programmes from different countries, the World Health Organization (WHO), research organizations and the three pharmaceutical companies which have donated drugs including Eisai, MSD and GSK. The 10th GAELF meeting this year was based on the theme of ‘Celebrating progress towards elimination’. The meeting would provide a platform for senior ministerial personnel and programme manager from countries that are LF endemic wherein they could discuss regarding the existing needs, challenges and experiences. At the meeting eleven different countries received awards for elimination of LF as a concern for public health which included names such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Tonga, Niue and Cambodia. One of the ministers within the Ministry of Public Health in Guyana, Dr. Karen Cummings emphasized on the necessity of working in coordination with international and regional partners to conduct research on acceptability of MDA (Mass Drug Administration) and vector control in order to ensure LF elimination. According to Ashwini Kumar, the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in India, the most crucial challenge in the present scenario for LF elimination is to foster compliance to treatment. He emphasized on the necessity for encouraging communities for consumption of preventive medicines facilitated during MDA. The chair of GAELF, Dr. Charles Mackenzie stated that improvement in community participation, direct monitoring of treatment and enhancements in programme delivery were significant of speeding up the process of LF elimination.

Michael,Gordon,1075,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article213038869.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com June 12, 2018 07:17 PM A year ago, an Arizona college student got drunk in a restaurant bar, went speeding down the wrong side of an interstate, and slammed into the car of two Mooresville sisters hoping to watch the sun come up over the Grand Canyon. All three were killed. Now a Mellow Mushroom in Phoenix is paying a fine and lost its liquor license for a week by acknowledging it kept serving booze to an already drunk customer. That patron, Keaton Allison, came to the restaurant on April 14, 2017, with friends but left early the next morning alone in his car with a blood-alcohol level of .25, more than three times the legal limit. Within minutes, the student at a nearby Christian college was barreling 80 mph down the wrong side of Interstate 17. Shortly after 2 a.m., he slammed into the Pontiac that carried sisters Karli and Kelsey Richardson of Mooresville, who were headed to the Grand Canyon to close out their spring break. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. All three died instantly. Karli was 20; Kelsey was 18. Medical examinations revealed that the sisters had not been drinking. Allison, according to a state investigation, had been drinking a lot. Under an agreement filed this week with the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control, the Mellow Mushroom in Phoenix acknowledged over-serving Allison along with two other violations: allowing an intoxicated customer to remain on its premises and not protecting the safety of a patron. Mellow Mushroom agreed to pay a $9,000 fine and surrendered its liquor license for a week. The restaurant's legal problems aren't over. The sisters' mother, Cathy Hocking of Mooresville, has sued the chain on grounds that it violated Arizona law by over-serving Allison. She called the liquor board's ruling a significant step in the pursuit of justice for her daughters. ""It's significant because the restaurant admits they over-served a drunk customer,"" Hocking said. ""That's huge for me. They know. They know. This was preventable, and they did nothing to stop it."" Hocking's attorney, Steve Hulsman of Phoenix, declined comment Tuesday. Referring to the consent decree from the case, Hulsman added, ""Some things speak for themselves."" The case illustrates the balancing act restaurants must play in profiting from liquor sales while being held legally responsible for how much their customers drink. In the Arizona case, the Mellow Mushroom waiter who served Allison's party told state investigators he only brought Allison a beer sample and a single pint. Several of Allison's drinking companions, though, said the 21-year-old had consumed beers and shots of liquor in various parts of the bar and was ""slushed out"" by midnight. John Norling, the Arizona attorney representing the Mellow Mushroom, did not respond Tuesday to an emailed request for comment.

Michael,Gordon,1075,https://www.npr.org/2018/06/13/619672855/confusion-remains-after-summit-on-whether-north-korea-will-fully-denuclearize,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Gordon about his interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Seoul. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: After the U.S.-North Korea summit, the two leaders signed a document that does not have a lot of details. And today, that has led to different interpretations of what the two sides agreed to - whether North Korea will fully denuclearize, how quickly and whether it will allow international observers to verify those steps. A lot of the confusion came out today in a conversation that secretary of state Mike Pompeo had with a small group of reporters traveling with him. Michael Gordon of the Wall Street Journal was part of that group of reporters and joins us now. Welcome to the program. MICHAEL GORDON: Thank you. SHAPIRO: President Trump has said this agreement was the beginning. So what did Secretary Pompeo tell you about the next steps in these negotiations? GORDON: Well, first off, he said it wasn't entirely clear when they were going to meet with the North again, but he hoped it would be soon. And then he sought to argue against the criticism which has come from some former negotiators that the summit declaration is too vague. You know, the term irreversible and verifiable don't appear in the summit declaration. But Secretary Pompeo argued that they were implicit somehow in the document. SHAPIRO: He said the word complete includes verifiable and irreversible, and the word complete is in the document? GORDON: That word complete's there. And he says it means irreversible and verifiable, even though they're not there, and that that was understood by the North Koreans. And therefore, this was just a minor semantic issue. So that's a big point of contention because some former negotiators who say the North Koreans are very literal about what they agree to. And for example, when they agree to ban long-range missiles, and they don't agree to ban space launch vehicles, you know, that opens up a loophole. So some of the critics have said, you know, you got to watch this language very carefully. Secretary Pompeo was saying it's good enough and that the North Koreans know what we mean. SHAPIRO: Pompeo was in Seoul to talk with his counterparts from South Korea and Japan. Do you think this language is going to be good enough for them? Is he going to have a hard time selling this agreement? GORDON: Well, you know, a big issue really is President Trump's decision to cancel exercises with South Korea, which the Pentagon for years has insisted are really vital to maintain the readiness of U.S. forces here. And this is a decision that was made without consultation with the South Korean government. And we asked Secretary Pompeo about it. He said he didn't want to get into the internal discussions of how the decision was made, but he stressed that President Trump told Kim Jong Un that the U.S. would put the exercises back on if it determined that the North wasn't serious in these negotiations that are about to ensue. SHAPIRO: Secretary Pompeo also met with the commander of U.S. forces in Korea today. And as you said, the Pentagon always insisted that these joint military exercises were really important and necessary. Do you think the State Department and the Pentagon have now gotten on the same page? GORDON: Well, you know, the Defense Department put out a statement yesterday that Secretary Mattis had been consulted in advance of this decision. But what nobody in the administration has said is so what was Secretary Mattis' advice? What was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford's, advice? What was General Brooks' input, who is the commander of U.S. forces in Korea? You know, the - for many years, the North insisted that these exercises be canceled. So it was certainly quite a gesture on the part of the Trump administration to do so. And that is the culmination of the negotiating process, but basically to jump-start the negotiating process. SHAPIRO: Finally, Secretary Pompeo gave you an ambitious timeline. Many Korea experts say denuclearization would take 10 to 15 years. What did Secretary Pompeo say? GORDON: Yeah. This was the question I asked because we had heard the administration wants to get this done in President Trump's first term. And Secretary Pompeo confirmed that. He said that the goal was to get what he called major disarmament, major steps, you know, in the next two and a half years. That doesn't mean that everything would be completely dismantled. You know, that could take years longer. But you would be well on your way towards this process of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of the North's nuclear arsenal. So that's a very ambitious timeline. And it's striking because North Korea has insisted that it prefers a phased approach, which could really drag out for many more years. So I still think this is very likely to be a major bone of contention in the talks going forward. SHAPIRO: That's Michael Gordon of the Wall Street Journal, traveling with Secretary of State Pompeo.

Jamie,Forese,1073,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-banks-have-dire-predictions-for-workers-who-spend-all-day-keyboard-hitting-2018-06-12,"Published: June 12, 2018 2:32 p.m. ET By Earlier this year, Kai-Fu Lee, founder of VC giant Sinovation Ventures, said that the rise of the machines will lead to widening inequality as lower-level jobs get swallowed up in numbers well beyond the grimmest of forecasts. Don’t look to the banking industry for a counterpoint. In a series of interviews marking the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis, the Financial Times took the pulse of execs from several leading banks and found many of them are girding for imminent — and substantial — job losses. Jamie Forese, president of Citigroup’s C, -0.67% institutional clients group, said 10,000 of the bank’s 20,000 tech and operational roles are “most fertile for machine processing.” He suggested they could be gone within five years. What kind of jobs are at risk exactly? Barclays investment boss Tim Throsby put it another way when asked about what the future will look like: Throsby explained that machines will take over “lower-value tasks” and a smaller number of employees will be making more money. Forese’s comments are reminiscent of those from Deutsche Bank’s DB, -0.31% John Cryan, who previously said half the German bank’s workers could be replaced by robots. The FT calculated that if those numbers were true for the broader banking industry, the potential job losses would outpace the ones we saw from 2007 to 2017, when almost 60,000 jobs were cut from eight of the world’s top 10 investment banks.

Jamie,Forese,1073,https://www.finews.asia/finance/27054-robots-to-march-on-citi,"Jamie Forese, Citi Within the next five years automation could replace up to 10,000 technology and operational roles at U.S. bank Citi. The rise of machine processing at Citi has the potential to slash its current 20,000 operations and technology roles by half. The stark prediction was made by Jamie Forese, president and chief executive of the bank's institutional clients group, in an interview with the «Financial Times» (behind paywall). The rapid growth in sophistication of technology in banking is leading to a number of unexacting and routine roles, such as data entry, being replaced by automation. Thousands of Job Losses In Asia, banks are increasingly leaning on digitization in their compliance departments. Singapore's OCBC Bank is piloting two fintech solutions to improve its money laundering and terror financing defenses. Japan's Mizuho uses artificial intelligence to screen customers applying for loans, replacing humans. In October 2017, the bank said it planned to shed as many as 19,000 employees in Japan and overseas over the next 10 years. The cuts will account for one-third of its entire labour force and will come through the growing use of AI and other technology. Rise of Robo-Advisors Not only back office roles are being affected however. The technology creep is making itself felt in more traditional face-to-face banking roles in Asia with the rise of robo-advisors. Banks in the region facing escalating fraud need software with machine learning and advanced data analytics capable of spotting wrongdoing in real time, Raffael Maio of NetGuardians writes.

Karen,Cummings,1072,http://www.uniindia.com/~/india-committed-to-eliminating-lymphatic-filariasis-transmission-nadda/India/news/1259724.html,"New Delhi, June 13 (UNI) India, as a global leader, is committed to eliminating Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) transmission and disease burden so that future generations are free from the debilitating disease. Asserting this, Union Health and Family Welfare Minister JP Nadda told participants during the inauguration of the 10th meeting of Global Alliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) here on Wednesday that significant progress towards the filariasis elimination had been made by India. 'With the concerted efforts of the Government, state governments and development partners, 100 districts out of total 256 endemic districts have achieved elimination target and stopped Mass Drug Administration after successful validation by Transmission Assessment Survey (TAS) and are under post-MDA surveillance.' He assured that 'India will always welcome newer initiatives and research to translate into the Filariasis elimination programme.' Lymphatic Filariasis (LF), commonly known as Elephantiasis, is one of the oldest and most debilitating neglected disease, which is currently endemic in 73 countries of the world, including India. It is caused mainly by Wuchereria Bancrofti and spread by Culex mosquito. The strategy to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis in India was based on twin pillars of Mass Drug Administration (MDA) once a year for interruption of transmission -- that is, no new case and to cater to the patients already afflicted with the disease with morbidity management. Stressing on the urgent need for total integration of different departments for mobilising the community, he expressed confidence saying that 'I am sure “Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis 2018” released today will also expedite the last leap for elimination of LF.” Mr Nadda later gave away the GAELF awards to 11 countries -- Cambodia, Cook Islands, Egypt, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Niue, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Togo, Tonga and Vanuatu -- for successfully interrupting the transmission. He also released the Accelerated Plan for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) 2018 for India. Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey said it was critical to enhance awareness among the affected communities about the disease and its treatment. 'I am sure during three day's deliberations, experts will come out with pragmatic approach towards elimination of LF. There is a need to all stakeholders to work in integrated manner in order to eliminate lymphatic filariasis as public health problem,” the minister said. Dr Karen Cummings, Minister of Guyana, Professor Balram Bhargava, Secretary DHR & DG-ICMR, Professor Charles Mackenzie, Chair GAELF, Dr Promila Gupta, Director General of Health Services and Dr Jonathan King, WHO head quarters, were among those present. The diseases mainly affects the poorest population in society, particularly those living in areas with poor water, sanitation and hygiene. LF does not kill the affected people, but can cause permanent disfigurement, reduced productivity and social stigma. GAELF is an alliance of partners from 72 LF endemic national country programmes, NGOs, private sectors, academic and research institutes and international development agencies that assists WHO's Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis and was formed in year. Since then the meeting are held biennially. The second meeting was held in 2002 in Delhi and India is again hosting the 10th meeting which recognizes that India has highest burden of Lymphatic Filariasis and there is need of taking leadership role to Eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Participation of LF programme managers in this meeting will provide an insight of larger global programme and enable them join discussion and contribute to solutions, an official release here said.

Andrew,Davis,1070,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/-WORLD-Romanian-ruling-conversion-therapy-first-Elton-John/63165.html,"Vancouver will ban conversion therapy, and supporters say it's the first municipality in Canada to do so, The Toronto Star noted. City council members voted unanimously in favor of the motion that will prohibit businesses from providing services or counseling intended to change a person's gender identity or sexual orientation. The business-license bylaw will also apply to religious groups who hold business licenses in the city. British music superstar Elton John has blamed social media for allowing hate speech to slide on their platforms, The Hollywood Reporter noted. In an interview with BBC News, John said that major social-media companies ""haven't done anything to try to stem the flow of hate on the internet,"" and proposed that a boycott could make them take action. John explained that a boycott would make social media giants ""sit up"" and take a stance against homophobic hate speech on their platforms. In India, a lesbian couple and one of their daughters have died by suicide, writing in their farewell note that ""the world did not let them live,"" according to PinkNews. The couple, Asha and Bhavna Thakor, lived in the Ahmedabad region of the country. The Deccan Herald reported that, in a bid to be together, the women took their lives by drowning. The women also took the life of one of the women's daughters, a 3-year-old named Megha. A baby could become the first person in England and Wales not to have a legal mother if a court grants a transgender man the right to be identified as the child's father, according to a Newsweek item that cites the Telegraph. The unnamed man is fighting to be officially identified as the ""father"" or ""parent"" on the child's birth certificate. He launched a legal case against The Registrar General for England and Wales after a member of staff told him the law states those who give both to children can only be noted as mothers on official documents. However, the man complained of discrimination, and said he is being forced to be identified as the child's mother breached his human right to respect for private and family life. Thousands of gay and bisexual men are to be formally pardoned after a new law was passed unanimously by the Scottish Parliament, the BBC noted. Consenting sexual activity between men over the age of 21 was only decriminalized in Scotland in 1981; itt was a further 20 years before the age of consent for gay men was lowered to 16. The new law will pardon men convicted of having consensual sex with other men before it was decriminalized. Four Church of England bishops in Lichfield have issued new guidance, welcoming LGBT people to the church and acknowledging the ""great contribution"" that LGBT Christians are making, PinkNews noted. The progressive guidance issued by the Diocese of Lichfieldone of the Church of England's 42 administrative districtsalso affirms that LGBT+ people ""can be called to roles of leadership and service in the local church."" Warsaw, the capital of Poland, has celebrated Pride with an ""unbreakable"" monument after the previous one was destroyed, PinkNews noted. Before the Warsaw Equality Parade, a new rainbow monument was unveiled at a busy intersection in the country's capital, where a rainbow is formed by light bouncing off of water vapor, producing a holographic rainbow. The monument is stationed at a busy intersection in the city on the site of a previous rainbow monument before it was repeatedly vandalized. Police in the U.S. Virgin Islands are investigating a threat made against St. Croix's first-ever Pride parade that took place June 9, The Washington Blade reported. ""Everyone that owns AK-47 needs to stay on roof tops and gun them down !!!!,"" reads the post. ""They are tipping the scale. No balance. They will become our destruction if we as a whole don't to ( sic ) something. They are trying to destroy Reproduction ( sic ). No sin will be brought against humans for killing."" The parade took place without incident. British Ambassador to the U.S. Kim Darroch urged Commonwealth countries that have yet to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual relations to do so, The Washington Blade reported. ""We just urge all of our friends and partners in other countries around the world to move on as we have done to make their societies more open, more liberal, to embrace anti-discrimination in relation to the LGBT community as we have,"" Darroch told the Washington Blade during an interview at the British Embassy in D.C. ""It just makes your society a better place."" A quarter of a million people gathered in Tel Aviv to march in the largest ever pride parade in the Middle Eastand where Bravo's Andy Cohen served as this year's international ambassador, a press release stated. This year's parade marked 20 years to the City's first pride parade and payed tribute to the pioneering activists who played key roles in promoting LGBT rights and visibility in Israel. A nurse who cared for some of the UK's first HIV/AIDS patients has been made an OBE ( Order of the British Empire ), the BBC reported. Kathryn Halford is among 64 NHS staff honored in its 70th year. The 54-year-old recalled having to wear protective suits to treat HIV/AIDS patients at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, in the early 1980s. Out Adventures and Spiritual Adrenaline have formed a strategic partnership offering group adventures for travelers in recovery from substance abuse and addiction, a press release stated. Out Adventures is the official operator of two Spiritual Adrenaline bucket list toursMachu Picchu, Peru; and Banff National Park, Canada. Both trips focus on adventure, sobriety, meditation, nutrition, fitness, and components of the 12-step program. Spiritual Adrenaline will also offer an Azores tour, with a local Portuguese operator. Soccer superstar Mohamed Salah has received a backlash after agreeing to meet Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader responsible for Chechnya's ""gay purge,"" PinkNews noted. Salah agreed to accompany Kadyrov to Egypt's training base in Grozny, Chechnya's capital city, before posing and smiling with the leader in front of the press ahead of the start of the World Cup on June 14. More than 100 gay and bisexual men have been arrested, imprisoned and tortured by authorities in concentration camps since the purge began last year, according to reports.

Michael,Sylvester,1069,https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/rotherham/major-housing-development-scheme-has-stalled-rotherham-council-leader-admits-1-9204005,"It is now more than a decade since homes on the Whinney Hill and Chesterhill Avenue areas of Dalton were demolished and the council entered negotiations to replace them with developers Keepmoat, in a scheme which would have created 260 new houses, including 15 council homes. A start date of 2016 was advertised on Rotherham Council’s website, but the development never happened and now council leader Chris Read has admitted a deal with Keepmoat could not be agreed, with council staff now looking for a new development partner to push the project forwards. That process should allow for work to start next year, he has told local campaigner Michael Sylvester, who raised a question at a recent council Cabinet meeting about why the work had not moved forwards. However, Mr Sylvester is now asking the council to instigate a process where the reasons for the lengthy delays – which he says have affected businesses and the community in the area – should be investigated and explained. Coun Read offered to write to Mr Sylvester after the Cabinet meeting and in his letter he told him: “Unfortunately, despite extensive negotiations and a significant amount of time and effort invested by both parties, this has not resulted in a development scheme. “I share your frustration at the lack of progress. These are strategically important sites and will make a significant contribution to the borough’s housing growth target. “The council cannot afford to leave them undeveloped. Prior to the recent Cabinet meeting officers had already taken the decision to launch a new procurement exercise to find a developer partner to start afresh on the sites. “It is expected work will start next year. I appreciate work has taken longer than we would have hoped but I am assured that the necessary actions to move the development along are being taken and I hope that this means residents will soon see progress on this site.” However, Mr Sylvester is not happy with the response and has written back asking that the extent of the delays should be investigated by the council’s Improving Places Select Committee. His response to Coun Read states: “The local community had raised expectations of development in the run up to the last local election, based on council publicity and the now removed online story on the council website that gave extensive development details and an expected start date in 2016.” He is also asking if the council is able to offer additional help and support to businesses in the area which have been affected by the longstanding loss of trade as a result of the loss of so many homes, particularly as the district is affected by deprivation. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

Michael,Gordon,1068,http://www.westportnow.com/index.php%3F/v3/comments/changes_to_gpa_and_retiree_celebration/,"Monday, June 11, 2018 By Jarret Liotta A fun and emotional celebration for the Westport school district’s outgoing educators tonight contrasted with some poignant emotional statements made later regarding the “injustice” of the current GPA system at Staples High School. The system awards smaller numbers for students in B- and C-level courses and omits other areas of concentration outside the five major academics entirely. There were 21 school employees acknowledged in a ceremony at the start of tonight’s Board of Education meeting, with 431 total years of public education service to their credit. Outgoing Chairman Michael Gordon was also honored. Laughter and tears mingled. “I have seen my work, not as a job, but as a labor of love and I will miss all my children,” said Adele Cutrali-Valovich, Staples’ orchestra director, who had 35 years of service. Meanwhile, since a presentation by Staples’ Principal James D’Amico last week about proposed changes to the GPA system sparked dozens of complaints from parents, implementation was rolled back a year so it would only impact the incoming class of ’22. “We are really behind the times in terms of looking at this issue … We want to catch up,” Superintendent of Schools Colleen Palmer said. Several board members, however, are not strongly in favor of the plan, acknowledging complaints they’d received that more discussion is needed before it moves forward. “There hasn’t been much opportunity for this to be thought through,” said board member Elaine Whitney. “I wish that we had time to vet this even more,” said fellow board member Karen Kleine said. While administrators acknowledged timing the announcement could have been handled better, D’Amico said the matter had been in discussion for at least 10 years. “To me, it’s a wrong and to me it’s never too soon to change that,” he said, noting ironically that incoming freshmen who are taking honors courses next year will actually receive a “bump” in their GPA if this change is implemented. “When we look at the weighting, our top students are still going to get into the top schools … so I am not concerned about (the impact on) college admissions,” Palmer said. Several members of the public shared their support for the change, including Daniel Heaphy, a social studies teacher at Staples who teaches both advanced placement and B-level courses. “The current weighting system really promotes a lot of bad and harmful narratives inside Staples High School,” he said. Despite teachers guiding some students into B-level courses and assuring them that, for all intents and purposes, they’re just as worthwhile, under the current GPA system the numbers are not reflective of that. “We put a number on their work that devalues them,” he said. “We put a number on their work that makes us liars. And they know we’re liars.” “There is a stigma to being a B-level student,” said parent Marjorie Almansi, who has children taking different ranges of classes. “The system as it stands now completely discriminates against my boys in B,” she said, noting that even if they receive all A’s, they’re still only able to obtain a 3.67. “There’s a lot of kids in the middle (and) our children deserve a chance to excel just like the other kids,” said parent Jill Dillon, who also serves as co-president of the Kings Highway School PTA. She noted that the most vocal opponents do not necessarily represent the largest number of students, most of whom fall into the average range. “To tackle issues like this is why I wanted this job,” D’Amico said. “To me I’m really not going for dramatic effect when I say it’s injustice … and that we ought to fix it as soon as we can,” he said. “We all acknowledge the timing is off a little bit (but) what I believe they are trying to do is the right thing,” Palmer said. “The board will look forward to continuing discussions,” said Gordon, who bid an emotional farewell to colleagues earlier. He is resigning from the board after six and a half years because of work commitments.

Steve,Cummings,1067,https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/business/22m-teesside-university-centre-change-14773569,"Steve Cummings, Dean of the School of Science, Engineering and Design talks to Q2 ALMOST two centuries ago, Darlington was the centre of technology as the Stockton and Darlington Railway rolled into service and changed the way the world moved. The region’s confidence and ground-breaking ingenuity have continued to be its trademark over the following 193 years, and one particular corner of the town is proving that this reputation is as passionately held and well deserved as ever. The world is still watching what Darlington does next, and now the focus is on the 30-hectare Central Park, one of the region’s regeneration flagships and home to a remarkable cluster of nationally-important projects, including Teesside University’s campus and its Centre for Professional and Executive Development, the Centre for Process Innovation, the National Biologics Centre, Darlington College and Grade A offices at Business Central. Next year the whole site becomes a fulcrum of UK innovation with the opening of the £22million National Horizons Centre (NHC), a training and education provider for the bio-industry, offering programmes tailored to industry needs, laboratory and pilot plant facilities, as well as conferencing, teaching and seminar space. The NHC is vital if the region is to stay at the heart of advanced manufacturing, led by one of the driving forces behind the project Prof Steve Cummings, Dean of Teesside University’s School of Science, Engineering and Design and also holder of a Chair in Microbiology. Steve is a man inspired by his science and driven to use any means he can to spread the word about the importance of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to the future success of the whole economy. The NHC is the pinnacle of that evangelism — room after room, lab after lab and expert after expert dedicated to building the next generations of scientists, engineers, problem-solvers, innovators and leaders. For Steve, this one corner of the region is capable of rewriting the rules about how such projects should be assembled and run. “You have CPI at one end of the park, doing very high-level applied research and process development with huge numbers of multi-national companies,” he explains. “They then have opportunities to work with the university on the main campus and at the NHC, which is beneficial to us because our own staff and students can work collaboratively with these business to do something innovative. Our undergrads are there on site to see all that happen around them and will get a sense of what their degree can do for them. And then, just a few yards away, is Darlington College , an essential part of the cluster because that is where many of these journeys will begin for school-leavers. “For me, that structure is the visualisation of the opportunities possible here to develop pathways that can lead around the world and reach into any sector.” Steve joined the project two years ago and became an important catalyst, added to the formula for what will be a economically-significant site with high-value, knowledge-intensive processes in biologics and other advanced manufacturing sectors which are key to UK growth and competitiveness. Harnessing Teesside University’s unrivalled expertise in digital technologies, and its links with the Digital Catapult, will be a key feature of the NHC, with plans to work closely with supply chain companies, digital businesses and academics to develop digital solutions to any challenges industry can throw at it. Those businesses will benefit from hugely enhanced graduate skills in big data, virtual reality and visualisation technology, improved manufacturing efficiency, product quality and training services. He said: “When I came here the whole project was still in development, so I had a good look at the business plan and recognised that we needed to move it on a bit with a more holistic strategy which matched the university’s ambitions. “We also wanted to grow our links with the external stakeholder community. We were very clear this was all about a skills development agenda and how important that is for the industries we work with in the bio-sector, like CPI, and how we could widen that to engagement with the health sector. I think a lot of these elements were synergistic, but just weren’t being joined up. “We are in the middle of a huge technological advance which means that the opportunity and potential is an ever-moving feast. We have to keep talking to our partners about what they want, because we recognise that while they want to work with us and share our enthusiasm for what could be done here. “We will work with them to look past that just for a moment and investigate more deeply the strategic developments they might have further down the track. “This can be difficult because we can all get caught up in the moment. But it is a challenge we are tackling, and need to continue working on together.” So, in the following few months before the centre opens, Steve and his team will be working with consultants in the bio-economy to perfect the offering and make the sector around the world sit up and take notice and broaden their own horizons. The NHC is not just bricks and mortar, it is ideas, strategies, brilliance, foresight and collaboration that will combine to have a profound effect on the bio-economy by training and supplying the very people who will be building it for generations to come. “In the UK what we are building here will be unique,” says Steve. “There is a view that STEM can be quite dry and factual, but science can be hugely creative, which is why it attracts the very best people. It is not just about doing experiments, it is about what that offers and how it can help us push the boundaries ever further. We need more kids to see STEM as an opportunity, not just something for an engineer standing in a muddy field in a hi-viz jacket. “We are crossing another frontier at the National Horizons Centre and the potential is incredibly exciting.”

Steve,Cummings,1067,https://www.eurosport.com/cycling/dowsett-out-to-win-back-time-trial-crown-at-british-national-road-championships_sto6803558/story.shtml,"11/06/2018 at 11:07Updated 11/06/2018 at 13:14 Alex Dowsett says he will be out to ‘win back my jersey’ at the British National Road Championships later this month as he targets a sixth time trial crown. The 29-year-old finished a Grand Tour for only the second time in his career a fortnight ago as he rolled into Rome at the end of a dramatic Giro d’Italia won by Chris Froome, but his focus now is firmly on the national championships in Northumberland, where the time trial is scheduled for June 28. Dowsett has good cause to consider the national stripes to be ‘his’ jersey, having won in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016, but he was pipped to victory a year ago by veteran Steve Cummings, who beat him by nine seconds on the 44.4km circuit on the Isle of Man. “I want to get my jersey back,” Dowsett told Press Association Sport. “To lose it last year by so little was a real tough one to take on the chin, but the year as a whole was a tough one for me. I know I’m in a much better place going into the nationals.” Last season was a frustrating one for Dowsett, who found his role reduced at Movistar as he was left out of the Tour de France, left to watch from afar as Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas took the yellow jersey on an opening time trial in which Dowsett himself might have excelled. He has switched to Katusha-Alpecin this season, and immediately got his wish with a start in the Giro, where he finished fifth in the opening time trial in Jerusalem and sixth in the time trial from Trento to Rovereto on stage 16. “The two time trials were the main focus for me and getting a fifth and sixth was very solid because there were a lot of good time trialists at the Giro,” he said. “It was a very competitive field so I was happy with how it went.” There was drama for Dowsett in the middle of the race when his phone was stolen from his hotel bedside as he slept before the start of stage 15, an unsettling experience for an athlete in the middle of one of the toughest endurance events on the planet. “Someone came in whilst I was sleeping and took it from next to my head,” Dowsett said. “We went to do a police statement and everything. It’s not what you want to be doing in the middle of a Grand Tour.” Dowsett has only ever started three Grand Tours in his career, the 2013 Giro and 2015 Tour de France, but has the taste and would be keen to start next month’s Tour if the opportunity arose. The team’s principal focus in France will be targeting the sprint stages for German star Marcel Kittel. “I feel I can be a real help for Marcel in the sprints,” Dowsett said. “If there is a better guy than me to go then I would be the first to say take him, but absolutely I want to go. The Tour de France is the pinnacle.” But before then, everything will go into recapturing a British jersey. The men’s time trial will take place over three laps of a circuit starting and finishing at Kirkley Hall in Northumberland, with a total distance of 39.7km. “The course looks decent,” Dowsett said. “I want it as hard as it can be in terms of draggy roads and being lumpy but not mountainous. “There are a lot of UK guys who are fast but not strong. We’ve seen in the past when the nationals have been quite flat the gaps are small but when it’s tough the gaps are bigger.” :: Alex Dowsett is a professional cyclist for Team KATUSHA ALPECIN.

Phillip,Frost,1066,https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/06/11/1519534/0/en/OPKO-Health-Completes-Enrollment-in-Phase-2b-Study-of-OPK88003-to-Treat-Type-2-Diabetes-and-Obesity.html,"MIAMI, June 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) today announced it has completed enrollment of 110 subjects in a Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. OPK88003 is a once weekly injectable oxyntomodulin medicine with GLP-1 and glucagon dual agonist activity. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction of HbA1c levels over a 30-week period; weight loss and improvement of blood lipid profiles are secondary endpoints. Based on preclinical and Phase 2 data, the use of the dual agonist, OPK88003, once-weekly with an optimized dosing regimen, could more effectively improve glucose control, increase weight loss and improve the lipid profile in type 2 diabetics compared with the currently available GLP-1 medicines. ""We are pleased to announce complete enrollment in the Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 two months after we initiated the study. Our confidence in this compound is supported by the earlier Phase 2 data, and it is our hope that the outcome of the current study along with our existing body of data will prepare us for a pivotal Phase 3 program,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We believe the dual agonist activity of OPK88003 may better control glucose and improve long term cardiovascular outcomes in the growing population of type 2 diabetics worldwide."" According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), approximately 30 million people in the U.S. have type 2 diabetes and 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed each year. The ADA estimates the annual cost of care for diabetic patients to be $327 billion, including direct medical costs and reduced productivity1. _________________________ 1 http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/?loc=superfooter About OPK88003OPK88003 was previously evaluated in a blinded Phase 2 clinical trial of 420 patients with type 2 diabetes for 12 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for an additional 12 weeks. The study showed that OPK88003 reduced HbA1c levels by approximately 1.4% and resulted in statistically superior weight loss compared with the comparator, a weekly exenatide. Further, OPK88003 treatment resulted in a favorable decrease in triglycerides and cholesterol versus the weekly exenatide. About OPKO Health, Inc.

Jamie,Forese,1065,http://www.businessinsider.com/citi-executive-warns-banking-jobs-automation-2018-6,"createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); VCG/Getty Images Robots could replace as many as 10,000 human jobs at the banking giant Citi within five years, its president told the Financial Times. ""We've got 20,000 operational roles. Over the next five years could you make it 10,000?"" Jamie Forese, the president of Citi and chief executive of the bank's institutional clients group, told the Financial Times in an interview. Forese said the most likely areas for automation were in technology and operations, which accounts for almost 40% of the headcount at Citi's investment-banking arm. Forese described these roles as the ""most fertile for machine processing."" Other major banking executives made similar comments to the FT, with Goldman Sachs International's CEO, Richard Gnodde — the bank's most senior figure outside the US — saying he saw no reason automation couldn't keep growing. ""There are so many functions today that technology has already replaced and I don't see why that journey should end anytime soon,"" he said. These comments from major CEOs follow a stark warning in late 2017 about automation by John Cryan, who at the time was the CEO of Deutsche Bank. At a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, last September, Cryan warned that a ""big number"" of workers at the company would ultimately be replaced by robots and other forms of technology as the firm embraced a ""revolutionary spirit"" going forward. ""In our banks we have people behaving like robots doing mechanical things — tomorrow we're going to have robots behaving like people,"" he said. ""We have to find new ways of employing people and maybe people need to find new ways of spending their time ... The truthful answer is we won't need as many people."" Technological advances in banking and the wider jobs market mean that many think a large number of more straightforward jobs, such as data entry, will soon be replaced by automation. A 2016 report from the World Economic Forum argued that automation would lead to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies by 2020. Certain banking roles are already being affected by the rise of so-called robo-advisers, which are able to give automated financial advice to customers. This is a subscriber-only story.

Jamie,Forese,1065,https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/317325/bankers-jailed-financial-crisis,"by Sarah Butcher 12 June 2018 Among people who want to see 'bankers' paying painful penance for their role in the financial crisis, it's a popular refrain to complain that the perpetrators haven't been jailed. In the case of ex-RBS CEO Fred Goodwin with his vintage cars and £340k a year pension, this is true. But there is also someone paying dearly - and only now realizing the price. David Drumm was CEO at Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008. After borrowing €100k in bail money from his wife's parents, he was convicted last Friday of fraud at the Dublin criminal court. Drumm now faces what the Irish Independent describes as a, ""potentially unlimited amount of jail time,"" for his part in a €7.2bn fraud that resulted in the nationalization of Anglo Irish Bank in a deal that cost Irish citizens £22.4bn (€29bn). A well known figure in Ireland, Drumm has been largely ignored by everyone else. He looks doleful in all the photos and his hands reportedly trembled when he learned the verdict last week. An accountant by training, he helped hike Anglo's profits 70% during his first two years as CEO. Then came the financial crisis, hundreds of millions in directors' loans and a ruse by which Anglo sent €1.2bn of its own money in a circle through Irish Life, so that €7.2bn appeared to be ""customer"" cash at its year end. Drumm isn't the only AIB banker who's been punished: three others were jailed in 2016, but their terms of between two and three and a half years seem short compared to the 10 years or so that Drumm can likely expect. Drumm, who has been living in Boston, Massachusetts, with his wife and two daughters, tried to declare himself bankrupt in 2010 after declaring debts of $14.3m and assets of $13.9m, but his attempt was refused. At the trial, he had no supporters on the public benches and no one but his lawyers came to speak to him after he had been sentenced. None of his family were in court for the sentencing: his wife went back to Boston for his daughter's graduation. While life goes on for everyone else, Drumm is going down alone. His haunted expression should be a palliative for everyone who wants to see pain in the crisis perpetrators, and a warning to bankers anywhere who might feel tempted to nefarious actions. Separately, Jamie Forese, the president of Citi's institutional clients group (its investment bank) has a warning for anyone working in technology and operations. Forese told the Financial Times that Citi will likely half its 20,000 technology and operations staff in the next five years as machines take over.

James,Forese,1064,http://rivieraradio.mc/news/evening-news-update-tuesday-12-june,"The former head of the Nice judicial police, Michel Neyret, has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for corruption. The sentence was delivered by the appeals court in Paris. After a 32 year career including 20 years at the head of the anti-gang brigade of Lyon, Neyret was a legend at the time of his fall. He was accused of having provided confidential information to members of the Lyon community in exchange for benefits, gifts and cash. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, including 18 months suspended, as well as a permanent ban from the police force. The prosecutor general may still decide to appeal the sentence. About 12,000 electricity customers in Valbonne experienced cuts to their power supplies this morning. The disruptions to the supply were the result of a demonstration being staged by employees of energy company Enedis at an electricity sub-station. The protest was against changes in salary levels, terms of employment and proposed redundancies. Latest figures show that 19 people have been killed on the roads of the Alpes Maritimes since the beginning of the year. Of those, eleven were riding a motorbike or scooter. Strike action by France’s rail network the SNCF is continuing today with 1 out of 2 regional trains operating and 3 out of 5 TGV’s running. Unions have called for a “massive” participation ahead of the government’s plans to implement the reforms on Thursday. Eric Ciotti, MP for the Alpes Maritimes, has said that France should not take in the 629 migrants who are currently adrift in the Mediterranean on the boat Aquarius. Speaking on French television this morning, M. Ciotti said that no French port should accept the boat and that it should return to the Libyan coast. The Spanish government announced yesterday that it would accept the boat to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, a decision M. Ciotti described as a mistake. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron has today accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the ship dock in Italy. A doctor from Menton has been appointed head of the non-governmental organization Médecins du Monde. Philippe de Botton has been involved with the organization since 1989. BUSINESS In the UK, there’s been a larger than expected rise in the number of people in work. There were 32.39 million people in work in the February-to-April period. That was an increase of 146,000 over the previous quarter, and 440,000 more than in the same period last year. In the United States, inflation rose slightly in May. The US Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index increased 0.2%. In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 2.8%, the biggest advance since February 2012. The head of Citigroup's investment bank has suggested that the bank could dispense with up to half of its 20,000 technology and operations staff in the next five years due to automation. In an interview with the Financial Times, James Forese said that the 20,000 posts at Citi were ""most fertile for machine processing"". SPORT FOOTBALL…Real Madrid have appointed Spain manager Julen Lopetegui as their new head coach on a three-year deal. He previously managed Porto for two years, before taking over at the Spanish national team in July 2016. Former England boss Sam Allardyce says he is ""jealous"" of Gareth Southgate and believes it should be him leading the national team at the World Cup. Allardyce left his post as England coach in September 2016 after only one match in charge. His exit followed claims by a newspaper that he gave advice on how to ""get around"" player transfer rules. BASKETBALL… fans are gathering in Monaco for the league final playoffs against Le Mans.

James,Forese,1064,https://luxtimes.lu/economics/34082-investment-banking-stronger-franchises-emerge-ten-years-after-crisis,"Succession of cost-cutting plans has made investment banks leaner, mergers & acquisitions boom boosted fee income When Lehman Brothers imploded almost 10 years ago, few Wall Street banks were worse placed to withstand the fallout than Citigroup. While most of its rivals had delivered bumper profits in 2007, Citi had already seen its earnings collapse to $3.6 billion (€3 billion) from $21.5 billion (€18.2 billion) after its subprime bets went badly wrong. Yet, a decade on from the crisis that threatened such devastation, Citi’s investment bank chief James Forese can say without irony: ""I don’t think there is much question that we’ve been a winner since the crisis. Even from the [high] of the 2005/06 period to today . . . our franchise is much stronger today than it was back then."" Already have an account? Sign in here.

Andrew,Davis,1062,http://slippedisc.com/2018/06/britains-next-rising-baton-is-a-spaniard/,"The CBSO has an unrivalled record in training conductors for the future, Recent assistant conductors of local origin include Alpesh Chauhan and Jonathan Bloxham, both now well launched. The next one, announced today, is … Jaume Santonja Espinós. Surely he isn’t Britain’s rising star, he’s Spain’s! how about Halle’s young conductors, Edward Gardner Andrew gourlay Jamie Phillips and jonathan Heyward How about the Halle, Edward Gardner, Andrew Gourlay, Jamie Phillips and Jonathon Heyward Jamie Phillips, of course – like Ben Gernon at the BBC Philharmonic – cut his teeth on summer conducting workshops with the CBSO Youth Orchestra. And lots of other places too, of course. This stuff never happens in isolation. What matters is that young talent is coming through and it’s being nurtured. Certainly not so recent, but the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra has in its history had a very distinguished series of Assistants including Sir Alexander Gibson, Sir Colin Davis, James Lockhart, Sir Andrew Davis and Sir Simon Rattle. Hard to top that list! I won’t show this headline to any of my Spanish friends. (Jaume is a Catalan name.) +1 Actually, he´s not Catalan at all. He´s from Valencia. Similar language & names but it´s a whole different region/autonomous community. Nothing to do with Catalonia. Valencians would be pretty upset that you took him for a Catalan. That´s kind of an insult. And I fear he will leave the Antwerp Symphony Orchestra now… https://www.jaumesantonja.com/bio Anyway, I wish him good luck and a brillant carreer.

Start spotting locations for a summer of craft beer and local history/arts/outdoors/architecture/culture jaunts: Lapel, in Madison County, is part of the Anderson Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 2010, Lapel’s population was just around 2,000. Its platting in 1876 between the newly laid tracks of the Anderson, Lebanon & St. Louis Railroad and the old Pendleton & Fishersburg Turnpike (now Ind. 132) took on the V-shape of a suit coat lapel, hence its name. Lapel’s location also is distinctive as residing atop a coral reef; its early economic base centered on limestone quarries and natural gas. Owens-Brockway Glass Container is a carry-over from Lapel’s century-old glass manufacturing status. There are mysteries imbedded in the town’s history—what happened to the Civil War “Recruiting Rock?” What happened the gold coins reportedly buried on John Castor’s farm sometime around 1848? Madison County History Center, however, claims the “real treasure in Lapel is its old buildings.” One them, at 908 Main St., is home to the newly opened Pax Verum Brewing Company owned by head brewers Jason Watson, Doug Goff, and Chris Magee. Spokesperson Maria Magee gave NUVO the specifics to back up her enthusiastic, “[Creating] this place has been a labor of love that we are so proud of! “[The building] was built in 1900, as a jewelry store. We have tried to create an ambiance in this space that highlights the original architecture while preserving/repurposing much of its existing wood and bricks, as well as adding fabricated metalwork to give a little industrial vibe. “We have used a lot of reclaimed wood from the area and our bar top has been salvaged from an old local grain elevator. We are keeping things local. We support local craftsmen and vendors. We are proud to be Indiana grown, as we source our hops from Crazy Horse Hops in Knightstown. We are serving a limited ""express menu"" provided by Joe Hsu with 5280 Bistro, who has created a handcrafted house beer cheese made with our beer to be served with warm Bavarian style pretzels.” Andrew Davis, manager at Pax Verum Brewing Company, reported, “We focus on hop forward beers but do offer lighter beers, as well as two stouts and a red ale currently. “Jason and Doug both have their own recipes they’ve perfected home brewing [for eight years] at Jason’s workshop on 191st Street, roughly 1.5 miles from Lapel."" He continues, ""Our beer menu will pull from their past recipes, as well as expand on them [on a 10 barrel system, with 4 fermenters and 2 bright tanks]."" “Ultimately, you will find 15 rotating taps at the brewhouse,” said Maria Magee. “Pax Verum operates with a three-way beer, wine and liquor license. We have something for everyone.” This includes daytime yoga and evenings with live music and vinyl, on what Magee calls a state-of-art “high quality sound system with a reel to reel and turntable. We want you to think of our space as a Listening Room."" “I left out some details that are best to be experienced,” she concluded. “My words can't do it justice, you will have to see and hear for yourself,” adding “Pax Verum translates to True Peace.” Hence the mantra: Peace. Truth. Beer."" Latin naming continues along the Ohio River New Albany-based Donum Dei [“Gift of God”] Brewery is cited as Indiana’s “fastest growing small and independent brewery” by Brewers’ Association in their survey covering 24 States. Donum Dei opened in 2015 at 3211 Grant Line Road with re-purposed equipment as a 10-barrel system by Brewer Richard Otey, CEO Kimberly Otey and business partner Jonathan Ruff. Their home page states, “We were able to complete the build with little debt load by doing the work ourselves using our own money.” With neither televisions, nor WiFi being offered, their lure was being a family-friendly neighborhood space to stop in and have a face-to-face conversation while enjoying a beer. Between 2016 and 2017, Donum Dei doubled its capacity from 150 to 300 barrels. To push growth they would need to add fermenters. Instead, they opted to develop a distillery and bottle spirits, including vodka, gin, apple brandy and whiskey, under the name of Die Shine [“to shine”], and describe themselves as a ‘Brewstillery.’ Still more growth in New Albany, per a notice from almost four-year-old Floyd County Brewing Company, located at 129 W. Main St., where the mantra ‘Food, Froth, Follies’ expands into the newly opened beer garden and auxiliary bar. While the original Brew Haus is a family-friendly brewpub with a full service restaurant, Brewer Brian and co-owner Julie Hampton designed the new Grain Haus as a walk-up bar to foster the kind of socialization that parlays into local history. Everything you lean on and sit upon, is re-purposed and re-claimed from former buildings, including a Jasper-based grain silo, an old barn in Salem, and bowling lanes from New Albany’s Hoosier Strike and Spare bowling alley. You’re encouraged to chat up the barkeeps. The Hamptons’ concept of “feeling invested in the community” tends to knowing about your community. Segue to Carmel, home base for Danny Boy Beer Works, which recently announced, “a new venture in spirits—Danny Boy Distilling Works—at the brewery in the Village of West Clay, located in the Tank 13 building. “With this new distillery, we have taken the art and creativity of making wicked awesome craft beers and applied it to making a great lineup of artisanal spirits and craft cocktails,” said owner Kevin ‘KP’ Paul, in a news release. Buddha vodka is available now at Danny Boy Beer and Distilling Works and the Brockway Pub, both located in Carmel, and at Danny Boy Craft Works Notre Dame. Danny Boy Beer Works In Greenwood, Oaken Barrel is sprucing up their location at 50 North Airport Road, just in time for their 24th anniversary on July 4. Owner Kwang Casey emailed NUVO, “Construction in our Brewhouse is under way and we are excited to see the finished product! We feel this makeover will be a welcome addition for not only Oaken Barrel, but for you all as well. “Nathan Scruggs is our Assistant Brewer [making a switch from Rock Bottom]. Alejandra Cuenca is our brewery assistant. She started as a cellarman in the brewery, and has worked for us for seven-plus years. She has become a great brewer and a great asset to Oaken Barrel. Along with some new seasonal beers brewed by our assistant brewers, you should expect continuance of great beers from our brewing team, headed by John Treeter. “Also, you should come to Franklin, Indiana,” added Casey. “Along with Billy and Todd of Bemis Group, I have restored a 90-year-old factory into a beautiful event center with two large reception halls and a beautiful modern bar.” The Garment Factory Event Center at 101 E. Wayne St. is just south of the city of Franklin Courthouse. Look for more reports about new openings and expansions.

The problem was that I entered through the Michigan Avenue side; I ended up ascending a spiral staircase that lead to the cavernous spot. A better idea for diners is to enter the Blackstone Hotel on the Balbo Street side. Mercat originally opened in 2008, but underwent a renovation about a year and half ago, with a decor that has as much a Catalan aesthetic as the delightful cuisine ( which is courtesy of Chef Diego Amat Lopez, who is fromdrum roll, pleaseCatalonia ). Traditional tapas include house-marinated Spanish olives, ciabatta bread with Iberian ham and tomato ( just divine ), diver scallops, the gustatory Russian-roulette dish of shishito peppers ( with one in 10 being spicy ), sardines topped with vanilla and olive oil ( and tasting better than it sounded ), lovely patatas bravas and bacon-wrapped dates ( with almonds, in cheese fondue ). Lopez offers a huge variety of intriguing and even challenging dishes in addition to some of the previously mentioned items. There are Catalan beignets filled with Brandade, quince aioli and celery root salad; Atlantic cod, pil pil, garlic chip, guindilla chile and alubias blancas/navy beans; and even a $65 roasted suckling pig, accompanied by Yukon gold potato, calcots and sauces. And then there are the paellashuge pans of valencia rice with variations that include chorizo, rabbit, chicken and shitake mushrooms; diver scallops, prawns, clams and mussels; and asparagus, peas, artichoke hearts and smoked eggplant. We actually opted for the other offering: squid-ink paella with calamari, pork sausage, pork loin, artichokes and garlic aioli. It was pretty tasty, save for some tougher artichoke parts that I encountered here and there. As for the ""a la Planxa"" in the restaurant's name ( meaning ""grilled on a metal plate"" ), there are menu items such as Black Angus ribeye, secreto and hanger steak. Dessert is a must, with olive-oil cake, ice cream and sorbets, and chocolate torte among the choices. You really can't go wrong.

Furious Spoon teams with Howard Brown Health In celebration of Pride Month, Furious Spoon announces the Pride Bowl in partnership with Howard Brown Health, offering a colorful bowl of ramen with proceeds benefiting the organization during all of June. The rainbow ramen creation, of course, showcases the LGBTQ flag, paying homage to Chicago's community during the celebratory month. Priced at $15, two dollars from every bowl will be donated to Howard Brown, which aims to eliminate the disparities in healthcare experienced by the LGBTQ community through research, education and provision of services promoting health and wellness. The Pride Bowl is available at most Furious Spoon locations, including those in Wicker Park, Logan Square, Pilsen, Andersonville, Evanston and Lake View.

Michael,Gordon,1061,http://www.chesterstandard.co.uk/news/16282307.Take_a_look_inside_the_cafe_dedicated_to_Ellesmere_Port_life_prisoner_Charles_Bronson/,"Chester 9°c I had thought that themed restaurants - where you can eat off a vampire’s coffin, beneath a man on the flying trapeze or seated between Alice in Wonderland’s Mad Hatter and March Hare – were a thing from that there London or more eccentric cities in Japan and the US. Except for a Wild West or Pirate themed eatery in Blackpool, I hadn’t expected to find a themed restaurant in the North West. So, I was more than surprised to learn of a café dedicated to Ellesmere Port life prisoner and “Britain’s most dangerous convict” Charles Bronson in, of all places, Salford. But this isn’t a hipster venue where you drink over-priced coffee from a jam jar or fish and chips out of a roller skate. Rather it’s a community café – a ‘greasy spoon’ if you will – dedicated to a man who has spent just four months and nine days out of custody since he was jailed for seven years for armed robbery at the age of 22 in 1974. So, during a trip to Salford Quays, I decided to take a look at this most quirky of cafes for myself. There is a small car park at the back of a row of shops on busy Broughton Road in Salford. After walking around to the front of the shops, there is no mistaking the Official Bronson’s Café. In striking red, black and white, familiar colours throughout Salford, is the man’s famous face, with spectacles, handle-bar moustache and shaved head. 65-year-old Bronson, now jailed at HMP Frankland and known as Charlese Salvador in honour of the surrealist painter, is a keen cook and has sent his best wishes to the team at the café. His wife Paula had cut the ribbon at the grand opening just six days earlier, but when I arrived it was a much quieter atmosphere. On entering, it is noticeable how bright and spotlessly clean the café is. But what grabs your attention is the Bronson artwork and memorabilia that lines the walls. One wall is crammed with the man’s own artwork while opposite is a stark black and white mural of a prison corridor. A signed photograph wishing the cafe well. Above the counter is a signed photograph from the man himself, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson in Aberystwyth in 1952 and was raised in Ellesmere Port, and next to it is a prison-style door that leads to the spotlessly clean customer toilets. The menu. The menu is small and includes “The Bronson Belly Buster” and straight-jacket potatoes. But the two ladies behind the counter had just prepared a Sunday roast – with a choice of beef of chicken – so I went with this option. Moments later I had a plate piled high with food – two types of potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, chicken and stuffing all coated in a generous helping of gravy – with more available on request. For £6.80, including a can of Fanta, it was definitely value for money. It’s these generous Sunday dinners, just like mum or nan used to make, that could be the key to this café’s longevity after the Bronson buzz has died down. Already popular with builders working on the many construction sites in Salford during the week, the café could be a goldmine on Sundays. As one retired teacher who has come in for Sunday lunch and a read of the newspapers said, there are no other local cafes that offer Sunday dinners. Once word gets out they could be queuing out the door. As one young man said before tucking into his roast: “It’s mint in here”. Despite the somewhat unusual theme of the café, there is a real community spirit here. All the food remaining at the end of the day is donated to a nearby homeless shelter and, as one member of staff joked, ""the homeless round here have never been so well fed"".

John,O'Neil,1060,https://www.thestar.com/vancouver/2018/06/10/researchers-explore-healing-power-of-yoga-at-canada-india-health-conference.html,"This copy is for your personal non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com When Naseem Gulamhusein was diagnosed with an inflammatory digestive disease roughly 20 years ago, she was told that with no known cure, medication was the only option. Exposed to yoga at an early age, she turned to the practice to get at the root of her illness, refusing to accept living with a lifetime of chronic pain. “At 42, I’m healthier than I’ve ever felt in my entire life,” she told StarMetro. “I’ve managed my own disease through yoga, along with taking medicine.” Gulamhusein was a presenter at the third Canada India Networking Initiative (CINI) conference in Surrey, co-hosted by Fraser Health and Simon Fraser University. The event, from Friday to Sunday, brought together local and international health experts to bridge gaps in care — for both Canada and India — through technology and innovation, such as using alternative health practices. A growing field of research highlights the benefits of yoga — from helping cancer treatment to panic attacks. Medicine and yoga are complementary, she explained: Where the former looks at symptoms, the latter supports well-being. Gulamhusein designed the yoga teacher training program at Langara College, one of the first academic programs in the country. She hopes to roll out an integrated yoga therapist program by next year. But the two are not the same, she noted. Therapy requires a stricter accreditation process, and often one-on-one treatment is involved to deal with chronic health conditions. Gulamhusein’s goal is to raise the standards for yoga as therapy, recognizing it’s a tradition from India with an approach to holistic health. “For so long, I’ve seen yoga get lost in a sea of appropriation,” she said. “It’s become this universal understanding. We also need to recognize where yoga has come from and where it is going.” The conference didn’t focus on yoga alone. With more than 40 years in clinical medicine, CINI chair Dr. Arun Garg told StarMetro that while Canada has built a sophisticated system for dealing with acute illnesses, changes in demography — such as aging populations and increased cultural diversity — are leading to spikes in chronic diseases. “These (chronic illnesses) are with you 24/7 and 365 days a year, whereas acute care is episodic,” he explained, noting this year’s conference focused on diabetes, palliative care and mental health. “Addressing these is becoming the biggest requirement for healthy societies.” Despite the attention on the South Asian community, Garg insisted the issues are also applicable to the general population, since problems such as hypertension, dementia and obesity are present everywhere, including in other ethnic populations. The conference opened with remarks from B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix and Dr. Victoria Lee, chief medical health officer at Fraser Health. There were presentations on a wide range of social innovation and alternative health topics. SFU health sciences professor John O’Neil detailed a pilot project developed with the First Nations Health Authority, Tzu Chi Foundation and the Snuneymuxw First Nation to explore providing traditional Chinese medicine services to First Nations in British Columbia. On Sunday, SFU senior lecturer Paola Ardiles spoke about the Health Change Lab, which brings together 20 undergraduate students from multi-disciplines — such as business, interactive arts and health sciences — to use technology to solve social and health issues. For two years, the lab — in collaboration with the City of Surrey, Fraser Health and non-profit organizations — has examined solutions targeting social issues identified by partners, such as food security, youth engagement, substance abuse and socially isolated seniors. “Often there is a social cause at the root of complex health problems,” Ardiles said. “Complex issues require more than one perspective.” Melanie Green is a Vancouver-based reporter covering food culture and policy.

Andrew,Davis,1058,https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/annesophie-mutter-how-the-violin-great-keeps-each-performance-fresh-20180611-h117wu.html,"Anne-Sophie Mutter can't count the number of times she has played the Tchaikovsky violin concerto in her four-decade career. But the only time she will play it this year will be when she visits Australia this week. Keeping it fresh: Celebrated violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. ""Of course, 2018 is the big Penderecki year (the Polish composer turns 85), so there is a focus on his work,"" the great German violin virtuoso, 54, says by phone from her Berlin home. ""But I'm greatly looking forward to the Tchaikovsky because it's one of the few super-exciting romantic pieces in the repertoire with a wonderful balance between the lyrical aspects and the amazing virtuosity – particularly in the last movement, where I really love to challenge the orchestra and conductor and, obviously, myself."" Mutter – who plays with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra from June 14 to 16 under David Robertson and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra from June 21 (a masterclass) to 23 – says she has no problem keeping her interpretation fresh. ""I am not the type of person who gets bored with something as exciting and multi-layered as the Tchaikovsky concerto. So every time I play it I get excited, and am looking for a different approach, maybe for a longer musical line, more purity, maybe less romanticism, because Tchaikovsky can also be looked at as a post-classical composer. There are many philosophical ideas you can wrestle with, and no right approach."" Working with living composers emphasises this, she says, because they are excited to find musicians with their own viewpoints, which can be opposed to each other. ""For example, Gidon Kremer's interpretation of my Sofia Gubaidulina violin concerto [written for Mutter] is totally opposed to what I did in the world premiere, and Mrs Gubaidulina was perfectly happy with both, because both Kremer and I had good reasons for our interpretation. ""The same is true of the Tchaikovsky. It's a constant path of renewal and question marks. I find that nothing is more important for music than to really question what you are doing and why, because I do not believe in formulas of interpretation."" Mutter famously made her concert debut with the Tchaikovsky at 13 with Herbert von Karajan at the Salzburg Festival – starting at the very summit. But if Karajan was her most notable mentor, another conductor she worked with a great deal in her youth is the one she will reconnect with in Melbourne, Sir Andrew Davis. ""I'm particularly happy to recollaborate with Andrew Davis, who was my favourite long-term conductor in my younger years."" They haven't worked together for decades, Mutter says. ""Sometimes it happens that you totally lose track of a musical companion and rejoin later."" She is also particularly excited about playing the Australian premiere in both cities of one of her favourite composers, John Williams – a work for violin, harp and string orchestra the celebrated film composer wrote for Mutter. ""I adore his film scores because they really ennoble the films he has done, whether it's Star Wars or Lincoln. His music is truly an art form of craftsmanship and understanding of tonal colours and harmonies."" This piece is lyrical, she says, like a fantasy. Is that the 27th work written for Mutter, a noted champion of contemporary music? ""I think so, probably around that number. There is a lot of contemporary music happening in the next few months, and that's why I love to include highly romantic repertoire from time to time – that brings me back to what the violin is best at. It's a wonderful, expressive melodic instrument, of course with the capacity to really dazzle in its virtuosity as well.""

At the Wedge, it’s not about making it out—it’s about pulling in. For the most part, the wipeout is a foregone conclusion. It’s simply part of the experience there, and a successful ride is just the cherry on top of a very delicious sundae. The footage you see above was shot by resident camera expert Steve Cummings (aka Jacuzzi Surfer) on May 23rd. “I filmed from 5:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.!” he wrote. “I hope you guys enjoyed the madness.

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:26 pm When Deloris Van Cartier, a very so-so disco singer, witnesses a local mob boss administering “lead poisoning” to a snitch she suddenly finds herself in the greatest demand of her career: as a witness for a local cop who’s been trying to ice said mob boss for years and by said mob boss who wishes to gift Deloris with a couple of 45 caliber slugs of basic element Pb. Meanwhile, back at the Queen of Angels church and nunnery, parishioner populations and donations have shrunk lower than the good sisters’ ability to carry a tune and it looks for all the universe that the building is about to be sucked up by a couple of alternative relationship guys who want to turn it into just the most darling little antique furniture emporium, thus side-walking or nursing-homing an even dozen of Sister Mary’s. But where better to hide a homicide witness from the mob? And who better to tune up the singing nuns and inject some serious rock into their roll? Nick Koesters as the top mobster and Andrew Hampton Livingston as the cop out to cage him have never been better while a stage-full of Barter’s yummiest actresses — and even Zacchaeus Kimbrel as Sister Mary Thais (think about it) — prove once and for all that beauty can’t be hidden by yards and yards of black cloth. Rick McVey, in a tiny pork pie hat, has just got to be the cutest little mobster ever and Paris Bradstreet overflowing a way too-small hooker get-up is one of those brain worms you wish you hadn’t seen. About the only actress that really doesn’t fit this wonderful ensemble is Raven Flowers aka Deloris Van Cartier herself who comes across as just a little too loud, a little too brash but, then again, that’s exactly who she is supposed to be and, for me at least, a couple of downward clicks on the old hearing aids was problem solved. Directed by Richard Rose, “Sister Act” is a show most worthy of the fine old Barter. If you’re looking for a send-up or sarcastic take on Catholicism, Christianity or religion in general you won’t find it here. Or, if you’re one of the millions of Americans erotically aroused by being offended by anything and everything, give it up. This show is 99.9 percent immaculate fun and the final tenth of a percent is magical Barter pixie dust. For reservations: 276-628-3991 or www.bartertheatre.com.

People were encouraged to sing a song or sing along with others in the spirit of the season. (Gazette file photo) An Indiana County worship team has been selected to lead the Faith Night celebration next weekend at an Altoona Curve baseball game. After they appeared for the Curve’s Faith Night event in August 2016, team officials invited His Word and Worship, a combination of Indiana area singers, musicians and pastors, to lead the next program at 5 p.m. Sunday, June 17, at PNG Park in Altoona. “With all the people that they could invite, to invite us back is pretty cool,” said worship team leader Anthony Frazier, of Indiana. His Word and Worship is a group of Indiana County Christians sharing the good news of the gospel through music and worship. Under Frazier’s leadership, His Word and Worship has provided contemporary, Christian and popular music for many private and public events, festivals, gatherings and coffeehouses in the region. The pregame Faith Night event coincides with Father’s Day and a handful of other Curve promotions: June 17 also is the Ritchey’s Dairy Kids’ Club Game, Tyrone Night and Fireworks Night at the ballpark. Altoona’s Element Church is the main presenter for Faith Night. Members of His Word and Worship include Frazier, Julie Davis, Andrew Davis, Max Davis, Michaele Davis, Barry Little, Kirt Anderson, David Beck, Tracy Gordish, Dan Shaffer and Ryan Long. The group’s speakers for the program are Dr. David J. Henderson, Father Harold Hicks, Pastor Kirt Anderson and Julie Davis. Those planning to attend the game may contact Julie Davis for group rate tickets. NOTE: This article edited 3:30 p.m. June 11 to clarify Frazier's remarks. Originally published 10 a.m. June 9.

Michael,Gordon,1053,http://www.wbtv.com/story/38383294/members-of-nc-church-known-for-blasting-out-demons-accused-of-bilking-taxpayers,"RUTHERFORDTON, NC (Michael Gordon and Joe Marusak/The Charlotte Observer) - A prominent leader of a controversial Western North Carolina church is accused of devising a scheme that cheated taxpayers out of tens of thousands of dollars in unemployment benefits. Kent Covington of Rutherfordton, a top minister in the Word of Faith Fellowship church, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Over five years, according to the indictment, Covington and ""co-conspirators"" filed more than $250,000 in phony unemployment claims for employees who kept working for companies owned by Word of Faith members. Starting in 2008, the indictment said, Covington masterminded a scheme to help his plastics manufacturing company survive the recession by laying off his work force, applying for unemployment benefits for his employees, then forcing them to keep working. For the next five years, taxpayers and not Covington paid the employees' salaries, according top the indictment. The indictment also accuses Covington of using his influence as a Word of Faith leader to force the other church members who worked for his Diverse Corporate Technologies Inc., to participate in the conspiracy. Diane McKinny, a Covington employee and fellow Word of Faith member, also was named in the indictment and accused of filing fraudulent paperwork to support the unemployment claims. According to the indictment, Covington and McKinny obtained more than six months of free labor for Covington's company, paid for by the government instead of the business. The 63-year-old Covington also is accused of passing on the blueprint of his scheme to other church members who owned companies struggling through the recession. T Two church members who implemented the scheme were the father-and-son podiatry team of Jason and Jerry Gross, who began laying off employees at Foot & Ankle Center of the Carolinas in 2009, prosecutors said. Both pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in Asheville federal court last month, the Associated Press reported. According to Thursday's indictment, between 2009 and 2011, versions of the unemployment benefits scheme were used at a church member-owned contracting business and two more of Covington's companies. The legal problems of the Covington family continue to mount. Brooke Covington, another top Word of Faith leader, and four other church members are scheduled to stand trial on accusations that they repeatedly beat a former congregant to drive the ""gay demon"" out of him, the (Asheville) Citizen Times reported. Word of Faith also is at the center of investigations here and in Brazil on whether the church set up a human pipeline with its Brazilian missions to come up with cheap or free employees for the businesses of church members. In the Kent Covington case, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office said they are seeking almost $310,000 in forfeitures from the defendants, according to Thursday's indictment. Kent Covington and the 65-year-old McKinny are scheduled to appear in court on June 18. ""We take these accusations very seriously and are conducting our own investigation,"" Stephen Cash, an Asheville lawyer for the church, said in a statement to the Observer on Thursday night. ""We intend to respond to the indictment in the near future."" 1 Julian Price Pl.Charlotte, NC 28208(704) 374-3500

With the Bunnies leading 18-16 in the final minute, fullback Alex Johnston coasted through the Titans' defence, drawing fullback Michael Gordon. Johnston passed the ball, with Titans centre Brenko Lee appearing to knock it back into Rabbitohs winger Robert Jennings. The ball then appeared to go forward off Jennings and over the sideline, which should have resulted in a scrum feed to the Titans, who would then have had to go 90 metres to score. Still, a chance is a chance. MORE: Gold Coast Titans forward Keegan Hipgrave sin-binned twice in one game | Titans try bombed as Dale Copley, Keegan Hipgrave knock on by getting in each other's way But referee Grant Atkins ruled in favour of South Sydney. ""It's off Brenko Lee,"" Atkins was heard saying on the referees' microphone. Titans playmaker Ash Taylor was furious with the call, and protested to Atkins. Watch the controversial decision in the video player below: The bunker had the opportunity to tip Atkins off, as the replay was shown before the Rabbitohs fed the scrum, but they didn't. Former Queensland Origin forward Corey Parker felt the decision was incorrect. ""They've got that wrong, they've got that wrong the referees,"" he said on Fox League, as the Rabbitohs held on to win by two points. Fans on Twitter agreed, letting loose on the officials. #NRLTitansSouths and this is why the @nrl and @NRLBunker are a joke clearly shows Souths knock that ball out but no one wants to question ref and overrule Wow when you think the NRL refs can’t get any worse..... SURPRISE!! #NRL #NRLTitansSouths pic.twitter.com/vByACbZkvp Titans dudded by 2 calls in 2 min. Changed the momentum in a big way at the end of the game.

Rick,McVey,1051,https://www.marketsmedia.com/trader-job-requirement-agility/,"The ongoing evolution of fixed income markets has shaken up the desired skill set of the fixed income trader. Key themes discussed over the past couple days at the WBR Fixed Income Leaders Summit include automation, data, and artificial intelligence. Much has changed over the past several years, and more change is ahead, so traders cannot be set in their ways. Supurna VedBrat, BlackRock “It is important that today’s traders have the mindset that can change easily,” said Supurna VedBrat, Global Head of Trading at BlackRock, at a Friday morning keynote interview. “Agility is important. Forward thinking is important. Innovative DNA. And having the savvy to be able to use technology to advance business processes.” VedBrat cited working well with others as a requirement, as fixed income trading is increasingly a collaborative endeavour, both in terms of working with portfolio managers internally, and interfacing with multiple external constituencies to source liquidity. In a market where data has proliferated and trading desks have yet to get their arms fully around another key skill for a trader is the ability to “understand the story of what the data is telling us,” VedBrat said. Regarding automated execution, VedBrat said the framework is to leverage data to make decisions on where to route a trade, based on acceptable price parameters. “We want to allow data to simplify and make executon more efficient,” she said. “Automation is not replacing human intelligence — it is making human decision-making smarter and faster.” BlackRock is open to using more all-to-all, or open, trading if that’s where the other side of the trade can be found. “We need to be able to reach liquidity regardless of where it is,” said VedBrat, who added that the distinction between buy side and sell side is not as important in this context, as any market participant can provide liquidity. With all all-to-all trading, “we have seen success in couple different markets” she said. “Assets are sitting with the buy side, so the buy side is in a pretty good position to be able to provide liquidity. The buy side provides liquidity as a price maker when ready to declare a price at which they’re willing to exchange risk.” In introductory remarks for the keynote interview, MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey cited four major trends the platform operator is seeing: (1) a proliferation of data, (2) substantial technology investment to automate processes, (3) a transformation of the odd-lot market, and (4) increasing adoption of all-to-all trading.

Andrew,Davis,1049,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/8/caps-fans-celebrate-deep-night/,"Nero fiddles while Trump burns The sensation nation Time to tighten absentee, mail-in and early voting rules It was a few minutes after midnight Friday morning as Andrew Davis stood at an outdoor table at the The Penn Quarter Sports Tavern on Indiana Avenue in northwest Washington, which was filled inside and out. He was a few blocks south of Capital One Arena, where he had been on hand for the watch party that nearly filled the arena to watch the Capitals beat host Las Vegas 4-3 to win the first title in franchise history. Davis said he has been going to about 10 games a year for the past few seasons but was not able to attend as much this year since he became a father. But the southern Maryland resident wanted to be sure he was on hand for Thursday night. So what was his reaction when the Capitals won for the first title in major D.C. sports in 26 years? “I cried,” said Davis, wearing a T.J. Oshie jersey. He said he didn’t figure to get back home until 4 a.m. or so. A few minutes earlier, inside the arena, souvenirs went on sale to mark the title. Among the first in line was Brandon Murray, 38, of Largo, Maryland. He bought a Capitals baseball hat for $35 that said Stanley Cup champions. “I had to come here. It was part of history. It was the absolute best,” he said. A D.C. police officer, standing outside said all 3,400 people on the force were expected to work Thursday. And the bulk of those were based near Chinatown and around Capital One Arena, with the rest of the city getting minimal coverage, he said. While Alex Ovechkin and his teammates celebrated on the ice in Las Vegas, strangers embraced on the streets of the District. “After 12 years of watching misery and heartbreak, this couldn’t feel better,” Grant Howe said. “There’s no other city that would enjoy this more.” “So many heartbreaks,” Junaid Hussain said. “Finally won this [expletive].” “Means a lot for D.C. and Landover,” Louis Snowden said. “This is for us.” And for Darren Ewing, a ticket holder since the Capitals’ inaugural season, he encountered “sheer disbelief” as time ticked down inside Capital One Arena. “Been a fan since Day 1,” he said. “Cried like a baby.” The crowd at the National Portrait Gallery steps at about 11:40 p.m. Thursday pic.twitter.com/xG1n1trsix When Friday morning broke, many longtime fans stills seemed amazed at what the Capitals had accomplished. Not everyone was surprised, though. “I told everyone: this team has it,” said Alan May, a former Capitals player who is now a broadcaster covering the team. He was speaking Friday morning from Las Vegas as he made an appearance on 106.7 The Fan. May felt this spring the Capitals had what it took to win the title. “Everything about it has been so special. They all went next level,” he said. “It was so special to be part of this and watch this. It kept getting better and better and better.” Not bad for a “minor league” sports town, as ESPN pundit Michael Wilbon said a few weeks ago about the nation’s capital.

The Federal Statistical Office figures alarmed economists, who hoped for a 0.8 per cent rise. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics said: ‘This makes for a horrible start to the second quarter.’ OIL SLOWDOWN Oil production in Venezuela is 25m barrels behind schedule as the country teeters on the edge of collapse. State firm PDVSA said it may be forced to declare it cannot meet obligations, as 80 tankers float unfilled in ports. PENSION WORRY Half of workers due to retire this year are expected to carry on working past state pension age instead, according to research by Prudential. More than a quarter of those planning to stay on hope to go part-time. Around 8 per cent cannot afford to quit. PAYMENT DEAL Payments firm Paysafe has struck a deal for its cards to be used in Google’s online shop. The Isle of Man business’s prepaid cards, designed for people who do not want to use online banking or buy with credit, can be used at the Google Play store. AFRICA PROFIT An investment firm founded by disgraced ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond has seen profit rise. Atlas Mara, which takes stakes in African banks, made £19.4million profit in the first three months of 2018, which is up from £7million a year earlier. SAVINGS SURGE Savers pumped £931million into the stock market in April as the Isa deadline loomed. The total cash pile looked after rose 3 per cent to £1.2trillion, according to The Investment Association. There is typically a stampede to shelter cash from the taxman in Isa accounts in early April, before the new tax year.

Michael,Gordon,1047,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/article212756729.html,"By Michael Gordon And Joe Marusak mgordon@charlotteobserver.com jmarusak@charlotteobserver.com June 07, 2018 05:43 PM A prominent leader of a controversial Western North Carolina church is accused of devising a scheme that cheated taxpayers out of tens of thousands of dollars in unemployment benefits. Kent Covington of Rutherfordton, a top minister in the Word of Faith Fellowship church, was indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Over five years, according to the indictment, Covington and ""co-conspirators"" filed more than $250,000 in phony unemployment claims for employees who kept working for companies owned by Word of Faith members. Starting in 2008, the indictment said, Covington masterminded a scheme to help his plastics manufacturing company survive the recession by laying off his work force, applying for unemployment benefits for his employees, then forcing them to keep working. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. For the next five years, taxpayers and not Covington paid the employees' salaries, according top the indictment. The indictment also accuses Covington of using his influence as a Word of Faith leader to force the other church members who worked for his Diverse Corporate Technologies Inc., to participate in the conspiracy. Diane McKinny, a Covington employee and fellow Word of Faith member, also was named in the indictment and accused of filing fraudulent paperwork to support the unemployment claims. According to the indictment, Covington and McKinny obtained more than six months of free labor for Covington's company, paid for by the government instead of the business. The 63-year-old Covington also is accused of passing on the blueprint of his scheme to other church members who owned companies struggling through the recession. Two church members who implemented the scheme were the father-and-son podiatry team of Jason and Jerry Gross, who began laying off employees at Foot & Ankle Center of the Carolinas in 2009, prosecutors said. Both pleaded guilty to wire fraud charges in Asheville federal court last month, the Associated Press reported. According to Thursday's indictment, between 2009 and 2011, versions of the unemployment benefits scheme were used at a church member-owned contracting business and two more of Covington's companies. The legal problems of the Covington family continue to mount. Brooke Covington, another top Word of Faith leader, and four other church members are scheduled to stand trial on accusations that they repeatedly beat a former congregant to drive the ""gay demon"" out of him., the (Asheville) Citizen Times reported. Word of Faith also is at the center of investigations here and in Brazil on whether the church set up a human pipeline with its Brazilian missions to come up with cheap or free employees for the businesses of church members. In the Kent Covington case, prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office said they are seeking almost $310,000 in forfeitures from the defendants, according to Thursday's indictment. Kent Covington and the 65-year-old McKinny are scheduled to appear in court on June 18. ""We take these accusations very seriously and are conducting our own investigation,"" Stephen Cash, an Asheville lawyer for the church, said in a statement to the Observer on Thursday night. ""We intend to respond to the indictment in the near future."" . View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

It was the highest fundraising total ever for the event. The Breakfast, held at the iconic Cipriani 42nd Street in New York, honored Leon G. Cooperman, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, Inc., and Damon Runyon Board of Directors member, for his longstanding commitment to investing in new generations of researchers. ""Our Annual Breakfast is always a special time for us at Damon Runyon, as we honor and recognize those who continue to fuel the success of our organization from both a research and business advisory standpoint,"" said Lorraine Egan, President and CEO of Damon Runyon. ""Not only was this year's event record-breaking in terms of fundraising, it also gave us an opportunity to recognize an individual who is integral to supporting our mission of finding and funding exceptional scientists who will be the driving force to end all suffering from cancer."" Since joining the Damon Runyon board in 1996, Cooperman – known as Lee – has managed the Foundation's Investments Committee, helping to grow its endowment by 500 percent, to over $100 million. In 2014, he and fellow board member Michael Gordon pledged to jointly fund Damon Runyon's Physician-Scientist Training Award program for its first three years. The program supports and encourages outstanding recent medical school graduates to pursue cancer research careers by providing them with the opportunity for a protected research-training experience under the mentorship of a qualified and gifted mentor. In addition, the Foundation will retire up to $100,000 in medical school debt still owed by an award recipient. Cooperman spoke with great fondness about his 26-year relationship with the organization, noting how the Foundation continues to evolve year-over-year in providing grants to the most brilliant, early career scientists. ""Winston Churchill said it best, 'We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.' My goal has always been to improve the world and leave it a better place than when I came into it, which is why I initially got involved with Damon Runyon over 20 years ago. They fuel the vision of researchers across the country, by providing the funding and support they urgently need to discover radical ways to prevent, diagnose and cure all forms of cancer,"" said Cooperman. Kenneth G. Langone, Founder and CEO of Invemed Associates LLC, introduced Cooperman, his longtime friend. Also attending the event were Nobel laureate Harold Varmus, MD, Shelly Lazarus, former CEO of Ogilvy, and Mario Gabelli, Founder of GAMCO. At this year's event, guests heard research updates from Melody Smith, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who is focused on improving outcomes for bone marrow transplants, and Kristopher R. Bosse, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who is pursuing a new targeted therapy for pediatric neuroblastoma. ""As a physician-scientist myself, I can truly appreciate everything this foundation does for these scientists, especially physician-scientists, who are a dying breed,"" said William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD, Professor of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Damon Runyon Board Member and Vice Chair of the Foundation's Scientific Programs, and keynote speaker. Egan also announced that the Foundation has named John Ferrarone, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine, the ""Lee Cooperman Physician-Scientist of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"" in Cooperman's honor. Dr. Ferrarone works under the mentorship of Dr. Varmus. His research focuses on developing new, more effective targeted therapies for lung cancers.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian. Thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our first-quarter results. MongoDB began fiscal 2019 with strong financial and operational performance, which reflects our market momentum and all the drivers behind our growth. To quickly summarize the first-quarter results, we generate revenue $48.2 million, a 49% year-over-year increase, which is above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 53% year over year. We ended the quarter with over 6,600 customers, up 83% compared to a year ago. We saw strong growth across all major regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia. And Atlas is now 14% of revenue. Our position as the leading modern general-purpose data platform get stronger each quarter with customers, partners, and the larger ecosystem, putting us in great position to continue generating strong top-line growth. Digital transformation has become one of the most important IT initiatives for all companies in all industries. While these digital initiatives hold the promise of a more nimble enterprise that can respond quickly to changing market conditions and provide a better experience for its customers, executing on these initiatives is far easier said than done. In my meetings with senior executives around the world, it's clear that companies are highly motivated to use modern technologies to transform their businesses to create a competitive advantage. In the first quarter alone, I had more than 20 meetings with the C-level executives at large global organizations across many industries to discuss how MongoDB can be a partner in their transformation process. The scope and frequency of these senior-level conversations are far different than the types of conversations we had even 18 months ago. Previously, there were typically exploratory conversations to learn more about the company and the technology and what projects they could start with MongoDB. Now these conversations are focused on how to use MongoDB for some of the most important digital initiatives that their businesses are undertaking. Moreover, many of these executives rarely meet with any vendors at all, reflecting one, the importance of what we do and the impact we can have on their business; and two, our credibility as a strategic partner. Turning to our first-quarter results in more detail. We saw a healthy mix of new logo wins and strong upsell activity, both of which include the customers' migrating workloads from legacy databases to MongoDB. Our performance in the first quarter exemplified the power of our land, expand and expand model and our multiple vectors of growth. During the first quarter, we grew our six-figure customer count by 47% compared to the same period a year ago and added a number of new enterprise customers, including Anadarko Petroleum, AppDirect, Extraordinary Systems, Hawaiian Airlines, and New Balance Athletics. We also expanded our relationship with customers such as Guidewire Software, Highspot, Mediaocean, NeoReach, PEMCO, state of New York, and Urban Outfitters. These customers are just the tip of the iceberg for us. Our opportunity is massive and global. We're closing deals in every corner of the world with highly sophisticated businesses, in some cases, in areas where we have no or only limited sales coverage today. This truly speaks to the size of our market opportunity and the broad appeal of our platform. It also demonstrates the attractive returns we are generating on our investments and underscores the number of additional high ROI opportunities we see ahead of us to invest across product, sales and marketing. Examples of our wins include a large European online electronics retailer, which built a single-view application of MongoDB Atlas to improve its customer experience, quickly identify fraudulent activities and comply with GDPR privacy regulations. Multiple wins in China, including Volkswagen China, which built a new energy vehicle management platform on MongoDB; and a leading airline that's using MongoDB to support a block-chain-based application for its revamped rewards program; one of Italy's largest energy companies, Eni gas e luce, which chose MongoDB to modernize its content management platform; wins with two of the largest financial institutions in Australia building important applications for online payments as Australia pushes aggressively toward a cashless society; a large deal with a Latin American bank that chose MongoDB for over a dozen applications, including a loyalty application, a customer service application, offloading and mission-critical application from the mainframe and other use cases across different business units; and a deal with one of the largest media companies in the Middle East, which is modernizing its legacy infrastructure and building a highly sophisticated platform to share exclusive content with its customers. While we monetize existing demand of our platform with these customers, we also continue to plant seeds around the world to further drive adoption. One way we do this is by hosting a worldwide tour of customer events. For example, we hosted seven of our top local events with thousands of developers in Bangalore, Munich, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney and Tel Aviv. We also hosted joint events with our cloud partners in London, Milan, Mumbai, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney and Tel Aviv. At all these events, we were able to get in front of tens of thousands of developers, database administrators and executives to increase awareness of MongoDB and showcase the power of our platform. In addition to seeing strong global demand for our platform, we're also seeing customers adopt MongoDB for a wide variety of cutting-edge use cases. A great example is Koinex, a cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform based in India. Koinex provides real-time trading of a rapidly growing number of cryptocurrencies. They're using MongoDB Atlas to focus on scaling the trading capacity by 50 times while minimizing the use of DevOps ops personnel. Another important win was with a large automotive manufacturing company that is working on object detection for autonomous cars. The company created a machine learning application to ingest and process large amounts of unstructured data. They chose MongoDB because of our abilities to easily support a large variety of data from cameras and sensors and to scale out the dataset as it rapidly grows. Third, we expanded our relationship with U.K.'s biggest public service department, the Department for Works and Pensions or DWP, which is similar to the Social Security Administration in the United States. A number of new services are being built on MongoDB from benefit delivery platforms to a service that helps people obtain the status of their pension payments. DWP is essentially using MongoDB to better serve the citizens of the United Kingdom. We also had an exciting win with New Balance, who's using MongoDB for real-time analytics related to managing their raw materials, specifically around costing, planning and procurement decisions. We also see -- we also continue to see tremendous customer interest in Atlas. In the first quarter, Atlas represented 14% of revenue, versus 4% a year ago and 11% last quarter. A fast-growing percentage of this business is coming through our direct-sales efforts, though self-serve is still the majority of Atlas sales. Atlas is a key part of our run anywhere strategy, and its success among enterprise customers makes it clear that Atlas is not only great for small- and medium-sized businesses but is also compelling solution for the largest organizations in the world. We anticipate field sales of Atlas will continue to increase as we introduce Enterprise Advanced features and more into Atlas starting later this year. We also continue to see growth of our Atlas business with partners. Two of our largest Atlas deals in Q1 closed through the AWS Marketplace. The ability for customers to buy Atlas through their preferred cloud partner makes it easy to do business with us, reduces sales cycle times and accelerates the growth of our business. Speaking of partners, our strong momentum is driving partners to further incorporate our platform into their technologies and go-to-market initiatives. In fact, our new business sourced from partners has more than doubled over the past year. Furthermore, we signed an exciting new ISV relationship with IBM as part of its private cloud initiative. With this deal, IBM will activate thousands of global sales reps who will be incentivized to resell MongoDB as part of IBM's ICP or IBM Cloud Private and Analytics Platform for enterprises. This deepens our partnership with IBM and will greatly expand our reach into new markets and opportunities where IBM has an influential presence. Innovation is the core to our DNA and to our success. We're continuing to invest in our platform and have a robust product road map that will make it even easier for customers to work with their data. In three weeks, we'll be hosting our annual user conference, MongoDB World, in New York City. The highlight of MongoDB World will be the formal introduction of MongoDB 4.0, including multi-document ACID transactions. While ACID is not required for many applications, its announcement has already led many companies to evaluate MongoDB, including those organizations who haven't looked at MongoDB recently and those who have never used MongoDB before. Initial customer reaction to MongoDB 4.0 has been very positive. The features in this new release are helping our sales team land meetings with customers and playing an important part in elevating our strategic importance among prospects. We plan to make a number of other exciting product announcements in MongoDB World that we believe will energize the customers and further expand the adoption of MongoDB in the developer community. We welcome all of you listening to the call to attend MongoDB World right here in New York City on June 27. So in summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We're executing across the business and believe our strengthened product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities position us well to continue driving best-in-class revenue growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review the financials Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our first-quarter performance. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Total revenue in the quarter was $48.2 million, up 49% year over year. The strong performance of the business was broad-based during the quarter with healthy new logo and upsell activity among enterprise customers as well as continued rapid adoption of Atlas. Atlas represented 14% of revenue during the quarter, up 4% in the first year -- first quarter last year. We continue to see strong global demand for our offerings. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 900 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 6,600, which is up from over 3,600 in the year-ago period and over 5,700 at the end of last quarter. Of our total customer count, over 1,550 are direct customers, which compares to over 1,450 at the end of the prior quarter and over 1,300 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven, in large part, by Atlas, which had over 4,400 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 3,400 at the end of the fourth quarter. The growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects both new customers to MongoDB as well as existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers. Our net AR expansion rate in the first quarter again remained above 120%. We ended the quarter with 394 customers with at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue and annualized MRR, which is up from 354 in the fourth quarter and 268 in the year-ago period. Driving expanded adoption and spend among existing customers is a key component of our growth strategy and has been a consistent area of success. Even among our largest customers today, we believe MongoDB represents a small fraction of their total database spend, which represents a large and attractive growth opportunity for us over time. Moving down the P&L. I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $35.0 million, representing a gross margin of 72.6% and consistent with the year-ago period. We are pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter, particularly in light of Atlas' growth. Atlas includes the underlying infrastructure, and our success in reducing the infrastructure costs related to Atlas has resulted in improved Atlas gross margins. We still anticipate Atlas will be a modest headwind to gross margin overall, but we are tracking well relative to our original expectations. Our operating loss was $21.7 million, or a negative 45% operating margin for the first quarter, comparing to a negative 47% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the first quarter was $21.6 million, or $0.43 per share based on 50.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $271.5 million in cash, cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $8 million. After taking into consideration approximately $400,000 in capital expenditures, free cash flow was negative $8.4 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the low point in the year for cash flow due to seasonally lower collections, and the second quarter is usually our heaviest investment in marketing investments like MongoDB World. In addition, we expect to see increased capital expenditures starting this quarter related to our New York City office move. Short-term deferred revenue was $119.9 million, up 45% year over year, while total deferred revenue of $141.8 million was up 47% year over year. We believe longer-term trends in deferred revenue are directionally correlated to the underlying momentum of our business. That said, as Atlas continues to become a larger portion of our business, it is important to appreciate that it is a usage-based model and does not generate meaningfully deferred revenue. Also, as a reminder, Atlas is often billed monthly in arrears versus the annual and advanced billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. Lastly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to the timing of events that may occur. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Beginning with the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51 million to $52 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $23.5 million to $23 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.45 per share based on 51.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2019, we are raising our revenue outlook to $217 million to $220 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $84 million to $82 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.62 per share based on 51.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our increased revenue guidance reflects strong underlying trends in the business and given the high ROI investment landscape we see, we have maintained our full-year outlook for non-GAAP loss from operations. In closing, we got off to a strong start in fiscal 2019, and we're excited for what's to come in the rest of the year. We're executing well on our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to drive strong growth and improving profitability over the long term. With that, we'd like to open up to your questions. Operator? Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Dev, congrats on a great start to the year. And, Dev, first question on the IBM deal. Can you give us a little bit more insight here? Like, historically, we have seen smaller software companies do deals with these large vendors. And on the one hand, on paper, they look good. Often, there is not that in reality coming through. Can you talk what's the incentive structure? How does it work for you guys? Why is it exciting for the two of you? Thank you. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes.Thanks, Raimo. What I think IBM have seen, and they're the ones who actually first approached us, was that they're seeing, frankly, MongoDB being adopted everywhere in their customer base, and they're seeing specific demand from their customers to -- for MongoDB. And they wanted to use MongoDB for their private cloud initiative and use some of the proprietary features. What's interesting about this transaction is that their salespeople actually are incentivized through quota relief to sell MongoDB. So this is not just one of those Barney announcements. There's real motivation by IBM to activate the 7,000-plus salespeople around the world to resell MongoDB, and they see a big opportunity in front of them. Why it's attractive to us is that even though we're a fast-growing company, we only have a certain amount of reach, and we're very attracted by the opportunity to expand our reach through their presence in these markets and accounts and where they have a lot of influence, where they can embed MongoDB more quickly than, say, we would try to do ourselves. So we're very excited about this relationship, and we think it will pay dividends in the future. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. And then another follow-up. On Atlas, obviously the growth, in our calculations, I think is like 400%, so that's really, really healthy. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving in terms of direct [Audio skip] commented on some direct [Inaudible] deals [Inaudible]? How do you see that evolving over time, and then once the enterprise features you kind of talked about, how will that change, then, the dynamic in the second half of the year? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Right. So if you remember, we launched Atlas a little less than two years ago, and it's only about this time last year that we really started getting our sales teams really focused on selling Atlas directly. And I think we're seeing the returns in that investment starting to pay off. Obviously, as part of our run anywhere strategy, we're giving customers choice about not only where they want to run MongoDB but how they want to consume MongoDB. And we're starting to see a lot of large customers want and like the optionality of basically procuring MongoDB as a service through Atlas. And that's definitely driving a big part of the growth. We're really excited about the traction we're seeing not just here in North America but frankly, all around the world and not just with small customers, with some of the largest companies and frankly, some very arguably industries that are probably more -- have reputation to be more slow moving who are aggressively moving to the cloud and see Atlas as a very attractive alternative. It also speaks to the fact that when people use MongoDB, in some ways, they future-proof their applications because they can start on-premise, go to the cloud, manage it themselves or consume it as a service and have it delivered on AWS, on Azure or on GCP. So it gives them real optionality. I would tell you that Atlas is the only Database-as-a-Service offering that's available in 54 regions around the world by virtue of us being able to run Atlas across the three largest cloud providers in the world. No other provider can say that. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, perfect. And maybe if I can squeeze in one more question for Michael. Like, if I look -- like, at the moment, your revenue is kind of running faster than we had modeled, but you kind of also keep investing. Like, how flexible -- like, as you said, on the call, you kind of are kind of playing -- being very dynamic with the investments given the high ROI. But like, how does it work for you? Like how does the planning work for you, whether cost allocation or the investment decisions? How does it work for you that you can kind of react so quickly? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So in general, given the market opportunity that we're going after, there are shorter lead time investments and longer lead time investments that we can make. And so obviously, in the planning process, it's a mix of doing both of those. We obviously saw very first -- very strong first-quarter performance, and we've been able to invest. Well, the two main areas that we will invest as we see incremental opportunities will be on the sales and marketing side and the R&D side. Both of those obviously have somewhat ramp times but the engineering ramp time for return to value is longer given product cycles. But those are really the two main areas that we look to and we look to reinvest in with continued strength of the business. And as long as we see high rates of return for both of those, we will continue to do that within the context of showing the continuing operating leverage that we're showing overall as a company. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We'll move next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent, guys. Very nice quarter and thank you for taking the question. I think after Raimo asked seven questions, we should all get at least three. I think that's only fair. Furthering on sort of the Atlas conversation. Could you talk to us a little bit on how you're seeing kind of those use cases develop? What kind of use cases are you seeing going toward Atlas versus what traditionally would be on the EA -- like an EA customer would be doing? And in the cases where you have sort of an existing EA customer expand to Atlas, maybe talk to us a little about sort of the use case that drives that as well because it seems like there's been a significant overlap, at least 100 customers, that went from EA to Atlas as well. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So great question, Keith. I mean, I would say you should think about -- again, we launched Atlas less than two years ago, so you can see -- as you can imagine, a lot of the early customers were doing a lot of dev test workloads, doing a lot of early prototyping work on Atlas. It's easy to get started with. They didn't have to procure any hardware. They didn't have to worry about getting their internal teams to support the infrastructure. As the comfort with Atlas has grown, you're starting to see people move to -- move more production and mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And we've seen that -- we saw that in our inside sales channel earlier, but now we're even seeing that in our direct sales force. And we're seeing a number of large deals move to Atlas. And so it speaks to, one, their comfort and familiarity with Atlas. Two, we've continued to expand the envelope of Atlas coverage. As I mentioned, we're now in 54 regions around the world. Three, we've added more and more features. We've made it easier. We built tools and content to make it easy for people to quickly migrate their on-prem installation to Atlas with minimal kind of effort. And so all those things are really helping customers to move workloads to Atlas. We've also introduced or plan to introduce a bunch of, what I call, enterprise features, things around LDAP, security, auditing and so forth, that will continue to encourage customers to be more comfortable in moving mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And to your point, about EA customers moving to Atlas, you should think about the fact that they might be different workloads. It might be that there -- have certain set of workloads on-premise but other workloads, they think, are a better fit or they're more -- they want to move more quickly to Atlas. In fact, you've seen many situations where sometimes a large enterprise may see some unexpected demand in a particular product or service offering and the internal teams can't keep up with that demand, and then they'll quickly choose to move to Atlas because of the elastic nature of that service. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. And perhaps just my one follow-up for Michael. With sort of the increase in Atlas and sort of the conversation you're talking about, how a lot of that is billed in arrears or sort of billed on a consumption basis. The rebound that we saw in current subscription billings from last quarter and into this quarter, they're probably more predicated on sort of EA strength versus Atlas. The Atlas strength that we saw in the quarter was sort of just more so just at the income statement. Is that the correct way to view it? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think, in general, I mean, we saw strength across the board. There are different cash flow and deferred revenue aspects to each of them, which is correct. And just for everyone -- so everyone's on the same page, the self-serve Atlas is the majority of Atlas today as opposed to Atlas sold through the sales force. Self-serve Atlas bills monthly in arrears, and so it is a very different dynamic. But we benefit, obviously, from the incremental cash flow of that as well, so that's sort of additive to the story. But we've got multiple engines of growth both on the Enterprise Advanced side as well as on the Atlas side. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent. Great quarter. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Keith. Operator We'll move next to Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev, Atlas revenue per customer has continued to expand at a really healthy clip here sequentially over the last few quarters. And given your commentary just before to Keith around the enterprise features for being additive going forward, should we assume that most of that growth thus far has been existing customers expanding implementations, and then, over time, there's opportunity for even more lift as they add these enterprise features? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. Actually, Brad, I would say it's actually both. We're seeing, obviously, strong expansion of existing customers, but we're also seeing newer customers start bigger on Atlas. And so I think that's again a function of the fact that those tend to be more mission-critical workloads versus dev test or early prototypes. And people now are starting to view Atlas as a very, very viable platform to run mission-critical applications. And the one thing I should also point out is that one of MongoDB's strength is the distributed nature of our database platform. And a lot of those features and those distributed capabilities are actually even better exposed in Atlas in terms of placing workloads closer to users, working around GDPR or other privacy regulations in particular countries. That really shows the power of MongoDB. And so we're actually seeing customers realize that with Atlas, they actually do more things on MongoDB than they could in their own data centers. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Brad, maybe just from like a math or sort of breaking down like the piece parts, the simplest way, I think, to think about it is the self-serve customers are exhibiting very strong underlying cohort behavior, so there's very good expansion in the self-serve customer base. But also, we're seeing an increasing percentage of the Atlas customers are sales sold, and those customers have a higher price point or a higher ASP. So the combination of those two things lead to generally increasing average revenue per Atlas customer if that helps. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Sure, sure. And then one real quick follow-up on that last point. The two big deals you talked about being sold on the AWS Marketplace, were those sold by the AWS sales force or by you guys or by self-service, we'll say? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer It was definitely sold by us, Brad, but I would tell you that the AWS sales team really worked with us to make sure those transactions happened. Obviously, it's early days, but it was a really great sign of partnering in the field. And we're really excited about what the future may hold there. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Operator Next, we'll move to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions. I wanted to start out first with just the kind of comments from you, Dev, on kind of about the competitive environment. In particular, Satya Nadella on their conference call commented about Cosmos and how quickly that's gone from zero to $100 million in annualized revenue. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see them in the market, where there might be overlap. Or are you complementary? And then I had two quick follow-ups. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So we basically -- one, I would say that we feel very comfortable about our competitive positioning. We have talked to customers who tried Cosmos, and frankly, the feedback we've heard has not been that positive. They're trying to do some sophisticated things, and many customers have said that -- they have said like they tried to make Cosmos work because they were already on Azure and have realized that just couldn't meet their needs, so they came to MongoDB. We've had some large ISV relationships who have strategic partnerships with Microsoft, who had every incentive to try to make Cosmos work, and it didn't work for them. Now there's no question being a cloud provider and just being in the flip screen of all the deals going -- or all the workloads moving to the cloud that they are definitely getting business, but when it comes to head to head, we're feeling very comfortable about our positioning. And we feel very excited about the future. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK, great. And are there any areas where you could be complementary to what they're doing or not really? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think, no. With a database -- I mean, typically, a database is pretty much an architectural decision, so I think where we see the complementary nature is less about the database and more around the ancillary infrastructure, where we can help customers consume more kind of compute and storage services and other services that the cloud prior may offer. And so we're seeing that not only with Microsoft, but we're seeing that with the other partners as well, which is why they're very motivated to work with us. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. And then just two quick follow-ups. You had really strong international results this quarter. I was wondering if you could share what drove the strength there. And then just a follow-up. I think Raimo might have asked earlier a little bit about the -- if you could give us an idea of the EA features in Atlas in better driving adoption and what customers are asking for in particular for EA in Atlas, that would be great. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, sure. So the international growth is really driven by the fact that we've been investing with teams in EMEA and Asia for the last couple of years, and we're really starting to see the results of that -- those investments, both in terms of just the size of deals we're doing, the strategic nature of those deals and the relationship that we're building. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. And I would tell you that we're still -- we still have wide swaths of EMEA and Asia that we don't have a lot of people in. So there's lots of opportunity to continue to expand our reach. But it's really a function of putting people in market, having good leaders in place who can directly manage them and bring a real focus to that market, and we see good things happening. Candidly, one of the -- the question that was asked earlier with Michael -- for Michael about investments, we constantly get asked, hey, should we put people in the Middle East, should we expand more quickly into Latin Americas. And so it's just a function of how large this market is. And obviously, we want to be disciplined about how we run the business, but there's -- we are not market constrained. There's a massive market out there. And then in terms of EA features, we've introduced and we'll continue to introduce a bunch of commercial features in Atlas around security, auditing, the ability to use our BI connector, which allows people to run reports right off of Atlas. Those are all proprietary features that are now available on Atlas, and you'll see that the number of those kind of features grow over time. So that's just, again, expanding and offering more capabilities on Atlas that gets people comfortable at putting mission-critical workloads on that platform. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you so much. Operator We'll move next to Richard Davis with Canaccord. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thanks. So maybe we'll do some product questions. So you guys have -- my understanding is you have a really good kind of aggregation framework, which is, as we all know, kind of the dirty little secret in data. What's -- the hard part is kind of getting everything lined up, so you can actually query it, stuff like that. Can you kind of talk about how this differentiates Mongo from other firms? And then the ancillary question is -- and I think, the answer is 99% chance is no. But is there any overlap with you kind of aggregation framework and things that are offered by companies like Alteryx and Talend? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So just for everyone else's benefit, what an aggregation framework is, is in layman terms, is just the ability to process and analyze data inside the database. And most NoSQL databases do not have this capability. It's one of the things that really distinguishes MongoDB from other more modern databases. Relational databases have this capability, but relational databases suffer from the problem of being an architecture that was built 40 years ago. And so they have trouble scaling and having resiliency in their platform. So what MongoDB does is gives you all the benefits of relational database with the power to scale, the performance and the flexibility of a modern database, which is why it makes such an attractive platform for developers. And so that's essentially what the aggregation framework does, and it's a very attractive part of our value proposition to our -- to those developers and customers who are using MongoDB. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. And then you already got 85 questions on Atlas, but I'll ask one anyway. So I think I saw that you lowered the price, is that MongoDB Atlas cost center is I think deployed on AWS Mumbai. Is that right by like 10% to 15%? Is that right? And so can you maybe talk about the logic and expected payoff from that decision? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And so what we've seen is actually a little bit of a price war going on between AWS and Google in that marketplace. And so as a beneficiary of being a basically a customer of AWS and as they started reducing prices in that market, we were able to pass on those savings to those customers. We think, obviously, that market is also more price sensitive than, say, other markets just because of the cost of labor is it that much cheaper. And we feel like India is a massive market for us. It's one of the highest download sites of any region in the world. And we're very excited about the opportunity there, and we believe that those price decreases will pay off in a big way. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thank you very much. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator And next, we have Jack Andrews with Needham. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the catalyst that enabled you to have the 20-plus conversations with C-level executives. I mean, is that related to the fact that we keep hearing some of these digital transformations are not going so well? Or just how did you really get an opportunity to have those types of conversations? Was it through direct sales? Partners? If you could shed some light on that, would be helpful. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, absolutely. So I would say a couple things. I would say that with regards to a lot of these digital transformation efforts, obviously, everyone has been talking about digital transformation for a while, but what people find is that it's far easier said than done. In fact, one of the blockers to basically getting to where people want to go is the fact that they have trouble using their data. The data is either trapped in silos. It's hard to use. There's a lot of duplicative data and so forth. And so people are realizing that they don't have a way to really manage their data. Their ability to be successful is going to be limited. Second, I would say is that we, as a company, have fundamentally changed a lot over the last few years. Obviously, we went public last October. That was a real signal to customers that we are now a really viable and strategic partner to companies. The maturity of the product has increased dramatically, especially now with the announcement of ACID transaction support. That perked up a lot of people's ears about the fact that, wow, they could use MongoDB for virtually any use case. And I would also say the maturity and the efficacy of our go-to-market efforts, these meetings didn't just happen by themselves because our sales teams are now being much more strategic on how they engage with customers. We're trying to go higher earlier in the sales cycle, and that's yielding these kinds of meetings. And so I would tell you that these -- the quality of these meetings have been outstanding, and it's really a sign of, one, how important this is to all these customers; and two, our credibility as a potential partner to them in their efforts. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst And then just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that people are in the evaluation process of MongoDB 4.0 right now. Could you just talk about maybe just qualitatively the level of interest you're seeing for this particular release of your product versus maybe some other releases? And how optimistic are you of a potential uplift, if you will, from this product? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say the interest has been extremely high. It's probably been the most requested feature for a number of years. So when we announced it in February, there was a huge amount of receptivity, positive receptivity to that announcement. That also generated a bunch of new engagements with the customers and prospects, and frankly, it's allowing us to be more strategic. The beta version of the software is available for people to use and test. The feedback has been very positive, and we expect to GA it in the near future. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We move next to Brian White with Monness, Crespi. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Yes. On the IBM relationship, how should we think about that ramping in fiscal '19? And IBM has their own cloud, so I'm wondering if you're going to have a partnership with their cloud as well. And will they be selling Atlas? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say that we are quite optimistic about the IBM relationship. We feel like it's a real relationship. It's not, again, one of these Barney announcements. And as I said -- and the way it's real is that their salespeople are now incentivized to sell Atlas to their customers. We're already seeing interest in -- I'm sorry, MongoDB -- we're already seeing interest in the field, and there's already a bunch of engagements happening in a bunch of different regions. And so I'll defer to Michael in terms of how we think we want to -- how we think it will show up in -- Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Look, I think it'll take time. The agreement has some time horizon for them to work through the commitment, so it won't be an immediate impact and will take time for them to ramp the global sales force. But we should see the benefit of it over time. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst And just as a follow-up, 5G commercial network starting to come online this year. And so I'm wondering, what does 5G mean to MongoDB? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think one of the things about -- one of the trends that we see very clearly is the rise of mobile applications. And MongoDB has been well suited for a long time for people to build mobile apps. One, it's a very -- mobile apps tend to have a very high rate of change because people are constantly adding new features, fixing bugs, and so they need a platform that can enable them to have high developer productivity. Obviously, with certain apps, you can have thousands, if not, millions of users, and so you want a platform that could scale. And with the distributed capabilities, you also want to have fast or low latency as we provide access. And so MongoDB is well designed for those kind of use cases. And as the pipes get bigger, it's 5G today, it could be something else in the future, that only plays to our strength because it will encourage people to build higher performance, more content rich, more streaming content, video and so forth that has more -- requires more bandwidth, and that plays well to MongoDB as people think about building those kinds of applications. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator And everyone, that concludes our question-and-answer session at this time. For closing remarks, I'd like to turn it back over to Dev Ittycharia. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, we're really pleased about the quarter. I think we're thrilled about the fact that MongoDB is increasingly being viewed as a strategic vendor by customers everywhere. There's clearly strong demand for MongoDB all around the world, and the breadth of use case continues to grow. We're really excited about the partner ecosystem growing as evidenced by the IBM relationship and the fact that our partner business is really healthy. And obviously, Atlas continues to grow very, very quickly. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our MongoDB World Conference on June 27, and so we encourage all of you to visit us here in New York City. Thank you.

John,O'Neil,1044,https://whdh.com/news/widow-sues-university-over-husbands-beating-death/,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — The widow of a Rhode Island man beaten to death by a University of Rhode Island employee says in a lawsuit the school and other parties were negligent for failing to alert police to the man’s erratic behavior. Alyson McCann’s husband, John O’Neil, was killed in May 2016 by Christian Lepore, who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity. The Providence Journal reports that the lawsuit says Lepore, a cook at URI, had been acting strangely before the killing, including babbling about extraterrestrials and a government cover-up. The 6-foot tall, 325-pound Lepore left campus, stripped naked, went onto the 62-year-old O’Neil’s West Greenwich property, and killed him. The defendants deny negligence in court documents. A URI spokesman did not return a call for a comment. McCann seeks unspecified damages. (Copyright (c) 2018 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

John,O'Neil,1044,http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-nws-forks-township-renters-register-20180607-story.html,"With several apartment units in development, Forks Township will consider establishing a registration for renters as a means of collecting tax revenue. Township Manager John Cornell told supervisors during a workshop session Thursday that requiring tenants to register with the township would allow Forks to collect earned income tax from those who slip through the cracks. “The benefit from our end would be the EIT,” he said. Cornell said the proposal does not go as far as requiring inspections as a means of cracking down on blighted properties and ensuring the safety of emergency responders who might respond to problems in those units. “At this point we wouldn’t advocate inspections; we’re not geared up to do that,” he said. Requiring renters to register with the township could also serve as a vehicle to eventually identify units with multiple tenants which could present safety concerns, Supervisor Erik Chuss said. The township has roughly 300 potential rental units in the pipeline, Zoning Officer Tim Weis said. They include Sullivan Park Apartments on Sullivan Trail and Meco Road, and Forks Village, located west of Richmond Road. Chairman John O’Neil said the idea would likely only work with apartment units and would not serve to identify individuals renting single-family homes, or rooms within homes. “With apartment buildings you’ll get them,” he said.

Anne,Wolff,1041,http://www.keyc.com/story/38375311/manic-monday-beginning-of-highway-14-construction,"If your commute takes you through Mankato, you better be prepared.Construction on U.S. Highway 14 will begin on Monday morning. Drivers can expect heavy delays, lane closures, and ramp closures. The project is slated to last a month, if the weather cooperates. Anne Wolff, public affairs coordinator for MNDOT, said: ""We're really advising motorists to find alternative routes especially during those peak travel times. Or travel during a non-peak time. Or just plan ahead for extra time."" The $5.3 million project will involve resurfacing the highway, repairing culverts and ditches, as well as fixing guard rails. MNDOT is also deploying a unique system to warn drivers of congestion ahead. ""There will be a message board on both ends of the project and its got radar traffic detection in it that will signal to motorists when traffic ahead is stopped or significantly delayed. That way they can plan ahead or stop, or choose to get off at one of those earlier ramps and avoid the area altogether."", Wolff said. Most of all, MNDOT wants to remind drivers to drive safely in work zones. ""With the single lane closures on this project, motorists will be driving alongside crews that are working so we really want people to slow down in the work zone. We'll have extra State Patrol enforcement on this project."", she said. So, for the next month, avoid Highway 14, if you can help it.

Michael,Gordon,1040,https://www.popmatters.com/gordon-kronos-quartet-clouded-yellow-2575695012.html,"On-and-off collaborators since 2001, the Kronos Quartet and Bang on a Can co-founder Michael Gordon present an arresting collection of their shared works. Cantaloupe Music 4 May 2018 Michael Gordon and the members of Kronos Quartet are kindred spirits. While Gordon, a co-founder of the composers' collective Bang on a Can, is known for his groundbreaking works that defy categorization, the similarly revolutionary Kronos Quartet have been essentially upending the role and identity of the classical string quartet for decades. While it's no secret that Gordon and Kronos have collaborated on and off for the past 17 years (beginning with the quartet performing one of Gordon's pieces in their hometown of San Francisco in 2001), an assembly of their collaboration has never been available until now. Clouded Yellow is a collection of Kronos Quartet recordings of Michael Gordon compositions – including ""Potassium"", the aforementioned piece that premiered in 2001 – released through Bang on a Can's label, Cantaloupe. As one might expect, the music is visceral, abrasive, and oddly moving. The hour-long album contains only a handful of pieces, but they're all powerful in their own way. It opens with the title track, whose title refers to a specific species of butterfly known for its fluttering migrations in England, and is held together by the low-register droning of Jeffrey Zeigler's cello while Hank Dutt (viola), David Harrington and John Sherba (violin) engage in dissonant flights of fancy. The relentless energy of the piece is palpable; the fact that Gordon spent an entire summer working on the piece before throwing the whole thing out and starting from scratch may be evident in the somewhat anxious, unflinching nature of the music. ""Potassium"" is no less powerful and seems almost initially devoid of melody, relying instead on mind-bending string runs that seem to ape the sounds of fast cars passing on a highway. The second half of the piece speeds up with a slightly more traditional - yet still dissonant – melody, resembling hyper-caffeinated Bartok. Gordon suggests in the liner notes that the abrasive sounds in ""Potassium"" represent a scrubbing away of the Kronos history, signaling a new beginning. The centerpiece of Clouded Yellow – not to mention its emotional center – is undoubtedly ""The Sad Park"", a four-part piece prompted by the events of September 11, 2001. Gordon recalls in the liner notes how family played a role in his reaction to 9/11, as he and his wife have children who were attending school nearby when the World Trade Center towers fell. ""We were down at P.S. 234, two blocks north of the World Trade towers,"" he says, ""and the plane literally flew over our heads. It was our daughter's fourth day of Kindergarten."" Using the voices of pre-school children impacted by the day's events – specifically University Plaza Nursery School in Lower Manhattan, where his son was enrolled at the time – Gordon and the Kronos Quartet manipulated the voice recordings as used them as instruments and pulses to accompany the strings on ""The Sad Park"". In a way, the multi-part composition is reminiscent of minimalist composer (and occasional Kronos collaborator) Steve Reich's 1966 piece ""Come Out"", which incorporates interview segments related to the Harlem Six to create a dizzying exercise in phase-shifting. ""The Sad Park"" is more freewheeling in its execution, as the sonic manipulations speed up, slow down, and stretch the samples like taffy, creating something both disturbing and breathtaking. Tributes to 9/11 have appeared in virtually all art forms, and everyone from Don DeLillo to Bruce Springsteen has translated the events into their own vernacular. The key is to move the listener (or reader, or viewer, as the case may be) without coming off as exploitative. Gordon and Kronos – not to mention the children who participated - succeed mightily in this endeavor. Children are also a key focal point in the Clouded Yellow's final piece, ""Exalted"", which pairs Kronos with the Young People's Chorus of New York City. Like the title track, ""Exalted"" was conceived in 2010 and is inspired not only by the events of 9/11 but also Gordon's Jewish faith, as it takes as its text the first line of the Mourner's Kaddish, one of the central prayers in the Jewish liturgy: ""Yisgadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah"" (""May His great name be exalted and sanctified""). More parallels to Reich come into play here, as ""Exalted"" tends to mirror the dark beauty of ""Tehillim"", Reich's 1981 composition that reflects his own Jewish heritage. On ""Exalted"", the chorus weaves in and out of the string arrangement, and the result is an arresting, sometimes intimidating nine minutes of reflection and tribute. Clouded Yellow is not an easy listening experience – it can be emotionally and aurally exhausting. The heaviness of some of the subject matter, in addition to the atonal nature of the music, creates something of a challenging atmosphere. But it's also some of the most fascinating, urgent, brilliant, and important music you're likely to hear so far this year. The Beatles' White Album has been credited with a lot of things over its 50-year history, but how about as the single biggest influence on US alternative rock as it burst into the mainstream in the late '80s and early '90s? Well, it's not as crazy as you might think. Geography, Bonnett claims in Beyond the Map, is becoming harder to read. Lino Brocka's Manila in the Claws of Light seethes with rage against colonial oppression without ever becoming overt agitprop. Glen Campbell was enlisted to record demos for Elvis Presley because Campbell could sing in the same key and replicate Presley's distinctive style. The songs on Sings for the King were intended only for Elvis to hear. Objekt combines the electronic backbone of his project with an experimental approach and an impressive amount of sound design to bring forth Cocoon Crush. Brainfeeder X is an important collection for those who are new to the label's output and for those who want to revel in its glories. A worthy celebration of a genuinely groundbreaking label. Bill Morrison's The Beatles Yellow Submarine mixes its psychedelia to fully represent the strange combinations found in George Dunning's 1968 film. Dead Can Dance's Dionysus is a unique concept album for the celebrated musical duo, putting all of their ideas into two songs that stretch the course of an entire album. The third in this critical environmental series, Anthropocene represents a significant departure from Manufactured Landscapes and Watermark. Replete with energetic hooks and spiky melodies, Delena's ""Animal"" is a modern pop song with a sting in its tale. © 1999-2018 Popmatters.com.

Andrew,Davis,1038,https://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2018/06/06/uchicago-study-earth-might-have-supported-life-earlier-thought,"A new study of rock minerals in Nuvvuagittuq, Canada revealed evidence that the Earth's continental crust might have formed hundreds of millions of years earlier than thought. (Elizabeth Bell / UCLA) Tiny flecks of rock minerals found in northern Canada show that the Earth might have supported life much earlier than thought, according to new research led by scientists from the University of Chicago. Through high-tech analysis of unique rocks from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, the scientists found evidence that the Earth’s continental crust could have formed hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought. Continental crust is a thick part of Earth’s crust, the outermost shell of the planet formed through the solidification of lava. Continental crust consists of rock that forms large landmasses (continents) and is richer in essential minerals compared to younger volcanic rock. “This alters the classic view [of Earth], that the crust was hot, dry and hellish for more than half a billion years after it formed,” said Patrick Boehnke, a postdoctoral fellow in UChicago’s Department of Geophysical Sciences, in a statement. Findings from the study were featured in a recent edition of the National Academy of Science’s official journal. The discovery sheds new light on a persistent question for geologists: How and when was Earth’s volcanic rock transformed into the more life-friendly continental crust that we know today? Answering that question is a difficult task given that evidence has been melting and reforming for millions of years, undergoing consistent change as part of the planet’s evolution. Luckily for geologists, there are zicrons – diamond-hard, weather-resistant minerals that provide clues to the makeup of Earth in its earliest stages. “They’re like labeled time capsules,” said Andrew Davis, a professor and chair of UChicago’s Geophysical Sciences department, in a statement. The CHicago Instrument for Laser Ionization (CHILI) was used to count strontium isotopes in rocks from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada. (Thomas Stephan / University of Chicago) To examine the zicrons – or the miniscule flecks of apatite embedded in the rocks – scientists employed a unique instrument completed last year called the CHicago Instrument for Laser Ionization, or CHILI. The machine uses lasers to count strontium isotopes in rocks, which helps scientists determine their age and chemical composition. The UChicago-led research changes scientists’ understanding of Earth in its earliest stages, Davis said. The makeup of Earth’s crust is important for a number of reasons, including its direct effect on the atmosphere, the composition of seawater and nutrients available to any life forms hoping to survive on the planet, according to the study. In addition to Davis and Boehnke, the study was authored by UChicago professor Thomas Stephan and postdoctoral scholar Reto Trappitsch, along with Mike Pellin from Argonne National Laboratory. A separate study published by UChicago geochemists last year revealed that Earth’s tectonic plates began moving about half a billion years earlier than thought.

Andrew,Davis,1038,http://www.classical-music.com/article/elgars-enigma-variations-what-listen-next,"Classical-Music.com The official website of BBC Music Magazine We suggest what to put on your player next after listening to Elgar's masterpiece... Elgar’s fond descriptions of family and friends – complete with the odd ribbing – in the Enigma Variations has a companion in Strauss’s 1903 affectionate tone poem representing 24 hours in his family life. ‘It will be partly lyrical, partly humorous – a triple fugue will bring together Papa, Mama and Baby,’ he commented. Like Elgar’s work, various characters and their moods are discernible (only the husband has a fiery side – his wife and child are invariably tranquil and easy-going), and the action revolves around scenes of utmost simplicity: the baby resisting bedtime, the husband working at his desk, his wife gently seducing him… It all culminates in that fugue, conjuring up an almighty family hoo-ha. Recommended recording: Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra/Marek Janowski Pentatone PTC5186507 Berlioz’s orchestrations were a huge influence on Elgar, who loved the Frenchman’s music – he was once reported to have been ‘trembling all over’ on hearing the Symphonie fantastique. Harold in Italy, a work for viola and orchestra in which the soloist describes the hero’s moods as he travels from Italian scene to scene, contains Elgarian whisperings, from sighing falls to full orchestra scamperings – even the way Berlioz scores his strings had a deep impact on the English composer. No doubt Elgar called Harold to mind as he sketched the sixth movement of the Enigma Variations, ‘Ysobel’, a witty tribute to an amateur viola-playing friend. Recommended recording: Antoine Tamestit (viola); London Symphony Orchestra/Valery Gergiev LSO Live LSO0760 Edward German was a close friend of Elgar and shared his enthusiasm for walking, cycling and fishing. Into the great outdoors is exactly where we head in the Shropshire-born composer’s orchestral suite The Seasons, written for the Norwich Festival in 1899. All begins with lightness of step and sun in the sky as we welcome ‘Spring’, the most Elgar-like of the four movements. ‘Summer’ has a certain rusticity to it before ‘Autumn’ plunges us into mists and wistfulness. ‘Winter’, meanwhile, reminds that this is also a season of chilly gloom, before eventually lightening its soul as, in a distinctly Slav manner, Christmas hones into view. Recommended recording: RTE Concert Orchestra/Andrew Penny Marco Polo: 8.223695 Comprising four movements with a couple of one-minute ‘melodramas’, Delius’s Norwegian Suite was originally conceived as incidental music for a play, Folkeraadet (People’s Parliament), a satirical comedy on the Norwegian parliamentary system. Written just four years after the Enigma Variations, this is early Delius at his most bucolic and playful, with Elgar’s pastoral language peppering the textures. There are touches of Edvard Grieg, too – Delius had just married the Norwegian painter Jelka Rosen after fleeing the clutches of his Paris mistress, Princesse de Cystria, so was clearly in a contented Nordic frame of mind. Recommended recording: Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra/Sir Andrew Davis Chandos CHSA5131 Elgar wasn’t the only composer to write music for and about his friends. In 1894, Hubert Parry’s close friend Lady Helen Matilda Radnor commissioned him to write a work for her 72-piece all-female orchestra, made up of fellow ladies of birth who had a high level of musical training – not least her own daugher Wilma, who played the violin in the ensemble. Parry duly conjured up a six-movement suite of courtly dances inspired by the countess’s stately credentials, the premiere of which she conducted at St James Hall in London. Lady Radnor’s band – as the orchestra was nicknamed – gave regular performances throughout the First World War, at which their conductor was known to wear her tiara backwards, so that the audience could better see it while she was on the podium. Recommended recording: English String Orchestra/William Boughton Nimbus NI5068 While stylistically a generation or so onward from Elgar’s Enigma Variations, Britten’s 1937 breakthrough work for string orchestra is a character sketch of his teacher, in much the same way Elgar pays homage to his chums. Each movement, based loosely on the theme of the second of Bridge’s Three Idylls for String Quartet, represents aspects of Bridge’s personality, from his humour in the skittish ‘Aria Italiana’ to his sympathy in the ‘Funeral March’ and sense of tradition in the ‘Bourée’. Along the way, Britten makes passing references to Rossini, Stravinsky and Ravel, before the work ends with a helter-skelter fugue and, at last, Bridge’s theme itself which Britten only hints at in the introduction.

Bob,Diamond,1037,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/london-briefing-tsb-s-paul-pester-gets-set-for-second-grilling-1.3520581,"TSB branch in London: Paul Pester appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken and where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts. Photograph: Neil Hall Has the embattled chief executive of TSB found time to attend an emergency media-training course since his disastrous appearance at Westminster last month? We’ll find out on Wednesday when Paul Pester is grilled by MPs for the second time in just over a month on the calamitous IT failure at the challenger bank earlier this year. Pester’s first appearance at the treasury select committee on May 2nd is widely regarded as a master class in how not to handle questions from angry parliamentarians. Indeed, many observers deemed his performance even worse than that of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, when he informed astonished committee members back in 2011 that the time for “remorse and apology” for bankers was over. The main problem with the TSB boss was that he appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken, where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts and where nobody had missed out on house, holiday or car purchases because they could not access their cash. But the committee had examples of all the above and gave a graphic real-time demonstration of the scale of the chaos when two staff members attempted – unsuccessfully – to access their TBS accounts even as Pester sat there claiming things were running smoothly. His response: “It’s nice to see we’ve got so many TSB customers in the room. Thanks for banking with us” has to go down as one of the most ill-judged attempts at humour from a boss whose job is clearly on the line. Media training or not, there will be little opportunity for levity at Wednesday’s session. Last time, Pester was unable to say when the problems would be fixed, nor was he able to give any guidance on how many businesses had been affected, or how large the bank’s compensation bill might be. He’s not going to get away with that. More than six weeks on, many TSB customers say they are still locked out of their accounts and report long waits to get through to helplines. Customers logging in to the bank’s website are still being greeted with the message “We’re working to put things right” along with a helpline number – and a warning that lines are busier than usual. Fraudsters are using the cover of the chaos to target TSB account holders, with numerous incidences of bogus texts, emails and telephone calls. Stressed TSB employees are feeling the impact too, with reports of a large number of defections to other banks. There’s been no information yet about how many customers have closed their accounts. Pester will clearly be anticipating a rough ride but he was given a taste of just how tough his grilling will be in the form of an exchange of letters between Nicky Morgan and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. In the letters, released on Wednesday morning, FCA head Andrew Bailey – who will also be attending the session – takes the unusual step of publicly criticising the TSB boss for his over-optimistic spin on the botched IT job. He also suggests that Pester had more detail on the extent of the systems failure that he could, and should, have shared with the committee in May. Morgan, meanwhile, has piled on the pressure by saying she remains “deeply concerned” about the “quality and accuracy” of the evidence provided to the committee by Pester. The TSB boss may have taken some comfort on Tuesday when Tesco Bank was hit by its own IT glitch, leaving customers unable to access their accounts online or via mobile phone. They were still able to use their cards, however, and normal service was restored within five hours. A systems failure at Visa last Friday also caused widespread disruption in the UK – where it processes a third of all spending – and across Europe as customers were unable to use their cards to pay for transactions. Morgan has written to Visa Europe boss Charlotte Hogg, demanding to know when the company first became aware of the failure, how many cards were affected, and whether customers will be compensated. If she’s not satisfied with the answers, Morgan says she’ll be calling Hogg, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, to appear before the committee too. The credit card company has said the meltdown was triggered by a hardware failure but has given no detail. The joke doing the rounds in the City is that Visa made the mistake of calling in Mr Pester to advise on IT. Fiona Walsh is business editor of theguardian.com Subscribe.

This year, construction of a roundabout at Highway 22 and County Road 90 will result in a shorter but still significant detour. File photo Construction of a new Highway 22 bridge at Beauford was one of the reasons for a major detour in 2018. This year, construction of a roundabout at Highway 22 and County Road 90 will result in a shorter but still significant detour. File photo MANKATO — For travelers between Mankato and Mapleton, the second summer of their discontent is underway. The ""road closed"" barriers on Highway 22 are now well north of Blue Earth County Road 90 as work began on a roundabout at the intersection Wednesday. ""The project started today and we'll be going heavy on that into the fall,"" said Anne Wolff, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The roundabout is just a portion of the construction on Highway 22, which is also getting new pavement and safety improvements from the north side of Beauford to County Road 90 just south of Mankato. The two projects are pushing traffic on to a detour that runs through St. Clair and Pemberton on Highway 83 before using County Road 10 to reconnect to Highway 22. The Beauford to Mankato trip, typically fewer than 10 miles, will be 23 miles using the detour. During pavement and bridge work between Beauford and Mapleton a year ago, the detour was even longer. MnDOT has worked to maintain fairly easy access to businesses along Highway 22 south of Mankato. For those business north of County Road 90 — including a nursery/garden center and RV sales lot — Mankato customers can continue past the ""road closure"" signs near the Highway 83 intersection. For businesses south of County Road 90 — including a golf course, a gymnastics center, a bridal shop and Pioneer Seeds — Mankatoans should follow Monks Avenue to County Road 90 and then follow the signs. Customers coming from the southeast can cross the Highway 22 construction zone at County Road 15 to reach County Road 8 (Monks Avenue). For through-traffic, the detour will be in place into the fall with construction of the roundabout and the highway pavement targeted for completion in mid-October. Significant landscaping work will continue in 2019 on Highway 22 between Mankato and Mapleton, which was named Victory Memorial Highway following World War II when hundreds of trees were planted in honor of area soldiers, sailors and Marines serving overseas. The landscaping and construction of monuments at both ends of the Victory Memorial Highway — the concluding piece of the $23 million three-year project — will be completed while traffic continues to flow on Highway 22 in 2019. ""This is the last big year of traffic impacts,"" Wolff said. React to this story: Whenever Mark Fischenich posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

Sara,Burns,1035,http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/5447681/bus-shelter-display-highlights-squirrel-glider-conservation/,"About 20 years ago, a Burrumbuttock resident found an injured squirrel glider. Wildlife rescue group WIRES offered care for the animal and then encouraged some extra feeding once it was released to help with the transition. Surprisingly given the species’ vulnerable status, other gliders turned up too. “People started to hear about it and would go and watch the feeding and they would go and see gliders, so the community awareness basically grew from that moment,” Lou Bull said. On World Environment Day Burrumbuttock added to its squirrel glider history with the unveiling of a new information display on the Urana Road bus shelter. It’s an initiative of the Burrumbuttock squirrel glider Local Area Management Plan that began in 2013 and winds up this year. Ms Bull, who is the project officer, said the map-based plan built on the will already within the community to help sustain animal numbers. “Squirrel gliders have the ability to move between trees if the trees are not too far apart,” she said. “This project has looked at where the gaps in the landscape are and aiming to fill those gaps. “By the end of the project, we would have put in probably 25,000 plants or more.” Squirrel glider LAMP project steering committee member Owen Dunlop said 31 Burrumbuttock landholders had supported squirrel glider conservation works on their properties. “So far, 420 stock-proof tree guards have been installed to create important stepping stones in the landscape and 109 hectares of revegetation has been undertaken to connect and enhance existing patches of habitat,” he said. Supported by government funding, the project is a partnership between Petaurus Education Group, Murray Local Land Services, NSW Office of Environment and Heritage, West Hume Landcare, Greater Hume Council and Burrumbuttock landholders. Ms Bull said the plan had offered a new way forward in squirrel glider conservation. “It hasn’t been quite so targeted before so hopefully this now sets the scene for replicating this style of approach,” she said. With the project nearing its end, the bus shelter display represented a permanent legacy of this work. “For me personally this project has been really positive just to see the goodwill of wanting to do something for future generations around an animal that’s vulnerable,” Ms Bull said. “It’s really fun working with these landholders who are learning along the way about an animal you don’t often see. “That’s really exciting when people get on board to do that sort of thing.” While you’re with us, did you know that you can now receive updates straight to your inbox each day at 6am from The Border Mail?

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:35 pm Salem, Massachusetts HADLEY GREEN/Staff photoThe city of Salem is taking Bradford Street resident Jennifer Cronin to court over her swimming pool, which is in her front yard. City officials say the pool doesn't meet required setbacks, and Cronin failed to secure a permit or have the pool inspected. HADLEY GREEN/Staff photoThe city of Salem is taking Bradford Street resident Jennifer Cronin to court over her swimming pool, which is in her front yard. City officials say the pool doesn't meet required setbacks, and Cronin failed to secure a permit or have the pool inspected. SALEM — While many homeowners have been getting their pools ready for the season, one Salem homeowner says she is trying to find someone to take hers down. But if Jennifer Cronin doesn't do it soon, the city might beat her to it. Why? Because the above-ground pool was put up just feet from the sidewalk at 3 Bradford St., in the north end of the city. And neighbors say it's disconcerting — as well as a violation of the zoning ordinance. ""It is out of place to see an above-ground pool in the front yard and close enough to touch it from the sidewalk,"" one neighbor, Matt Modoff, told the Zoning Board of Appeals in October. Under the city's zoning ordinance, the pool is supposed to be at least 15 feet from the sidewalk. City officials, who also say Cronin never got an electrical permit or inspection for the pool after it was put up last year, went to court last month asking a judge to issue an order that Cronin take it down. Failing that, the city wants the court to appoint a receiver to step in and remove the pool — at Cronin's expense. Cronin, in an interview last week, said she's not sure what the big deal is, saying the pool itself is ""just shy"" of the 15-foot setback and that she could move the deck. She called it ""an honest mistake."" ""Who would it hurt?"" said Cronin, who said she took ""great pains to make sure it was safe."" She said she planned to put up a fence around the pool before she was ordered by the city to stop. It remains unclear who put up the pool and did the electrical work. Cronin declined to identify the business. The city of Salem's Inspectional Services Department received a complaint from a neighbor last September. Assistant building inspector Steve Cummings found that the pool was in violation of setback requirements, and had been set up without a building or electrical permit. He sent her a violation notice. Cronin, who lost her husband unexpectedly in 2016, said she was told to apply for a zoning variance, so she did. But she did not appear at the public hearing last November. The board heard from several of her neighbors. The owner of the property closest to the pool, Vincent Lepore, told the board he's concerned about what could happen to his yard if the pool was damaged. Others noted that Cronin had a pool previously in her backyard, something to which they did not object. ""I had no idea it was an open meeting,"" said Cronin. The board sent her a letter shortly after the decision to deny the variance. Cronin admits she was upset when it arrived. She put it down and then, she says, a housecleaner threw it away. She also said her emails to city officials bounced back. Cronin, who did not have an attorney, said she then asked city officials about filing an appeal, and was told she was one day past the 20-day deadline for filing one. City officials warned Cronin that she would begin incurring fines unless she removed the pool within 10 days. But it was impossible, Cronin said, to find someone to take down a pool in December. She requested extra time. The city agreed to give her until April if she agreed to give Cummings a notarized affidavit promising to have the pool taken down by then. She didn't, and the city then began fining Cronin, issuing three violation tickets totaling $500 between Jan. 16 and Feb. 5. City officials say in their complaint that Cronin has done nothing to correct the violations. Cronin's ""failure to comply harms the values of neighboring properties and presents a safety risk given the absence of building and electrical permits ... and inspections,"" the complaint says. After being served with the civil lawsuit last month, Cronin said, ""I am appalled. It's beyond comprehension."" Cronin, in a two-plus hour interview, said at one point that she may file a countersuit, blaming a range of past neighborhood issues as the reason for the permit denial. But she also said she plans to call a pool company to have the pool removed.

Steve,Cummings,1033,http://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/itv-broadcast-british-cycling-national-road-championships-382154,"Catch the British domestic race on ITV on July 1 The HSBC UK National Road Championships race will be broadcast on ITV this year, British Cycling has announced. The broadcast will begin at 3pm, on Sunday July 1 – when the races take place in Northumberland, following the time trial on Thursday June 28. The 106km women’s road race, which takes place in the morning, will be shown in highlight form, and there will be live footage from the 185km men’s event – both races will finish in the village of Stamfordham, around 20km west of Newcastle. The village hosted the Nationals road race in 2011 – when Bradley Wiggins and Lizzie Deignan won, both through late attacks. >>> British Cycling reveals 2018 National Road Race Championships courses The men will be competing to take the national champions’ jersey from last year’s victor, Steve Cummings, whilst the women will race to take the title from Lizzie Deignan. Narrow, technical roads characterise the course – and though it’s not notably hilly, there is a signifiant incline on the Ryals ascent which the men will attack four times on their 34.5km long loop. There’s two short 22km laps included – on laps one and six of the six lap race, and the men will visit the climb for the last time with 30km to go. The women will complete three laps of the long route, and will therefore meet Ryals with just 10km to go. The races form part of the ‘Cyclone Festival of Cycling’, which comprises of the elite time trials and road races, plus a mass participation ‘Tyne 6 Bridges’ ride on Friday June 29 and the ‘Cyclone Challenge Sportive’ on Saturday June 30. “At British Cycling we want to inspire people from all walks of life to get on their bikes. The HSBC UK National Road Championships are the pinnacle of our domestic calendar, and ensuring that as many people as possible get to follow the racing is a key aim of ours,” said British Cycling’s CEO, Julie Harrington. “The field for both the men’s and women’s races looks set to be incredibly strong, and it’s fantastic news that people from across the country will be able to watch the country’s best riders put on a great show and be inspired to attend another event or take up and be inspired to take up the sport themselves in the future.” The footage will remain on ITV’s Hub for 27 days after the event, for those who want to catch up.

Humorously tossing the cloak over a nearby violinist, Richard Ballinger took up his director’s baton as he led the advanced middle school string musicians to the opening medley of John Williams' music from ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" It was an incredible evening of orchestral movie, pop and folk music by the Oslo and Storm Grove Middle School orchestras and original music composed by and performed with visiting guest artist Adam Ezra Group, a folk rock band from Boston that worked with the orchestras for the three days leading up to the concert.

The concert brought in $15,000. OPUS has made it its mission every year for the past several years to support the public school education system and the performing arts programs. OPUS members believe this makes an impact on the quality of students' scholastic and holistic well-being. “Absolutely it has helped our son,” said Michael Gordon. “Not only has he developed a true passion for playing the bass and loves attending school, but he has new goals. Thanks to the inspiration of this program and its director, he is now making plans to pursue an interest in acoustical engineering.” Since its inception in 2012, OPUS has assisted more than 1,500 students and their families. Alumni from these programs have gone on to achieve scholarships and university degrees while still actively honing their craft as string musicians, many within the community.

Michael,Gordon,1032,https://www.businessnewsaus.com.au/articles/blue-sky-confirms-kpmg-to-carry-out-comprehensive-review.html,"Written on the 6 June 2018 by Ben Hall Blue Sky Alternative Investments (ASX: BLA) has announced it is undergoing an independent valuation review of all assets by KPMG, a day after its shares took another hit on the news that it is winding up its retail domestic hedge fund. Blue Sky says KPMG is not advising Blue Sky on its business model or management structure and the review is part of a comprehensive review process announced last month. Shares in Blue Sky fell 6.5 per cent to close at $2.31 on Tuesday after the fund manager announced it would wind up its retail domestic hedge fund, One Managed Investment Funds Limited, which is the responsible entity of the Blue Sky Alliance Fund. Proceeds will be returned to investors. The company says the Alliance Fund comprised $48.6 million of fee-earning assets under management at March 31, 2018, representing less than 1.5 per cent of Blue Sky's total fee earning assets under management (FEAUM) at that date. Blue Sky's hedge fund business will now focus solely on its institutional Dynamic Macro strategy, which has returned 6.88 per cent annually since inception. The Brisbane-based company's share price and market capitalisation has collapsed since the release of a scathing report in March by a US short seller which claimed it ""wildly exaggerated"" its FEAUM. Glaucus Research claimed that Blue Sky's $4 billion in FEAUM was overstated by $2.5billion and that its share price was worth just $2.56. At the time of controversial report, BLA shares were trading around $11.50 and had previously reached a high of $14.99. As the share price plunged, the fallout led to two board purges and the resignations of managing director Robert Shand, followed by chairman John Kain, along with board members Elaine Stead and Nicholas Dignam. Veteran board member Michael Gordon resigned for health reasons. Last month the company announced it expects its full year net profit after tax (NPAT) for 2018 to be lowered by $7 million just a week after it abandoned guidance because of the turmoil caused by the Glaucus report. At around 11am, BLA shares rose slightly to $2.33. Never miss a news update, subscribe here. Follow us on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Twitter.
