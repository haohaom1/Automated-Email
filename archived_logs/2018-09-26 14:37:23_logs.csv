Here’s how to create the perfect town plot Although I live in a town, my garden thinks it lives in the country, with its brambles and nettles and patches of rural shagginess. I like it this way, and so do the birds, insects and other creatures that live and breed in it. When I look out of the window, I want to see other beings going about their business in safety and comfort. For me, the garden is a place for them to live full time, and for me to visit for a while every day, to grow some ornamental plants and a few vegetables without causing too much upset. However, I realise that this approach is not for everyone. Most people with town gardens want to see a balanced scene with strong… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most. Sale now on.

Joel,Cutler,b'1668',http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180922/football-uas-sass-suffers-collarbone-injury,"The Upper Arlington High School football team will begin OCC-Central Division play without its starting quarterback, and the Golden Bears might not have him for the rest of the season. Senior Sammy Sass suffered what coach Joel Cutler called a “significant” collarbone injury during the first quarter of UA’s 29-28 loss to Lancaster on Sept. 21, although he stopped short of saying it was broken and would not put a time frame on how long Sass might be out. “Without going into too much detail, Sammy has a significant collarbone injury and it doesn’t look good for the near future,” Cutler said Sept. 22. “It’s a tough blow.” Sass was injured at the end of a long run in the first quarter. Two Lancaster defensive backs sandwiched him near the goal line, causing the injury. “He was trying to get into the end zone and he was splitting the safeties when they went to tackle him. They both fell on his shoulders when he hit the turf,” Cutler said. Sass’ backup, junior Jacob Leve, completed four of eight passes for 56 yards against the Golden Gales. UA fell to 2-3 with the loss and will play host to Westland in its OCC-Central opener Sept. 28. Sass, who has completed 42 of 76 passes for 616 yards with seven touchdowns and three interceptions and has rushed for 155 yards and four touchdowns on 32 carries this season, also missed much of last baseball season because of a broken left thumb — on his non-throwing hand — suffered in April. Sass has committed to play baseball at Wright State. dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

""Ed and I have never seen ourselves as they kind of people who will move down to the warm weather and play bridge and tennis for the rest of our lives,"" Lane said. ""That was never going to work for us."" Lane sought out local classes for older adults at Berkshire Community College. Her husband, Ed, separately pursued his master's in business administration. Today, Lane not only takes classes at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College, she is also a board member. Her husband, a former consulting actuary, now teaches finance and economics as an adjunct professor at other colleges. ""At the end of the day, you're having a glass of wine and preparing dinner,"" said Lane. ""And Ed's got his stories about his students and I've got my stories. It's really been wonderful for us."" For retirees who find themselves with time on their hands and a willingness to learn, taking classes or even going back to school full time may be an appealing option. Colleges and universities are meeting that demand with everything from dedicated lifelong learning programs to on campus living arrangements. Individuals living on a fixed income likely want to avoid the big tuition bills that can come with going back to school. Fortunately, there are programs designed for older and retired individuals that let you take classes for a fraction of the costs of today's tuition. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, which receive funding through the Bernard Osher Foundation, provide non-credit, non-graded courses aimed at adults ages 50 and up. Its network includes 122 college and university programs across the country. At Berkshire Community College's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, membership is $60 per year, and classes are $50 each. Like other Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the program offers scholarships for those who find those costs too steep. The school's program currently has 1,200 members with two full-time staff members. Its robust schedule — including 26 classes in the fall semester — relies heavily on the help of volunteers. The Pittsfield, Massachusetts, area, where the school is based, is a popular retirement destination for people who love culture and nature, according to Megan Whilden, executive director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College. That has drawn more of those residents to its classes, which are on everything from current events — such as contemporary gender roles, nuclear weapons and gerrymandering and the right to vote — to memoir writing and fly fishing. More from Personal Finance: Retirement isn't just a pipe dream. How to make it happen You need to save for retirement. But don't forget your dreams These countries are ahead of the US in retirement The program also offers day trips, such as previews of upcoming performances at the Tanglewood Music Center or tours of a local dairy farm. Many of the students are not your typical senior citizens, according to Whilden, who recalled seeing an 85-year-old woman in a Pussy Riot t-shirt during her first week on the job. ""It's good for blowing up stereotypes, for sure,"" Whilden said. Nancy Vale, 87, a professionally trained actress, has found that both teaching and taking classes through the Performing Arts Initiative at the Institute has enabled her to continue to put her acting skills to use. It has also helped her grow her social circle after her husband of 49 years, Michael, the actor who played the baker in Dunkin Donuts' ""Time to make the donuts"" commercials, died 10 years ago. ""There's always someone directing something or appearing in something or wanting to put heads together about a workshop or class,"" Vale said. ""I've made a lot of friends."" That support continues outside of the school, which helped to promote to the school community her role in a local production of ""The Vagina Monologues."" The lifelong learning model that many schools follow today was first created at The New School in New York City in 1962. Today, that program — called the Institute for Retired Professionals — continues to thrive. Annual membership costs $1,054, and gives participants access to up to three study groups and a regular course at the New School each semester at half price, plus other activities and special events. The program has about 300 students, with members ranging in age from their 50s to their 90s. Those members use their professional backgrounds — including areas such as human resources or finance — to help run the program. ""This is about the self-motivation of learning, being involved in an active learning community,"" said Mary Watson, executive dean of The New School's Schools of Public Engagement. The average tenure for members is 15 years. If students decide to discontinue their membership, they can convert to alumni members for a $25 lifetime fee. Like the Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the New School offers scholarships for those who have limited resources. Retirees who want to go back to school on a budget also have several other options to consider, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research at Savingforcollege.com. Some colleges and universities offer senior citizen tuition waivers. In addition, many community colleges will let senior citizens audit classes for free, provided there is space available, Kantrowitz said. Companies that provide video lectures or online education programs may also be a low-budget option for learning new information. Retirees may also want to consider going back to work for a company such as Starbucks or Walmart to get access to the free tuition benefits they offer, Kantrowitz said. The good news for aspiring students: Any money you have left over in a 529 college savings account can be used to pay for classes, even if you're not pursuing a degree or certificate. ""Maybe you had a 529 plan that you set up for your children or grandchildren and there's money left over,"" said Kantrowitz. ""You can use it for your own education, even if you're not pursing a degree. ""It's great for continuing education classes,"" he added. Retirees who will spare no expense in pursuing a college experience may instead want to opt to live on campus. Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, is seeing demand for such accommodations. The university is adding a dorm building to its campus for senior residents. The building, which is scheduled to open in 2020, will include 252 independent living apartments and 52 health-care units. Individuals must be at least 62 to sign up to live there. So far, almost 90 percent of the units have been sold. Residents will have access to campus amenities, including an art museum, dog park, indoor pool, restaurants, spa and theater. But the biggest perk of all, according to Todd Hardy, managing director at Innovation Zones at ASU, will be the access to campus culture, including performing arts events in the dorm, and the ability to join the community themselves as students, teachers and mentors. ""The young folks learn more effectively when they're exposed to an older generation,"" Hardy said. ""The older generation thrives significantly because of exposure to the younger generation."" To live in the dorm, called Mirabella, residents pay a buy-in fee, which ranges from $378,500 for a one bedroom unit to $810,200 for a two-bedroom penthouse. When a resident dies, 85 percent of that fee is returned to their heirs. In addition, residents must also pay a monthly fee — which covers activities, dining, housekeeping, shuttles and utilities, as well as other costs — which ranges from $4,195 for a single person in a one bedroom unit to $5,570 for two people living in a penthouse suite. For many Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes across the country, the challenge is keeping up with demand from new students who want to participate. ""In the past couple of years, our growth has just exploded,"" Whilden said of Berkshire Community College's program. ""We've increased our membership by 30 percent — 12 percent just over the past year."" At Northwestern University's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, where students have access to courses on everything from art in America to how democracies die, membership has grown by 11 percent to 12 percent every year, said Kirsty Montgomery, director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Northwestern. In 2011, Northwestern's program had 800 members. Today, that total has climbed to 1,400. As a result, Montgomery said she rarely advertises the program outside of the college community because there is only so much growth the program can take. ""It's a good problem to have,"" she said. At Bismarck State College in North Dakota, the school's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute plans to grow to 500 members in the next couple of years, from 150 members today. That target is in keeping with the area's growing retirement community, said Bismarck State College President Dr. Larry Skogen. Skogen, who is also a historian, will be teaching his own course this fall on the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848 as a prelude to the Civil War. But the biggest takeaways from the programs are the social connections that the students establish, according to Norma Clippard, director of the Osher Institute at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Vanderbilt's program includes a steel drum band, complete with a band camp, and classes on astronomy and American popular music. For many retirees, this has been life changing, Clippard said, and has let them find new purpose in retirement. Grandparents sometimes run into their own grandchildren — and fellow students — on campus, while other students have met their significant others in class. ""These classes have been a life saver for me, and I've heard a lot of other members say the same thing,"" said Kathy Garthwaite, who currently serves as advisory board president of Vanderbilt's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Garthwaite, 63, found the program after an unexpected early retirement led her to become ""bored to death."" Attending the classes has changed her life – and the lives of others – for the better, she said. ""People said they were depressed and then they started to come to classes and started to get involved and made new friends,"" Garthwaite said. ""It has made all the difference in their lives.""

Jane Lynch fell down a rabbit hole of nostalgia with PeopleTV’s Couch Surfing host Lola Ogunnaike, and the two fell on The Fugitive. Lynch, soon to be seen (excuse us, heard) in Disney’s Ralph Breaks the Internet, shared some behind-the-scenes stories about her time working with Harrison Ford — including how Ford didn’t care for how their scene had been written. “He didn’t like the scene as it was written,” she recalled. “And it was raining outside and he took me underneath his umbrella, we went to his trailer, and we worked it out, we worked the scene out. Like, ‘You say this and then I’ll say that, and then I’ll say this and you say that.'” Released in 1993 and directed by Andrew Davis, The Fugitive starred Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man on a mission to find his wife’s killer after he was framed for the crime. Lynch then appeared as Dr. Kathy Wahlund, who had that line about how Richard asking for her help is “not his style.” RELATED VIDEO: Jane Lynch reveals the Role Models line she still hears on the street “He was kind of a cranky guy,” Lynch said with a smile of Ford in the film. “He said, ‘We’re gonna do it this way.’ And everybody was like, ‘Alright.'” As an added bonus, Lynch got more advice from Ford — perhaps the most useful advice of her career at that point in her life. “It doesn’t matter how smart you are, you look stupid if your mouth is agape,” the actress said.

MIKE MATHISON/The News-Enterprise John Hardin coach Chris Engstrand previewed the tussle with visiting Meade County as a fight in a phone booth. He wasn’t wrong. The Bulldogs held the Green Wave to three points on back-to-back trips inside the 10-yard line and escaped with a 15-9 battle. “That was very important,” John Hardin linebacker Navash Daley said about keeping Meade County out of the end zone to start the second half. “We stayed disciplined. We had great coaching by Coach (Greg) Goodman and we executed very well. I feel like this game brought us together and showed us what we can do on the defensive side of the ball.” Meade County had a second-and-goal at the 1 the first time and lost possession via fumble that the Bulldogs’ Cameron Brown recovered. The Green Wave had first-and-goal at the 10 on the next drive and came away with a 25-yard field goal by Mason Craycroft for a 9-7 lead with 4:48 left in the third period. “That (not scoring to start the second half) and the fumble on the goal line were probably our two biggest defensive stands of the night,” Engstrand said. “Just to keep them from hitting paydirt was big for us.” The two long drives were at the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half. “We have a saying, it’s pretty normal, but ‘bend, don’t break,’” John Hardin defensive lineman Dominic Hope said. “If we can hold them to a field goal, we’re gonna hold them to a field goal. We did that tonight. We didn’t allow them to score a touchdown on our defense. “They were trying to run it away from some of our good linemen. We switch around people on the line. Every game we play different positions. I never play just tackle or just end. We all get switched around and find that sweet spot and what works. The sweet spot changes every game, depending on what team we’re playing.” John Hardin’s defense shut down Meade County (2-4) the rest of the evening. The Green Wave had 24 snaps for 142 yards on those two drives and 32 yards on 26 plays everywhere else. “Film study and great coaching,” Daley said. “We couldn’t get it in the end zone,” veteran Meade County coach Larry Mofield said. “You’ve got to be able to get it in the end zone. You can’t kick field goals, although we did a nice job of taking the lead. We couldn’t run the football. That was on me because I think I talked Coach Kirk into throwing the ball too much. We probably should have stuck with the running game a little bit. That one’s on me.” The Bulldogs (4-2) held the visitors to back-to-back three-and-outs after the field goal and took over possession at the 45-yard line. They went on a 14-play, 55-yard drive in which they converted four third downs and one fourth down and took 4:22 off the clock. Will Cason scored from the 6 and a Russell pass to Andrew Davis was good for the two-point conversion and John Hardin held the 15-9 lead with 5:35 left in the game. “They did a good job tonight. You got to give Coach Engstrand and those kids credit,” Mofield said. “They really find a way to come back and win football games. They’re playing well right now. They’re pretty hot. If they stick together, they’re gonna make a lot of noise. “They spread you out and do a nice job with the screens. They’re spacing is good and are able to run the ball. Their quarterback runs the offense well and they’ve got a lot of nice athletes. I thought they did a good job up front, too on both sides of the ball, but especially on the defensive line.” Meade County made it 6-0 when Mason Burnett picked off a Justin Russell offering and took it back 50 yards just 77 seconds into the game. The 2-point conversion run was stopped. “They came out fired up and we came out a little on our heels,” Engstrand said. “But we knuckled down when we needed to.” John Hardin made it 7-6 at the 7:23 mark of the second period when Russell found senior Darion Davis on fourth-and-goal from the 7 one player after a Davis run was stopped for a six-yard loss. “The defense, I thought, played well all night and did a good job containing,” Mofield said. “Then they got us in a three-man front and started running the ball. They got us in a lot of second-and-short, third-and-short opportunities, which is pretty easy to call plays.” Meade County was short on a fourth-down run on its next possession and then threw three straight incomplete passes to turn the ball over with 90 seconds left in the game. “(The last two weeks) tells our defense that we can hang with the gonna ones, that we can hang with the big boys,” Hope said. “It doesn’t matter that we’re small, we’re still gonna pop you.” Russell finished 13-for-27 for 119 yards. Six receptions for 67 yards and a score went to Davis. The Bulldogs ran the ball 24 times for 117 yards. “We had them behind the chains most of the night,” Engstrand said. “And that matters, especially with a team that’s so run heavy. We can pretty much dictate what they’re gonna do at that point.” The Green Wave had 114 yards on the ground. Senior Nathan Holley led the way with 62 yards on 12 carries. He was followed by junior Donovan Matthews, who had seven carries for 45 yards. Quarterback Trent Mofield was 4-for-16 for 46 yards. He was 1-for-9 for minus-1 yard in the second half. “We’ve got to find a way to keep our bunch together,” Coach Mofield said. “We’ve lost a bunch of tough ones. It’s gonna check our resiliency. I think our kids are frustrated at losing. These are the times that try you. If you can come through these because this is a lot like life. There’s gonna be a lot worse that happens to us that losing football games. Getting through moments like these will set the course of us down the road I think.” The Bulldogs have won three in a row and have given up 32 points in those contests. “I feel we’re set well going into district play,” Daley said.

Phillip,Frost,b'1663',https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/22/1574592/0/en/Pomerantz-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-against-OPKO-Health-Inc-and-Certain-Officers-OPK.html,"NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Papa John’s International, Inc. (“OPKO” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: OPK) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, and index under 18-cv-23924, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons other than Defendants who purchased or otherwise acquired OPKO securities between September 26, 2013 and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are a shareholder who purchased OPKO securities between September 26, 2013, and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until November 13, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here to join this class action] OPKO purports to be a healthcare company that engages in the diagnostics and pharmaceuticals business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) OPKO and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Phillip Frost (“Frost”), were participants in a “pump-and-dump” scheme designed, in part, to artificially inflate the price of various stocks, allowing Defendant Frost, among others, to reap millions of dollars in unlawful profits; and (ii) as a result, OPKO’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On September 7, 2018, the SEC issued a press release entitled “SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes”. The press release stated, in part, that the SEC had “charged a group of 10 individuals and 10 associated entities for their participation in long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock.” The press release named both OPKO and Frost as defendants. Following this news, OPKO’s stock price fell $1.01 per share, or more than 18%, before NASDAQ halted the trading of OPKO stock on September 7, 2018, at 2:34 p.m. EDT at $4.58 per share. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions.
