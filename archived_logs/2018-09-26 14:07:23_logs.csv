Jane,Powers,b'1669',https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/ireland/jane-powers-on-gardening-strike-the-right-chord-for-a-harmonious-urban-paradise-hxdcgj70f,"Gardening From the framework to the flowers, balancing the elements is vital in a small space — and can make it seem larger. Here’s how to create the perfect town plot Although I live in a town, my garden thinks it lives in the country, with its brambles and nettles and patches of rural shagginess. I like it this way, and so do the birds, insects and other creatures that live and breed in it. When I look out of the window, I want to see other beings going about their business in safety and comfort. For me, the garden is a place for them to live full time, and for me to visit for a while every day, to grow some ornamental plants and a few vegetables without causing too much upset. However, I realise that this approach is not for everyone. Most people with town gardens want to see a balanced scene with strong… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most. Sale now on.

Joel,Cutler,b'1668',http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180922/football-uas-sass-suffers-collarbone-injury,"The Upper Arlington High School football team will begin OCC-Central Division play without its starting quarterback, and the Golden Bears might not have him for the rest of the season. Senior Sammy Sass suffered what coach Joel Cutler called a “significant” collarbone injury during the first quarter of UA’s 29-28 loss to Lancaster on Sept. 21, although he stopped short of saying it was broken and would not put a time frame on how long Sass might be out. “Without going into too much detail, Sammy has a significant collarbone injury and it doesn’t look good for the near future,” Cutler said Sept. 22. “It’s a tough blow.” Sass was injured at the end of a long run in the first quarter. Two Lancaster defensive backs sandwiched him near the goal line, causing the injury. “He was trying to get into the end zone and he was splitting the safeties when they went to tackle him. They both fell on his shoulders when he hit the turf,” Cutler said. Sass’ backup, junior Jacob Leve, completed four of eight passes for 56 yards against the Golden Gales. UA fell to 2-3 with the loss and will play host to Westland in its OCC-Central opener Sept. 28. Sass, who has completed 42 of 76 passes for 616 yards with seven touchdowns and three interceptions and has rushed for 155 yards and four touchdowns on 32 carries this season, also missed much of last baseball season because of a broken left thumb — on his non-throwing hand — suffered in April. Sass has committed to play baseball at Wright State. dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.
