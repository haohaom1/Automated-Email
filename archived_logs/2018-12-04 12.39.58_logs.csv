Davis, 32, was flying two passengers Friday when the Cessna 525A crashed minutes after takeoff from Clark Regional Airport. Flight tracking site FlightAware shows it was at about 6,000 feet when it suddenly changed course and then disappeared from radar. Davis was a corporate pilot at TEG Architects. He was flying Wayne Estopinal, 63, the head of the Jeffersonville firm and a founder of the Louisville City FC soccer team, and TEG vice president Sandra Holland Johnson, 54, of Shreveport, Louisiana. All three were killed. More about Andrew Davis: Pilot was beloved father and husband Workers Monday were hauling parts of the demolished plane from a densely wooded area west of unincorporated Memphis, about 16 miles north of Louisville. Pilots, safety experts and others have cautioned against early speculation about the cause of the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board will spend months studying the crash before determining a likely cause. The FAA said Monday that it had no records of accidents, incidents or enforcement actions related to Davis. Davis had been with TEG Architects since February 2018, according to the company. Before that, he had worked as a corporate pilot at Soin International and Muncie Aviation Co., according to TEG. Soin President Vishal Soin said in an email that Davis worked there for about 3 1/2 years and never had any safety or job performance issues. ""Andrew was a true family man and devoted man of faith,"" Soin said. ""He was an extremely conscientious pilot and had an unrelenting passion for aviation."" Davis graduated in 2008 from Indiana State University with a bachelor's degree in aerospace administration and professional aviation flight technology, the university confirmed Monday. At TEG, Davis worked alongside Mike Vollmer, the company's other corporate pilot. The two had previously worked together at Soin. When Davis switched to TEG, he encouraged Vollmer to join him at the Jeffersonville architectural firm. ""He was a relentless father and husband,"" Vollmer said of Davis. ""Everything he did focused around his family and his faith."" The damage: 'It’s terribly fragmented': Crews work Clark County plane crash site Vollmer said Davis was easy to get along with and was always telling stories. ""I used to joke with him that he wasn’t old enough to have that many stories,"" he said. He said Davis was always focused on safety and procedure. ""He had checklists for checklists."" Vollmer said the Cessna 525A had recently been in for minor routine maintenance. He said he and Davis in November held a safety training ""stand-down"" and had invited other tenants at Clark Regional to join. Paul Lucas, a TEG pilot from 2007 to 2014, said he flew the Cessna for more than five years, beginning when it was delivered new from the factory in 2009. He said the plane had two crew seats and seven seats for passengers. He said the corporate jet ""has a history of being a very safe, reliable aircraft."" Lucas stressed that he has been gone from the company for four years but said the plane was reliable and doesn’t remember significant problems. Estopinal, himself a private pilot, was focused on safety, Lucas said. Earlier: Investigators start searching for clues in deadly Indiana plane crash Overview: Here's everything we know about the Southern Indiana plane crash ""He was a hard-charging guy, but when it came to airplanes, we were in charge,"" Lucas said. ""He got the things that sometimes as a corporate pilot are difficult to convey to your management team."" Lucas spoke reverently of Estopinal, praising his former boss for giving him an opportunity to be chief pilot at age 24. ""I swore I would never let that man and his family down,"" Lucas said. Lucas said he used to fly 300 to 400 hours per year in the Cessna 525A. He said the typical flight was within about 600 miles of Clark County, although ""we had the airplane all over the country, all four corners of continental U.S."" Lucas said there's a ""natural human reaction to try to rationalize"" what could have happened in the crash but he said he hopes people will wait to speculate and allow investigators to do their jobs.

TEG Architects President Wayne Estopinal SOUTHERN INDIANA — The Jeffersonville architecture firm that lost three employees in a small plane crash on Friday says colleagues are grieving, but still providing the services the company's founder would expect of them. TEG Architects founder and President Wayne Estopinal, VP of Business Development Sandy Johnson and company pilot Andrew Davis died when the Chicago-bound Cessna Citation CJ-2 they were aboard crashed near Crone and Beyl Roads in Memphis around 11:30 a.m. Friday. The plane had taken off from the Clark Regional Airport just minutes before. Estopinal founded TEG 29 years ago, according to a statement from TEG. Estopinal was also one of the founders of LouCity FC. ""He was a visionary, an innovator and capable of extraordinary architecture resulting from his incredibly hard work ethic and uncompromising attention to client satisfaction,"" the statement reads. ""Wayne was also a superior teacher to all of his staff. He generously shared his time to mentor, educate and inspire others while striving to promote quality and efficiency in design. In addition to inspiring many staff, he provided exceptional internships to more than 140 architectural student interns; immersing them in all aspects of planning and design."" Johnson, a Louisiana native, was described as ""an extraordinary liaison"" for the firm. ""The dedication to her family, staff, clients, colleagues that she possessed was unlike any other."" Davis, a Sellersburg native, was new to the firm, but considered a seasoned pilot. ""But most importantly [he was] a dedicated, loving husband and father."" He was the father of two and attended Northside Christian Church. ""While grieving, the TEG family will recover and looks forward to continuing to provide our services,"" the statement continues. ""Our partners, Ernie Dreher, Kyle Wilson and Joel Wallace will ensure our firm will continue to meet the same high-quality standards, uncompromising commitment, and outstanding effort that Wayne expected.""
