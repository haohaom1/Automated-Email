Michael,Gordon,1954,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/11/19/titans-2018-season-by-the-numbers2/,"TITANS The Gold Coast Titans' 14th-placed finish in 2018 needs to be balanced against the strong foundation that was built by new coach Garth Brennan, which suggests a return to September football in the near future is not a pipe dream. The Titans lost nine games by 12 points or less and, like most sides that failed to figure in the finals, were unable to ice games that were there for the taking. The mental lapses that marred several of those performances were not surprising given that the Titans fielded, along with the Panthers, the most inexperienced side in the NRL in 2018 with an average of just 79 NRL caps per player. It was the introduction of a couple of rising stars – 19-year-old forward Fotuaika Moeaki and 20-year-old half/fullback AJ Brimson – which signalled the arrival of two rare talents and the direction Brennan wants to take his squad. Brennan had a tough initiation to the role when his million-dollar man Jarryd Hayne left the club before the start of pre-season training. The Titans were also nomads in the opening seven rounds of the competition due to the Commonwealth Games being held on the Gold Coast, which led to them playing just one of the first seven games at CBUS Stadium. Two of their 'home' games were played at Toowoomba and Gladstone, a scenario which was not conducive to building any momentum at home early in the season. The Titans also had mixed returns from the buys they did make with Leilani Latu and Bryce Cartwright disappointments but Michael Gordon and Mitch Rein both having strong seasons. Their key 2019 new recruits – Tyrone Peachey, Ryley Jacks, Shannon Boyd and Brian Kelly – will give the Titans depth and attacking punch in key areas. ""We didn't finish near where we wanted to be, but it was a year of laying some very strong foundations,"" Brennan told NRL.com when reflecting on the 2018 season. ""Right from the outset I said I want to have a team predominantly made up of locals and that takes time. That is why I brought blokes like AJ and Moe into the team, and that may or may not have been before they were ready, but I was willing to take a few hits if it meant they were going to be better for it. ""I would have liked to have won more games, don't get me wrong, but if we had won just one more we would have finished up in 11th above Newcastle and people would have said that was a good season after we started wooden spoon favourites. ""Being on the road for a long time at the start was tough and there was an early disruption with the Jarryd thing, but we do not use that as an excuse. Bryce and Latu probably didn't aim up like we would have hoped but we picked up Michael Gordon and Mitch Rein and I thought they were standouts."" In the club's best regular season performance back in 2009, when they finished third, the Titans won 11 of their 12 home games. That benchmark is high but reflective of what the club at its best is capable of. Opponents do not fear a trip to the Gold Coast and the Titans will need that to change if they are to play regular finals football. Their four wins and eight losses at home in 2018, a win/loss record replicated on the road, was never going to be good enough to play finals football but it could so easily have been eight and four or better. ""In all the games at home, apart from the (34-0) loss to the Broncos, we were more than competitive in and in the fight,"" Brennan said. ""We got beaten by the Sharks by one point, the Panthers in golden point and losses to the Storm (10-8), Cowboys (30-26) and Rabbitohs (18-16) were close. We've just got to turn those narrow losses into wins and then we are talking about semi-final football after that."" Winger Anthony Don topped the try scoring list for the Titans for the fourth season out of five with 15 to maintain his reputation as one of the club's most valuable assets. It is a remarkable achievement for the former Grafton Ghost who did not make his NRL debut until the age of 25. Don, who is signed for the next two seasons, now sits just one try behind David Mead's club record of 67 tries. ""Don is not a Ferrari, more like your Holden Commodore. He is Mr Reliable,"" Brennan said. ""You know he is always going to turn up and do his job, and he's a really good finisher. You just know that when Don is around, he's safe."" Maroons forward Jai Arrow topped the post contact metres per game for the Titans with 54.9m on average across 21 matches, which put him in ninth position overall in the NRL. Titans centre Konrad Hurrell was second on the Titans list with 48.3m through 19 matches. Cowboys powerhouse Jason Taumalolo led all NRL players with 75.8m per game. Overall the Titans were 14th in the NRL for average post contact metres per game with 469m, behind the Roosters who topped that statistic on 530m. It is an area Brennan expects to improve in 2019 due to several shrewd buys. ""We've brought in guys like Shannon Boyd, Tyrone Peachey and Brian Kelly who are predominantly tackle breakers so I think we will be better in that area for it,"" Brennan said. ""Jarrod Wallace is in a lot better shape than he was at this time last year and I think that will help him out as well."" The Titans scored 40% of their 78 season tries down the left or centre left channel, narrowly ahead of the 38% of their tally down the right or centre right. Left winger Phillip Sami scored 14 tries for the season while the team's third and fifth highest try scorers – AJ Brimson (7) and Dale Copley (5) – scored the majority of their tries down the left side. The Titans' right side features Ash Taylor, who led the club for try assists with 17, while Don is a right winger and the Titans had joy going towards his flank. Brennan said the improvement in the left side attack as the season went on was due to the emergence of Brimson as a genuine threat as a ball runner. ""Ash demands the ball more than anybody and a lot of the responsibility was put on his shoulders this year but next season AJ will be better for the 12 months under his belt, we've got Tyrone Roberts back who has worked well with Ash in the past and Ryley Jacks is coming out of a good system at the Storm,"" Brennan said. ""They are all options that will take a bit of pressure off Ash and see us play more on both sides of the field."" The Titans conceded 97 tries for the season with 26.8% of those in the centre channel and 21% in the centre left channel. The centre right channel on the other hand was responsible for letting in 10 tries all year, just 10.3% of the total. ""We had a lot of chop and change on the left hand side in the halves but on the right side we had Ash Taylor and Kevin Proctor for a just about every game so we had a lot of stability on that right edge,"" Brennan said. For not the first time in his career captain Ryan James was the most penalised Titan in 2018, giving away 25 penalties for the year. He was given a run for his money by fellow prop Jarrod Wallace with 24. The problem for the Titans when it comes to penalties is that they have a lot of trouble defending the next set of six after conceding one. The Titans conceded 42 tries for the year in the set of six after giving away a penalty, the equal worst in the NRL with the Eels. ""If you aren't starving the opposition of the football eventually they are going to wear you down and score points so we have to be better with our discipline to not give away as many penalties, and when we do we need to have that mental toughness and resilience to defend it,"" Brennan said. The Titans made the third highest number of metres after an offload in the NRL in 2018 with 9.1m per offload, behind the Raiders (9.5m) and the Broncos (9.2m). Overall they finished 10th for the season in metres gained from offloads for the year with 1432.4m at 59.7m per game. Winger Phillip Sami was the best at making metres after receiving an offload with 178.1m at 16.2m per offload. The most metres were made by the Titans for the season following Jai Arrow offloads, with 293.5m. While the Titans had joy when they did offload, Brennan said making the most of that facet of play was a balancing act. ""We like to entertain and move the ball around but what hurt us was that we were one of the worst teams for completions in the NRL which is something we have to improve on,"" he said. ""We don't want to be a boring side but we have to find the happy medium because there is a difference between being a boring team and loses all the time as well. We have to be smarter with our offloads and making sure we do them at the right time."" The Titans' aspiration to be an attractive side to watch was also revealed by the statistic relating to shifting the ball (with passes that cover 30% or more across the field) where they were ranked second (on 23.8%) in the NRL. Titans goal kickers Ash Taylor and Michael Gordon landed 78.2% of their try conversion attempts, ahead of the NRL average of 73.6% and the top four average of 71.5%. Taylor missed two of his 17 conversion attempts. Gordon landed 14 of his 15 penalty goal attempts at an average of 93.3%, just ahead of the NRL average of 92.2%. Titans captain Ryan James topped the NRL with the most average decoy runs per game for the season with 8.7. James was also fourth on the Titans try scoring list for the season with six four-pointers, perhaps an indication that when he does get the ball close to the line the opposition is not expecting it. ""What that shows is the selfless player that Ryan James is. He is running the decoy for someone else who is getting the carry and all the glory,"" Brennan said. ""Coaches look at blokes that do the work off the ball and help their mate out and that is something that Dark (James) does so well and why he is our captain, because he does those selfless acts."" The Titans were reasonably effective with their decoy runs, making the ninth most in the NRL with 49.7 per game and the equal ninth most line breaks per game with 3.9. South Sydney topped both of those statistics with 61.8 decoys per game and 5.2 line breaks per match. When not in possession of the football, the Titans are ranked number one in the NRL for slowing the opposition's play-the-ball speed with an average of 3.56 seconds. ""That is something we work very hard on, within the rules, because if you are not slowing the opposition down they are going to make easy metres and eventually break your line,"" Brennan said.

Andrew,Davis,1029,http://www.dailylocal.com/general-news/20180605/wcu-student-held-for-trial-on-child-porn-charges,"PHILADELPHIA >> The West Chester University student who has been accused of possessing hundreds of images of child pornography had been arrested and charged with molesting two young boys he was babysitting just months before he began collecting the illegal material, according to court documents. Federal authorities on Tuesday asked a magistrate in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia to order Ryan Andrew Davis detained while awaiting trial on the charges of possession, receiving and transportation of child pornography based on his prior juvenile criminal history and his false statements to investigators. In a memo, a prosecutor said that even while he was under supervision for the molestation case, he was secretly compiling a stash of pornography through the internet. “The defendant is a danger to children in the community,” wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Rotello in a motion for pretrial detention filed Monday. ”There are no conditions that could assure the safety of the community if he is released. He was already an adjudicated sex offender at the time he committed these federal crimes … (and) his crimes clearly demonstrate the true danger he poses to children in the community.” Davis, 21, of Thornbury, Delaware County, was taken into custody last week by FBI agents investigating the allegations of child pornography possession against him. He has been held at the federal detention facility in Philadelphia since then. At the conclusion of a detention hearing Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas J. Rueter, Davis was ordered to be held in detention awaiting trial. His attorneys, Thomas Schindler and John Pavloff of Kennett Square, accompanied Davis at the proceeding, Afterwards, Schindler said Davis was given an opportunity to speak with his family before being taken back to the detention facility. Schindler declined comment on the specifics of the case, but said his legal team would begin the process of defending him. If convicted, Davis, 21, faces a maximum possible sentence of 60 years in a federal prison, including a five-year minimum mandatory prison term, five years of supervised probation, and $750,000 in fines. West Chester University officials have stated that they are aware of the indictment, and are in the process of determining what actions should be taken against Davis. According to an indictment in the case, in February 2016, March 2017, and August 2017, Davis had images of minors engaged in sexual activity and abuse on his laptop computer and smartphone. Some of those incidents took place while Davis, known by the screen name “Davis_rad,” was on West Chester’s campus. Other incidents occurred at Davis’s home at the time in Glen Mills, Delaware County. The images included those in which minors were seen being sexually assaulted or depicted in sexually explicit positions, the U.S. Attorney’s news release stated. According to Rotella’s motion, the case against Davis began in October 2016 when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children got a tip from Dropbox Inc., an online file hosting site, that a person with the username Andrew Davidson has uploaded 130 images of suspected child pornography into his account. Authorities were able to trace the account to Davis at his home in Glen Mills, Delaware County, and at WCU. A search warrant was executed at the Glen Mills property in August 2017. In an interview, Davis acknowledged setting up the Dropbox account in the false name — combining his middle name and that of his grandfather — so that he could store links containing child pornography. He said he had started using the Dropbox account during the time of his arrest for sexually assaulting the two boys he had been babysitting, ages 6 and 9 years old. Those charges, filed in Delaware County in October 2014 when he was 17, included accusations that he molested the children, showed the older boy pornographic images on his phone, forced them to perform oral sex, and raped the older boy. He was adjudicated delinquent on two charges of indecent assault, and placed on probation. No restrictions were placed on his use of the internet, Rotella wrote. Davis initially told detectives investigating the child pornography allegations that he had deleted the images from his devices because he knew they were illegal after his arrest. But a forensic examination of his Dropbox account showed that he began uploading the images in June 2014, seven months after his juvenile arrest. In addition, there was no evidence that he ever deleted the material, the motion states. He tried to assert that he had been storing the images so that he could continue an online relationship with another man, someone he referred to as “Mike.” But investigators were able to determine that he was involved in a number of internet groups involved with child pornography, including one called “World of Boys.” They could find no evidence of any online romantic relationship with “Mike”involving the exchange of pornography. When Dropbox reported the activity in his account, they shut it down. However, an examination of his iPhone showed that even after that, Davis continued to access child pornography, as recently as March 2017. Eventually, Davis told police that he continued to trade child pornographic images for at least a year up until August 2017, a year after he had been successfully discharged from his juvenile probation sentence in Delaware County. Ultimately more than 20,000 images and videos from the Dropbox account of graphic and sexually explicit images of infants, toddlers and prepubescent boys were recovered from his Dropbox account. His arrest was announced last Thursday by U.S. Attorney William McSwain. To contact staff writer Michael P. Rellahan call 610-696-1544.

Get the news Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about Joe Minicozzi discussed why investing in downtowns and density is a wise move for cities Monday at CivicCon A link has been sent to your friend's email address. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs CivicCon logo(Photo: CivicCon) During a ride through East Pensacola on Monday, consultant Joe Minicozzi pointed out Chu's Market, a little grocery store on the corner of East Jordan Street. The 90-year-old building is architecturally interesting — with red accents and large, rounded ornaments decorating the top — but it doesn't necessarily look like much of an economic asset to the city. And definitely not in comparison to an economic giant like Walmart. But with a twinge of amusement, Minicozzi noted that in an apples-to-apples comparison — taxable value per acre — the mom-and-pop grocery store was worth about as much as the Walmart on Creighton Road. Minicozzi said most people, because of unconscious biases, would never think that could be the case. He said that's simply because most people had never bothered to do the math. ""All the stuff I'm doing is just pointing out the information that's in plain sight,"" Minicozzi said. ""We're just not asking the right questions."" On Monday, Minicozzi visited Pensacola as part of CivicCon, a joint initiative between the News Journal and the Studer Community Institute designed to help spark civic conversations on ways we can use smart planning and civic engagement to make our area a better place to live, grow, work and invest. More: CivicCon Podcast: Where cities really get their money Minicozzi is the principal of Urban3, LLC, a North Carolina consulting firm that helps citizens and city officials understand how their land usage affects their economy. Discussing ""the Economics of Cities"" to a crowd at the Pensacola Little Theatre, Minicozzi said the wealth of most cities and counties is concentrated downtown. He said dense, multi-story building created more value and retained more value than flat developments built on the outskirts of town. He showed dozens of examples of mid-rise building across the country that held dozens, hundreds or even thousands of times the value as big box stores when compared on a per-acre basis. In a local example, the Walmart on Creighton Road was built in 2002, occupies 26.5 acres, has a taxable value of around $12.05 million and its owners paid $220,000 in ad valorem taxes in 2017, according to property appraiser records. The Thiesen Building at 40 Palafox Place is a five-story office building constructed in 1902. It occupies 0.23 acres, has an assessed tax value of $2.56 million and the owners paid $49,000 in ad valorem taxes in 2017. That equates to about $188,500 per acre, or close to 23 times what Walmart paid per acre. More: CivicCon: Minicozzi will explain where cities really get their money Minicozzi compared living in a city or county to being a shareholder in a corporation. Every piece of property is an investment in our portfolio that either builds or drains our collective wealth. So an investment like the Theisen Building isn't just a better return on investment now, ""It's been in our portfolio for 100 years bringing a high value of wealth, while Walmart's going to be gone in 20 years."" Minicozzi noted that residents living in the suburbs often bristled at the notion of their taxes being funneled into downtown, but noted that people living in city limits pay taxes to both the city and the county. They also pay more than people living in the suburbs. ""What's good for downtown is great for the city,"" Minicozzi said. ""It's phenomenal for the county."" He said when considering what was a good investment of public money and resources, it is important to take a hard look at what you're giving up and what you're getting back. He said a new business that brought in thousands of jobs might look great on the surface, but it was worth considering the costs of roads, pipes, fire hydrants and all the other things it would take to support it long term. Minicozzi added that it was also worth considering who those employees were going to be. Would they start small businesses of their own one day? Would they shop at local businesses? Each lunch at nearby restaurants? Would they help the area build wealth? If not, it might not be such a good investment. ""Put them on the same piece of paper,"" he said. ""Do the math.""

Almost 160 athletes participated in the 25th annual Onion Man Triathlon at Bennington Lake on Sunday, with a couple of Walla Wallans topping the male and female finishers. Michael Gordon, who considers Walla Walla his hometown despite currently living in Maine, Onion Man organizer Dan Elsom said, won the overall male division victory in 2:09.19. Gordon successfully defended his title after winning the Onion Man last year, as well. And Walla Walla’s Marcella Rietz topped the overall female division with a time of 2:23.50. Participants came from Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Maine as well as Washington, Elsom reported. “Unfortunately, our numbers were down by about 100 due to conflicts with other triathlons happening in Portland, Spokane and the Victoria area,” he said. Gordon’s victory was a come-from-behind win, as he edged 2016 Onion Man winner Matt Sheeks. “Michael had to work for the win,” Elsom said. “He came of the bike in fifth position, so he had some ground to make up up on the run.” He made it past Sheeks, who finished in 2:09.58, for the victory. Rietz held off 19-year-old Alexa Johnson, who was closing in on her during the run, Elsom said. Johnson finished second overall in 2:24.41. “The weather was great for the race, but it did get a little warm on the run,” Elsom said. Perhaps the biggest news on Sunday was Elsom and his wife, Paula, announced that after starting the Onion Man Triathlon 25 years ago, they are stepping down as the event’s organizers. “This event means a great deal to us and has been a big part of our lives, so it came with a heavy heart in making this decision,” Dan Elsom said. “The Onion Man Triathlon is a grassroots staple race not only in the Walla Walla Valley, but in the Pacific Northwest. “Our hope is that we can find someone with the passion and desire to continue it on for years to come.” For complete 2018 Onion Man Triathlon results, see website https://hub.enmotive.com/events/2018-onion-man-traithlon/results.

In reality, he was exchanging online messages and phone texts with undercover operatives from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI. Budi was arrested Saturday when he showed up at a college friend’s house to pick up the radioactive material, which was instead an inert substance substituted and shipped by the FBI, documents say. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The 26-year-old Budi is now being held in the Mecklenburg County Jail. The charge: Use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire. If convicted, Budi faces up to 10 years in prison. Budi, who attended N.C. State, does not appear to have a previous criminal record. But an affidavit by Christopher Nasca, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security, details a bizarre plot in which Budi allegedly twice tries to take his revenge on an unnamed Charlotte man who Budi says “has been making my life a living hell and extorting me for a year.” Excerpts from what the affidavit says are Budi’s online communications with the federal agents indicate that he tried to hire a hit man before and had already tried to poison his target on at least one other occasion. “I tried to poison him with something else, but it tasted bitter as soon as he took a swig at it he threw up,” Budi said, according the affidavit. Budi began shopping for an assassin in late April, using a website that serves as a market for illegal drugs, counterfeit goods and weapons, the affidavit states. Unknown to him, Budi began negotiating with an undercover Homeland Security agent stationed in New York. The two went back and forth on what it would take to have Budi’s enemy killed, according to the affidavit. In one online exchange, Budi offered to pay $4,000 for the hit, but questioned whether he could trust the agent to carry out the plot. “The previous person I hired didn’t do the job and left with my money,” Budi wrote, according to the affidavit, “so I am just making sure that I am not getting into the same hole again.” In subsequent conversations, Budi asked the Homeland Security agent to make the killing look like a robbery. Later he suggested that the killing be carried out so that it appeared his enemy had simply disappeared. “he is 30 years old. lives in apt in Charlotte, NC. goes only to dollar tree and gas station (doesn’t go anywhere). doesn’t know fighting skill,” Budi wrote, according to the affidavit. “basically make it look like robbery went wrong. don’t care what weapon you use, as long as you get it done.” During the same time period Bud was negotiating for a contract killer, he used the website to arrange a backup: a lethal dose of a radioactive substance that he intended to use against the same individual, the affidavit says. This time he was dealing with an undercover FBI employee. “do you sell ricin as well? basically I want to use it for you know ... how much is a lethal dosage?” Budi wrote on April 26, according to the affidavit. “how long would it take for a person to die if he/she ingest that? how much could I get for $500.” Two weeks ago, Budi texted the agent the Charlotte address of a friend of his from college who was cooperating with the FBI, the affidavit states. The inert substance arrived Thursday. On Friday, Budi met in Charlotte with his college friend before noon to pick up his package, the affidavit says. He was arrested shortly afterward.

Michael,Gordon,1028,https://www.lmtonline.com/news/article/Bernard-E-Trainor-Marine-lieutenant-general-12967346.php,"Harrison Smith, The Washington Post Bernard E. Trainor, a Marine Corps lieutenant general who served in two wars and then launched a second career as a journalist, covering the military for The New York Times and in three critically acclaimed books on America's wars in the Persian Gulf and Iraq, died June 2 at his home in Potomac Falls, Virginia. He was 89. The cause was cancer, said his wife, Peggy Trainor. Gen. Trainor led an infantry platoon in the Korean War, served two tours in Vietnam and was deputy chief of staff for plans, policies and operations at Marine Corps headquarters before retiring from the military in 1985. While retired three- or four-star generals sometimes make their way to television news, offering spur-of-the-moment analysis of the American military and conflicts around the globe, Trainor took the unconventional step of joining a print newspaper as a full-fledged correspondent. He had no previous journalism experience, but - with a reputation as an ""intellectual"" general whose fondness for cigars was matched by an interest in military scholarship - was invited to write a trial story for the Times. ""He wrote it up, handed it in to them, and the next thing he knew it was published with his name in the paper. He told me from then on he was kind of hooked,"" said Michael Gordon, a former chief military correspondent for the Times. Trainor wrote stories about the drug war in South America, a sunken Soviet submarine, the Army's increasing reliance on the reserves, Russian military exercises in East Germany and conflicts from Afghanistan to Chad to the Iran-Iraq War, where he reported from the front lines on battlefield tactics and wartime conditions. ""He had a real understanding of not just what war is like, but how military operations are conducted,"" Gordon said in a phone interview. ""Over the years, I personally embedded in six or seven wars. But I could never match his understanding of how the military works."" Trainor left the Times in 1990 to lead the National Security Program at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He continued to work in journalism, serving as a military analyst for ABC News and NBC News, and in 1995 co-wrote ""The Generals' War"" with Gordon. An incisive account of U.S. military leadership in the Persian Gulf War, the book ""essentially debunked the public perception that the 1991 Gulf War went smoothly from start to finish,"" Mackubin Thomas Owens, a former associate dean of the Naval War College, wrote in National Review. Drawing from classified documents and scores of interviews, the authors argued the war was an ""incomplete success,"" marked by failures from generals Norman Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""With the emphasis on a quick victory and speedy exit,"" they wrote, ""the generals supported the premature decision to bring the war to a close with surprisingly little planning for the termination or the possible reverberations within Iraq."" In ending the ground war after 100 hours, they concluded, the military leadership enabled the Republican Guard to survive, allowing Saddam Hussein to hold on to power and setting the stage for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Trainor and Gordon chronicled that war beginning with ""Cobra II"" (2006), named for the U.S. operation to depose Hussein and seize Baghdad. A damning account of failures of intelligence and imagination, the book was also an indictment of military leaders who failed to listen to their commanders in the field. ""The American war plan was never adjusted on high,"" the authors argued. ""Gen. Tommy Franks, who was the overall commander, never acknowledged the enemy he faced nor did he comprehend the nature of the war he was directing."" In ""The Endgame"" (2012), a sequel, Trainor and Gordon chronicled the years from late 2003 to 2011, when U.S. ground troops departed from Iraq. The 779-page book focused on the ""surge"" in troop levels that was said to have turned the tide of the war. ""As a military event,"" they wrote, it ""succeeded beyond any reasonable expectation in tamping down sectarian violence, breaking the back of al-Qaida in Iraq,"" and damaging the Mahdi Army formed by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. ""Without American forces helping to keep Iraq on the straight and narrow, the authors suggest, it is likely to slip back into tyranny or civil strife or both,"" Foreign Affairs editor Gideon Rose wrote in the New York Times. ""The argument is not original - you might even call it the dominant view among most established Iraq watchers - but rarely has it gotten so careful a treatment, buttressed with such impeccable sourcing."" Bernard Edmund Trainor was born in Manhattan on Sept. 2, 1928, and raised in the Bronx. His father was a fruit auctioneer on the city docks, and his mother was a homemaker. Mick, as he was known, had hoped to serve in the Navy during World War II, which ended the year before his high school graduation in 1946. ""The Navy didn't want him,"" his wife said in a phone interview, ""so he went next door and here was this squiggly Marine who said come on in."" Through the Holloway Plan, a newly created education program for the Navy and Marines, he graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1951 and was commissioned as an officer. He soon landed in Korea, where he later recalled triggering an enemy land mine that, had it not malfunctioned, would likely have killed him. In a 1996 op-ed for the Times, he expressed ambivalence toward mines, noting that they ""have both threatened and saved my life."" When his platoon installed mines to defend their position in Korea, he wrote, expressing opposition to a proposed ban on the devices, ""the mines saved us from being overrun."" Through an exchange program, Gen. Trainor trained in mountain and winter warfare with Britain's Royal Marines and commanded a company of British commandos in Malta. Beginning in 1965 he served with a covert warfare unit in Vietnam, according to his official Marine biography. He later returned to Vietnam to command the 1st Battalion of the 5th Marine Regiment and then the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. In 1978 he was named director of the Marine Corps Education Center at Quantico, Virginia. ""He started us down a path to where we are now with a full-fledged, accredited Marine Corps University,"" said Lt. Gen. Wallace ""Chip"" Gregson Jr., a former assistant secretary of defense. ""He was very much ahead of his time in trying to enhance the education experience across the board, even for mere junior officers."" Trainor later served on the board of groups including the World Affairs Council and the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation. In addition to his wife of 59 years, the former Peggy Hamilton of Potomac Falls, survivors include four children, Kathleen Trainor of Arlington, Virginia, Theresa Trainor of Shepherdstown, West Virginia, Claire Leimone of Santa Monica, California, and Saxon Trainor of Los Angeles; and five grandchildren. Trainor's military decorations included the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, two Legion of Merit honors and the Bronze Star. But those who knew him said his legacy in the military extended far beyond any individual honors. ""One of the reasons I came home from Vietnam, with basically my soul intact, was because not only did I learn how to call artillery and treat my men well, I was given a moral compass by Gen. Trainor,"" said sculptor Peter DeCamp Haines, who studied under Trainor at the University of Colorado in the early 1960s. Trainor, a major at the time, was an instructor in the school's ROTC program while pursuing a master's degree in history. ""We spent a lot of time on the Nuremberg trials, the message of which is, you can't say I was just following orders,"" Haines recalled. ""As an officer I was guided by that. I knew I had to do the right thing. There are North Vietnamese soldiers that are probably alive today because of my intervention,"" he said, referring to an incident in which he took the guns of enemy prisoners rather than shoot them. ""The Marine Corps issued me a flak jacket,"" he added. ""Mick Trainor had provided me with moral armor.""

Michael,Sylvester,1027,http://www.theforecaster.net/whos-on-the-primary-election-ballot-where-to-vote-in-portland/,"Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments PORTLAND — Ranked-choice voting, a $110.6 million school budget, and three contested Democratic Party primaries are on the June 12 ballot. So are the party primaries for governor, U.S. Senate, and the 1st Congressional District. New to the ballot process is ranked-choice voting for the gubernatorial party primaries. In a state referendum, voters will also be asked to keep the ranked-choice system or delay it until 2022. In the primary races in Cumberland County for district attorney and probate judge, ranked-choice voting will not be used. Jon Gale, Frayla Tarpinian and Seth Levy are vying for the Democratic nomination for Cumberland County DA, while Democrats Paul Aranson, Charles Kahill and Ruben Segal are seeking the judge of probate nomination. Randall Bates is the sole Republican candidate to replace District Attorney Stephanie Anderson, a Republican who is not seeking re-election after seven terms in office. Independent candidate Jonathan Sahrbeck will also be on the Nov. 6 general election ballot. No Republicans filed for the judge of probate primary. With the exception of House District 40 and Senate District 28, none of the primaries for the city’s delegation to Augusta are contested. In House District 40, covering the Bayside and Parkside neighborhoods, incumbent Rep. Rachel Talbot Ross is challenged by former Rep. Herb Adams. There is no GOP candidate. In House District 36, reaching to the northern and western city limits, former Mayor Michael Brennan is unopposed for the Democratic nomination to replace Rep. Denise Harlow. Republican Samuel Ledue is also unopposed. Harlow, an independent, is stepping aside due to state term limits. In House District 37, Rep. Richard Farnsworth, the Democratic incumbent, has no primary opposition. Jane Frey is the sole GOP candidate in the district extending south and west from Brighton Avenue. In House District 38, covering the city’s West End, incumbent Democratic Rep. Matthew Moonen has a clear path to his fourth term; he is unopposed in the primary and there is no Republican candidate. In House District 39, covering Munjoy Hill and the city’s Casco Bay Islands, incumbent Rep. Michael Sylvester, a Democrat, and Republican Peter Doyle are the sole primary candidates for their parties. Democratic incumbent Rep. Erik Jorgensen and Republican Dr. James Azzola are seeking their party nominations in House District 41, which covers Deering Center. In House District 42, covering East Deering, Rep. Benjamin Collings, the Democratic incumbent, and Republican Susan Abercrombie are unopposed in their party’s primaries. April Fournier’s name is on the Democratic ballot, but she withdrew from the race. Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap on May 29 said any votes for Fournier would be counted as blanks. The House District 43 seat, which represents northern and western Portland and a section of Falmouth, is open because Rep. Heather Sanborn is running for the state Senate. Democrat W. Edward Crockett and Republican Cathleen Nichols are seeking their party’s nominations without opposition. In state Senate District 27, Sen. Ben Chipman, a Democrat, is unopposed in the primary while seeking his second term. The GOP primary candidate is Joshua Kelton. Independent candidate Crystal Canney will be running in the Nov. 6 general election. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday, June 12. Polling places are District 1-1, East End Elementary School, 195 North St.; District 1-2, Merrill Auditorium Rehearsal Hall, 20 Myrtle St.; District 1-3, St. Christopher’s Church, 15 Central Ave., Peaks Island; District 2-1, Reiche Elementary School, 166 Brackett St.; District 2-2, Exposition Building, 239 Park Ave.; District 3-1, Woodfords Club, 179 Woodfords St.; District 3-2, Italian Heritage Center, 40 Westland Ave.; District 4-1, St. Pius Church, 492 Ocean Ave.; District 4-2, First Baptist Church, 360 Canco Road; District 5-1, Deering High School gymnasium, 370 Stevens Ave. (access via Leland Street entrance), and District 5-2, Grace Baptist Church gymnasium, 476 Summit St. To find the proper polling place, visit https://bit.ly/2se5SsH.

Michael,Sylvester,1027,https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/u20s-world-cup/mcnamara-hails-irish-u20s-effort-in-bruising-defeat-36973931.html,"Monday 19 November 2018 John Fallon in Narbonne June 4 2018 2:30 AM It won't be easy getting Ireland prepped for their final World Rugby U-20 Championships pool game against Georgia next Thursday, after two gruelling and bitterly disappointing games, but coach Noel McNamara has full confidence in his charges to deliver. It wouldn't have taken a lot for Ireland to be sitting on two wins rather than two losses, but against France last Wednesday night, and again yesterday, they were blitzed for scores when the opposition got periods of dominance. After a dreadful start which saw them fall 12-0 behind, Ireland recovered to trail by just two points at the break and when they hit the front five minutes after the restart, things looked good. South African centre Wandisile Simelane, who revelled when switched to the wing when they were hit with a spate of injuries, had other ideas and he ran in a second-half hat-trick to break Ireland's hearts. Battered It leaves Ireland battered and bruised after two demanding contests - needing to regroup to face Georgia next Thursday - knowing the best they can do now is a mid-tournament finish. And having come to France with justifiable hopes of being involved at the business end of the competition, they will be keen to avoid a relegation dogfight. McNamara, though, is confident they have the composure to digest these two defeats and get an upward turn in fortunes. ""Of course we are disappointed with a second defeat, but the priority now is to recover and prepare for Georgia,"" said McNamara. ""We are disappointed with the outcome, but it's hard to be disappointed with the boys' effort. They put in an absolutely monumental shift there against an enormous South African side. ""They are a great bunch of lads, they have worked really hard and teams of lesser character would have suffered heavy defeats in both those games."" Ireland made it hard on themselves from the outset, conceding a try inside less than a minute of the start when scrum-half Johnny Stewart had a clearance blocked by his opposite number Zak Burger. ""It was the worst possible start we could have had. We just didn't organise that exit. To get a block-down and concede seven points within 40 seconds is certainly not what you need against South Africa,"" said McNamara. ""We rediscovered our composure really well. We kept the ball really well and limited their opportunities. We were really unlucky at half-time not to go in ahead."" South Africa's super pack also got on top and Ireland were on the back foot for most of the opening quarter, and it was no surprise when they extended their lead through left winger Muller du Plessis on 20 minutes. Ireland didn't panic and a penalty from Conor Dean from 40 metres settled them and they took charge before the interval. The Irish pack became more effective and captain Caelan Doris peeled away from a scrum to score five minutes from the break. The Baby Boks lost replacement lock PJ Steenkamp to a yellow card and it seemed that Irish winger Tom Roche got over after a quickly tapped penalty, but the try was correctly ruled out by the TMO after it was spotted he dropped the ball in the tackle. That left it 12-10 to South Africa at the break and while they almost scored again inside a minute of the restart - Irish full-back Michael Sylvester got back to deny Tyrone Green - it was Ireland who took control. They looked set for victory when Doris put Sylvester through and a deft inside step from the Trinity player was enough to take him in under the posts. Dean's conversion made it 17-10 and it seemed that Ireland were poised to pull away. But it was South Africa who took over after that and centre Simelane, having switched to the wing, broke Ireland's hearts with a devastating display of finishing. He levelled the game at 17-17 on 52 minutes. The next score was always likely to be the clincher and it was Simelane who seized the moment. He completed the job when he wrapped up his hat-trick in the closing minutes.

The collection of Albert Stone's many years of work as a newspaper photographer in Rochester, including 14,000 glass plates, is in the care of the Rochester Museum and Science Center.(Photo: Annette Lein/file photo 2000)Buy Photo In 1936, a young woman in Rochester borrowed a pickup truck and, with her brother’s assistance, saved thousands of priceless images, a record of life here in the first three decades of the 20th century. Helen Stone Reinhard did this because she loved her late grandfather, because she valued his work as a photographer, because she wanted his career to have lasting impact. From 2017: Oldest aerial photos of Rochester displayed for only third time since 1919 Certainly, as suggested by her daughter, Nan Galbraith of Brighton, Stone Reinhard belongs in our list of Remarkable Rochesterians. Born in 1915, Stone Reinhard, who died in 2011 at the age of 96, was the granddaughter of Albert Stone, the first newspaper photographer in Rochester, starting with the Rochester Herald, and then for the Democrat and Chronicle. Her father, Daniel, was also a photographer for the Democrat and Chronicle. Helen Stone Reinhard’s childhood was not easy, as her mother was ill for several years. But she formed a bond with her grandfather, often visiting him at the offices of the Herald. Albert Stone was an energetic chronicler of life in Rochester, someone who always seemed to be in the right place at the right time. When presidents visited, when winter storms paralyzed the city, when women voted for the first time, Stone was there. Consequently, his glass plate negatives piled up, eventually numbering as many as 14,000. Lawyer's Co-op and City Hall in 1923 photo of Erie Canal where Broad Street now runs. (Photo: Stone Collection at Rochester Museum and Science Center) The Herald and the Democrat and Chronicle merged in 1926, becoming the Democrat and Chronicle, which Frank Gannett bought in 1928. Sometime after that, Gannett, or one of his representatives, told Stone that the area where he had been storing his glass plate negatives would have to be emptied for office space. What to do with the negatives? “Throw them out the windows and into the Genesee River,” Gannett is purported to have told Albert Stone. Rather than do that, Albert Stone removed the negatives from the building — a box at a time, presumably — and put them in the attic of his 19th Ward home. In the 1910s, Albert Stone took this photograph of Highland Park during the Lilac Festival. (Photo: Stone Collection at Rochester Museum and Science Center) Albert Stone died in 1934, and his son Daniel, Helen’s father, died in 1936. Soon after that, Helen, along with her brother, Robert, moved the negatives out of the attic. To do this, she tied them in bundles and lowered them to the ground and into a pickup truck. It was difficult work. “I started to get tired,” she told the Democrat and Chronicle in 2000. “The knots — I never was a Girl Scout — the knots that I tied, some of them came loose. And I can still remember how it hit the pit of my stomach when a pile of them would fall. Because that was the end. They broke.” While some of the negatives were lost, thousands survived, including film negatives taken by Daniel. They were placed in rented storage space, but eventually the cost of keeping them there got to Helen, who had a job as a secretary at the Eastman Kodak Co. before her marriage to Robert Reinhard in 1940. She first tried to give the negatives to the George Eastman House, but it didn't have sufficient room. Then, in the early 1940s, she asked officials at what is now the Rochester Museum and Science Center if they wanted the plates. They did, giving Stone Reinhard $500 in appreciation. In 1976, volunteers led by the museum’s Lea Kemp began to catalog all of the negatives. It was tedious work, as, using microfilm of the newspapers, they matched the images on the plates with the published pictures. Then dates and captions had to be transcribed. Most often, there is additional contextual information. Golfer Walter Hagen instructs a very young friend. (Photo: Stone Collection at Rochester Museum and Science Center) Later, money from a federal grant and other sources was used to digitize the images, which are available online through the museum’s website (libcat.rmsc.org). They have proven to be a treasure trove for historians, an invaluable record of life here. Helen Stone Reinhard and her husband, who had three daughters, lived in Irondequoit and California before settling in Victor, Ontario County. Her role in saving the Stone images became better known as time went on, and she would often attend, and speak at, presentations Kemp gave on the preserved images. Stone Reinhard died in February 2011 at age 96. Rochester Mayor Thomas Richards declared Oct. 19, 2011, Helen Stone Reinhard and Lea Kemp Day. Kemp, who was earlier placed on the list of Remarkable Rochesterians, died Sept. 16, 2016, at age 86. ""13,000 fans see team take first place.

Stone, the first professional newspaper photographer in the city. Her father, Daniel Stone, also a photographer, working alongside Albert Stone. The elder Stone had saved thousands of his glass plate negatives from destruction in the late 1920s, moving them to his attic. His later images, as well as some taken by his son, were added to the collection. In 1936, Stone Reinhard, with her brother’s help, moved all of the images into storage. A few years later, she transferred them to what is now the Rochester Museum and Science Center. They have since been cataloged and digitized and are available to the public.

Andrew,Davis,1024,http://www.classical-music.com/article/best-recordings-elgars-enigma-variations,"Classical-Music.com The official website of BBC Music Magazine Are you a fan of Elgar's Enigma Variations? Here are some of our favourite recordings The first performance of Enigma Variations, conducted by Hans Richter on 19 June 1899 in London, made Elgar’s name virtually overnight as England’s finest composer since Purcell. He had come up with a unique creation – a sequence of musical portraits of his wife, his friends and himself, all based on a melody representing, as he later said, ‘the loneliness of the artist’. Although the subtitle ‘Enigma’ was only added before the premiere by Elgar’s publisher, the composer suggested that ‘over the whole set another and larger “theme” goes, but is not played’. Endless musicological detective work has failed to turn up a counter-melody that ‘fits’. This must be because there isn’t one: as the Elgar authority Michael Kennedy suggested, the composer was thinking of the work’s broader, abstract theme – of friendship and love, set amid the social scene in and around his Worcestershire home. Hallé Orchestra/Mark Elder (2002) Hallé CD HLL 7501 Besides coming through the ranks as a professional violinist, Elgar played several other instruments fluently, and his knowledge here engendered a work so securely written for every section of the orchestra that it’s almost impossible for a performance to come off badly. Then again, achieving an exceptional one isn’t straightforward either: the range of musical portraits is so varied, with orchestral imagination to match, that finding a near-ideal touch with each one can be elusive. Sir Mark Elder’s interpretation with the Hallé, recorded live in Manchester in 2002, is as good as you can get. The orchestra’s way with the Enigma theme sets a benchmark, with the strings beautifully shaded and balanced. The variation sequence that follows offers one delight after another – the poise of the opening woodwind in ‘R.B.T.’ (Richard Townshend); a hushed beginning to ‘Nimrod’ (Alfred Jaeger, Elgar’s publisher), making the music’s growth towards its exalted peroration all the more memorable; and a wonderfully poignant contribution from the cellos in ‘B.G.N.’ (Basil Nevinson, Elgar’s cellist colleague). The emotional charge that builds through all this is genuinely moving. There’s a separately recorded bonus of Elgar’s original finale to the work, whose abrupt final bars Jaeger and Richter persuaded him to expand after that history-making first performance. London Symphony Orchestra/Adrian Boult (1970) Warner Classics 764 0152 Sir Adrian Boult knew Elgar personally, which gives special authority to his recordings of Enigma. The recorded sound of his last one, made in 1970, impressively conveys the focused lustre that he was able to conjure from the orchestras he conducted. No other recording combines unportentous grandeur with sensibility as this one does. Among countless memorable touches are the searching melancholy of the Enigma theme itself, the beautifully balanced violin-and-cello counterpoint to the woodwind melody in ‘C.A.E.’ (Alice, Elgar’s wife), the almost keening intensity of ‘Nimrod’, and Boult’s pacing of the ‘E.D.U.’ finale, with its carefully judged holding-back of the ‘C.A.E.’ theme’s recall before the rousing conclusion. That said, it’s possible to feel that the total effect sounds too abstractly symphonic, perhaps missing the affection of Elgar’s musical portrait-painting. BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra/Martyn Brabbins (2016) Hyperion CDA68101 While Elgar’s idiom is quintessentially English in tone, it was based on deep technical understanding of Austro-German orchestral tradition. The connection is strikingly clear in the response drawn by Martyn Brabbins from the BBC Scottish Symphony – the Bruckner-suggesting unison horns in ‘C.A.E’, or the earnestness of the massed strings in ‘R.P.A.’ (Richard Arnold). There are imaginative touches too, as in ‘Dorabella’ (Dora Penny), whose solo viola and twittering woodwind (does she take herself just a bit seriously?) are offset by the central section’s flickering strings (maybe she doesn’t). And a haunting sense of space is conjured in the ‘Romanza’ variation – almost certainly immortalising Helen Weaver, Elgar’s former fiancée, who had emigrated to New Zealand. Royal Albert Hall Orchestra/Edward Elgar (1926) Naxos Historical Great Conductors 8.111022 Listeners reluctant to approach a historical document dating from 1926 can be reassured: the remastered recorded sound is excellent, with decent tonal and dynamic range and miminal hiss. While the subtler orchestral effects can’t always be made out, the energy and directness of Elgar’s conducting come across in fine style. The strings’ portamento sliding between notes, then a standard device, is now less familiar, but Elgar also deploys less rubato tempo-bending than most of today’s conductors. Special moments include the whimsical string lines in ‘W.N.’ (Winifred Norbury) and a forthright choice of tempo for ‘Nimrod’. Elgar’s way with his concluding self-portrait, ‘E.D.U.’, must be the most viscerally exciting ever recorded. Philharmonia Orchestra/Sir Andrew Davis (2009) Signum Classics SIGCD168 ‘Avoid’ is perhaps harsh: there are no perversities in Sir Andrew Davis’s 2009 interpretation, and the Philharmonia’s contribution has all the rich-toned professionalism one would expect. Yet this is one of those live recordings where, for whatever reason, the result takes too long to lift itself beyond a sense of high-class routine. In Basil Nevinson’s variation (No. 12 out of 14), the music’s heart at last truly seems to beat. That’s leaving it late.

His Los Angeles Dodgers, which came oh so close to giving him his first World Series title in November, sputtered out of the gate with a record even worse than that of their hated rivals in San Francisco. (Things have not gotten much better since.) The SEC’s probe into Guggenheim Partners’ relationship with Bob Diamond grew into a look at Walter’s home-buying practices, including an $85 million pad in Malibu he personally co-owns and a house in Pacific Palisades that his lady friend—who is not his special lady, according to Guggenheim—has been living in. And to top it all off, said lady friend, on-leave Guggenheim global head of internal distribution Alexandra Court, has left to do her own thing. Ms. Court, who went on sabbatical in June 2017, departed in April, according to her LinkedIn profile…. Ms. Court’s personal website said she is “now focused on her own entrepreneurial and social impact interests, as well as advising businesses on growth strategies and implementation plans….” She also had a personal relationship with Guggenheim Chief Executive Mark Walter, according to people familiar with the matter. Guggenheim’s board reviewed the relationship and took no action, these people said. “If there were a relationship, the prospect of a nonbusiness relationship would have been fully and promptly disclosed to the appropriate parties at Guggenheim in accordance with established processes and procedures, which then would have been fully implemented, to avoid improper influence or favor,” a Guggenheim spokesman said last year.

Bob,Diamond,1023,https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/markets/a-barclays-standard-chartered-merger-has-no-strategic-rationale,"Barclays would be delighted to get access to Standard Chartered's $56 billion in Asian deposits.(AFP) Is a major banking deal brewing in the City of London? The grapevine contends that Barclays chairman John McFarlane is under pressure from activist shareholder Edward Bramson's Sherborne fund, which has accumulated a 5.4 per cent stake in the 3-century old former Quaker High Street bank that Bob Diamond morphed in the early 2000s into Britain's only bulge bracket global investment bank Bramson wants Barclays to shrink or even sell Barclays Capital, its investment banking crown jewel, to release $40 billion in dedicated capital to the unit. This is anathema to Jes Staley, the bank's American, ex J.P. Morgan Master of the Universe CEO. McFarlane and Staley would prefer to blunt Bramson's activist thrust by making a takeover bid for Standard Chartered, a bank that never recovered from disastrous lending spree to Indian steel oligarchs and colossal mismanagement by its senior executives in London, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Gulf under former CEO Peter Sands, ultimately ousted by pressure from Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund that is its largest shareholder. StanChart has not really recovered since Sands's ouster. Revenues have fallen 20 per cent since 2014 while overhead is still bloated. CEO Bill Winters, another J.P. Morgan alumnus has been unable to boost the bank's return on equity above its cost of capital or deliver a credible growth strategy. Barclays would be delighted to get access to StanChart's $56 billion in Asian deposits and its franchises in some of the hottest banking markets in the Pacific Rim. Yet a $90 billion merger would necessitate a stock swap that might not be palatable to Temasek or other StanChart shareholders since Barclays shares trade well below tangible book value due to its pathetic ROE, multiple legal swords of Damocles and history of boardroom palace coups and CEO regicide. StanChart's culture is unique in UK finance and there is no real regional overlap with Barclays, now that it has decided to exit Africa and the Middle East to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays shareholders would be hugely diluted by an offer for StanChart at a time when they desperately want management to boost dividends and profits, not engage in self-serving deal making. It is also doubtful if a takeover bid from a bank that faces US Justice Department and FCA charges over the 2008 emergency capital raising scheme, whose four former top executives face criminal charges in the case, whose celebrity CEO Bob Diamond was grilled in the House of Commons and fired by the Bank of England's diktat after the LIBOR manipulation scandal would send Stan Chart shareholders into paroxysms of delight. Zero plus zero still equals zero. A failed bid for StanChart would mean the axe for McFarlane, Staley and possibly the corporate and investment banking franchises. This is an irony since Staley survived the whistleblower scandal with a mere £640,000 fine from regulators and settled the US mortgage misselling scandal for $2 billion, not the feared $5 billion with Justice. The Crown Court also dropped the Serious Fraud Office (SFO's) criminal case against Barclays, removing a threat to its UK banking license, though Justice, SEC and FCA probes into the 2008 fund raising in the Gulf remain live. None of this makes me sanguine about the odds of a Barclays cash and share bid for Standard Chartered Bank. Size matters in global banking, yet a ""Godzilla strategy"" alone will not solve the myriad problems faced by Britain's two historic but troubled money center banks. I do not believe these banks will merge in the proximate future. There is no evidence that either bank has engaged advisors, lawyers, white knights or political allies or creditor syndicates for an imminent deal. Yet Edward Bramson's Sherborne can well goose Barclays share price once it unveils its restructuring (shrinking?) blueprint. Standard Chartered remains they juiciest takeover bait in international banking, a Cinderella waiting from a kiss from a fairy tale prince names Jamie, not Jes. A blowout May payroll number and the formation of a new Italian government in Rome means the bear market in US Treasury debt resumes with a vengeance. A 3.8 per cent unemployment rate and 0.3 per cent average hourly earnings means the Powell Fed has reached the limits of its dual mandate. This means a certain interest rate hike at the June FOMC, the September FOMC and possibly even the December FOMC.

Michael,Gordon,1022,https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/String-Quartet-ETHEL-Celebrates-20th-Anniversary-Season-2018060499,"String quartet ETHEL, known for its enlivened playing and consistently groundbreaking redefinition of concert music, announces their landmark 20th anniversary season. Described as ""an adventurous quartet with a rock band's zest"" by The New York Times and deemed ""a genre unto itself"" by the Village Voice, ETHEL continues to set the standard for contemporary concert music. Celebrations begin with a June 20th benefit gala hosted by New Sound's John Schaefer, honoring ETHEL as well as fellow new music champions: Bang on a Can founders Michael Gordon, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe. ETHEL's 2018-19 season offers the New York premiere of Circus: Wandering City at the 2018 BAM Next Wave Festival, along with continued touring of the group's signature works: The River and Documerica. (Please scroll below for more details and complete 2018-19 schedule of events.) The quartet creates and tours rich, often multimedia, productions including the evening-length ETHEL's Documerica, inspired by the tens of thousands of images shot as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's decade-long Project Documerica, launched in 1971; The River, a collaboration with Taos Pueblo flutist Robert Mirabal; and Circus: Wandering City, which explores the phenomenon of circus through the eyes and insights of people who have created its special thrills and illusions. Directed by Grant McDonald, and co-commissioned by BAM and The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art (The Ringling) in Sarasota, Florida, Circus: Wandering City is an immersive work, combining projections of stunning images, film, and interviews from the Museum's archives, the words of circus performers past and present, and original music composed and performed live by ETHEL. Circus: Wandering City made its world premiere in January 2018-the 250th anniversary of the modern circus-at The Ringling. The work makes its New York premiere in November 2018 at the BAM Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn, NY. ETHEL Through the Years In 1998, violinists Mary Rowell and Todd Reynolds, violist Ralph Farris and cellist Dorothy Lawson came together for a recording session. The collaboration of these extraordinarily skilled, passionate musicians sparked a surge of creative energy and potential, at a time when the classical music field was conservative and the economic climate was difficult. ""When we formed ETHEL 20 years ago, our renegade style of music was the first of its kind. We were anomalies,"" explains Dorothy Lawson, ETHEL's co-artistic director and cellist. ETHEL quickly earned a reputation as one of America's most adventurous string quartets - heirs to the likes of the Kronos Quartet and Soldier String Quartet, and part of a generation of young artists blending uptown, conservatory musicianship with downtown genre-crossing - by playing with the intensity and accoutrements of a rock band. Two decades into a singular career, ETHEL has in turn become seminal, a path-breaker for countless new genre-spanning ensembles and a prolific commissioner of new music. ""We witnessed first-hand the growth of the new music scene. We could not be happier to have played a role in the development and sustainability of this music, and will continue to forge new approaches and practices that make meaningful contributions to the field,"" states Lawson. Since its inception, ETHEL has released six feature recordings (one of them nominated for a Native American Music Award), guested on 35+ albums, won a GRAMMY with jazz legend Kurt Elling, performed in 14 countries, 45 states, and 250 cities, served as artists in residence with four revered institutions (Grand Canyon Music Festival/Native American Composers Apprenticeship Program, Park Avenue Armory, Denison University, and the Balcony Bar of The Metropolitan Museum of Art ), appeared twice as TED speakers, and premiered over 190 works (>77% commissioned) by 100+ different ground-breaking 21st Century composers (>25% female). The quartet regularly performs works by all of the members of the ensemble, alongside music by Philip Glass, Julia Wolfe, Phil Kline, David Lang, Dan Friel, John Zorn, Missy Mazzoli, Anna Clyne, Steve Reich, Don Byron, Aleksandra Vrebalov, Marcelo Zarvos, Pamela Z, Evan Ziporyn and Terry Riley. The New York Times has described the group as ""indefatigable and eclectic,"" and Pitchfork has called them ""infectiously visceral."" According to the New Orleans Advocate, ""ETHEL has been exploding the boundaries of conventional quartet music by combining its classical training with rock 'n' roll enthusiasm and musical traditions from around the world."" Named the ""avatar of 'post-classical' music (The New Yorker),"" ETHEL has earned its place as a lead voice in the pantheon of the concert music world.

Michael,Sylvester,1020,https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2018/0603/967972-ireland-u20s-semi-final-hopes-dashed-by-south-africa/,"1 2 Maybe later RTÉ Sport reporter South Africa 30 Ireland 17 Ireland’s hopes of making it to the semi-finals of the World Rugby U-20 Championship were dashed in Narbonne when they went down to South Africa. It’s a second defeat in-a-row for Noel McNamara’s men who will now have to regroup for their final pool game against Georgia next Thursday but they will be playing for a mid-tournament finish from here. Ireland recovered from a disastrous start to trail by just two points at the interval, with South Africa leading 12-10. Ireland could hardly have endured a worse start than scrum-half Jonny Stewart having a clearance blocked down by his opposite number Zak Burger to score in less than a minute. Out-half Damian Willemse added the conversion to give the Baby Boks a perfect start and when they won penalties in the first two scrums it looked ominous for Ireland. Both sides lost five-metre lineouts after penalties to the corners but South Africa, with their superior scrum telling, increased their lead at the end of the opening quarter when winger Muller de Plessis was put through for a fine score. Ireland, similar to their poor start against France in midweek, did not panic and Conor Dean settled them with a penalty from 40 metres after 23 minutes. The Irish set-piece also started making inroads and after a few promising attacks were repelled, they got the breakthrough when captain Caelan Doris peeled away from a scrum to score five minutes from the break. Dean landed the difficult conversion to cut the gap to 12-10 and it seemed Ireland had hit the front when right winger Tom Roche scored but the TMO spotted he had dropped the ball in a tackle before ground it. Ireland had an extra man for the opening ten minutes of the second-half after replacement lock PJ Steenkamp was binned. Ireland made the extra man count when Doris put Michael Sylvester through five minutes after the restart and the full-back stepped inside neatly to score under the posts, with Dean’s conversion pushing Ireland 17-12 in front. But South Africa hit back and tied the game when centre Wandisile got in for a try and he repeated the dose towards the end of the third quarter to push South Africa 22-17 in front. Full-back Gianni Lombard took over the kicking duties when Willemse went off injured and he put them eight points clear eleven minutes from time with a penalty in front of the posts. Wandisile completed his hat-trick three minutes from time to seal Ireland’s fate.

James,Crook,1016,http://theinscribermag.com/diet-7-signs-you-might-not-be-getting-all-the-nutrients-you-need/,"Your body is blessed with its own fighting mechanism, but it requires additional nutrients for growth and to improve physiological function. The vitamins and minerals that our body craves are known as micronutrients and since these are not naturally produced in the body, you have to take them through your diet. You may face a nutritional deficiency if you’re not eating the right foods or your body fails to absorb the nutrients it requires. Nutritional deficiency can lead to a variety of diseases and health problems, such as; dry skin, anemia, digestion problems, weak bones, stunted growth, etc. The recommended daily amount (of nutrients) you require depends on your age. There are apps that help keep track of the calories and nutrients you consume in a day. However, sometimes no matter how certain you are about your food, it is possible to have a deficiency. Here are some signs that your body is deficient in some basic nutrients. 1. Fatigue Fatigue and exhaustion are classic signs of iron deficiency, which can further lead to anemia, categorized by low levels of red blood cells. One major symptom of anemia is pale skin and excessive tiredness. Other symptoms may include depression, increased heart rate, and thyroid problems. Feeling tired all the time and not being able to perform daily routine tasks is a sign you should consult your doctor and get your nutrients check. Your physician may prescribe pills to cure anemia. According to World Health Organization (W.H.O), 30 percent of the world population is anemic and is not aware of it either. 2. Split Ends and Dry Hair One easy way to detect nutrient deficiency is to have a close look at your hair. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if every day was a good hair day? Vitamin C and B vitamins get your hair looking shiny and healthy and damage and coarse hair serve as an identification for nutritional deficiency. When a teen or middle-aged person’s hair becomes brittle and dry, it’s usually a sign that their diet is lacking the basic nutrients suggests Kathleen Niedert, a clinical nutritionist from Iowa. Hair loss is common as you age but losing hair at an early age signals deficiency of proteins, fatty acids, and some important nutrients. If your doctor diagnoses the problem, ask him to prescribe nutrients-rich supplements for hair growth and repair. 3. Brittle NailsJust like hair, brittle or weak nails are also a prominent sign of a nutrient deficiency. Koilonychia, a condition in which nails turn from the edges of the root causing pain and discomfort, is an indicator of iron deficiency, specifically, anemia. To overcome the iron deficiency, consume foods like liver, clams, prawns, oysters, seafood and other iron-rich foods. 4. Oral Health Issues Spots inside the mouth, cracking of the sides and inflammation indicate a deficiency of riboflavin (B2) or iron in the body. This condition is known as angular cheilitis and is characterized by a pale and bitter tasting swollen tongue. Oral health issues can be linked to low levels of zinc, iron and vitamin B. Consult your physician as zinc deficiency can cause cystic acne and other skin related problems. 5. Diarrhea: Diarrhea could have many reasons. Malabsorption, a condition in which your body cannot absorb the useful nutrients is one major reason. Malabsorption occurs due to infection, surgery, extreme use of alcohol, drugs and digestive disorders. That’s right. Long-term use of prescription drugs can interfere with the body’s ability to absorb common nutrients. Chronic diarrhea if not treated can lead to death, since, your body is being deprived of the nutrients and water it needs. 6. Mood Swings: Sudden mood swings and feeling irritated can be the signs of some serious illness like depression, anxiety and low self-esteem caused by some hormonal Imbalance or nutrients deficiency. Frequent forgetfulness is also a sign your body is not getting the strength it requires. It’s important to consult a psychologist if you’re suffering from depression or anxiety. But if you feel the issue is more than that then talk to your doctor and get an appointment to get your nutrients level checked. What may look like a symptom of stress could actually be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. 7. Lack of Appetite: As we get older, we lose our appetite, our tongue loses the sense of taste and we no longer crave rich and delicious food. Well, adults require fewer calories, and constant medication can make a person cranky and uninterested in all the good things life has to offer. Nancy Wellman, a well-known nutritionist, suggests, chronic lack of appetite can be a serious nutritional deficiency. If you skip meals for no reason and not feeling hungry at all, you need to meet a doctor who can help you eat the right food and get the right nutrients according to your age. Normally physicians ask to run a blood test, which can show what nutrients your body is lacking. A nutritionist can also create a diet plan for you, based on the food you take and what you should consume more. But you need to consult a doctor as soon as possible before a simple deficiency turns into something serious. If not treated at an early age, nutritional deficiency can further lead to serious problems like; frequent backaches, dizziness, blurred vision, fainting, muscle pain, and high fever. Some nutrient deficiencies that are pretty common include; vitamin D deficiency, iron deficiency, calcium deficiency, cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency, folate deficiency, niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency, thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, vitamin A deficiency and zinc deficiency. Nutrients can make a big impact on our health. Apart from getting enough nutrients through food, it is also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and ensure you’re exercising daily and eating clean. If you have food allergies, consult a nutritionist and follow a strict diet plan. Diet plans are not just created to reduce weight but to keep you healthy. Most nutritionists now have incorporated telemedicine into their practice and you can contact them using your laptop or smartphone.

Andrew,Davis,1015,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/06/candidate_removed_from_ballot.html,"By Malachi Barrett mbarret1@mlive.com KALAMAZOO, MI -- Paul Clements plans to challenge a Board of State Canvassers decision to remove him from the August primary for not having enough valid signatures to appear on the ballot. Friday, the Board of State Canvassers unanimously voted to accept a bureau of elections recommendation concluding Clements was short nine signatures. The Western Michigan University professor was the Democratic challenger to U.S. Rep. Fred Upton for the 6th District congressional seat in 2014 and 2016. After consulting with an attorney, Clements told MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette Saturday that he plans to challenge the decision in U.S. District Court in Grand Rapids. The state found that too many signators checked the wrong box indicating where they are registered to vote. This occurred in cities and townships that share a name. Clements had 991 of the required 1,000 valid signatures from registered voters. If signators would have left the box blank, their signature would have been counted. ""That shouldn't invalidate the signature,"" Clements said. ""If the ones where there was a mistake in city and township were accepted, then I would be on the ballot ... That's just not respecting voter's rights."" There are six pairs of jurisdictions that share a name in the 6th District, which includes all of Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, and Van Buren, counties, and includes most of Allegan county. ""There is a voters' rights issue here, and I would be wrong to let it lie,"" Clements said. ""Because of this, and to seek a more just system for allowing voters to express their wish to have a candidate named on the ballot, I have decided to seek legal advice."" Signing a petition shouldn't be a geography test, he said. ""It's not uncommon to be unsure if your voting registration is in the city or township,"" Clements said. ""But when you sign a ballot petition, if you check the wrong box, today your signature doesn't count."" Clements attended the Friday meeting in Lansing, but unsuccessfully argued against the report. He said some board members considered accepting his petitions, but they ultimately decided against it. After the meeting, Clements said the board decision ""override(s) the will of the petition signators due to a technicality."" He said he regrets some ""carelessness"" in reviewing his petitions. Of the 1,346 signatures filed by Clements, the Secretary of State originally found 1,148 were valid. A challenge to petitions turned in by Clements resulted in another 157 invalidated. Democrat Eponine Garrod was also removed from the ballot Friday, but has not announced plans to challenge the decision. She submitted 1,019 signatures, of which 974 were valid. The Secretary of State found 45 signatures were invalid, including 35 for having a date error. Without Clements and Garrod, there are four candidates remain in the Democratic primary -- George Franklin, David Benec, Rich Eichholz and Matt Longjohn. Upton is unopposed in the GOP primary. The challenge to petitions turned in by Clements was filed by Andrew Davis, a failed challenger to Upton in 1992. Davis also serves on the executive committee for the Democratic Party in the 6th District.

Shown in this file photo, Wild Things pitcher Scott Dunn pitches during a game in 2014. Former Washington Wild Things pitcher Scott Dunn has been selected to the Frontier League Hall of Fame Class for 2018. Dunn pitched five seasons in the league, including one in Washington, and will be inducted as part of a class that includes five players, a significant moment and a special contributor. Dunn pitched four seasons in Traverse City before finishing his Frontier League career with the Wild Things in 2014. The induction ceremonies will be held July 11 during All-Star Game week in O'Fallon, Mo. Dunn will be the third former Wild Things player to be in the league's Hall of Fame, joining pitcher Aaron Ledbetter and outfielder Chris Sidick. ""Scott was the backbone of a special 2014 season as a Wild Thing. Though he spent only one season in Washington, it was full of memories for him and his family,"" said Wild Things vice president and general manager Steven Zavacky. ""We appreciate all he gave to our organization and are happy to celebrate him as a Frontier League Hall of Famer."" A Clinton, native and 2005 graduate of South Side Beaver High School, Dunn played at Marietta College and Slippery Rock University before entering professional baseball. He was drafted in the second round of the 2010 Frontier League Draft by the Traverse City Beach Bums, whom he played for from 2010-2013 (four seasons). He was then traded to Washington prior to the 2014 season. In his five seasons in the Frontier League, Dunn amassed 445.1 innings and sported a career earned run average of 2.83. His 38 wins ranks second in league history behind Ledbetter. Dunn's career record was 38-15 and he also had 10 career saves. He struck out 307 batters. His best season came as a member of the Beach Bums in 2013, as he was 15-1 with a 2.61 ERA. That season, Dunn started the Frontier League All-Star Game for the East Division was the Brian Tollberg Award Winner (Pitcher of the Year). With Washington, Dunn had an 8-5 record and 3.28 ERA, helping the Wild Things to the playoffs for the first time since 2007. Current Wild Things manager Gregg Langbehn, who was the manager in Traverse City during Dunn's tenure there, said he is not surprised Dunn is being honored as part of this year's class. ""Scott was about as intense as I've ever had for a pitcher. He had the cliche bulldog mentality and he came in as more of a thrower but learned how to pitch,"" said Langbehn. ""He deserves [this honor]. He was a great guy to have around. He always showed up, did his work, was always on time and never complained, and he was about as reliable a pitcher as you could have."" Joining Dunn in this year’s Hall of Fame class are former Florence pitcher Andy Clark, Lake Erie infielder Andrew Davis, Evansville pitcher Eric Massingham and Zanesville Greys pitcher Terry Pearson, along with former Richmond Roosters owner Duke Ward and a Significant Moment – Baseball’s Best Burger.

Paul Clements Eponine Garrod Paul Clements Eponine Garrod LANSING — The number of Democratic candidates who are in the hunt for the 6th District Congressional seat shrunk by two Friday. The state’s Board of Canvassers determined Paul Clements and Eponine Garrod will be left off the Aug. 7 primary ballot after the Michigan Secretary of State’s office stated the candidates lacked enough valid signatures from registered voters. Clements and Garrod, who were part of a loaded primary to face 16-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, were present for the Friday hearing. The two candidates were found to be less than 30 petition signatures short of the 1,000 required to qualify for the primary ballot. Clements, a Western Michigan University professor and two-time Democratic challenger to Upton, said the decision was vexing because too many signees living in jurisdictions that share a name checked the wrong box indicating where they are registered to vote. If they had left the box blank, their signature would have been counted. It was a point of discussion at the Friday hearing, Clements said. The Secretary of State’s initial review showed that Garrod submitted 974 valid signatures. Clements stood to pass the state’s initial review, but a challenge revealed he had only 991 valid signatures. Garrod didn’t have a lot of breathing room, having submitted 1,019 signatures. Forty-five signatures were later deemed invalid. Clements filed 1,346 and lost 198 of the signatures from the original review. However, when a challenge petition was filed against Clements, another 157 signatures were rejected. The final review left Clements just nine signatures short of the minimum. Andrew Davis, a supporter of Democratic opponent Matt Longjohn, filed the challenge to Clements’ petitions. Like Clements, Davis was a former challenger who lost to Upton in 1992. There will be four left in the House race for the nomination, which includes George Franklin, Longjohn, David Benac and Rich Eichholz. Clements previously said he would not run as a write-in candidate. Garrod, who was running for the first time, said in a news release that she would cease her campaign and accept the board’s decision. “Democracy ought to be in the hands of the people rather than in the hands of four appointed individuals,” Garrod’s statement read. “While I am no longer able to pursue this seat at this time, I will most certainly be around and involved in advancing progressive causes until the next door opens.” The congressional race has drawn a lot of attention for the number of candidates that have filed. It marks the first time since 1984 that more than one Democrat has sought the Southwest Michigan seat. Upton, R-St. Joseph, hasn’t relinquished his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in more than 30 years. Upton is also running unopposed on the Republican ticket. The district the four remaining Democrats are fighting for includes Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, St. Joseph and Van Buren counties – and most of Allegan County.

Andrew,Davis,1012,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/06/clements_garrod_removed_from_6_1.html,"By Malachi Barrett mbarret1@mlive.com LANSING, MI -- Two Democratic candidates for the 6th District Congressional seat will not be on the Aug. 7 primary ballot. Friday, the Board of State Canvassers voted in Lansing to accept a bureau of elections recommendation concluding Paul Clements and Eponine Garrod lack enough valid signatures from registered voters. Garrod and Clements attended the Friday meeting, but unsuccessfully argued against the report. Clements said some on the board considered accepting his petitions, but ultimately decided against it. Clements was the Democratic candidate to challenge U.S. Rep. Fred Upton for the 6th District congressional seat in 2014 and 2016. He fell nine signatures short of the 1,000 required. The Western Michigan University professor said it was particularly frustrating because too many signators living in jurisdictions with cities and townships that share a name checked the wrong box indicating where they are registered to vote. If they would have left the box blank, their signature would have been counted. It was a point of discussion among the board Friday, Clements said. Clements said it ""override(s) the will of the petition signators due to a technicality."" He said he regrets some ""carelessness"" in reviewing his petitions. ""The fundamental thing here that is if someone has signed to get you on the ballot and they have given where they live, that should be acceptable,"" Clements said. ""That's what they are overriding and I am very disappointing in that. This could occur in the following jurisdictions: Of the 1,346 signatures filed by Clements, the Secretary of State originally found 1,148 were valid. A challenge to petitions turned in by Clements was filed by Andrew Davis, an endorser of Longjohn's campaign, resulted in another 157 invalidated. Davis was a failed challenger to Upton in 1992 and serves on the executive committee for the Democratic Party in the 6th District. Clements said Longjohn did not support the challenge to his petition. Clements does not plan to pursue a write-in campaign. ""I think all the Democratic candidates would be better than Fred Upton and I hope one of them wins,"" he said. ""I will certainly support whoever wins the primary."" Garrod, a first-time politician, submitted 1,019 signatures, of which 974 were valid. The Secretary of State found 45 signatures were invalid, including 35 for having a date error. The Pfizer quality control tester identified as a grassroots progressive originally inspired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. She is not pursuing a write-in campaign. Without Clements and Garrod, there are four candidates remain in the Democratic primary -- George Franklin, David Benec, Rich Eichholz and Matt Longjohn. Upton is unopposed in the GOP primary.

Andrew,Davis,1012,http://abc57.com/news/candidate-paul-clements-fails-to-get-enough-signatures-for-primary,"Candidate Paul Clement failed to obtain 1,000 valid signatures on his nominating petition for US Representative to the 6th District, according to a report from the Michigan Secretary of State. The filing included 1,346 signatures and the initial review found 1,148 face valid signatures. Andrew Davis filed a challenge to 417 of the signatures. After analyzing the petitions, the state found 157 additional signatures that were invalid, according to the state's report. The final number of valid signatures was 991, just 9 shy of the 1,000 required to be on the ballot. A majority of the signatures that were determined to be invalid were in areas where the person signing the form had in ""incorrect jurisdiction of registration."" For example, if a resident is registered in the city of South Haven, but accidentally checked ""township of"" instead of ""city of,"" their signature would be invalid. This only occurred for people who live in an area where there is both a city and a township of the same name including: Kalamazoo, New Buffalo, Saugatuck, South Haven, St. Joseph and Sturgis. Clements posted the following statement on his ClementsforCongress Facebook page It is with deep sadness that I announce the end of my campaign. Following a challenge to my petition, the Board of State Canvassers debated today, and eventually decided that I did not have enough valid signatures for the ballot. This is bitterly disappointing – that my campaign is ending, and that the Board’s debate hinged on a technicality, and they chose with no rational basis to narrow the interpretation of the law against the intention of signers. I am very grateful for the support and friendship through the campaign, from friends, family, citizens, and I am particularly grateful to the campaign team who share my disappointment. I promise to continue in the fight for social justice and democracy. My commiserations to Eponine Garrod, who has impressed me immensely by her courage and determination. We now have four Democratic candidates in Michigan's Sixth District, and we must work together to win this seat in November's election.

Sara,Burns,1011,http://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20180601/marion-examines-how-to-fight-climate-change,"MARION — A committee of town officials and volunteers met recently to whittle 21 actions the town could take against the effects of climate change down to three priorities. The daunting task is part of Marion's effort to become a certified Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Program community, which will entitle the town to grant funding that will address its susceptibility to the damaging effects of future storm and rising sea levels. At the first workshop, May 24 at the Music Hall, participants, split into two groups of approximately a dozen people each, chose the natural hazard problems that pose the greatest threat to the town and identified the community strengths and vulnerabilities under the categories of infrastructure, societal and environmental concerns. On Wednesday, participants met again at the Music Hall to use sheets listing the hazards under these three categories to identify and prioritize the action items that would fix these issues. Infrastructure solutions bandied about, but not yet finalized as top priorities, included removing trees to alleviate where stormwater rises quickly around town and moving its two fire stations to areas with more space. Societal solutions included improving heat within the town's emergency shelter, the Sippican School. ""First, they're identifying the hazards as to how they apply to infrastructure, societal and environmental effects,"" explained Sara Burns of the Nature Conservancy group, one of the organizations guiding the workshops, ""then they are ranking actions items addressing each category. At the end of the day, each group will pick three prioritized action items. It will take time."" Participants included Town Administrator Paul Dawson, Police Chief John B. Garcia, Fire Chief Brian Jackvony, Harbormaster Isaac Perry, Selectman Norman Hills, Planning Board Chair Eileen Marum, interim Department of Public Works Director Jonathan Henry and guidance from Bill Napolitano of the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development agency and representatives from Mass Audubon. Dawson explained it's all part of a long, multiple step process. The report of prioritized action items that results from these workshops will be submitted to the state. After the state certifies the town as an MVP community, the town can apply for grants to fund its priorities. Dawson's progress report will be presented to selectmen at their June 5 meeting.

Michael,Gordon,1010,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article212255084.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com June 01, 2018 09:51 AM A former police officer's use of force during a 2016 arrest, which his chief called ""indefensible,"" could now be defended in court — at taxpayer's expense. Two years ago, then-Charlotte Mecklenburg police Officer Jon Dunham put his gun to the head of an unarmed suspect and threatened to kill him if he did not allow himself to be handcuffed. Dunham also could be seen on a police video tasing James Yarborough while he and other officers were piled on top of him. In his new legal complaint against Dunham and the city of Charlotte, Yarborough alleges that the officer assaulted him while violating his constitutional protections against unlawful search and seizure. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The lawsuit, which was moved to federal court this week, also accuses Dunham of filing trumped-up criminal charges and a fraudulent incident report to justify his actions. The following video is of the incident that occurred on March 26, 2016, involving former CMPD Officer Jon Dunham and the suspect, James Yarborough. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department defended the actions of four officers shown on a video All the charges against Yarborough were dropped. Dunham left CMPD shortly after the incident. Dunham's tactics during Yarborough's capture ""constituted an unlawful assault that put (Yarborough) in fear of imminent death or serious injury,"" the lawsuit says. ""Dunham acted out of malice and with intentional and willful and wanton disregard of (Yarborough's) rights and beyond the scope of his lawful authority."" Police attorney Mark Newbold, who is representing the city, and Lori Keeton, who is Dunham's lawyer, said in a joint statement that they have received the complaint and will be responding soon. Based on its handling of recent lawsuits against police, the city appears less inclined to settle the cases and more likely to take them before a jury. The Yarborough case presents several challenges to that strategy. The following video is of the incident that occurred on March 26, 2016, involving former CMPD Officer Jon Dunham and the suspect, James Yarborough. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department defended the actions of four officers shown on a video ▪ After WBTV, and then the Observer, ran police video of the arrest, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Chief Kerr Putney defended most of Dunham's actions. But he said the officer's threat to kill Yarborough after placing a gun to Yarborough's head violated department protocol and escalated a tense situation. ""I'm not going to defend the indefensible,"" Putney said. ▪ A year after first exonerating Dunham, CMPD took up the case again and found that Dunham had engaged in conduct ""unbecoming of an officer."" ▪ In September — and for the first time in its 20-year history — the city's Citizens Review Board ruled against CMPD on its handling of a complaint against officers. On a 7-1 vote, the board found that Putney ""had clearly erred"" by not disciplining Dunham. Dunham, now a corporal for Davidson police, did not respond to an Observer email Thursday seeking comment for this story. According to the complaint, which was filed by Charlotte attorney Luke Largess, the events of March 26, 2016, began unfolding when Yarborough's truck ran out of gas on West Fifth Street. At a nearby gas station, the lawsuit says, Yarborough ran into a man he had met in prison who offered him a ride to his truck. According to court records, Yarborough has been convicted of several weapons violations. Unknown to Yarborough at the time, police had the car under surveillance, the lawsuit says. During the short ride, the unidentified man gave Yarborough a handgun wrapped in a towel and asked if he wanted to buy it. Yarborough declined, the lawsuit says. As the two arrived at the truck, police cars and officers with drawn weapons boxed them in, the lawsuit says. Free of any charges or probation for the first time in years and now fearful of being arrested on a weapon's charge, Yarborough fled the truck and ran up Summit Avenue, weaving in and out of backyards with police in pursuit, the lawsuit says. The chase ended on Cemetery Street. Several officers, Dunham among them, tackled Yarborough and began punching him, demanding that the suspect allow himself to be handcuffed, the lawsuit says. Yarborough pleaded with the officers piled on top of him to ease off, the lawsuit says. Instead, Dunham put his service revolver to Yarborough's left temple. ""I will kill you, you understand? Give me your hand now,"" the officer can be heard saying on the video. After putting his gun away, Dunham later drew his Taser and shocked Yarborough in his back. The lawsuit also says Dunham ""deliberately and maliciously"" elbowed Yarborough in the head before another officer told Dunham to get off of the suspect so he could be handcuffed. Later in his report of the incident, Dunham ""dishonestly"" claimed that he drew his gun because Yarborough was reaching for his waistband — ""a claim refuted by the camera video footage,"" the lawsuit says. Yarborough is asking for punitive and compensatory damages along with a jury trial. Since his departure from CMPD, Dunham has been promoted once by Davidson police. Previously, in 20, he was shot in his own bed by an armed intruder. The legal battle over police tactics provides a reunion of sorts for the three lawyers. In April, a jury awarded the family of Spencer Mims $100,000 in damages after the Charlotte man was fatally shot on his porch by a CMPD officer during a 2013 mental health crisis. Largess represented the Mims family while Newbold and Keeton, a private attorney who frequently is hired by the city to defend police accused of wrongdoing, handled the defense of the city and the officer, respectively. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday he “can’t defend” the actions of an officer captured on video putting a pistol to an unarmed man’s head during an arrest. The incident took place in March 2016 when police chased James Y Researcher Maria David contributed.

Visit image gallery to purchase the image. The economy was still in good shape through fiscal stimulus and the record-high terms of trade. But it might be tiring. Both headline business confidence and firms’ views of their own activity fell four points in May. In terms of expectations regarding their own activity, retail and construction industries were dragging the chain, she said. A net 27% of businesses were pessimistic about the year ahead. Firms’ own views of their own activity — which had the stronger correlation with GDP growth — dipped from 18 to 14, the lowest reading since November. In a surprise reading, agriculture confidence lifted. Construction was flat at low levels and retail fell 10 points to match it as the equal lowest confidence industry, Ms Zollner said. A net 3% of firms were expecting to lift investment, down four points. Investment intentions had been in single digits for five of the past six months. Profit expectations fell eight points to -9%, firmly in the red. Employment intentions eased from 9% to 7%. Construction industry employment intentions fell sharply. Excluding construction, the data was flat.A net 28% of businesses expected it to be tougher to get credit, from 26% in April. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said May was a relatively eventful month, including Budget 2018, which offered little for businesses other than the R&D tax credit, the sharp rise in fuel prices to a record high, and the Government’s decision on how to address the Mycoplasma bovis outbreak. ""However, the survey likely predated most of this and we may see some more telling responses next month.’"" Westpac economic forecasts incorporated a lull in hiring and investment in 2018 on the back of uncertainty concerning the impact of the new Government. That was consistent with firms’ expressed intentions in the ANZ survey, he said.

Robert,Hoopes,1009,http://www.theintell.com/news/20180531/fall-trial-date-set-in-lower-southampton-corruption-case,"Two ex-Lower Southampton public officials are set for trial in October while sentencings for those who have pleaded guilty are pushed back further. Former district judge John Waltman and ex-Lower Southampton public safety director Robert Hoopes have another new trial date on federal money laundering charges. Previously delayed by superseding indictments, plea talks and piles of complex evidence, a jury trial for the pair of ex-public officials is set to start in mid-October in federal court in Philadelphia, according to records filed Tuesday. Waltman and Hoopes are accused of laundering $400,000 they believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and healthcare fraud that was given to them by undercover agents while they were in office, according to court documents. They also are charged with accepting bribes from four businesses in an alleged pay-to-play scheme. An order from U.S. District Judge Gene E.K. Pratter says the trial is “specially listed” for Oct. 15. A final pretrial conference is set for Oct. 4. Hoopes' attorney Megan Scheib declined to comment on the case Thursday while Waltman's lawyer Louis Busico could not immediately be reached for comment. Sentencing hearings for deputy state constable Bernard Rafferty, ex-credit union manager Kevin Biederman, salesman Robert DeGoria and attorney Michael Savona — all of whom have pleaded guilty in the corruption case — have been pushed back from dates in the summer to Nov. 6-9, presumably after any trial has ended. Rafferty admitted in March that he aided Waltman and Hoopes in laundering cash and helped orchestrate a ticket-fixing scheme out of Waltman's court. Biederman admitted to charges he used his position at the Philadelphia Federal Credit Union to produce bogus documents to facilitate the money laundering operation. DeGoria, a former digital billboard salesman, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and IRS about his financial dealings with Waltman and Hoopes. Savona, who was once solicitor for Lower Southampton, admitted lying to federal investigators about his knowledge of an alleged $10,000 bribe from DeGoria to Waltman and Hoopes. The judge's latest scheduling order comes after she granted a joint request for more time earlier in the spring, which pointed to plea talks and problems with a defendant's hard drive as factors driving the need for a new delay. The motion added that federal prosecutors have had continued discussions with attorneys for both Waltman and Hoopes, “which may result in one or both of them pleading guilty prior to any trial.” Choose the plan that's right for you.

Please turn on JavaScript for the best possible experience. Quick links By Gareth Dennison | 01/06/2018 THE site of a notorious estate remains neglected and desolate — a decade after its houses were reduced to rubble. And a Rotherham Borough Council webpage for the former Chesterhill site at Thrybergh this week still said construction work was expected to start in 2016. Regeneration of the area was promised when the bulldozers arrived in 2008 but attracting developers has proved difficult. Struggling nearby businesses would relish the extra residents in the village to help trade, an independent campaigner told councillors. Michael Sylvester, a Thrybergh resident, said: “In 2013, plans were brought forward with Keepmoat Homes to build 260 properties, including 15 council homes. “According to information on the council website, we were due to see construction started in 2016. “If we assume the web story was correct, and not just for consumption in the run-up to the last local elections, Rotherham Council needs to explain the extended delay. “What are they going to do to help repair damage to businesses that have struggled due to this decade long gap in the local community?” More than 140 properties were demolished on Chesterhill Avenue, Townend Avenue, Glebe Crescent and Wilson Drive. Residents petitioned the council at the time because of delays in the project and calling for action against antisocial behaviour and crime they described as “absolute mayhem”. Council leader Cllr Chris Read admitted it was embarrassing for the website page to be out of date. But Cllr Dominic Beck, cabinet member for housing, said the aim was still to deliver about 240 properties on Chesterhill Avenue and Whinney Hill. He added: “The council is committed to delivering high quality homes that meet the needs of people in the borough. “We have faced a number of challenges over the years in getting a deliverable scheme off the ground. “We are currently reviewing our options to ensure we move as quickly as possible on these key sites.” Mr Sylvester said: “In the intervening two years since 2016, Dalton and Thrybergh have lost their last pub. “A few hundred yards away, we’ve lost Dalton Progressive Club. We’ve lost our last post office and Thrybergh Legion Club. “We have many businesses that are struggling and could do with the extra 600 people that this would bring in to the village. “There’s been a delay but are the council going to learn from it and support the businesses?” We want to continue holding local authorities to account, attending court and council meetings, as well as providing breaking news, competitions and offers – but it costs money.

Steve,Cummings,1007,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cummings-i-have-to-fight-for-my-tour-de-france-spot,"Dimension Data rider looking to maximise his remaining time at the top By his own admission this season’s results have been below expectations but Steve Cummings his confident that after a break from racing he can showcase his improving form at the Criterium du Dauphine and secure a Tour de France spot with Dimension Data.Related ArticlesCummings: Best way to respond after Worlds snub was to carry onCummings waiting for his chance in Volta a CatalunyaCummings keeping calm in the eye of the stormCummings: Sometimes a bad experience can be a good one Cummings, 37, has not raced since abandoning the Tour de Romandie in April due to allergies. The Swiss race brought down the curtain on a disappointing spring campaign in which both rider and team struggled for results, but with the Dauphine just days away Cummings believes that he has regained his health, and his mojo. “At the moment, I’m more interested in performance. I’ve not performed all year, and that’s me saying that. I’ve not reached my capabilities and I’m just hoping that I can perform. If I perform well then results will follow,” Cummings told Cyclingnews before heading to France. Part of Cummings’ disappointing spring could be down to his change in race programme. With Dimension Data looking to embark on a number of goals this year, including the hunt for WorldTour points, Cummings was given a new race calendar. The team was hoping that he could be one of the main driving forces in securing points but not all change leads to immediate success. A number of the team’s riders, not just Cummings, have struggled with health and bad luck this year, while the team has also looked to once again take on the responsibility of developing raw talent from Africa. With so many injuries and securing rider visas a constant battle for the team, several riders including Cummings has been asked to fill gaps in rosters. “Romandie didn’t set me back but it was never really a race on my programme. I had to do it because the team was stretched and to have the allergy problem was tough on me mentally after what had happened in the spring. It never rains, it pours,” Cummings said. “I think that the team was a little bit worried about WorldTour points at the start of the year. They were trying to maximise the group and thought that it would be better for me to do some other races. I thought it might be a risk, in that why change something if it’s not broken. I’m not a young rider and over the years I’ve found a programme that suits me. But I can understand that the team needs WorldTour points.” The break between the end of April and June has allowed Cummings to gain both perspective and his true form. Several other riders including Mark Cavendish and Edvald Boasson Hagen are also back in training and gearing up for a huge summer of racing. Along with the Dauphine, the Dimension Data squad are hoping to reignite their season with strong showings at the Tour de Suisse and of course the Tour de France, where they have enjoyed huge success in the past. At 37 Cummings is well aware that he is closer to the end of his career than the start. During his mini-break from the action he began to ponder a life after competitive cycling and while he has no firm plans beyond his 2018-19 contract with Dimension Data, the time away from racing has helped him rediscover his motivation after a difficult few months. “I didn’t enjoy spring at all. After Romandie, I really didn’t enjoy that next week. I spent a lot of time thinking about life after cycling and what I would do next. I’m still thinking and I need to have a plan but now I feel a lot better. I’ve put things in perspective because sometimes you can get caught up in the cycling bubble. I know I can’t go on forever and this has been the first time I’ve really thought about what I want to do after cycling, and at the same time, that’s given me an appreciation for what I want to do now. I’ve asked myself if I still really want to do this and the answer has been yes. I want to maximise what time I have left and I don’t want to put a date on it. I’m quite happy now though because I’ve maximized every day I’ve had since then.” “I think that a big change for me over the years has been with having a family. I don’t want to be as selfish as I was a few years ago. I want my family to be happy as well. I think that having a family has helped me make cycling less intense. It’s hard to explain but I think my priorities have changed over time but I’ve still kept a high level. If spring was a bit of a wobble, then I feel on track again and I’m looking forward to the Dauphine and the opportunities that I have left.” Cummings won a stage in the Dauphine in 2016 before going on to win the second of his two Tour de France stages that summer. Of course, a repeat of that Dauphine success would go a long way to improving the team’s win tally for the season, but Cummings is aware that he needs to concentrate on his performance first and foremost. “Things are looking a lot better than they were a few weeks ago. I’ve still got a bit more form to find but I’m better mentally, and physically I’m getting to where I need to be right now,” he said. Last year Cummings only secured his Tour spot thanks to a quality outing at the British nationals in which he won both the road race and the time trial. The veteran rider is under no illusion that despite the team’s slow start to the year he has not done enough to ensure he has a spot for the Tour team in July. “Everyone has to fight for their place at the Tour. I’m no different to anyone else in that sense but I’m moving forward and I know that I need to be in the ballpark for the Dauphine, otherwise I wouldn’t pick me for the Tour either. I need to be at a point where I can show my condition because there’s only so much time left between now and the Tour.” CRESCENDO from Cyclingnews Films on Vimeo.

John,O'Neil,1004,http://www.capecodtimes.com/entertainmentlife/20180531/cabaretfest-brings-music-and-stories-to-provincetown,"The CabaretFest schedule this year includes an array of events and performers, with workshops, master classes and a solo and group cabaret shows. What does the word “cabaret” bring to mind? Maybe a relaxed setting, a room with cozy tables and shaded lamps; a smoky-voiced singer leaning on the piano, singing low .... Patricia Fitzpatrick, producer of this weekend’s CabaretFest in Provincetown, offers her own spin: “It’s a small room, an intimate gathering … and a musical story.” Cabaret style, she says, is “filled with patter. It’s telling a story, a personal story.” She adds, “When you leave (a cabaret performance), you should know more about the entertainer as a human being.” Fitzpatrick is at the helm of the annual festival for the fourth year in a row. The event originated in 2000 and ran for a few years under the direction of performer/teacher John O’Neil, and then Fitzpatrick re-launched the idea – and the festival – in 2015 after a hiatus of several years. She says the event is growing more popular every year. A look at this year’s schedule reveals an array of events and performers, with workshops, master classes (already sold out, including those by last year’s lifetime-achievement award-winner Marilyn Maye) and a variety of solo and group cabaret shows, nearly all open to the public. Headlining events include Friday evening’s variety show “Music, Music, Music,” showcasing 30 top cabaret performers and songs from the golden era of 1950s pop. Saturday night’s draw is cabaret star Jeff Harnar, who just won the 2018 MAC (Manhattan Association of Cabarets) Award for Best Male Vocalist. Harnar and arranger/composer Alex Rybeck perform “The 1959 Broadway Songbook” – music from shows that opened on Broadway in 1959. The festival’s closing Sunday Brunch features performances by students chosen from those who’ve “graduated” from a class or workshop at the festival. Fitzpatrick calls it “the culmination of the weekend.” Sandwiched in among the many classes and performance workshops are more solo cabaret shows, created by individual artists. Themes include love songs of the 1950s; standards from the American Songbook, and a tribute to famed 1950s jazz musician Mel Torme. On Saturday afternoon, Fitzpatrick and her musical director, Brian Patton, perform their cabaret show “The Lounge Singer” – songs and humorous patter about the “glamorous” life of a 1950s “girl” nightclub singer. For the festival’s classes, Fitzpatrick says her goal as a mentor is to instill a sense of what cabaret really is – connecting with the audience in an intimate setting, rather than presenting something that she calls “overly rehearsed.” Forget the head shots, wardrobe and costly lessons, she says. Just “get up and start doing it.” Fitzpatrick’s own life seems like a whirlwind of activity, from her early career as a singer at the Playboy Club in Detroit; then marriage, five kids and stints as a freelance journalist. She worked as a corporate sales director for five Holiday Inn motels and as Provincetown’s first director of tourism, from 1999 to 2005. She launched her talent-management business, Ambassador Productions, in 2005. It wasn’t until around 2000, when she attended a workshop led by well-known cabaret performer Carol O’Shaughnessy (who will receive a lifetime achievement award at this year’s festival), that she learned about cabaret singing and set out to change her performance zeitgeist. Fitzpatrick has written and produced many cabaret shows since then. After the death of her husband in 2004, she created the show “I’m Single Again, and It’s Not My Fault,” winning a MAC award nomination in 2007. She also wrote and performed a show with two other women, “about women over 60 trying to date.” Her more recent production, “The 1940s USO Radio Show” debuted last year -- the year of her 75th birthday -- at CabaretFest and at Don’t Tell Mama’s in New York City. She recounts receiving accolades from Maye herself after the famous performer attended one of Fitzpatrick’s shows: “Who writes your patter?” Maye asked. “I do,” said Fitzpatrick. “That’s why it’s so good – it’s fresh!” praised Maye. Fitzpatrick is enthusiastic about her role as mentor to students learning the art of cabaret: “Here’s who you go to. Here’s what you do when you do a show. … It’s about how to take a song and do it differently.” “This is a business, and you can learn this business,” she says. How big a part does mentoring play in her work these days? “For me, all of it,” she says. “I have all this knowledge. I want to share it.” Choose the plan that's right for you.

The Michigan Secretary of State’s office determined this week that Paul Clements and Eponine Garrod are less than 30 petition signatures short of the 1,000 required to qualify for the ballot. The fate of the two candidates will be decided today at a 9 a.m. hearing by the state’s Board of Canvassers. Clements, an economic development professor who in the last two elections was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee challenging Upton, was near the front of the highly contested primary. Garrod, a Pfizer quality control tester and self-described grassroots progressive, was considered a long shot to face Upton by political analysts. The Secretary of State’s initial review showed that Garrod submitted 974 valid signatures. Clements stood to pass the state’s initial review, but a challenge revealed he had only 991 valid signatures. In a phone interview with The Herald-Palladium, Clements said he would not run as a write-in if disqualified. “I’m disappointed there was a challenge,” Clements said Thursday. “I submitted more than 1,000 signatures from people registered to vote in this district. But there were some errors and omissions.” Garrod could not be reached for comment. Overall, seven Michigan congressional candidates – five Democrats and two Republicans – could be left off their parties’ Aug. 7 primary ballots because they lacked the 1,000 valid signatures from registered voters in their districts needed to qualify. Garrod didn’t have a lot of breathing room, having submitted 1,019 signatures. Forty-five signatures were deemed invalid. Clements filed 1,346 and lost 198 of the signatures from the original review. However, when a challenge petition was filed against Clements, the Board of Canvassers rejected another 157 signatures. The final review left Clements just nine signatures short of the minimum. Andrew Davis, a supporter of Democratic opponent Matt Longjohn, filed the challenge to Clements’ petitions. Fred Woodhams, a spokesman for the Secretary of State’s office, said in an email that the Board of Canvassers will meet today to consider the reports, but the recommendations are normally accepted. Clements and Garrod were running in a crowded field of Democrats trying to unseat Upton, R-St. Joseph. If both candidates are disqualified, there will be four left in the House race for the nomination, which includes George Franklin, Longjohn, David Benac and Rich Eichholz. Clements, 57, wasn’t sure if he wanted to run again until Upton was among the House members who approved a health care bill that could have ended the Affordable Care Act. Garrod, 24, was convinced she needed to become more active in politics after Sen. Bernie Sanders, “sparked a movement” with his run in the 2016 presidential election.

Andrew,Davis,1003,http://wtvbam.com/news/articles/2018/may/31/two-democrats-may-not-make-primary-ballot/,"LANSING, MI (WKZO AM/FM) --Two Democratic challengers to Congressman Fred Upton may not appear on the ballot in the August primary election after all. The Secretary of State Office says Paul Clements and Eponine Garrod are both less than 30 petition signatures short of the required number to be put on the ballot, and their recommendation is to disqualify them. The state Board of Canvassers will get final say Friday. Clements and Garrod were running in a crowded field of democrats trying to unseat Rep. Fred Upton. Clements was one of five that Ruth Johnson says failed to survive review and challenges submitted to the Secretary of State’s office. There are a number of reasons why signatures can be invalidated and Andrew Davis, a supporter of Democratic opponent Matt Longjohn filed the challenge of Clements petitions. Another democrat vying for the nomination, George Franklin says he is disappointed that the Longjohn Campaign filed the challenge, saying it runs “counter to our fundamental values” calling it a political ploy. But it’s one that has apparently borne fruit. That leaves four in the race for the nomination, including Franklin, Longjohn, David Benac and Rich Eichholz.

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 2:07 pm Michael Gordon Law and Justice Reporter Michael Gordon Michael Gordon of Missoula likely will not spend additional time in jail after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges Wednesday stemming from a family dispute in which he fired a shotgun into the air and then led police on a chase. Gordon gained notoriety in 2014 after a coroner's inquest found that he was justified in shooting and killing a man after a fight in the parking lot of a strip club. Earlier this month, Gordon was charged with felonies for assault with a weapon and assault on a peace officer, as well as a misdemeanor for fleeing after an incident in which deputies were called to a home on Primrose Lane for a report of shots being fired. A woman at the house said an intoxicated Gordon had been fighting with his father before coming to the house, finding a shotgun and saying he was going to kill him, according to court records. The woman locked an armed Gordon out of the house, then heard him fire the shotgun three times before driving away. When officers found and attempted to pull over Gordon’s truck, he allegedly led them on a chase that reached speeds of 100 miles per hour before reaching a business on Broadway. Court records say Gordon then got out of the truck holding the shotgun, but dropped it when told to do so by officers. After reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors, Gordon pleaded no contest Tuesday after his felonies were amended to misdemeanors for partner or family member assault and driving under the influence. He also pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor fleeing charge. Chief Deputy County Attorney Jason Marks said once he was able to fully review the dash camera video of the incident from earlier in the month, he decided that resolving the case at the misdemeanor level was appropriate. “While there is certainly probable cause (for the felony charges,) after reviewing the video I didn’t think a jury would convict,” he said. Marks added that the allegations don’t indicate that Gordon pointed the weapon at anyone at the house or at any deputies. Gordon was sentenced Tuesday in Missoula County Justice Court to two and a half years of jail time, with all of it suspended except the time he has already served in custody. In addition, he was fined more than $1,000 for the three convictions, and must attend anger management and inpatient treatment for drug and alcohol issues. Marks said the conviction for misdemeanor partner assault will prohibit Gordon from possessing firearms. Reducing that charge to a misdemeanor was also in line with the wishes of the victim in the case, he said. In September 2014, Gordon shot and killed Christopher Hymel after an altercation in the parking lot of the Fox Club. According to records, Hymel attacked Gordon through the window of Gordon’s truck, and Gordon took a gun from his center console and shot Hymel in the chest. A jury at a coroner’s inquest later that year found the Gordon was legally justified in the shooting. A Missoula man who in 2014 was found to have been justified when he shot and killed a man outside a strip club faces new felony charges after … Law and Justice Reporter Crime reporter for the Missoulian.

Michael,Gordon,1001,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article212133349.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 30, 2018 09:18 AM Multiple shootings. Three attempted carjackings. Two high-speed chases. And one shootout with police. On Tuesday, all those numbers added up to a 20-year federal prison sentence for Rodolfo Joel Ulloa-Paz. The 30-year-old, undocumented immigrant from Mexico becomes the second person to receive a lengthy prison sentence stemming from a violent and chaotic effort two years ago to evade Charlotte-Mecklenburg police. A second conspirator, Alan Israel Chavez-Cruz, received a 12-year sentence in March for carjacking and firearms charges. Cruz also is undocumented. The episode unfolded in August 2016 when police began looking for a pickup whose occupants were believed to have been involved in multiple shootings. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Authorities say Paz was at the wheel of the GMC Sierra. Cruz was his front-seat passenger. Four other companions were in the back of the truck. When police tried to stop the Sierra, Paz sped off. He collided with two other vehicles, leaving his truck disabled. He parked it in the driveway of a home off W.T. Harris Boulevard, authorities say. The four riders in the back all fled. Paz, however, stepped out of the pickup with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. Cruz carried a black 9mm handgun, authorities say. They eyed a Mazda parked in the same driveway. Cruz stuck his pistol in the stomach of the homeowner and demanded the keys, authorities say. The man did not have them, and Cruz could not find them when he rummaged through the man's pockets. According to prosecutors, Paz yelled at the driver of a passing Ford Ranger to stop, then opened fire with his shotgun. The birdshot struck the windshield, injuring the driver and passenger. But the Ford kept going. Authorities say Paz and Cruz next eyed a parked Chevrolet Silverado. Paz fired his shotgun in the air and Cruz, his handgun showing, ordered the passenger to get out of the vehicle. The Chevy, with Paz at the wheel, then led police on a hot pursuit down N.C. 16. Along the way, authorities say, Cruz took apart his handgun and threw the pieces from the speeding pickup. When the chase crossed into Catawba County, Paz lost control of the Silverado and crashed into a power pole. Cruz was quickly arrested. But Paz apparently had no plans to surrender. He left the truck still holding the shotgun, then pointed it at the surrounding police. Three CMPD officers opened fire. Though wounded, Paz still struggled throughout his arrest, authorities say. In November, he pleaded guilty to carjacking and firearms offenses. A Mecklenburg County Jail mugshot shows the smiling defendant with a medical device attached to the right side of his face. On Tuesday, he stood before a judge and received his sentence. Both Paz and Cruz face deportation once they complete their prison time.

With visually stunning projections, Anthracite Fields draws on oral histories, interviews, speeches, geography, local rhymes, and coal advertisements to create a work honoring the region's people who persevered, endured, and fueled a nation. Throughout the Festival, daily 1:30pm recitals offer an opportunity for the performance and composition fellows to interact with the artwork in the galleries, often playing new works written while in residence at MASS MoCA.

Together with The Noguchi Museum, Bang on a Can welcomes everyone to join together for concerts that cross genres, generations, and geographies and build our utopian world.

Since its first Marathon concert in 1987, Bang on a Can has been creating an international community dedicated to innovative music, wherever it is found. With adventurous programs, it commissions new composers, performs, presents, and records new work, develops new audiences, and educates the musicians of the future. Bang on a Can is building a world in which powerful new musical ideas flow freely across all genres and borders. Bang on a Can plays ""a central role in fostering a new kind of audience that doesn't concern itself with boundaries. If music is made with originality and integrity, these listeners will come."" (The New York Times) Bang on a Can has grown from a one-day New York-based Marathon concert (on Mother's Day in 1987 in a SoHo art gallery) to a multi-faceted performing arts organization with a broad range of year-round international activities. ""When we started Bang on a Can, we never imagined that our 12-hour marathon festival of mostly unknown music would morph into a giant international organization dedicated to the support of experimental music, wherever we would find it,"" write Bang on a Can Co-Founders Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe. ""But it has, and we are so gratified to be still hard at work, all these years later. The reason is really clear to us - we started this organization because we believed that making new music is a utopian act - that people needed to hear this music and they needed to hear it presented in the most persuasive way, with the best players, with the best programs, for the best listeners, in the best context. Our commitment to changing the environment for this music has kept us busy and growing, and we are not done yet."" Current projects include the annual Bang on a Can Marathon; The People's Commissioning Fund, a membership program to commission emerging composers; the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who tour to major festivals and concert venues around the world every year; recording projects; the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival at MASS MoCA - a professional development program for young composers and performers led by today's pioneers of experimental music; Asphalt Orchestra, Bang on a Can's extreme street band that offers mobile performances re-contextualizing unusual music; Found Sound Nation, a new technology-based musical outreach program now partnering with the State Department of the United States of America to create OneBeat, a revolutionary, post-political residency program that uses music to bridge the gulf between young American musicians and young musicians from developing countries; cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects with DJs, visual artists, choreographers, filmmakers and more. Each new program has evolved to answer specific challenges faced by today's musicians, composers and audiences, in order to make innovative music widely accessible and wildly received. Bang on a Can's inventive and aggressive approach to programming and presentation has created a large and vibrant international audience made up of people of all ages who are rediscovering the value of contemporary music.

Andrew,Davis,996,http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2018/05/6th_district_democratic_candid_1.html,"By Malachi Barrett mbarret1@mlive.com KALAMAZOO, MI -- A two-time Democratic challenger to U.S. Rep. Fred Upton may not see his name on the ballot a third time. The Michigan Secretary of State office said Democrats Paul Clements and Eponine Garrod are among seven candidates who lack enough valid signatures from registered voters to be on the Aug. 7 primary ballot. The Board of State Canvassers will meet Friday to vote on the recommendation to remove the candidates from the ballot. Fred Woodhams, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office, said candidates will have the chance to plead their case, but it's ""uncommon"" that the recommendation isn't followed. Garrod said she will attend the Friday Board of Canvassers meeting to argue her case. Clements was unable to be reached by MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette. Clements was his party's pick to challenge Upton for the 6th District congressional seat in 2014 and 2016 but fell nine signatures short of the 1,000 required. Clements submitted 1,346 signatures, of which 991 were deemed valid. READ THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S REVIEW OF CLEMENTS HERE Garrod, a first-time politician, also did not have enough valid signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot. She submitted 1,019 signatures, of which 974 were valid. Without Clements and Garrod, there are four candidates in the Democratic primary -- George Franklin, David Benec, Rich Eichholz and Matt Longjohn. Upton is unopposed in the GOP primary. READ THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S REVIEW OF GARROD HERE Of the 1,346 signatures filed by Clements, the Secretary of State originally found 1,148 were valid. A challenge to petitions turned in by Clements was filed by Andrew Davis, an endorser of Longjohn's campaign. Davis was a failed challenger to Upton in 1992 and serves on the executive committee for the Democratic Party in the 6th District. Davis challenged 417 of Clements' 1,148 remaining signatures and 157 were found to be invalid. Signatures were disqualified for writing an ""incorrect jurisdiction of registration."" Too many signers living in jurisdictions that have cities and townships with the same name checked the wrong box indicating where they are registered to vote. This could occur in the following jurisdictions if the signer selected the wrong box to indicate whether he or she was registered to vote in the city or township: Clements, a Western Michigan University political science professor unsuccessfully ran for Congress twice already, losing to Upton in 2014 and by a wider margin in 2016. After considering staying out of the 2018 election, Clements saw an opportunity to run again. Garrod, a Pfizer quality control tester, identified as a grassroots progressive originally inspired by Sen. Bernie Sanders. The 24-year-old was a vocal supporter of progressive issues, often attending local government meetings in Kalamazoo County to speak. The Secretary of State found 45 signatures were invalid, including 35 for having a date error.

Andrew,Davis,996,http://wmuk.org/post/secretary-state-report-recommends-keeping-clements-august-ballot,"The Michigan Secretary of State is recommending that Paul Clements not be placed on the August ballot for the Democratic primary in Southwest Michigan’s 6th Congressional District. Clements was the Democratic candidate who challenged Republican Representative Fred Upton in 2014 and 2016. This year five other Democrats have filed to run for their party’s nomination. 1,000 signatures from registered voters are needed to make the ballot. A memo from the Secretary of State’s office says a challenge to petitions turned in by Clements shows he was nine short. The challenge was filed by Andrew Davis. A spokesman for the campaign of Democratic candidate Matt Longjohn says Davis is a supporter of Longjohn’s bid for Congress, but does not have an official position with their campaign. The Board of State Canvassers is scheduled to meet on Friday. They will consider to challenge to Clements’ petition as well as a report that another of the Democrats seeking the 6th district nomination, Eponine Garrod, did not submit enough signatures from registered voters to qualify for the ballot. Paul Clements says he wasn’t sure if he would run for Congress again this year. But the Western Michigan University Political Science Professor says he brings the “strongest package” for winning in the 6th Congressional District, and pushing an agenda in Congress to improve well-being of people in the district.

Michael,Gordon,995,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article212132559.html,"By Jim Morrill And Michael Gordon jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 30, 2018 01:09 PM The way Mecklenburg County voters choose judges would change dramatically under a bill that passed the North Carolina Senate Wednesday and appears to be moving quickly through the General Assembly. The county's eight Superior Court judges, now elected from three districts, would run in eight under the bill. And the county's 21 District judges, now elected countywide, also would be elected from those eight districts. ""The intent was to run in smaller districts,"" said Sen. Jeff Tarte, who co-sponsored the bill with fellow Mecklenburg Republican Sen. Dan Bishop. ""It gives you the opportunity to actually go and do your homework on the judges."" For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Introduced this week, the bill passed two Senate committees and the full Senate by Wednesday afternoon. It goes to the House and appears to be on the fast track to passage. That's too fast for critics. ""The problem is at this point nobody trusts the process,"" said Sen. Jeff Jackson, a Charlotte Democrat. ""The well was poisoned last year when they rolled a half-baked . . . set of maps that caught everybody by surprise. The controversy isn't over whether or not we need to update the map. It's how to do it. And using ultimatums isn't going to win anyone over."" The legislation is the latest in a string of actual and proposed changes to state courts by the Republican-controlled General Assembly. Lawmakers have shrunk the state court of appeals, put party labels on judicial races, eliminated public financing for court elections and done away with this year's judicial primaries. They've also talked about appointing rather than electing judges, redrawing districts across the state and shrinking judicial terms — now as long as eight years — to two. One national analyst said nowhere in America were so many changes coming to courts in such a relatively short time. Bishop and Tarte point to the disparity in size of Superior Court districts. In Mecklenburg, one Superior Court district wraps around the county from Davidson to Steele Creek to Ballantyne. It has 374,000 registered voters. Another district mainly in north and west Charlotte has 114,000. They each elect the same number of Superior Court judges. In written testimony to a Senate panel, one expert acknowledged the disparity. In one district, he said, there are 250 felony jury trials a year. In another, only 20. And one district court district handled 2,800 child-support cases while another disposed of 260. Few dispute the idea that changes are needed. Bishop called the disparities a ""gross violation of basic constitutional .... equality."" He pointed to months of study by legislative committees. But unlike earlier efforts at court reform, there have been no blue-ribbon commissions or extended hearings from stake-holders. Charlotte attorney John Wester, a Republican and longtime critic of the legislature's injection of politics into the courts, said he saw the bill for the first time on Tuesday and is still sifting through its potential implications. He says changes should not be rushed into law without ""a full debate."" ""The impact of redistricting is so significant that I hope for a slowed process ... bringing to the table citizens, the legal community and judges who have acquired a deep knowledge of this issue during their professional careers,"" Wester said. In a memo, Bishop said the bill does three things. He said it balances populations among districts, eliminating big disparities. It eliminates ""the irrational distinction"" between the way District and Superior Court judges are elected. And he said it's all done with ""minimal impact"" on incumbents. Tarte said he and Bishop tried to protect incumbent judges from running against each other. But Chief Mecklenburg District Judge Regan Miller said the new district lines would pit incumbents against each other and force other sitting judges to move to some other part of the county to keep their seats. One of the new districts, in the northern part of the county, has no incumbent judges living there. Two seats are assigned to that district. ""Two people will either have to move there or lose their seats,"" Miller said. Another district, he said, has three seats but only two sitting judges living there, meaning another judge would have to move there to stay on the bench, he said. Another district has four incumbents living there, but only three seats. Again, someone would have to move to another district or leave the bench. Last year lawmakers made judicial elections partisan. Miller said said nonpartisan races also ""made it much easier for judges to support their competent colleagues when you didn't have to worry about partisan politics."" As of now, the county has 18 Democrats and three Republicans on the District Court bench. Tarte said he doesn't expect that to change much. ""Candidly if the Democrats had proposed this they'd love it,"" Tarte said. ""And we’d have had a few on our side complaining it was unfair.” Anne Blythe of the (Raleigh) News & Observer and Colin Campbell of the Insider contributed.

Michael,Gordon,995,http://atlantajewishtimes.timesofisrael.com/200-break-silence-on-addiction-mental-illness/,"Sarah Moosazadeh is a staff writer for the Atlanta Jewish Times. Atlanta native and Temple Sinai member Erin Clements struggled for years with heroin and other opioids. Her addiction worsened after her mother died of cancer. But after her sister’s wedding, Clements decided to seek help. Before 2016, life for Jennifer Greenberg and her husband, Adam, seemed great. They had high-earning jobs, took frequent vacations and enjoyed their friends’ company. Adam was fiercely devoted to his family and his colleagues. Get The AJT Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up But what people didn’t see were his bouts of depression. Jennifer tried to help and suggested therapy, but she was sworn to secrecy — until Adam killed himself. Those were two of the stories presented about addiction and mental health at “Quieting the Silence,” the Blue Dove Foundation’s debut program, held at Temple Sinai in partnership with The Berman Center, Jewish Family & Career Services and its HAMSA addiction program, Sinai’s Nefesh mental health program, Jewish Path to Recovery, and Derech Transitional Living on Thursday, May 24. Berman Center CEO Justin Milrad and Executive Director Alyza Berman, who launched Blue Dove, organized the program, which drew more than 200 people. More than 64,000 Americans fatally overdosed last year, most from opioids. Over 170,000 people are believed to have used heroin for the first time. Meanwhile, one in five Americans has some mental illness, and nearly 60 percent of adults with mental illness did not receive health services in 2017. “What we know is that mental illness and substance abuse occur in the Jewish community whether we want to acknowledge it or not, and what we know is that it occurs in the Jewish community at relatively the same rate as the general community. We are not immune. We are not protected,” said Dan Arnold, the JF&CS director of clinical services. “The trend is stigma and silence. … But we are bucking that by saying treatments need to happen, community needs to happen, it’s real, and we have to address it.” Marci Talarico’s three children suffer from binge eating, depression, drug addiction and anxiety, but she refuses to keep her struggle a secret. Today she has numbers for therapists, doctors and psychologists in case any of them relapse. She is one of the few who are not afraid to talk about their family issues. “I think the Jewish community is coming to the table on mental health and substance abuse,” Jewish Path to Recovery founder Eric Miller said during a panel discussion led by Berman Center program director Daniel Epstein. “I think what people have noticed is that in their own lives and own families they have been experiencing substance abuse and mental health issues and have wondered where to go.” Epstein noted a gap between the time that a person or a family recognizes a problem and the moment a patient receives treatment. “I think it’s the judgment that we put on families and someone, but I think the best thing to do if you know someone is not to shame them, but to approach them with love and ask a question,” Berman said. OCD specialist and therapist Josh Spitalnick said: “One of the things I would recommend for anyone battling this disease is to seek out specific services that are online that are science- and academic-based. I think a way to increase that access to care is to identify legitimate websites that have really good providers.” When people talk about mental health, the focus tends to be on the individual, but the family also faces challenges, Arnold said. “It’s crucial to reach out to the family system to treat individuals holistically because what we strive to do is to create a connection, boundaries and support. … We have to engage the family.” Miller said: “I also think it is important to provide a lot of education to the families. There is a way to intervene, but it is important to have a plan and understand what that is before you do so and perhaps find a professional to do that. I think we need to come out of the closet with people who are ready to help support the family because the family is as clueless as anybody.” Denial is the correct term for the conflict, said The Berman Center’s medical director, Michael Gordon. “For a person with an addiction, there are two stages to denial. The first is ‘What drug problem? What drinking problem? I don’t have a problem. I am fine.’ But past that, there is ‘OK, I drank too much but can handle it on my own.’ “The family’s denial is ‘I don’t have a problem. He is the one with the problem. I will be fine.’ In a way, that is obviously true. But what we need to do as a community and as a culture is to break that down.” Epstein said some types of care may be underrepresented in treating people with addiction or substance abuse. “In most of our training, you start medical first and then go social second, but if there are any issues with mood or anxiety, one of the first things you want to find out is whether something organic or biological is going on, and that is often controlled by a primary care doctor, psychiatrist or physician,” Spitalnick said. “Quieting the Silence” was a successful event, Berman said. “It was wonderful to have the community come together to learn more about mental health and substance abuse. We were able to start the difficult conversations of what the issues are and how our community can address them.” The Berman Center plans to hold a similar night of education in the fall that will focus on youths and to present many more events that break the shame of mental health and substance abuse. “Our goal,” Berman said, “is to bring awareness to the community that mental illness and substance abuse do not discriminate based on religion, race, ethnicity or socio-economic status.” Authors note: Clements is currently married with one child and has devoted herself to helping other women fight substance abuse while working as the women’s director for a sober living program.

Michael,Gordon,995,http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/business/home-lending-restrictions-tipped-to-ease-by-year-end/,"8:30a.m. - 12p.m. Home lending restrictions could be eased again by the end of this year, an economist is predicting. The Reserve Bank left property loan restrictions on hold today after easing them slightly in January. Loan-to-value ratio restrictions have been in place since October 2013, requiring most home buyers to have a 20 percent deposit. In January they were eased to allow banks to lend up to 15 percent of their new lending to owner-occupiers with a deposit of less than 20 percent - up from 10 percent. At the same time, the cap for lending to investors eased to allow the banks to lend up to 5 percent to investors with equity of less than 35 percent - down from 40 percent equity. Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac, said while there were no changes to the restrictions this time he expected that to change by the end of the year. ""We expect an easing by year-end as new Government policies weigh on investor demand for housing."" In its financial stability report released today, the Reserve Bank said that household mortgage debt remained high. ""However, financial risk has lessened with both lending and house price growth slowing in the past 12 months – in part due to our imposition of loan-to-value (LVR) ratio restrictions."" But it said lending growth needed to be further sustained before it gained enough confidence to ease restrictions again. Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr said it would be looking to at least the next financial stability report before it made any further decisions on easing lending restrictions. The next report is due out at the end of November. ""It is still early days around the slower credit growth we have observed,"" Orr said at a press conference held after the release of the report. Credit growth - or the amount of money the banks are lending out - has slowed to 6 percent in the last year which was still slightly above income growth. While the growth in house prices had slowed to 4 percent in the year to April. Orr said one challenge for the banking sector was that while the loan restrictions had an impact on new lending it would take a long time before the average risk levels across bank loan books became more comfortable. The central bank's report said the continued stabilisation, or a further reduction, in the growth rates of household debt and house prices, would be required before the riskto the financial system was normalised. Gordon said despite the vagueness of the Reserve Bank's criteria for easing loan restrictions he believed they would be met before the end of the year. ""The Government is introducing a series of new policies aimed at cooling investor demand for housing, one of which is already in play: the extension of the 'bright line' test for taxation of capital gains came into effect at the end of March."" Gordon said house sales and prices were fairly muted in April and the bank expected that to be repeated over the coming months. ""We are forecasting annual house price growth to slow to zero by the end of this year."" That may be more pessimistic than the central bank's own predictions. Deputy governor Geoff Bascand said today he expected house price growth to have a moderate track over the next few years rising at about 2 to 3 percent a year. Orr also said some of the Reserve Bank's reluctance to ease restrictions was around what the banks would do. ""Our challenge around confidence is to think what would happen in the absence of these LVRs. Would banks go back to their less prudent lending behaviours or would they have picked up a lesson?"" He said this issue would be part of its conduct inquiry into the banks and it would be talking to them about their lending horizons.

Andrew,Davis,989,http://www.china.org.cn/arts/2018-05/29/content_51530384.htm,"The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO) concluded its China tour in Beijing last Thursday. It teamed up with a renowned Chinese violinist, giving music fans a night to remember. Founded in 1906, the MSO is the oldest and the most renowned professional orchestra in Australia and the southern hemisphere. Under the baton of world-famous British conductor Sir Andrew Davis, the band treated the audience with Carl Vine's Five, a tune composed by a native Australian musician, Bruch's No. 1 Violin Concerto, and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6, the Pathetique. Sir Andrew Davis was appointed the Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for his illustrious conductorship. He has conducted so many distinguished concerts including the one celebrating the Queen's Golden Jubilee. And Paganini Violin Competition's first place winner Lyu Siqing is also an endeared artist among classical music fans. So their teaming up on stage is a rare treat for audiences here in Beijing. It's the band's first major China tour in sixteen years, as they toured six cities in ten days. Performing alongside the orchestra was Lyu Siqing, the first Asian violinist to win the first place at the prestigious Paganini Violin Competition in 1987. He is now one of the most renowned violinists on the world stage right now. Lyu is only one of eight Chinese artists that the orchestra plans to collaborate this year. He says the orchestra has a deep connection with Chinese artists.

Andrew,Davis,986,http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/20180528/starr-shares-message-of-sacrifice-reflection-in-lubbock-memorial-day-service,"It was a hot day on base in Qatar on a September day in 2012. Retired United States Air Force Col. Michael Bob Starr remembers standing on a bridge on base with about 200 other airmen and Marines gathered to pay respects to a fallen U.S. Marine lying in a flag-draped coffin preparing to embark on his last trip home to Pennsylvania. Just a few days before, Chris ""Otis"" Rival lost his life when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded above him as he was working to save countless service men and women from an attack on the base. ""I never met Otis Rival in person,"" Starr, a 23-year-veteran, recalled Monday during the 16th annual Memorial Day Service at the City of Lubbock Cemetery. But to this day, Starr said he thinks of Rival - and the countless others like him who lost their lives in combat - every Memorial Day. ""I had to run several errands in Abilene over Friday and Saturday and more than once, as I was paying for my items, the person at the register wished me a happy Memorial Day,"" Starr said. ""I think they meant well but I don't think they get it. There's nothing happy about Memorial Day. There are too many people that think Memorial Day is about barbecues and summer vacation. There's nothing wrong with those things. I'm for both of them, but Memorial Day is the day we set aside to remember those who gave their lives in defense of our nation."" During his speech, Starr shared Rival's story and the story of another veteran with a marker at the City of Lubbock Cemetery - George Andrew Davis Jr. Lt. Col. Davis, with the U.S. Air Force, was a Medal of Honor recipient who died on Feb. 10, 1952. Jose ""Tres"" Salinas III, president of Veterans of Wars motorcycle group, and Orlando ""Big O"" Sandoval, vice president of the group, said Davis was one of the reasons the group chose to attend the ceremony Monday and set up American flags lining the entrance to the cemetery. The group was joined by members of La Familia motorcycle club. Their bikes, many decorated with U.S. and military flags, lined parking spots by the gazebo where the ceremony took place Monday. Salinas, who served in the U.S. Army from 1989 to 1999, said the group's purpose is to provide support for veterans and their families. Sandoval, who served in the Special Forces from 1982 to 2000, said they've don't projects like help fix roofs, build ramps and line the flags at the cemetery. While they hope to help as many people as they can, they also hope to bring a focus back to the real reason Memorial Day is celebrated - the fallen veterans, he said. ""Today is not a happy day,"" he said. ""It's a very sad day."" During his speech, Star said Davis was a pilot. His plan was shot down during a mission but his body never made it back to U.S. soil. His body and belongings, Star said, currently sit in a museum overseas. A marker for him sits alone between two trees inside the City of Lubbock Cemetery. On Monday, it was decorated with a small flag. ""Memorial Day's purpose is to remember, to preserve the memories, especially, in particular, the memories of those who gave their lives defending our nation,"" Starr said.

Michael,Gordon,985,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article212066309.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 28, 2018 02:55 PM After days of rinse and repeat, the Charlotte area faces even heavier rainfall — and the chance of flooding — from the wet embrace of approaching subtropical storm Alberto. The National Weather Service forecast through Thursday for western North Carolina carries almost a mantra-like quality: heavy rain with possible flooding each day. Alberto, after loading both barrels with warm, tropical moisture from the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to bring flooding to the Florida Panhandle before heading north. Rain and thunderstorms are supposed to intensify throughout the Carolinas until at least Tuesday night. Given that the ground already is saturated from two weeks of showers, the chance of flash flooding becomes a significant threat, the weather service says. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. If there is good news for the Charlotte area, it is this: Duke Energy meteorologists believe that the heaviest rainfall will hit west of the city, higher up in the Catawba River basin or another drainage area entirely. That gives Duke more time and more reservoirs to control the downstream flow, says spokeswoman Kim Crawford. Many of the area lakes already are at higher-than-normal levels, she says, leading Duke to release more water through its dams to create storage space for what is expected to be rolling down from the west. Unless conditions worsen, she says, Duke doesn't expect a ""spillage"" problem along its lakes or the river. What may arise from Charlotte's creeks, culverts and paved surfaces remains to be seen. Below the Lake Wylie Dam in Fort Mill on Monday morning, water thundered down the main spillway and into a free-flowing Catawba rising toward its banks. Overhead, a pair of osprey circled in the mist, searching for breakfast. Below, two great blue herons glided in a few feet above the river, looking for a place to land and fish. The shallows, where the birds like to hunt, had already become hard to find. View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

Now, government prosecutors are sifting through the pieces of their murder cases against two of Doyle's alleged killers after both of their trials ended in hung juries in May. Doyle, 64, a wealthy Wyoming car dealer who moved to Charlotte in 2009, spoke often and openly about how he stashed gold and cash in the anticipation of a government or economic collapse. In July 2015, he was found dead inside his home in the RiverPointe community on Lake Wylie. Doyle had been tied to a living room chair with parachute cord. Search warrants at the time said he had been burned, stabbed and beaten. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The attorney of one of the eventual suspects said Doyle was tortured because he would not give up the combination to his safe or the location of his gold. Investigators later called in a locksmith to open the safe. Inside they found loaded guns and an emergency stash of cash and gold coins. The amount of valuables has remained unclear. Three men were arrested and charged with the killing, including Doyle's gardener, a former methamphetamine addict named Peter Gould who knew from conversations with Doyle what was supposedly hidden in his employer's home, Gould's attorney said at the time. Gould quickly agreed to cooperate with the Mecklenburg County District Attorney's Office in its cases against his alleged accomplices — half-brothers Daniel Blakney and Tardra Bouknight, who, like Gould, had criminal records dating back more than a decade. Dean Loven, Gould's attorney, says it was his client who came up with the idea of breaking into Doyle's home to steal the gold. But what started as a burglary on July 18, 2015, quickly escalated. A neighbor found Doyle the next afternoon lying in a pool of blood. In an agreement with the district attorney's office, Gould eventually pleaded guilty to a series of lesser charges — and a 20-year prison sentence — in exchange for cooperating with prosecutors. However, his testimony this month against Blakney and Bouknight proved to be less than persuasive for the juries. On May 8, Superior Court Judge Greg Hayes declared a mistrial when jurors said they could not reach a unanimous verdict about Blakney. Two weeks later, Hayes declared another mistrial when Bouknight's jury also deadlocked. Assistant District Attorney Bill Bunting, head of the homicide team for the district attorney's office, told the Observer on Monday that prosecutors plan to retry Blakney at a later date. A decision on Bouknight is pending, said Bunting, who declined to comment further. Blakney's attorney, Johneric Emehel of Charlotte, said Monday that his client should have been acquitted based on what he described as Gould's dubious testimony. Gould ""gave varied accounts of what happened that were inconsistent with the physical evidence,"" Emehel said. ""The state failed to make its case, and the jury agreed."" Peter Anderson, who represents Bouknight, could not be immediately reached for comment Monday. View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

Bob,Diamond,979,http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-5774815/RUTH-SUNDERLAND-Britain-needs-real-business-bank-not-just-casino.html,"By Ruth Sunderland for the Mail on Sunday Published: 16:26 EST, 26 May 2018 | Updated: 06:30 EST, 27 May 2018 10 View comments Do we really need a big British investment bank? I ask the question because Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, apparently believes we do – and he thinks that the City regulators are of the same mind. One of the many battles Staley has been fighting is against activist investor Edward Bramson, who wants Barclays to scale back its investment banking arm. Staley, a Wall Streeter imported to Canary Wharf from JP Morgan, is determined to hold on to it. Not only that, but he is also said to believe the regulators will back him, on the basis it would be bad for the country to lose our only remaining home-grown investment bank. Ruth Sunderland says generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank Since the Big Bang opened up the Square Mile to overseas players in 1986, the investment banking scene has been dominated by the big boys from the US: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley et al. It’s rather like Wimbledon –lovely when the top players happen to be British, but not essential. The main thing is that Britain plays host, not the nationality of the participants. There is a respectable argument that the UK needs an investment bank of its own to look after its interest when underwriting Government debt issues. But generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank, which provides straightforward banking services to individuals and firms, from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank. The bank has suffered almost from a split-personality, with the workaday UK operation on one side and the casino on the other. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays The conflict between the two is reflected in the way the bank has swung to-and-fro in the selection of its chief executives: investment banker Staley follows Antony Jenkins from the retail side, who in turn came as an antidote to Bob Diamond. But there is a larger point at stake. The financial crisis revealed how taxpayers could end up having to foot the bill for the antics of casino banks. For much of the 20th Century, this was not an issue because of post-Depression era rules brought in during the 1930s that meant investment banking and the humdrum high street variety had to be kept separate. That legislation was repealed in the late 1990s, and many observers see it as a major factor in the crisis. As a consequence, we now have ‘ring-fencing’ where large operators such as Barclays are allowed to own investment and retail banks but have to quarantine them off from one another. The history of ‘ring-fences’ and ‘Chinese Walls’, however, is that they are not fool-proof and can erode over time. Barclays has been struggling for years to overcome a toxic culture where it historically, and recently, has been at odds with regulators. Relations came close to breaking down totally in the Bob Diamond era and Staley had his own run-in, when he was recently censured for attempting to expose a whistleblower. The bank has been dogged by a crisis era loan of $3 billion it made to Qatari investors, when it carried out an £11.8 billion emergency fund-raising in 2008 to avoid a UK Government bail-out. Charges by the Serious Fraud Office related to that loan have been thrown out by a court but former senior managers are still on the hook. Staley’s view on the investment bank has been at odds with the previously expressed opinion of the chairman, who has said he thought it best to shrink it. In any event, the notion that Barclays wants to save its investment bank for the good of the nation, rather than its own highly bonused employees, invites scepticism. The City has oodles of investment banking expertise, which is great for larger companies. Small and medium firms, however, have far too often been exploited and maltreated by their lenders. It may not be as exciting, or as lucrative, but what we really do need is a properly functioning business bank.

The Mecklenburg jury handed down its guilty verdict against Emmanuel Rangel, 22, after a 10-day trial. Police say Rangel and Edward Sanchez were after drugs when they shot and killed three people in February 2015 in a home outside of uptown Charlotte. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The dead included 19-year-old Mirjana Puhar, a former contestant on the TV show ""America's Next Top Model."" Sanchez was convicted of four murders last year, including that of Rosool Harrell, 22, a Xanax dealer, who was shot outside a Matthews hotel two days before the other killings. Charges against two other co-defendants are pending. After his arrest, federal officials said Rangel had wrongly been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program protection from deportation despite appearing in a federal database of suspected gang members.

Negotiations are to speed up from next week on an expected £60 million deal. While Liverpool seek to demonstrate their improvement on the pitch by beating Real Madrid, completing the transfer of Fekir would show that they mean business off it. The Anfield recruitment team, led by sporting director Michael Edwards and the Fenway Sports Group president, Michael Gordon, are advanced in their planning for next season, eager to build on this campaign's success. Liverpool still crave what is generally referred to around the club, even among the executives, as ""No 19"". Liverpool's last league title, their 18th, was won in 1990, but there is a significant points gap to bridge to catch Manchester City. Fekir would be seen as a direct replacement for Philippe Coutinho, who joined Barcelona in January for £142 million - an attacking midfielder who can play in an advanced role or a midfield three in Jurgen Klopp's side.

John,O'Neil,974,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-indigenous-groups-in-bc-welcome-traditional-chinese-medicine-clinics/,"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. Archie Sam has been racked with back pain for several years, the result of two accidents − one at work and one while driving − that he says put him on life support twice. But Mr. Sam, a member of the Sto:lo Nation, hasn’t been interested in pharmaceutical pain remedies. He worries pills would mess with his mind and body. He is, however, interested in the Chinese acupuncture clinic that opened earlier this month on his home reserve. Story continues below advertisement “My doctor told me that I would have pain further down the road and it would be excruciating,” said Mr. Sam, who noted he is not on any medication at all for the pain. He once relied on alcohol, but now avoids that. “What I am looking for is natural medicine, such as herbs from the land,” said Mr. Sam, who says the opening of a traditional Chinese medicine clinic in his community on Seabird Island is something that he can relate to. “I believe that traditional medicine is what I would [want] for myself.” Dr. Michael Chung, left, Dr. Jackie Wu provide acupuncture treatment to Seabird Island First Nation member Brian Govereu. Rick Collins The clinic began offering services earlier this month every other Wednesday on the reserve. Seabird Island is one of more than 10 First Nations communities in British Columbia, including Sumas in Abbotsford, where Chinese-medicine doctors have offered help. A pilot project, launched by the Tzu Chi Foundation Canada, Snuneymuxw First Nation and Simon Fraser University, aims to do similar things for other Indigenous communities searching for health-care alternatives. Racheal Eni, acupuncturist at Snuneymuxw Health Centre on Vancouver Island, said she usually treats about 12 to 13 patients a day and her service is always fully booked. She said traditional Chinese medicine − or TCM − is a comfortable fit for many Indigenous patients because communities have a cultural inclination to pay attention to natural food and natural medicines. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Dr. Eni noted that while Western medicine is important and necessary where it works the best, the complicated health issues existing in the Indigenous communities, means some people have been struggling with “over-medicalization.” “For First Nations, the health issues are quite complex and chronic that people have issues that arrive from poverty, marginalization and colonization,” she said. “People [have been] really depending on prescription drugs for a very long time without considering other options.” SFU health-science professor John O’Neil has been studying aboriginal health for more than three decades. He said Western medicine hasn’t responded well toward many health issues in Indigenous communities such as chronic diseases and extraordinary levels of stress and pain. The opioid crisis has only added to the turmoil within the Indigenous population as people have gotten used to prescription medication to deal with pain. “There is a significant need in the First Nations communities for any kind of health care response that is useful,” said Prof. O’Neil. Story continues below advertisement Michael Chung, chief governor of Tzu Chi International Medical Association, said the foundation first connected with people from First Nations communities in 2014. By then, he noted, they were treating homeless mothers with children at Vancouver’s Aboriginal Mother Center. After receiving positive feedback from the community, the organization thought their services might be welcomed by other bands. Prof. O’Neil said he has received lots of testimonial evidence indicating that TCM has a very positive impact on First Nations communities, but he noted there is still a lack of clinical evaluations and solid scientific evidence. He added that it would require a very expensive and lengthy study to provide solid scientifically valid clinical evidence, and no one is willing to fund that type of study in Canada. Acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine are not regulated nationwide in Canada. Currently, B.C. and Ontario regulate both TCM practitioners and acupuncturists. Alberta, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador regulate acupuncturists only. The Medical Service Plan of British Columbia now covers 10 acupuncture treatments per year, with other alternative care for certain low-income groups, and each service will be reimbursed $23. Story continues below advertisement Dr. Chung noted that the foundation is also planning to work with several colleges in those Indigenous communities and establish TCM programs to train the young generation. He said the idea was partly inspired by some First Nations young people who received training with TCM, with a goal of serving their own communities. Karyn Smith, from Dzawada’enuxw First Nation in Kingcome Inlet, studied TCM at the International College of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Vancouver. After graduation, she served a few Indigenous communities in B.C. and now treats people in the Stó:lo First Nation in Chilliwack. She said both Indigenous traditional medicine and TCM see a person having a connection between their mind and body, and treat a whole person not just their symptoms. She added that the two traditional practices believe people should live in accordance with the environment and keep to a more local diet. Medicine, both cultures emphasize, are mostly found in plants that are around them. “I hope to bring it to more First Nations communities because I think it’s a really good fit,” said Smith.

Trouble averted: Jonathan Wright wearing the One Solutions sponsored jumper in 2013.Credit:Anthony Johnson The Sharks' partnership with One Solutions - which was once the club's front-of-jersey sponsor in a $330,000 plus GST deal - spectacularly unravelled in the wake of Michael Gordon not being granted a mid-season release to Parramatta in 2015. One Solutions was seeking $120,161.16 in compensation from the Sharks, who won their maiden premiership in 2016. But the parties have reached an out-of-court settlement, just prior to details of how the partnership came crashing down were expected to be aired in the Supreme Court. It's the third major case the Sharks have avoided being dragged through the courts in the past nine months. The Sharks reached settlements with more than half of their 2011 top grade squad over the ASADA scandal as well as Todd Carney in his unfair dismissal case, in which he originally sought $2.4 million in damages after being sacked over the infamous ""bubbler"" incident. It's another welcome relief for a club which is chasing a sixth straight NRL win and perhaps won't be counting the cost of the State of Origin player drain like it has in previous years. And coach Shane Flanagan has candidly revealed talk of the Sharks riding their longest winning streak since their premiership year won't be tolerated in the Shire. ""This is a new journey and it was a big error on my part last year to keep referring back to '16,"" Flanagan said before the clash with the Knights on Sunday. ""This is a new team, a new journey with new players and we're celebrating the style of footy we're playing and the players in my team. We'll never ever replicate 2016. That's over. ""Can we win the comp again? Of course we can. We don't refer back to it anymore and we just concentrate on what we're doing now and the journey we're on this year."" Co-captain Wade Graham and Luke Lewis will return for Cronulla just a week after Paul Gallen as Flanagan's back-row crisis officially comes to an end. Australian and NSW regular Graham is facing an uphill battle to force his way into Brad Fittler's squad for the Melbourne Cricket Ground opener having struggled with a recurring hamstring complaint this season. ""He's played for Australia and Origin last year and I'm sure he planned on playing it this year,"" Flanagan said. ""It's not over for him. ""Whether he's picked in the first game, I'm not quite sure. If he's not there for game one I'm sure he'll push for the final two games. At the start of the year we probably thought we'd have four or five missing - I don't know if that's going to be the case - but we just need to handle this next bloc of rep footy really well. ""It's been a really enjoyable month-and-a-bit, but we've got to keep going. If we don't go up there with the right attitude it will all come to an end.""

Negotiations are to speed up from next week on an expected £60 million deal. While Liverpool seek to demonstrate their improvement on the pitch by beating Real Madrid, completing the transfer of Fekir would show that they mean business off it.

Michael,Gordon,972,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article211814764.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 25, 2018 09:48 AM A former political candidate who has filed more than 160 lawsuits across North Carolina has been blocked in the Mecklenburg courts from entering new complaints without prior approval. Superior Court Judge Lisa Bell says she orally issued what is known as a ""gatekeeper"" order against Tigress McDaniel last week and plans to sign a written order in the coming days. It bans McDaniel from making any new legal filings unless they have been approved ahead of time by either the county's chief magistrate judge, the chief district court judge or one of the county's resident superior court judges, Bell said. McDaniel can also proceed if an attorney in good standing before the Mecklenburg and North Carolina bars assures the courts that her filing is not frivolous and has legal merit. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The order does not apply to federal courts, where McDaniel has filed lawsuits in the past. Nor does it affect complaints McDaniel filed before Bell's order. McDaniel was not on hand May 18 to hear Bell's order. She did not reply to Observer emails Thursday seeking comment. Earlier this month, McDaniel was an unsuccessful candidate in the Democratic primary for an at-large seat on the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners. Gatekeeper orders in North Carolina are rare. Bell told the Observer she handed down the restrictions against McDaniel ""to protect the integrity"" of the Mecklenburg judicial process. A 2017 gatekeeper order against McDaniel in Rowan County found that she had filed 162 lawsuits in 72 N.C. counties. Her complaints have targeted public bodies, lawyers, landlords and others with whom she has done business. According to Bell, McDaniel has failed to follow the rules of civil procedure in her Mecklenburg cases and had filed lawsuits ""for the purpose of harassment."" McDaniel serves as her own attorney and has had the normal filing fees waived by declaring that she is indigent, Bell said. A Superior Court lawsuit costs $200 to file; district court, $150. The Mecklenburg sheriff's office also charges $30 per person to deliver the complaint to defendants. McDaniel, then known as Tosha McDougal, served about 20 months in state prison after being convicted in 2006 in Cabarrus County on charges of obtaining property under false pretenses and identity theft. She maintains her innocence. In March, the Observer reported on McDaniel's suit against two Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools parents, the district, the school board and several employees over the dietary and health needs of her son. McDaniel dropped the complaint on April 16 during a court hearing. But Bell said McDaniel did not inform the judge that she had filed an identical complaint four days before against the same parties, including a CMS volunteer whom Bell had dropped from the case on April 10. McDaniel's latest complaint added two new defendants: the Observer and Charlotte attorney Lane Williamson, who represented the CMS volunteer whom Bell removed. Williamson said Thursday in an email that the restrictions on any future lawsuits by McDaniel is an appropriate step. ""Given Ms. McDaniel’s extensive history of abuse of the judicial process, the remedy of a gatekeeper order is necessary to restrain her from burdening the courts and the public with her manifestly frivolous lawsuits,"" he said.

Steve,Cummings,970,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/doug-ryder-determined-to-strengthen-dimension-data-and-keep-mark-cavendish/,"African team talking to Deloitte and Manx sprinter in key moment for team's future Dimension Data team manager Doug Ryder is hoping to keep both Deloitte as a major sponsor and Mark Cavendish as a team leader in 2019 as the African WorldTour team tries to fight back after a testing spring hit by injuries to a string of leading riders.Related ArticlesTransfer Mechanics: The lay of the land in 2018Keep calm and carry on - Dimension Data's sorry season so farTour of California: I'm not just here to mill around, says CavendishTransfer Mechanics: Round-up from the Giro d'ItaliaMark Cavendish to ride Tour of Slovenia and Adriatica Ionica Race ahead of Tour de FranceMark Cavendish can still beat everybody, says Aldag Last week the usually well-informed Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf first reported that Deloitte would no longer back the Dimension Data team in 2019 and instead join up with bike brand Giant to replace BMC as title sponsor of Jim Ochowicz's squad for 2019. Cyclingnews understands that Ochowicz has confirmed to his riders that the reports of Deloitte coming on board are not true and he is hoping to fund a team for 2019 via sponsorship from Giant, as well as existing partners Sophos, and Swisse Vitamin. The reports about Deloitte caused Ryder a few sleepless nights. He was with a group of important Deloitte guests at the Tour of California when De Telegraaf published its story, and Deloitte never confirmed or denied the reports. The precarious nature of professional cycling and the huge budgets needed to sign the biggest riders and provide them with the best support means the WorldTour is often dog eat dog and a battle of survival. However, Ryder ruled out a merger with the BMC Racing team, despite reports that Dimension Data will ride BMC bikes in 2019. He is focused on securing the next phase of the African team's future and is convinced the team can continue to help develop African riders and help African children via the Qhubeka charity. ""There are lots of conversations going on with sponsors all the time and I don't think reports like that help anyone, neither us or even Jim Ochowicz as he tries to secure the future of his team,"" Ryder told Cyclingnews at the Giro d'Italia. ""Our contract with Deloitte is up for renewal and we're in conversation with them. I'm not sure if it will be yes or no but we want to maintain the partners we have because we have some amazing partners and we've brought some amazing partners into the sport. We want to continue to do things a little differently."" The 2018 Dimension Data squad includes 13 African riders, who the team are helping to develop, with Cavendish, Edvald Boasson Hagen, Louis Meintjes, Steve Cummings, Igor Anton as stand-out riders. Although Meintjes was forced to quit the Giro d'Italia due to illness, 22-year-old Australian Ben O'Connor has emerged as a future Grand Tour talent. He is currently 12th overall and third in the best young rider competition. Mark Cavendish's arrival at Dimension Data in 2016 lifted the squad to a new level, securing the team WorldTour status. He won four stages at the 2016 Tour de France, including the opening sprint stage that gave the team the first yellow jersey of the race. Steve Cummings won a stage to Mende in 2015 on Nelson Mandela Day when the team was known as MTN-Qhubeka. Cavendish turned 33 last week and has endured a difficult spring due to crashes and injury but his decade of sprinting success means he is one of the few globally recognised athletes in professional cycling. Cavendish helped bring Deloitte and Oakley to the Dimension Data team and his choice of teams for 2019 could still significantly shape the sponsorship market. If Cavendish opts not to stay with Dimension Data it could undermine Ryder's plans for the future. He would have to find a new team leader, in a difficult market, to keep his major sponsors happy and ensure success in 2019. ""We'd love to keep Mark. He's core to our team, an amazing individual, and has done a huge amount for the Qhubeka charity. It'd be a privilege to keep Mark in the team for 2019, we'd love to keep him,"" Ryder told Cyclingnews. ""Mark's had a tough start to 2018 but you never write off a champion and Mark is a born-and-bred champion. He fights every day. He's still hungry and wants to do a lot. We're confident he will be back at his best for the Tour de France."" The Dimension Data team have won just three races this season after injuries massively disrupted their ambitions and race rosters. They sometimes face problems securing visa for their African riders, obliging other riders to step up and race more. Their African status makes them unique and attractive to sponsors but makes it harder to compete at WorldTour level. Their current difficulties coincide with the end of the Deloitte sponsorship and Cavendish's three-year contract. ""If you look at our Classics group, five out of our eight riders were eating hospital food in the spring instead of racing. We had to bring other riders in and that affected their race programmes. It has been tough but we're through it now and confident we're fighting back,"" Ryder explained. ""The sun shone on our backs for a long time but we know every team has its ups and downs. We're just riding that down wave at the moment but we'll be back soon. We won Milan-San Remo in 2013 when we'd just stepped up a level. In 2015 we were in the top three of the Tour de France teams classification with three days to go. Mark gave us that special moment in 2016 and Steve Cummings won on Mandela Day. That was a historic moment. ""The tough times unite a team together and connect everybody. Of course, sometimes people don't believe in each other anymore but our team know that if we do well, race well, we end up doing more for the Qhubeka charity. Our success reflects on the donations to that. That's what motivates us and picks ups up every day. This team has another dimension, we have something to focus on when times are hard.""

SANTA FE, N.M. — In 1921, the New York Times named Taos the “Provincetown of the Desert,” comparing the small, high desert town in New Mexico to a long-established art colony on Cape Cod, Mass. The Times report was recognition of Taos’ own up-and-coming status in the art world, spurred by the Taos Society of Artists. The 12-person collective, which included painters who had moved in from the Midwest and East Coast, like Joseph Henry Sharp, Ernest Blumenschein and E.I. Couse, existed from 1915 to 1927. Most of the members became famous for their paintings of New Mexico landscapes, and the Pueblo people who lived in and around Taos. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “It preserved a record of a time and of the peoples in that time, principally in northern New Mexico,” said Carl Jones, president of the Couse Foundation, an organization named after the art society’s first president that operates the Couse-Sharp Historic Site in downtown Taos. The society “helped preserve customs, traditions, on canvas, that would’ve been lost a long time ago,” Jones said. The existing site includes studios of both Couse and Sharp. For the past several years, the foundation has been in talks about a central location for archival and research materials about all the Taos collective’s members. A recent grant of $600,000 has pushed the plan closer toward its goal of a 2021 opening. The Lunder Foundation, a Portland, Maine, organization started by Dexter Shoe Co. founder Peter Lunder and his wife, Paula, awarded the grant earlier this month. Jones wouldn’t say how much the total project will cost, but noted that a public fundraising campaign is on the horizon. The facility will be named The Lunder Research Center. “This is an opportunity to do something significant for the first time with Western art,” said Kevin Gillis, the Lunder Foundation’s president. He said most of the organization’s grants are given on the East Coast, despite the Lunder couple’s affinity for Western art. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “Peter and Paula think what Couse is doing is very worthwhile,” Gillis said. The Couse Foundation in Taos, which is planning an archival and research facility for materials related to the Taos Society of Artists, recently received a $600,000 grant to further the project. (SOURCE: The Couse Foundation) The grant, Jones said, will go toward repurposing a building next to the existing historic site. With 4,800 square feet of usable space, the research center will have a storage room for items like original documents; a smaller storage space for Native American artifacts collected by the Taos artists; a research library with literature on the society and the histories of New Mexico, Taos, and native peoples; a conservation space dedicated to the preservation of decades-old materials, and administrative offices for the Couse Foundation. Jones said he expects the facility to attract Western art professors, authors, graduate students and other scholars specifically studying the Taos Society artists and their work. The research center building has housed the Mission Gallery, whose owner is retiring. Parts of the Mission building are remnants of Sharp’s home, according to Jones. The center’s collection will include documents, articles, photos, artifacts and artworks relating to or previously belonging to almost all 12 society members, including Couse, Sharp, Blumenschein, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, Julius Rolshoven, E. Martin Hennings and W. Herbert Dunton. Jones said that as the center establishes itself, he hopes to attract items specifically relating to other society members who didn’t leave as much behind. For Couse alone, the collection includes 10,000 photographic negatives and 5,000 photo prints, all relating to his artwork. Also in the center will be more than 30 Couse sketchbooks, paintings, personal letters and records of who purchased his paintings, and about 30 pairs of moccasins and other pieces of Native American clothing he collected. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Notre Dame connection “It’s going to be the most extensive, highly specialized archive on any group of artists,” said Dean Porter, a Taos Society scholar and retired director of the University of Notre Dame’s Snite Museum of Art. The main gallery and reception area of the research center will be named after Porter. He and several Taos Society experts from across the county have donated or promised the project various items. Porter is the author of several articles and books about Ufer and Higgins, whose work he discovered in the 1970s as part of Norte Dame’s museum collection. He also studied and wrote about the entire society as a co-author of the 1999 book “Taos Artists and their Patrons: 1898-1950.” He’s promised the center an estimated 20 boxes of materials, including interviews he conducted with close acquaintances and relatives of the Taos artists, like Oscar Berninghaus’ daughter and Higgins’ caretaker, as well as books, research papers and news articles. “Every article ever written on the Taos Society of Artists I have copies of,” Porter said during a recent phone interview from his home in Granger, Ind. He wishes something like the research center had existed when he started his work on the society more than 40 years ago. There’s a new generation of Taos Society scholars coming up nationwide who will benefit from access to the center collection, he said. Personal items like letters and notes will provide an inside look at the artists’ lives and thoughts. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Porter recalled a time when there wasn’t much focus on documents and papers relating to the Taos Society artists. He recalled a trip to New Mexico in 1975 when he visited Higgins’ first wife, Sara Parsons, during which time she handed him five paper grocery bags full of his letters, notes and receipts. “That was the archives,” he said with a laugh. The project is designed to bring materials like that back home, said Jones. He said there’s a risk they could end up donated and scattered among colleges and universities across the country where they might never see the light of day. “It would’ve been a real loss to the state of New Mexico or the town,” he said. “This is where they were created and this is where they came from.” Advertisement Copyright © 2018 Albuquerque Journal | Albuquerque, N.M. $10/mo Subscribe Other Offers Already a subscriber?

Bob,Diamond,966,https://news.efinancialcareers.com/ie-en/316214/deutsche-barclays-bob-diamond-panmure-gordon,"by Beecher Tuttle 25 May 2018 Following a lengthy restructuring process, Barclays is still under a great deal of pressure – as is the bank’s chief executive, Jes Staley. Meanwhile, the man who once held Staley’s post, controversial former CEO Bob Diamond, is quietly thriving. Barclays’ struggling investment banking division hasn’t reversed course as quickly as many had hoped, despite an aggressive growth strategy championed by Staley. The slow progress led activist investor Edward Bramson last week to call on Barclays to take a knife to the investment bank, stripping it of virtually all trading functions. Now, Barclays is said to be mulling a merger with fellow British bank Standard Chartered as a potential attempt to thwart Bramson’s demands. While the details of the rumor are murky, what’s clear is that Staley has his hands full. Diamond, who resigned amid the Libor controversy in 2012, appears to be enjoying more success while tangentially dipping his toes back into investment banking. London stockbroker Panmure Gordon, owned by Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital, is building an advisory and equity capital markets business, according to Financial News. The firm plans to double its headcount in London in the “medium term” after bringing on an M&A head back in January. Future hires will include managing director-level bankers as well as juniors. While Diamond doesn’t personally run Panmure Gordon, his fingerprints were likely all over the move. At the time of the takeover, Panmure’s then-CEO Patric Johnson said the firm would not become ""Barclays 2.0. It is not Bob Diamond coming back in and saying he is going to be chief executive.” Just one month later, Diamond’s firm replaced Johnson with a familiar face: former Barclays executive Ian Axe, who hinted at expanding the investment bank at the time of his hire. No matter how direct Dimon’s role, the former investment banker has to be smiling just a bit. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank just got kicked when it was already down. Literally hours after announcing plans to cut at least 7,000 jobs globally, Deutsche Bank acknowledged a Bloomberg report that it mistakenly transferred nearly $25 billion to Macquarie back in 2014 due to a human error. The blunder wouldn’t be as newsworthy if Deutsche Bank didn’t do something similar in March of this year, when it transferred 28 billion euros to its own Eurex account when it meant to transfer 28 billion yen. That’s a difference of $32.7 billion. When it rains, it pours. Meanwhile: Former Goldman Sachs CEO and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine isn’t exactly crushing it with his new hedge fund. He’s raised just around $20 million so far. (Fox Business) President Trump has signed a bill that will roll back some Dodd-Frank mandates that put restrictions on smaller community banks with less than $250 billion in assets. The bigger news may be that the bill won’t offer any exemptions for bulge-bracket banks. (Reuters) Bank of England Governor Mark Carney believes the mechanisms are now in place to remove and punish “rolling bad apples” within banking. Carney is in the camp that believes individual bankers should face similar punishments aimed at banks. (Bloomberg) Merrill Lynch brokers are reportedly up-in-arms over a new compensation program that punishes advisors who don’t meet certain cross-selling targets. Some claim the plan is being implemented retroactively, equating to a clawback. (WSJ) Credit Suisse has poached UBS veteran Ryan Nelson to take over its newly-created role of global head of prime financing. (HFM) Part of Deutsche Bank’s cuts include a team of 10 emerging markets bankers in London. (FN) Six senior women at J.P. Morgan wrote a letter to Stacey Cunningham to congratulate her on becoming the first female president of the New York Stock Exchange.

Andrew,Davis,964,https://www.canberratimes.com.au/business/the-economy/china-is-better-than-us-at-an-age-old-problem-20180524-p4zh8v.html,"Today finds me in a very hot and steamy Beijing where the temperature has reached 32 degrees, with smog threatening. But this city seems to have brushed it off. It’s an exciting place to be. Last night saw a brilliant performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra to a very grateful and respectful audience as Sir Andrew Davis, one of the top 10 conductors in the world, took the orchestra through the works of Vine, Bruch and Tchaikovsky. The audience enthusiastically demanded two encores before we all went on to a grand reception. This country really knows how to entertain people. China has 16 per cent of its population aged over 60 compared with Australia’s 21 per cent. Business is banqueting, and banqueting is business in China. Tonight’s banquet, I’m told will be no less than eight courses starting at 6pm and finishing at 7pm. Charlie’s quick mind works out that’s a course every seven minutes. I dare not ask for the vegetarian option for fear of having the same dish eight times over, as happened to a leading Australian educationist recently. I am also advised that there will be two speeches and six toasts of a fiery drink called Baijiu, the most consumed distilled spirit in the world. This is a very organised place and as we arrived, the news broke that the Chinese government is planning to scrap control on families completely, having imposed the one child policy in 1979 and revised it in 2015 to allow a second child. Perhaps it is recognition that the modern Chinese woman cannot be controlled this way any more. But it also reflects a concern about the future of the country’s demographic spread. The Chinese government has no expectation that the country’s fertility rate will reach replacement in the near future. China has 16 per cent of its population aged over 60 compared with Australia’s 21 per cent and it is set to continue to age dramatically just like Japan which now has 33 per cent of its people over 60. An ageing country is ultimately a shrinking country. However, China is taking an approach to its older people that we could well learn from. I sat with a property developer who had built a village on the outskirts of Beijing, a city of 30 million people. This village has a population of 800,000, the majority of whom are about 100-years-old and he is looking for a place in Australia to build a village for around 20,000 so that his older people could take a break from time to time in our country. I’m not sure that we in Australia are doing the best by our aged folk. Families are not the strength that they once were. Hugh Mackay, the great commentator and author, makes the point that one in two families are now breaking up with members often living miles apart across busy cities. Many families are scattered all over the country. We have a wonderful country but as Mackay says we’re a society that is overanxious, overweight, overmedicated and financially overstretched with a third likely to be affected by mental illness. The Chinese are great planners. It’s nothing for them to have five, 10 or even 100-year visions and then apply the resources and energy to realise them. They also have a great sense of place and family. They can see the social and economic benefits of developing villages that we would call cities, which support the fabric of family life right through into old age. Charlie and Louise are both travelling with me and remind me that the backyard with the bungalow where the aged uncle Jack spent his retiring years has all but disappeared. “And so has the backyard,” laments Louise. We need much more proactive policies to respond positively to our ageing population. We need to provide encouragement for people aged over 60 to continue working well beyond the traditional retirement age. This will require us to develop suitable roles and provide ongoing retraining. We also need to reduce ageism among employers. Some might argue that increasing net migration helps but it won’t because migrants age as well. The other related challenge is suitable health care for those approaching the end of their life. As in all things, Australia’s provision of infrastructure lags behind the needs of a changing population. This visit to Beijing makes me think China’s forward planning may well be better than ours. The Middle Kingdom has been a source of wisdom for many centuries, and the more time I spend in this country the more I realise that we have a great deal to learn from each other. I’ll spend much of tomorrow looking further into the One Belt One Road initiative accompanied by another eight-course banquet I dare say. “And I’m already looking for a bigger belt,” says Charlie. “Before we hit the road,” quips Louise.

Andrew,Davis,964,https://www.vivathematadors.com/2018/5/24/17388418/tech-baseball-gets-run-ruled-by-tcu,"Texas Tech played their first game in the Big 12 tournament game last night, the team didn’t play well and got run-ruled by sixth seeded TCU. They now face elimination and will play second-seeded Oklahoma State tonight to try and stave off elimination. Ryan Sublette got the start for the Red Raiders last night, he only pitched one inning plus and gave up four runs on one hit and five walks. The Red Raider pitching staff as a whole gave up fourteen walks last night, way too much for a team trying to get a national seed in the NCAA tournament. Caleb Freeman finished the second inning for Sublette, giving up two runs of his own on 2 hits and struck out one batter. Connor Queen came in and pitched the next three innings. He gave up three runs on four hits, walked four batters, and struck out three on 62 pitches. Andrew Davis came in to pitch in the sixth inning and went an inning and a third. He gave up three runs on three hits and five walks, striking out one on 45 pitches. Nick Candelari also made an appearance in this game, finishing the seventh inning for Davis, giving up no hits and striking out one batter. The Red Raider bats were active last night as they accumulated 10 hits on the evening, but couldn’t string anything together as they only managed to score two runs. Josh Jung had the only scored RBI of the game, as Brian Klein scored on a wild pitch in the fifth inning. This team had a really bad night, but the good thing about college tournaments is that they are double elimination. The Red Raiders could go on a win streak and win this tournament! That redemption will start tonight against the Oklahoma State Cowboys. What do you all think of the game last night? Should we as fans be worried about getting run ruled in the Big 12 tournament? Let me know in the comment section below!

Michael,Gordon,963,https://www.nbr.co.nz/article/kiwifruit-turns-april-gold-exports-ng-215948,"The latest monthly merchandise trade figures have bounced back to a big surplus after slumping in March. Kiwifruit exports soared 82% to a new monthly high of $438 million, boosting overall export values to $5.05 billion, the second-best ever monthly total. (The highest was December 2017’s $5.5b.) Stats NZ international statistics manager Tehseen Islam said kiwifruit returns rose in all the main markets of China, Europe and Japan. “In April, the first month of the export season, the gold variety made up nearly three-quarters of the total value of kiwifruit exports,” he said. The trade balance in April rose to a $263m surplus from a downward revised March deficit of $156m after accounting for imports. In seasonally adjusted terms, exports jumped by 7% for the month. Meat exports rebounded 15% to $723m after a weak March, while a further pickup in dairy volumes and prices pushed values up 6.2% to $1.17b. Westpac economist Michael Gordon says: “This was a little stronger than we or the market expected, though it only partly compensates for the much softer than expected March result.” Rising fuel prices boosted the import side of the ledger; a 15% rise of $629m hit a new April high of $4.85b “Oil imports remained high after a jump in March – stocks were built up ahead of a major maintenance shutdown of the Marsden Point refinery in May,” Mr Gordon adds. Imports of plant and machinery continued their recent strength, while vehicles, parts, and accessories also rose after shipment disruptions in February. The trade deficit for the year to April widened to $3.76b from $3.51b in April 2017. ASB's senior rural economist Nathan Penny says that deficit is expected to narrow. ""In particular, we expect agricultural production to increase over the year and to boost export volumes, while export prices remain firm,"" he says. ""At the same time, growth in import values is likely to be more subdued as economic growth remains soft over 2018.""

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:00 pm The brains behind “A Street Piano for Ashland” (from left) are Amy Vik, Michael Gordon Lee and Annemarie Pero at Otis Park, where they are hoping to be able to place the street piano. The brains behind “A Street Piano for Ashland” (from left) are Amy Vik, Michael Gordon Lee and Annemarie Pero at Otis Park, where they are hoping to be able to place the street piano. As they all appreciate music, a trio of friends – Michael Gordon Lee, Amy Vik and Annemarie Pero – are seeking to bring a little harmony to the community with “A Street Piano for Ashland.” “People like music, music brings people together,” said Lee, pointing out that they would like to place a piano at Otis Park and keep it there June through the end of August or September for people around the community to play. “We kind of just want to liven up the streets,” said Pero, adding that they want to involve the community. While the group has only been corresponding with Ashland Parks and Recreation Director Sara Hudson about their idea since April, Lee and Vik noted that they’ve been thinking about it for some time. “Last summer I was in Willmar, Minnesota, and there’s a street piano there and I came back and I was telling Michael about it and how cool that’d be and I think that’s kind of the start of the idea,” Vik said. “Either that or the abandoned piano that we found on Highway 13,” said Lee. Vik recounted how she’d realized that Lee was, in fact, serious about the project when he brought it up again at the beginning of this past year and said they should actually do it. “We got the ball rolling,” said Lee, mentioning that they have plans to meet with Hudson this week. Hudson asserted that having a group of community members who are interested in taking on a project of this nature come forward is a huge benefit. “I’ve always said that when it’s a community idea and the community is behind it, that idea … is more successful because the community takes buy-in in it, and it’s not someone saying, ‘Yes we should do this,’ it’s really coming from within the community,” she said, adding that some of the most successful projects – like the trash cans and murals – have come about that way. “When I got an email from Michael I got kind of excited.” Hudson admitted that she initially believed it was doable and crazy at the same time. “I actually thought it was a really cool idea,” Hudson said, adding that she receives emails from an organization that encourages the placement of instruments in public places for people to play music. Some of the main concerns Hudson said she had were figuring out how to make this happen, how would the piano get maintenance and how would it survive the northern Wisconsin weather. “Tom Draughon … has agreed to do some maintenance for us and the tuning that it’s going to require, so he’s going to be in on this project,” Lee said, adding that they have plans for some future fundraisers in the works. “(Draughon) is going to donate some turnings, but we want to be able to compensate him for the rest of it for the rest of the year because maintenance on something outdoors like this is going to be a bit of work for him.” The trio is also looking for volunteers to help with a number of other things. “We’re planning on getting an insulated tarp to help protect it at night and then from weather,” said Vik, pointing out that they will need volunteers to help cover the piano at night and when there is inclement weather. As to acquiring the piano itself, Lee said they have already had a tremendous response from people. “We have three different ones we’re looking at,” he said, joking that it seems there’s always a supply of free pianos if you start looking. “We’re looking at getting the piano painted,” Pero said. “The first year I think we just kind of wanted to take over and paint it, make it look all pretty and then perhaps maybe get community involvement on that, maybe high school art class or something.” “Paint it every year because that kind of fits in with the mural theme of the town, having something on it,” said Lee explaining that they are still ironing out the details on if the piano’s donor would be onboard with the painted piano idea. “One of them for sure is because they threatened to burn that one if they don’t get rid of it this year,” he said. As for the piano’s placement, Lee had suggested Otis Park as an ideal location. “It’s a good spot in-between the coffee shop, the co-op and the library … it’s kind of like a somewhat central part of downtown,” he said. “It’s a great location,” Hudson said. “I think it’s really cool especially with the new Burger Barn right there. I can’t believe the transformation that place has gone under. I think it makes for a really cool place to have something.” The group is scheduled to present their idea to the Parks and Recreation committee and the Ashland City Council during their June meetings to hopefully get their blessings to move forward with the project.

Susan,Boland,962,http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/100859/osteoporosis-is-preventable-and-treatable,"Galway Advertiser, Thu, May 24, 2018 Osteoporosis Clinic Ireland is a multidisciplinary clinic, providing a unique triple therapy approach, that has been developed to assist people with or predisposed to bone health issues. Osteoporosis is a silent disease affecting one in two women and one in four men over the age of 50 in Ireland, although all age groups can be affected. Osteoporosis is preventable and treatable at all stages. Therefore it is important to address your bone health, especially if it is hereditary. There are usually no warning signs an individual has developed osteoporosis and it is often only diagnosed when a bone is fractured. How Osteoporosis Clinic Ireland can help Osteoporosis has been called “the silent disease” because bone loss occurs initially without symptoms. Many conditions can be associated with the development of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis Clinic Ireland can help to improve your bone health. The clinic's expert staff will provide specific nutrition advice based on symptoms, weight-bearing exercises to target the improvement of bone density, and bone density scanning to determine osteoporosis risk index. In addition, supplements will be given, based on the client's needs, and testing is available to identify individual requirements. The DEXA scan will be explained. The clinic also offers preventative measures for those predisposed to osteoporosis. During consultation, registered general nurse Karen Byrne will review and explain the DEXA scan, and provide an ultrasound bone density scan to monitor progress on an ongoing basis. Nutritional therapist Susan Boland will assess, and develop a personalised nutrition plan to meet each client's specific bone health needs. Chartered physiotherapist Maria Murphy will assess the client and outline specific exercises to improve bone density, balance, and posture, designed to fit in with lifestyle and individual requirements. The team uses the most up to date research in the development of programmes, and looks forward to engaging with clients on their journey to improving bone health. Follow up consultations are available to you at three to six-monthly intervals in each location countrywide. The next clinic takes place on Tuesday, May 29, in the Menlo Park Hotel, Galway.

The Radio 4 classic has been adapted for the stage for the first time by acclaimed Jarrow writer and fellow of The Customs House Academy, Alex Ferguson. It will be directed by Gareth Hunter and performed at The Customs House in South Shields from Tuesday, July 17, to Saturday, July 21. Set in 1930s Jarrow, it follows the adventures of 10-year-old Lecky (Andrew Finnigan, Broken Biscuits, Drip) and his family, including his imaginative Uncle Freddie (Chris Connel, The Pitman Painters, Emmerdale, Byker Grove, Inspector George Gently). The play, which celebrates the human spirit, humour and community of the north east, also stars Georgia Nicholson (The Cinder Path, The Dolly Mixtures) as Mam, Paul Dunn (I Left My Heart in Roker Park, Seriously Dead) as Dad and Jill Dellow (Horrible Histories, Tracy Beaker Returns, Hollyoaks, Hospital People, Vera) as Aunt Bella. The cast visited Beamish recently to take part in a photoshoot for the production and also soak up the atmosphere in the 1900s Town, Colliery and Pit Village. Gareth said: “We chose Beamish because My Uncle Freddie was originally recorded in one of the cottages in The Pit Village, so it was taking it back to where it all started. “We also wanted the photos to have an authentic feel, rather than ones done in the studio, and Beamish provided the perfect backdrop. “It’s a fantastic and fascinating place to visit and to be able to use it for our publicity images was great. It was challenging, as it was open to the public at the same time, so we had to take the pictures quickly. “Normally we would have got funny looks doing photos in public, but at Beamish, the cast just looked like they were meant to be there!” My Uncle Freddie was first broadcast in 1997 as a hilarious and heart-warming trilogy of tales from a 1930s childhood in Jarrow, starring Shaun Prendergast, Colin Maclachlan, Alex Ferguson and Janine Birkett. Julie Wilson, Head of Communications at Beamish, said: “We were delighted to be able to help out with locations for The Customs House photoshoot, especially as the original Radio 4 plays were recorded here – almost 21 years to the day!” Karen Cummings was responsible for the hair and make-up on the shoot and the photographer was George W Knox. In keeping with the theme, Paul Dunn, who was unable to attend the Beamish photoshoot, had his publicity images taken at South Shields Museum & Art Gallery. Tickets for My Uncle Freddie are priced from £15 and available from the box office on (0191) 454 1234 or online at www.customshouse.co.uk. Performances start at 7.30pm, with a 2.30pm matinee on Thursday and Saturday. © 2018 Bdaily Ltd. All rights reserved. Bdaily is a company.

The three male teenagers and a 44-year-old woman, all from Dundee, appeared briefly, and separately, from custody on the same petition before Sheriff Alastair Carmichael. One of the teenagers, from the Menzieshill area, is just 16 and cannot be named due to his age. He, along with John O’Neil, 18, of Gourdie Place, Heather Samson, 44, of Forth Crescent, and Lee Hathway, 19, of Ballindean Place, are all accused of, on May 18, at a house in Menzieshill and elsewhere to the prosecutor unknown, being concerned in the supply of cannabis, O’Neil and the 16-year-old both while on bail. All four are further accused of, on the same date and at the same house in Menzieshill and elsewhere unknown, being concerned in the supply of cocaine, both O’Neil and the 16-year-old while on bail. The four are also accused of, on the same date and at the same location, being in possession of cannabis resin, both O’Neil and the 16-year-old while on bail. Prosecutors allege the offences were aggravated by a connection with a serious organised crime operation. None of the four made any plea and were granted bail while the case was continued for further examination. © DC Thomson Co Ltd 2018. All Rights Reserved. Send Email Cancel

Today was senior day today as Tech played against The University of Texas. The Texas Tech baseball team fell to TCU, 12-2, on Wednesday, May 23, at Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark in the opening round of the Phillips 66 Big 12 Baseball Championship. With the loss, the four lower seeds of the tournament went undefeated in the opening round. TCU started scoring early in the game and Tech was unable to recover from the deficit. A leadoff single and two walks loaded the bases for TCU in the top of the second. After issuing his third straight walk and giving TCU a 1-0 lead, freshman right-handed starting pitcher Ryan Sublette’s night was over. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Caleb Freeman took over for the Red Raiders with bases loaded and no outs. He gave up a single to the first Horned Frog he faced, increasing TCU’s lead to 3-0. The bases were loaded again after junior outfielder Josh Watson was hit by the pitch. Senior outfielder A.J. Balta then cleared the bases with a three RBI double to left center field, putting TCU up, 6-0. The Red Raiders started the bottom half of the second inning strong, with senior designated hitter Zach Rheams drawing a leadoff walk and junior first baseman Cameron Warren hitting a double to right field. Despite having two runners in scoring position with no outs, the Red Raiders were unable to capitalize and went into the third inning trailing 6-0. The third inning saw another pitching change for Tech, as sophomore right-handed pitcher Connor Queen took over on the mound. After a quiet third inning, TCU started the fourth with two runners in scoring position with no outs. They both came in to score when senior infielder Michael Landestoy singled up the middle, giving TCU an 8-0 lead. Queen issued back-to-back walks to start the fifth inning. A sacrifice fly from Watson put TCU runners on the corners with one out. Balta followed up with an RBI sacrifice fly to center field, increasing the Horned Frogs’ lead to 9-0. Freshman catcher Braxton Fulford started the Tech half of the inning with a single to center field. Sophomore second baseman Brian Klein did the same thing as Fulford with his at bat, giving Tech two baserunners with one out. Another single up the middle from sophomore third baseman Josh Jung brought Fulford in to score. Another one-out single from sophomore left fielder Grant Little loaded the bases for Tech, putting them in position to cut into TCU’s lead. A wild pitch allowed Klein to score, but that was all the Red Raiders were able to get. After five innings, TCU continued to lead, 9-2. Sophomore right-handed pitcher Andrew Davis came in to pitch for the Red Raiders in the top of the sixth. He entered the game only having pitched four innings the rest of the season, according to Tech Athletics. Davis gave up a leadoff walk to junior outfielder Johnny Rizer, who scored on an RBI double from sophomore catcher Zach Humphreys. TCU added two more runs in the seventh inning to secure the victory over Tech, 12-2. The Red Raiders will face Oklahoma State at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday, May 24, in the loser’s bracket of the Phillips 66 Big 12 Baseball Championship. Your comment has been submitted.

Andrew,Davis,957,https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/queenstown/water-quality-leads-10-year-plan-hearing,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Of the 12 groups and individuals who spoke at the hearing, half of them focused on either the lake's water quality or the need to better monitor all the district's lakes. The hearing began with an impassioned plea by Wakatipu resident Andrew Davis, who accused the council of ''neglect'' in its statutory duty to protect water quality in Central Otago. He accused the council of taking a passive approach to the lake and its tributary, Mill Stream. That had allowed the lake's water quality to gradually degrade to the point where residents and visitors could no longer be confident about swimming in it. Mr Davis said the council had closed the lake for swimming several times in the past year because of high E.coli levels, but had not specified the bacteria. That had left tourists to assume there was human waste in the lake, which was damaging the district's reputation. He called on the council to commit to a full restoration programme. Friends of Lake Hayes secretary Richard Bowman said practical options for improving the lake's water quality had been identified, and it was now up to the council to ''put it into action''. Failure to make progress would ultimately impact on the Wakatipu Basin's tourism economy through reputational damage, Mr Bowman said. Support for addressing the lake's issues also came in a wide-ranging submission by the Shaping our Future forum. Board member Maree Baker-Galloway said the council should continue working on remediation plans for the lake. It should also install monitoring buoys on all of the district's lakes by next year. Queenstown Grey Power representative Kirsty Sharpe said it was ''past time'' to start remedial action in Lake Hayes, and immediate action was required to prevent further contamination. In a personal submission to the long-term plan, Mrs Sharpe said she supported an increase in rates if the extra funds were used to rectify the district's water quality issues. Queenstown Lakes district councillor Alexa Forbes said it was ''tragic'' the lake had reached its present state, and any commercial development in nearby Waterfall Park had to be ''careful and sensitive''. Water quality, particularly in the Manuherikia River, was also a hot topic at the long-term plan hearing in Alexandra yesterday afternoon. The river has suffered from bacteria contamination caused by rural run-off in recent years. Clyde resident Lynne Stewart told councillors her children had been ''violently sick'' after kayaking in the upper section of the river, and called for the council to take action to preserve the waterway for future generations. An emotional Raymond White, of Alexandra, read a poem entitled Manuherikia and Man to councillors. The poem mentioned that exploitation of the river was complete. He told councillors they had a ''hell of a task'' ahead of them to save the river. -By Sean Nugent

Bob,Diamond,956,https://www.lusakatimes.com/2018/05/24/rajan-mahtani-loses-cement-firm-to-ventriglia-family/,"Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe, reports that Zambian multi-millionaire entrepreneur Rajan Mahtani has lost ownership of Zambezi Portland Cement, a leading cement manufacturer in the southern African country, as the High Court of Zambia awarded full ownership of the company to the Ventriglia family of Italy on Monday. The resolution follows a 10-year court battle between the Ventriglia family and Rajan Mahtani, a Zambian businessman of Indian origin. Mahtani had always claimed that he owned a 58% controlling stake in the business as payment for organizing financing for the Ventriglia family years ago, but the Ventriglia family insisted that he had no claim to the stake, asserting full ownership of the company. The Ventriglia family is one of the wealthiest and most powerful business families in Zambia today. In 1957, the patriarch of the family, Antonio Ventriglia along with his wife and children arrived Zambia from Italy. They established a Terazzo company, Ital Terazzo, which eventually became very successful. In an effort to diversify their investments in Zambia, the family decided to venture into cement manufacturing, establishing the Zambezi Portland Cement Company. The family approached Rajan Mahtani, a popular financier and business mogul who was a family friend to the Ventriglias, and asked him to help arrange financing for the new cement company. Mahtani, who was the Chairman and controlling shareholder of Finance Bank, Zambia, used his influence to syndicate a $100 million loan from the European Development Fund and the Kenya’s PTA Bank. In return, the Ventriglia family orally agreed to sell a 49% stake in the cement company to Rajan Mahtani’s investment vehicle, Finsbury Investments, for a discounted price of $60 million – an amount Mahtani never paid. The Ventriglia family soon needed additional financing in order to increase the cement plant’s capacity and Mahtani was on hand to help arrange an additional loan, in return for an additional 9% stake in the company for a discounted price. Even though Mahtani never paid for the shares he orally agreed to buy, he allegedly fraudulently procured his company secretaries to alter the register of Members and filed with Zambia’s Registrar of Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA) a fake photocopy of share transfer certificates indicating that he was a member and shareholder in Zambezi Portland Cement. The Ventriglia family has insisted that they never transferred the shares to Mahtani’s company. On Monday, the court ruled that Mahtani had indeed falsified share transfer certificates in the company, and as such did not own any shares in Zambezi Portland Cement. “Mahtani has been unable to produce the original signed copies of the share transfer certificates because they simply do not exist and he never paid for the shares. As such, complete ownership of the company firmly rests with the Antonio Ventriglia family,” a spokesperson of Zambezi Portland Cement confirmed to this reporter via email. Rajan Mahtani, 70, is one of Zambia’s most successful, yet controversial businessmen. He was previously the controlling shareholder and chairman of Zambia’s Finance Bank before it was acquired by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara in 2015. In Zambian businessman Chisanga Puta-Chekwe’s acclaimed book, Cobra In The Boat: Michael Sata’s Zambia, he claims that Mahtani brokered a controversial deal whereby the Zambian Government sold off the state-owned Konkola Copper Mines Plc, one of Africa’s largest integrated copper producers (and a company easily worth hundreds of millions of dollars), to Vedanta resources controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, for only $25 million, a tiny fraction of its real value. Rajan Mahtani did not respond to an email requesting for comment at the time of publishing this story. Source:Forbes This story is older than three days, the judgement has even been appealed against. The news now is about the appeal. Poor chap. Instead of enjoying his retirement, he is always being stressed by court issues. This man has been a crook all along period! This is how these crooks like Mahtani used to grab businesses…you go to his bank for assistance he sees an opportunity takeover your business.. alot of people have not been so lucky. Only in Zambia can a vile crook like Mahtani can still walk the streets freely. You are the one who is behind the case is over, no such thing as appeal, Rajan has been a shade character for a long time. An Indian wants to do an Italian job on Italians Mahtani is not a poor chap. He is a crook. Stole from Late Puta’s family (Mr. Puta was a shareholder and director of Finance Bank) Stole from Late Wadood’s family (Mr. Wadood was Managing Director of Finance Bank) Stole from Mr. Savior Konie (Mr. Konie was Managing Director of Professional Insurance) Stole from Mr. Fearon (Mr. Fearon was Managing Director of Finance Building Society). As for Zambezi Portland Cement, Money Launderer Mahtani’s partner in crime, Mr. Barkat Ali issued a fake letter that Rajan had brought in 5 million US dollars as capital and got a loan approved on that basis from his corrupt friend Michael Gondwe (then President of PTA Bank). Rajan is a money launderer. He steals tax from the UK, Canada, Zambia through his sister Schultz and girl friend Craven… Mathani is a gazetted crook. This Mahtani guy is greedy. People are blaming HH for having sold KCM for 25m. But it appears this guy was all behind the undervaluation. Because he was Ba Satas friend kaili so the PF spin doctors will always prefer HH mentioned in the sale of mines. It is good when such revelations happen hopefully some people see that selling a mine was not like vending imbalala by the roadside…..But the whole idea is so easy to sale to the gullible and simple minds of most voters that HH sold all the mines. Unfortunately it is a “Good” political strategy from the PF though. It is up to the UPND and HH to “unspin” it. But i dont expect supposedly educated people to believe this …please leave it to the uneducated gullible HH was not involved in the later sale of KCM. I don’t like HH but I wouldn’t allow people to falsely accuse him. HH was involved with Anglo-American the first buyers of the company. It’s if anything Levy Mwanawasa who should take the blame. KCM Plc saga was: The late Levy Patrick Mwanawasa msrip-HH-Rajah Mahtan. This thug sold KCM in exchange for $50,000,000 commission for himself and another $25,000,000 for Maureen Mwanawasa. Typical Indian this Mahtani. They want to own things without spending anything. How many times is he going to ‘lose’ ownership? Next story please Justice has been served. Mahtani’s list of controversies go back when he swindled the Zambian people through that Carrington maize deal and used Nawakwi and M’membe to divert the blame on FTJ. Who can forget writing off a $4m loan for Mutembo Nchito in exchange for a Nolle Prosequi after a court had bonafide evidence that he forge a judge’s signature?? Mahtani is a hardcore white collar crook whose luck has run out after manipulating previous presidencies to his advantage. Waloba ilyauma. Justice for the Ventrigllias and congrats!! The chap should spend his retirement in a Zambian Jail. That’s what he been sowing all these years. Mahtani’s crookedness goes back to the time he swindled the late Humphrey Mulemba who had entrusted him with ill-gotten wealth from the late Tiny Rowland. Sounds like good history. Would you like to share more on this story @Duda And when he is in trouble he jumped on a plane to UK …using his British passport. The man is vile and evil…there is nothing inspirational about his richies he is a sick petty little crook..am surprised he is still alive after so people he has crossed. Well, thief stealing from thief is not theft. Tiny Rowland? That name is familar what business did he own?? @8.4 jay jay he owned Lonhro group of companies. A crook. I think he even wrote a book about how he stole wealth from Africans. You can google the man. Thanks …I have just read about him on Wikipedia…apparently in 1996 President Nelson Mandela awarded Rowland the Order of Good Hope, the highest South African honour..really laughable. He stole from late Nyambe, the then Vice Chairman of Finance Bank. Cement is too expensive in Zambia. It’s not easy to build in Zambia. Zambian are so useless and lazy that even news happening under their noses they have to read without shame in Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe. This Mahtani is a big crook …there he is taking things to court based on oral agreement…these are the people involved in selling KCM for a song to his Indian friend Anil. *Zambian media…. The perennial doomsayer …Come see what your friends are doing here in Zed…i was there dude…always berating Zambia from the diaspora…when i cam back home, was shocked to see how young people were moving forward with businesses, savings, property etc… Dont be led on by social media sir…. Who’s berating who? Have you read what I have written ..always the same fooools posting comments and changing their silly names? So it was a Zambian of Indian origin who crooked the people of Zambia to sell the mine to his fellow Indian for a song and not the Tonga man from bweengwa.No wonder Some one said lies have no legs to stand on. In addition, it was Mathani who took J&W investment to State House in February 2004 and took Baluba Mine away from First Quantum. That move shaped the future of Luanshya town! Zambians must apologise to HH for falsely accusing him of the sale of KCM to Indians for a song. HH, I Chitapankwa Allepo Trump do tender in an apology for falsely accusing you on the deal. On behalf of all those who did not read, I say I am sorry. The only issue I have got with UPND now is the adoption of Charmaine. If he is found to have forged docs, let him be caged or deported to Kashmir. We are tired of chinese, Lebanese & Indian crooks hiding behind legal technicalities while abating rampant corruption When he is about to be caged he jumps on a plane to UK…its from the likes of this guy I first heard of the term dual citizenship…then bribes top leaders in Zambia whilst there; as he can not stand UK he longs staying in Zambia where he is treated like a God. Falsified legal documents? How about some jail time? He would never see the inside of a jail…he has too many secrets; this crook used to fund a lot of political campaigns!! The KCM sale was another of LPM’s frauds, apart from the Zesco deals. Rajan won’t let go without a fight. If both parties weren’t greedy, there wasn’t going to be all this, what’s wrong with these ba Zimandola? Those Italian mafia are supposed to be Mahtani’s employees because without him there wasn’t going to be Zambezi Portland nor Ital Terrazzo. KK is too old to reconcile them, maybe Tom Mtine, he’s another Zimandola Ayatalloh Terrazzo started off as a small company when no one sold tiles especially marble tiles or roofing tiles in Zambia give credit where its due…Rajan was using his bank to find out weakness in your business and using that against you …this *****t has breached every banking law there is and he is still around because he is connected like a gun merchant. …before the Chinese money arrived Rajan was the go to guy for laundering money!! KK gave up on Mahtani a long time ago. If it wasn’t for Rajan ‘s Mum, KK would have jailed him for a good number of years and deported him to the UK. The relationship between the Ventriglia family and Mahtani family is a business relationship. It centers on Zambezi Portland Cement Company. It is unlikely that the Mahtani family deserves to go away empty handed. Leave company shares alone. Focus on the loan facilitation process. Estimate the value of the facilitation process. What are the service charges for the loan? What is the average level of service charges in the financial sector? The Mahtani family needed to work with reliable lawyers when dealing with huge sums of money. But fees here seem a reasonable proposition for the Mahtani family to be paid to them by the Ventriglia family. The Itanian family owes Mahtani, $8.7Bn in facilitation and interests, a claim reads in part. But, how can facilitation fee be 8000% more than actual loan obtained??? Serves him right. First the Guptas are chased with their tails between their tun Nchafu. Now Mathani is about to face the new Africa. Kikiki I am loving this. No connections in the current govt. That’s what happens. Ati Banker. Worse than the neighbourhood shylock who appeared like owning the gleamy cars parked in yard. Now the mojo is gone. The Venitians just want their blood. Mahtani should do with palty return on his flesh sold to Bob and Co. Comments are closed. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

Housing officials are still ‘reviewing their options’ over two key housing sites in Rotherham which were cleared to make way for new homes a decade ago, they have confirmed, following problems in getting redevelopment work started. The Whinney Hill and Chester Hill Avenue areas of Thrybergh, Rotherham, have been awaiting redevelopment since 2008 and now neighbourhood campaigner Michael Sylvester has questioned Rotherham Council’s lack of progress with the schemes, which could provide the town with 240 new homes. Mr Sylvester, a former councillor, said originally the council had plans to redevelop the land under the Government’s Housing Market Renewal Pathfinder scheme and five years later a scheme to create 260 new homes was announced with Keepmoat Homes. Details on Rotherham Council’s website said that scheme was due to commence in 2016, but there had been no progress, said Mr Sylvester, who used a public questions session at a meeting of the council’s ruling cabinet to ask for an explanation. “Rotherham Council need to explain the extended delay plus what they are going to do to help repair damage to local businesses that have struggled due to this decade long gap in the local community” said Mr Sylvester. He said that in the two years since building was due to start, the villages of Dalton and Thrybergh had seen their last pub close, the Progressive and Legion clubs go and other businesses left struggling. “All of these are businesses that would have benefited from the additional 600 people this development should bring into the area and we need to know what the council is going to do to rectify any damage done to the local economy” said Mr Sylvester. Rotherham Council’s Cabinet spokesman for housing, Coun Dominic Beck, said the regeneration work was expected to create 240 new homes and said: “The Council is committed to delivering high quality homes that meet the needs of people in the borough. “Both the Chesterhill Avenue and Whinney Hill sites are areas capable of delivering over 240 homes, however we have faced a number of challenges over the years in getting a deliverable scheme off the ground. We are currently reviewing our options to ensure we move as quickly as possible on these key sites.” ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

(WBAY)- More changes are coming to the growing Sawdust District in Oshkosh as the city council gives the okay Tuesday night on a renovation of the former Miles Kimball building. The historical property is located in the 800 block of South Main Street, close to where the new Menominee Nation Arena also sits. After years of sitting vacant, a major renovation project targeting the former Miles Kimball building is now just weeks away from starting. Plans call for a combination of office space, mixed with a restaurant on the first floor. ""It's a 120-year-old building, and for us it seems to be the premier intersection in this part of town with 9th Street coming off the highway coming into the new entertainment district here with the stadium and some other very nice developments in the area,"" said Will Steiner of Bridgeview Holdings. Steiner says he's still seeking a restaurant tenant that he hopes to sign soon. A tech company has already signed on to occupy the fourth floor. On the top of the buildings, plans call for a rooftop bar with views of the downtown area, Fox River and Lake Winnebago. . In a vote Tuesday, the project received unanimous support from the city council. ""I keep thinking we want to go more vertical for the views. I mean, the views are of Lake Winnebago, and you pay top dollar for building, be it office space, apartments, condos that have views,"" said Oshkosh Mayor Steve Cummings. Construction is expected to begin in July and last about six months.

Steve,Cummings,953,http://www.osceolaiowa.com/2018/05/21/marcie-saxton/a7xfp9k/,"Marcie Jae Saxton, age 41, of Weldon, the daughter of Jay Saxton and the late Vicki (Tharp) Saxton, was born March 13, 1977, in Leon. Marcie died at Clarke County Hospital in Osceola on Monday, May 14, 2018. Marcie’s family will greet friends from 5 to 7 p.m. Friday evening at Kale Funeral Home, 301 S. Main St., in Osceola. Memorial services celebrating her life will be 10:30 a.m. Saturday, May 26, at the funeral home with interment of her cremains in Green Bay Cemetery near Weldon. Marcie graduated from Central Decatur High School in 1995. Marcie went on to further her education at Graceland University in Lamoni, and then on to AIB to complete her B.A. in business. Marcie met Steve Cummings back in 2002, and they have been together for the last 16 years. Marcie was the proud stepmother of Steve’s daughter Aleesha. Marcie loved watching Aleesha grow into the young woman she is today. Marcie held various jobs over the years. She loved kids, so it was fitting she worked at The Village in Osceola. Marcie previously worked at Graceland University and currently worked at Saxton Fencing and Dozing, taking care of the family business and at DMACC Ankeny Campus as an administrative assistant. Marcie enjoyed her job at DMACC and her coworkers. Marcie was an event planner for the HPS Department and also secretary for Green Bay Township in Clarke County. Marcie was baptized and confirmed at Our Savior’s Lutheran Church. The most important thing in Marcie’s life was spending time with family. It really didn’t matter what the activity, shopping, playing with the little ones, camping and bonfires, baking and sewing or crafting. Marcie loved being outside with her dog, Holly. Marcie was a heavy machine operator, thanks to her dad, Jay, teaching her about the family business. Marcie loved International tractors. Marcie enjoyed singing and listening to country music. She was an avid reader and loved the quiet time she spent reading. Marcie loved being able to watch her nieces, Paige, Dain and Caitlyn grow into the wonderful young ladies they are today. She was very proud of all they have accomplished. The brightest light in Marcie’s life was her granddaughter, Thea. Marcie adored Thea, and they spent lots of quality time playing, snuggling, reading and were always on the go together. Thea had Marcie wrapped around her little fingers. Marcie believed in hard work and appreciated those around her that worked hard. To show her appreciation, she would bake or cook meals and take to those sitting in the tractors planting or harvesting. She would make cinnamon rolls for the heavy machine operators in her life, so they could get their days started off with a good breakfast. Marcie wasn’t afraid to get dirty or jump in to help out. Marcie would roll her sleeves up and dive in to help anyone who needed it, asking for nothing in return. Marcie loved cattle and the farm life. She helped her nieces and Aleesha with 4-H projects and livestock projects. Marcie always enjoyed cattle and had always wanted a red cow instead of the traditional black cattle. Ironically, Marcie got her wish when one of her cows had a “red” calf. It was a heifer to boot, so she will stay with the herd, just as Marcie had wanted. Marcie will be remembered for her big smile, sparkling blue eyes and her long curly blonde hair. We will remember her as a woman with her heart on her sleeve, a fire in her soul and a faith that never wavered. Survivors are husband, Steve Cummings of Weldon; stepdaughter Aleesha Cummings and step-granddaughter Thea of Osceola; father Jay and step-mother, Carol Saxton of Leon; brothers, Latham (Rose) Saxton of Leon and Garrett (Kelly) Saxton of Leon; stepbrother Scott (Whitney) Hanthorn of Leon; stepsister Christy (Dan) Hanthorn of Manhattan, Kansas; grandparents, Jerry and Donna Tharp of Leon; numerous aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and a host of friends. Preceding her in death are her mother Vicki Saxton; sister-in-law Genny Cummings; grandparents, Russell and Agnes Saxton; and in-laws, Mickey and Bob Cummings.

Michael,Gordon,952,http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/northbrook/news/ct-nbs-bill-vaananen-retiring-wescott-tl-0524-story.html,"Bill Vaananen’s students and collegues say the music teacher at Wescott Elementary school in Northbrook teachers more than music. Vaananen’s use of music to teach history, geography, culture and more, was cited by current and former students along with Northbrook/Glenview School District 30 Superintendent Brian Wegley. “What he teaches transcends music,” Wegley said. “He teaches the history of music and history. He teaches important life lessons.” Vaananen, a Deerfield resident who is retiring after 37 years, will be honored by the community and colleagues with “An Encore With Mr. V” at 7 p.m. on May 24 at Maple School. Part of the reason Vaananen’s teaching goes beyond scales and rhythm is because he sees music as a form of storytelling with songs teaching lessons. There are social messages celebrating the diversity of Wescott’s own culture. “A lot of music teaches us we are not isolated in the world,” said Vaananen, who was a 1990 Golden Apple award winner. “Music is a social study. Every song comes from some place. It is a story of that place.” Growing up in Tulsa, Okla., Vaananen said he was influenced by the music of Woody Guthrie, another Oklahoma native. He also loves travel and likes to put different places around the world into his shows. He has done shows focusing on the Winter Olympics and musicals he adores. “I look at an atlas every day,” Vaananen said. “I look at parts of America, at rivers and mountains.” After graduating from college, Vaananen taught two years in Harrisburg, Mo., before moving to Chicago with thoughts of being a professional musician. He did some substitute teaching and a full-time job opened at Wescott in December 1981. “The principal said, ‘you are exactly what we are looking for,’” Vaananen said. “‘Why don’t you apply? Can you start Jan. 4?’ I did and I’ve been here ever since.” During Vaananen’s last fifth grade show on May 18, many of the songs from performances of years past were incorporated. The show had elements of history with a song about Abraham Lincoln as a boy in Kentucky. Vaananen’s current students like fourth grader Shiloh Gordon said they like his class because of how he incorporates more than music. “He tells us a bunch of stories and jokes,” Gordon said. “That makes the class a lot of fun.” Some former students like Michael Gordon, Shiloh Gordon’s father, said one requirement he had when he decided to move to Northbrook was finding a house in the Wescott area so his children could experience learning from Vaananen. “He was an amazing teacher,” Michael Gordon said. “He always had a smile and he made you feel like you were part of the family. I like the fact Shiloh and Dakota (a seventh grader at Maple) have the same experiences I did with Mr. V.” Humor is what makes Vaananen stand out for Hayden Carl, another Wescott fourth grader. Her father, Adam Carl, also was a student of Vaananen. “What’s really great is that I was his first class and my youngest was almost his last class,” Adam Carl said. “Very few parents are lucky enough to say that their most impactful teacher and positive influence on our entire family’s lives taught both generations.” Vaananen inspired two generations of the Becker family as well. David Becker said Vaananen inspired him in music class just as he does for his daughter, fourth grader Samantha Becker. Her appreciation of music with Vaananen is something she and her father share. Wegley said part of Vaananen’s teaching skill comes from the way he draws talent out of his students. “When you watch one of his shows every one of his students shines individually and as part of the group,” Wegley said.

Michael,Gordon,952,https://la.eater.com/2018/5/22/17381158/los-angeles-starbucks-new-policy-bathrooms,"Starbucks issued new guidelines Saturday to emphasize that all are welcome, with or without a purchase. Chairman Howard Schultz announced the approach five weeks after two African-American men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks, which resulted in a swift backlash. With the new policy implemented, CBS-LA gathered the local response to see how customers feel about it. Some maintain a positive response to the policy, which allows anyone, customer or not, to use the bathrooms. “I’ve definitely done it. So I don’t see a problem with it,” said Nicole McDonald. “I think it should have always been that way, especially because of the way racism is, you know,” says Desiree Mollere. Others see the policy change as a problem. “If you go into a business and you just sit there and you don’t buy anything you are taking up space at the table,” says Melrose Larry Green. Squatting is another concern. “You could end up having a squatters problem where you just have people coming and staying,” says Joe Selva. “I mean if they are going to do that they need to limit how long people can stay in there.” Schultz clearly had some concerns about the new policy. “We don’t want to become a public bathroom, but we’re going to make the right decision 100% of the time and give people the key, because we don’t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to use the bathroom,” says Schultz. Still reeling from damage control, Starbucks will conduct a highly-publicized company wide racial bias training on May 29. And while Starbucks brought on these current guidelines to address racial profiling, it seems that some customers aren’t necessarily pleased with the changes. Sign up for our newsletter.

Michael,Gordon,952,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article211599149.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 23, 2018 10:39 AM Cathy Hocking says it's not greed that has driven her to start a legal fight 2,000 miles away from her Mooresville home. It's respect. Respect, she says, for her two children. Respect for other families who, she says, would desperately want to avoid the hell in which she finds herself today. ""Nobody wants my life,"" Hocking says bluntly. ""I don't want another mother to live my life."" For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. On the night of Good Friday 2017, Karli and Kelsey Richardson called home at 11 p.m. Mooresville time to tell Hocking that they loved her, and that they planned to leave Phoenix, Ariz., and drive through the night to watch the sun come up over the Grand Canyon. Six hours later, the sisters who had been inseparable for most of their lives, died together, too, — killed by a wrong-way driver who investigators say had been drinking for 4 1/2 hours at a nearby restaurant. Karli was 20; Kelsey was 18. The other driver, 21-year-old Keaton Allison, also died. He attended the same Christian college in Phoenix as Karli. The police report says that at the time of the collision, Allison was traveling at 80 mph in a 65-mph zone down the wrong side of Interstate 17, with only his parking lights on. There were no skid marks at the crash scene. The Richardson girls never saw Allison coming. A friend who had been drinking with Allison that night at the nearby Mellow Mushroom on Happy Valley Road told an Arizona investigator that he was so worried about Allison's sobriety that he waited outside the restaurant to make sure he didn't drive home. Instead, the friend says he fell asleep in his car. When he awoke, Allison was gone. Within minutes, he was headed southbound down a northbound exit ramp onto I-17. Sarah Hanson, a passenger in a car at the same intersection, told police that her companion had to leave the road to avoid a sedan driven by a lone male, the accident report says. She said she thought the other driver would realize his mistake, stop and turn around. He never did. At 2:10 a.m., Allison's car slammed into the Richardsons' 2003 Pontiac Sunfire, leaving it ""unrecognizable,"" according to the police report. Allison's blood-alcohol level taken after his death was .25, more than three times Arizona's legal limit. The medical examiner's report says the sisters had not been drinking. ""Point-two-five — are you kidding me?"" Hocking said this week during a phone interview with the Observer. ""If you are point-two-five you are really drunk. They should have stopped serving him. It's that simple. ... ""My precious children were not allowed to live their lives because no one paid attention, and no one followed the law."" Now, a year after the accident, Hocking and the girls' biological father, Perry Richardson, have sued the owners of the Mellow Mushroom in Phoenix, holding them responsible for over-serving Allison and then allowing him to get behind the wheel. Hocking says any business that serves liquor has a legal responsibility to their customers and the public to know when someone has had enough. The parents' complaint appears buoyed by the findings of an investigator with the Arizona Department of Liquor License and Control, who says the restaurant violated state liquor laws on April 13 and 14. That's when Allison and a group of his friends came to Mellow Mushroom for its 11 p.m. half-price, happy hour after spending the evening at a spiritual gathering for junior high students. ""Allison, who by all witness accounts, arrived at the Mellow Mushroom Restaurant in a sober condition, left ... four hours later with a blood-alcohol content of .25%,"" Detective Steve Schrimpf wrote in his March 28 report, which cites the restaurant for selling liquor to an intoxicated or disorderly person, failure to protect the safety of patrons and having an intoxicated customer on its premises for 30 minutes. Phoenix attorney John Norling, who is representing the restaurant owners in the case, did not respond to an Observer email seeking comment for this story. Hocking says the new documents add details to the long-distance horror she experienced the night of the crash. ""The more we learn, the worse it gets,"" she said. ""I am so ready to fight this. I don't think anybody would sit back and not do something. Not me. I'm not that kind of mother. I truly believe this could have been prevented."" Schrimpf's interviews with 10 of Allison's companions on the night he killed the Richardsons and himself, present a portrait of an outgoing, occasionally ""goofy"" college student who was a regular at the Mellow Mushroom. The waiter who served Allison's table told authorities he brought Allison only a beer sample and a single Hangar 24 pint. However, Michael Sawyer, who juggled soccer balls with Allison earlier that night to see who would pay the bar or food tab for their night out, told Schrimpf that Allison already had a beer in his hand and had opened a tab when Sawyer arrived at Mellow Mushroom around 9:30 p.m. Sawyer said he saw Allison drink at least two beers and a shot of Crown Royal. Another companion, Austin Schleier, said Allison combined beers and whiskey shots, and that he made regular trips to the bar or to join another group where additional drinking may have been taking place. Both said Allison became clearly intoxicated as the night wore on, the state liquor control report says. ""Dude, you can't drive,"" Schleier says he told Allison at one point. By midnight, according to Sawyer, Allison was ""slushed out."" Sawyer said he told his friend three times that he was too drunk to drive, but Allison said he was OK and refused the offer of a ride, the state liquor report says. Just before 2 a.m., Sawyer and Schleier left the restaurant to wait for Allison in the parking lot, according to the state report. When Sawyer awoke after dozing off in his car, it was 2:10 a.m. Allison's 1999 Chrysler Sebring, according to Sawyer, was no longer outside the restaurant. Not far away, the Richardson sisters headed north on I-17 toward the sunrise. In their lawsuit, the sisters' parents allege that the restaurant violated a series of Arizona liquor laws, including ""the duty to furnish, serve or sell alcohol in a reasonable manner so as to not create an unreasonable risk of harm to others."" The complaint, which also alleges negligence, calls for a jury trial and compensatory damages. Keaton Allison's family is not named in the suit. Last year, around Mother's Day, Hocking says she received a card and a hand-written note from an unfamiliar Colorado address. She opened it to find that it had come from Allison's parents. Hocking says she was shocked by the gesture. ""I mean, the last thing I expected to happen was for them to reach out,"" she says. She describes the letter as ""kind, and sad, and I believe it was heartfelt."" ""But no, I didn't respond,"" Hocking says, and she hasn't heard back.

Michael,Gordon,952,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/23/gold-coast-titans-centre-dale-copley-not-losing-sleep-over-contract-negotiations/,"TITANS Titans centre Dale Copley says approaching a critical period of his career is not playing on his mind. He faces his previous team, Sydney Roosters, for the first time on Saturday with contract negotiations reaching a pinnacle stage. The 26-year-old has been released from his past two contracts, by the Broncos at the end of 2015 and the Roosters last March and is looking for the security of a long-term deal on the Gold Coast. He said he was hoping his future would be settled in the next fortnight, either side of the Titans’ bye in round 13, but ""it’s not something that is keeping me awake at night"". The Ingham-born and Brisbane-raised Copley has never quite achieved NRL permanency since making his debut at fullback for the Broncos as a 17-year-old in 2009, playing 20 games or more only once in a decade (2014 with the Broncos). However, he has become an established member of the Gold Coast backline since his switch from the Roosters after round two last year, playing in 27 of their 32 games since (missing five though injury). ""It would be ideal if I could stay here but I have learned in the past couple of years you can’t rely on anything happening,"" Copley said. ""I’ll let that play out and hopefully something will be sorted in the next couple of weeks. ""No it’s not playing on mind. That’s why you pay an agent; they can do all that work for you, so you can focus on what’s really important. ""I probably wouldn’t be at this stage [in negotiations] if I wasn’t playing good footy, so that’s my focus at the moment – doing my job and getting better each week."" His main focus is the Roosters, who are coming off a controversial loss to Brisbane, at Central Coast Stadium on Saturday. He will come up against former teammate Mitch Aubusson, who he knows is not a regular centre but one of the toughest and most consistent competitors in the Telstra Premiership. ""He is one of the most under-rated players in the NRL and no matter where’s he put he does his job,"" Copley said of the 30-year-old 250-game veteran. ""He could play every position on the field if he had to. They love him down there because they just know he’ll get the job done and I know I’m in for a pretty tough task. He plays the game hard and it’s going to be a challenge to me. “They are one of the heavyweights of the competition and every time they’ve come off a loss they have played pretty well. They’ve changed their roster a fair bit since I was there, and they’re playing a bit differently. “We’ve got a job to do and they have a job to do so I don’t think I hold any secrets about them [by playing for the Roosters]. ‘Flash’ [fullback Michael Gordon] has been there more recently.” Titans: 2018 season by the numbers Titans: 2018 season by the numbers What you need to know for your NRL team's 2019 draw James: Titans will embrace Meninga's cultural revolution Kelly back home and ready to fight for Titans spot

John,O'Neil,949,https://pcherald.com/node/366,"John O’Neil, CEO, Pickens County Medical Center BY GENA HUFF, Editor A lot of excitement has surrounded the new CEO of Pickens County Medical Center (PCMC) since he arrived. A new hope has found its way into the community surrounding the hospital, along with the excitement of PCMC being selected as one of only nine other communities for a first-time $2 million grant program. Born in Peoria, Ill., John O’Neil graduated the University of Iowa in 1978. “I started in healthcare in 1980 and then, after I’d been in it about a year or so, I went back to get my master’s,” he said. Healthcare wasn’t the only thing O’Neil started in 1980. He began his family when he married his wife, now of 38 years, Lisa, in 1980. While attending Central Michigan for his master’s degree in 1981, their son, Jeffrey, was born. O’Neil’s daughter, Jenna, arrived about four years later. “My first CEO job (in 1993) was in Booneville, Indiana. It was a 48-bed rural hospital right outside of Evansville. I was there for six years. Then I went to Lourd’s Hospital in Binghamton, New York. I was there from 1999-2009. Then I came to St. Vincent’s (Birmingham, Ala.) in 2009 to almost 2015,” said O’Neil. “Did you think you were going to retire?” I asked. “No,” O’Neil laughed, “I never had retirement in mind.” See complete story in the Pickens County Herald.

Bob,Diamond,947,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/city-spy-at-the-chelsea-flower-show-business-gossip-from-sw3-as-bosses-mingle-a3845556.html,"It might be little more than a month since the founder’s defenestration at media giant WPP but Sir Martin Sorrell was prominent last night on the main “boulevard” at the Chelsea Flower Show’s exclusive gala for the titans of corporate Britain. Was the diminutive multimillionaire, last spotted at the Royal Wedding, hunting clients for a new venture? “I don’t have to hunt for clients,” laughed the adman, who apparently has “many things” planned for the future. Sorrell was earlier spotted deep in a huddle with Goldman Sachs chieftain Richard Gnodde. Spy doubts they were discussing the dahlias. Talk of financing his new venture perhaps? Don’t be misled by the brainiac reputation of Adair Turner, former Financial Services Authority chairman and serial think-tanker. He was the only bigwig brave enough to take the plunge down the showpiece 40ft treehouse slide, to hearty cheers from all. Spy wondered if he’d be leaping for the top job at the Bank of England when Mark Carney’s term ends next year. He went for it last time, but alas, not now. “I don’t think they’d give it to me,” he admits. Turner was mingling by the well-populated stand of sponsors M&G Investments where City luminaries such as BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and Korn Ferry headhunting supremo Oliver Pawle also lurked, as former PM David Cameron and wife Samantha wandered by. The City’s finest have clearly been hitting the gym in the past year. Keen gardener Stephen Hester, chief executive of RSA, had shed a few pounds. He said he was still “emotionally attached” to his old shop RBS, and will be soon be lunching with his successor there, Ross McEwan. Ryvita only, by the looks of it. Sainsbury high-up John Rogers, still Spy’s favourite to be chief executive Mike Coupe’s successor, was also a shadow of his former self — in weight terms at least. The once-portly grocer was barely unrecognisable in his svelte new guise, all helped by spending several days a week in a flat above a Sainsbury’s in Argos’ home town of Milton Keynes where, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do but go to the gym. Coupe was sprightly as ever, fresh from news of his £14 billion pop at Asda. Mrs C was clearly keen on examining the gardens but Mike — who kept his singing voice to himself for a change — said he was confident of success: “You have to have a degree of confidence or you wouldn’t be doing it,” he says. Spy also spotted him in conversation with Marks & Spencer boss Steve Rowe. After Argos as well, surely he couldn’t make it a hat trick? Another grocery goliath, Tesco’s Dave Lewis, was looking Teutonic in five o’clock shadow and white-framed square specs. He and wife Helena were hunting accoutrements for their small garden in west London. Spy wondered if he was much of a crooner like Coupe. Lewis sympathised with his arch-rival: “As someone who does very similar things before TV interviews, I feel for him,” he sighed. Lewis said the Booker takeover’s blooming marvellous, but poured weedkiller on talk that the cash and carry group’s boss Charlie Wilson was angling for his job. “He’ll have to put up with me for a while yet.” More shy of the rowing machine was a stout Digby Jones, whose beloved Aston Villa are in with a chance of promotion back to the big time. But Jones seemed more preoccupied by the concern over Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street. Another gym-dodger is Serco chief executive Rupert Soames. Unlike brother Nicholas, Rupert was not at the Royal Wedding. But he was ebullient as ever, delighted that the fabled “shitometer” gauge on his desk has not gone off for a while due to the lack of crises at the once-accident prone services giant. Wife Milly was pleased about that, too, but not as delighted as she was to show off Rupert’s proud wearing of the Serco logo embroidered on the breast of his shirt, somewhat like a security guard. “I’m jolly proud of it,” said the stout boss, “but not of the man-boob underneath.” Elsewhere Spy ran into another busy dealmaker in GVC boss Kenny Alexander, up to his neck in getting to grips with Ladbrokes Coral following a £3.2 billion takeover. Both Alexander — a Scot who spent last Saturday’s wedding watching the racing and the rugby instead — and William Hill boss Philip Bowcock were breathless after a “rollercoaster” week for the sector which saw the US betting market opened up but FOBT stakes slashed. Bowcock, a proud Stoke fan, had the misfortune of seeing his team relegated but the only consolation was that the Potters have been the biggest winners for the bookie this season due to unfortunate punters betting on an upturn in form. Felicity Kendall has been causing sap to rise since Spy was a seedling. And the fragrant Good Life star still works her magic in her seventies. Guy Hands was left grinning ear to ear after she helped out at his Terra Firma-sponsored Prince’s Trust garden by Charles Williams, a chum of Hands from Oxford. “She spent a good hour and a half there with us, and looked absolutely marvellous!” he beamed. Lloyds chief Antonio Horta-Osorio was strolling with wife Ana looking for inspiration for their garden in Lisbon. AHO recalled: “I came here for my first time in 2008, one year into the financial crisis, and our host gave a speech I’ll never forget. It went: ‘Last year, we had many bankers at our party here at Chelsea. This year it is marvellous to see so many of you back again as gardeners.’” Enterprise Inns boss Simon Townsend — strong as an oak — was dishing out bone-crushing handshakes with gusto. Well he might: trading at pubs over the weekend was rather excellent by all accounts. “They came in for the wedding in the morning, then stayed all day for the FA Cup in the evening. Marvellous!” he guffawed. Bob Diamond was adding some American glitz to the affair, chatting to anyone who could handle the dazzle effect of his supernaturally white gnashers. It takes more than a few boring lawyers to kill off dealmaker Amanda Staveley’s cheer. She and partner Mehrdad Ghodoussi had just heard the news that the courts had thrown out the Serious Fraud Office’s charges against Barclays over its emergency fundraising from Qatar in the 2008 financial crisis. Staveley is suing the bank for fees she claims her PCP Capital Partners is owed for brokering the deal. Yesterday’s decision was irrelevant, she beamed: “I look forward to my day in court.” The couple still say they’re looking at football club deals despite reports that talks with Mike Ashley to buy Newcastle United appear to have faded. “We’re not talking about Magpies,” she said, cryptically. Back at the nosebag tent of Spy’s hosts Standard Aberdeen, trencher-man Martin Gilbert was in fine form, holding forth with chums Lynton Crosby, Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross and Rory Bremner among others. It was old pal Andrew Neil’s birthday, and a giant cake was produced for the shy, retiring, broadcasting tiger. “I’d like to thank Chelsea for putting this wonderful show on for my birthday,” said the great man. And with that, he blew out the candles on another Chelsea power show. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here. Are you sure you want to submit this vote?

Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--iCash has launched its Proof of Trust (‘PoT’) protocol and initial token sale offering (TSO). The PoT protocol creates the ability to add an assurance and validation layer to blockchain transactions and is designed to increase trust and confidence in the system, paving the way for institutional adoption. The attraction of blockchain is that information is stored in an immutable ledger, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. However, there have been very few solutions to the challenge of validating the trustworthiness of data entered onto the blockchain. iCash’s solution is a PoT protocol that allows for processes to assure and insure the validity of smart contract inputs and outcomes. Commenting on the launch, CEO and Founder Will McDonough, said “Industries are being transformed as they conduct business on the blockchain via smart contracts. Developing checks and balances for validation of those transactions has been a problem for blockchain users and large corporations, until now.” “While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of Proof of Trust provides distributed trust and assurance for data input to the blockchain. The future belongs to innovators, and iCash’s underlying technology aims to institutionalize the blockchain, and protect those who transact from being victims of incorrect or nefarious data inputs on the blockchain.” PoT can be applied to any live verifiable event involving a smart contract in sectors such as: trading in commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies, sports and wider asset management activities. iCash, through its protocol, enables the filtration and appeal of smart contract outcomes at scale and across ledgers. Fast, incorruptible appeal and settlement are achieved via a community of delegates, which validates and audits the trustworthiness of data inputs and outcomes. iCash uses a reputational algorithm designed to track and rank the trustworthiness of its delegates over time and only the most trustworthy delegates are able to validate data inputs, and thus earn iCash. PoT increases the scalability of smart contract input verification and execution on the blockchain. The iCash technology team is currently focused on the Ethereum, EOS, and NEO blockchains, but are also developing the platform to work across all blockchains. The opportunity set for iCash’s implementation is global, and the firm has to date secured 70 patents in 100 countries. iCash’s management team has a successful record of building businesses in emerging technology and institutional finance. Its leadership includes CEO Will McDonough, who previously led the $825 million IPO for Atlas Mara on the London Stock Exchange with co-founder and former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, as well as CIO Magnus Sigurdsson, who developed asset allocation strategies for a $7 billion portfolio at TIFF, the not-for-profit organisation, and global macro at 55 Institutional. The Company’s President Jonathan Malveaux is a JD/MBA with 25 years of experience in Asia working internationally for Panasonic, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. The Company’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer previously served as Risk Management Officer at the $75 billion State of Massachusetts Pensions Reserve Investment Board (MA PRIM). iCash’s Chief Economist Max Fraad-Wolff was also among the first Wall Street analysts to value LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and AliBaba. NOTES TO EDITORS About iCash iCash is a revolutionary company dedicated to bringing trust to the blockchain. iCash’s Proof of Trust protocol assures the validity of Smart Contract settlements. Blockchain ensures that information is immutably stored without a central authority, but not enough attention is paid to the negative impact when an input to the blockchain is not trustworthy. iCash introduces the Proof of Trust (PoT) protocol as a multi-platform protocol that enables real-world inputs to be validated by decentralized participants in settling Smart Contracts. While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of PoT provides distributed trust for data input. PoT uses a reputational algorithm and known participants to provide real-world validation without sacrificing technical efficiency. With this, interactions and events can be trusted & verified before being entered into the blockchain. iCash is made up of executives, academics and entrepreneurs with hundreds of years of experience in public and private companies—with hundreds of billions in market cap including: BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Electronic Arts, General Electric, State of Massachusetts Pension Fund, Uber, and more. The world-class leadership team with over 70 patents and trademarks across 100 countries position iCash to be a truly global token protocol. The company’s team is led by founder and CEO, Will McDonough who has built and scaled multiple public and private companies, managed the private capital of the Partners of Goldman Sachs, and later co-founded London Stock Exchange listed Atlas Mara, alongside former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond. McDonough is also a founding member of the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development, an organization that supports the United Nations’ ability to integrate blockchain technologies in meeting Sustainable Development Goals.

He said: 'Ben and I just went for it. I got 'pash rash' from his beard. I loved him.

Ahead of her wedding to photographer Francesco Carrozzini, son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, she and pals including Glee star Dianna Agron and former Barclays boss Bob Diamond’s daughter, Nell, headed for Mexico. As well as going fishing and watching the Royal Wedding, they were given matching Juicy Couture tracksuits — though as this snap shows, Bee, who works in theatre production, seemed happier in a bikini. Bee Shaffer, 30, during her hen party break in Mexico in which her friend went fishing and enjoyed the beach Axed Strictly Come Dancing star Brendan Cole put on a show of marital harmony at the launch of the Chelsea Flower Show as he playfully pretended to bite his wife, Zoe Hobbs. Zoe, who has two children with Brendan, apparently read him the riot act after he was photographed a fortnight ago getting intimate outside a London club with Jenna-Lee James, a 41-year-old backing dancer. ‘I was innocent,’ he protested. ‘Being a dancer I’m just a tactile person. It looked worse than it was. It’s disgusting. I think there are jealous people out there.

It will be showcased Friday through Sunday and June 1-3. Audience members will be summoned as jurors in a futuristic courtroom, where they will be faced with the decision to grant Albert Stone — an obscure, self-absorbed poet with familiar flaws and failures — a costly treatment that would give him immortality. It will be up to jurors whether Stone’s potential future contributions to society are valuable enough to justify the expense of life-sustaining care. Director Marc Clopton said the play’s themes revolve around the flaws in the U.S. health care system and provide commentary on the growing costs of care to which many people can relate. “People are already experiencing the financial glass ceiling with health care, and anybody who is managing a household budget knows what that feels like,” Clopton said. Health care is a topic of concern for Fulton, who said he hopes the play will spark conversation among the audience on the future of a society that, in many situations, favors the very rich and leaves others needing to make difficult decisions and sacrifices. “I think these are all issues that people need to address but the play is not meant to be political,” Fulton said. “It’s just meant to get us to think about these problems together.” While the interactive show puts some pressure on the audience and provokes intense, existential questions, Clopton said the story is also told with a great sense of humor. “It puts the audience in the hot seat, and they get to feel the responsibility of making the final call,” Clopton said. “I think that, ultimately, people will really enjoy the play. There’s enough lightness to make it not seem so dark and oppressive.” The play includes original compositions by recording artist Roger Ebacher. Ebacher, a Newburyport native, has earned a solid reputation for the passion, artistry and professionalism he brings to his recordings and live appearances. He has twice been the featured guest artist on “Eric in the Evening,” a jazz program on WGBH radio, and also had his music featured in several international music compilations. As the “The Trial of Mr. Stone” nears its premier this weekend, Fulton said he is pleased to see his work come to fruition at The Actors Studio with a result uniquely mixing social commentary, laughs, poetry and music. “It’s good to see it go from two dimensions on a piece of paper to having the characters come alive on stage,” Fulton said, commending Clopton for his directing work. “And I have to say, it’s hilarious.” The shows will be Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 5 p.m. over the next two weekends. Admission is $20 for adults and $18 for students and seniors. For more information or to make reservations, visit www.newburyportacting.org, or call 978-465-1229.

Michael,Gordon,941,https://www.westport-news.com/news/article/Board-of-Education-Chairman-Gordon-to-step-down-12932566.php,"By Justin Papp Caption Close WESTPORT — Michael Gordon will soon no longer be chairman of the Board of Education. Citing an increasingly busy schedule, Gordon announced Monday he would step down by the end of June from the school board after more than six years of service, including almost four years as chairman. “Since I first joined the board, my responsibilities at work have increased as my company has expanded. I”m at a point with my day job that I can no longer continue my BOE service at the high intensity level that it requires,” Gordon, a Democrat, told the board. Since 2005, Gordon has owned his own strategic communications firm, Group Gordon, with offices in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago. He has three children in Westport Public Schools. He was elected to the board in 2011 and became chairman in 2014. He served in President Bill Clinton’s administration as a special assistant on education policy. justin.papp@scni.com; @justinjpapp1; 203-842-2586

Michael,Gordon,941,http://www.goulburnpost.com.au/story/5422360/200-years-to-be-celebrated/,"A meeting organised by the Historical Society to gauge interest in celebrating “Taralga 200 Years On” was chaired by Peter Davies. The enthusiastic crowd, representing many organisations and some local businesses, threw in suggestions for the proposed long weekend in October 2019. These included: an old time ball, a sheep muster, stalls, tree planting, a fun run or half marathon, car clubs, modern or vintage, street parade with buskers, a visit by a TV or radio celebrity, camp fire cooking and recognition of the indigenous people. One person is already working on a history of the beginnings of the district. 200 YEARS: There was a good roll-up to the inaugural meeting of those interested in celebrating the anniversary of Taralga's discovery. Organisations not at the meeting will be approached for their ideas and participation in the weekend, so that there will be three full days of fun to entertain residents and visitors both very young, middle of the road and quite old. A core committee was formed with Peter Davies and Graham Lambert (as leaders) plus Kristy O’Sullivan, Michael Chalker, Andrew Moore, Colin Chalker, Karina Rees, Bronwyn Sullivan, Mary Chalker and Max Keith. It is expected that each organisation or group of organisations, will be responsible for their segment of the festival. It was suggested that we would need a theme – perhaps someone not at the meeting would have an idea. The annual meeting of the Taralga and District Fire Brigade saw John Sullivan re-elected as Captain. Senior Deputy Captain is Bradley Sheridan with Deputy Captains- Mandy Lang, Lawrie Dunn and Jeffrey Chalker. The Administrative Officers- President, Michael (Gordon) Chalker; Secretary, Peter Davies; Treasurer, Graham Lambert; Training Officer, Bradley Sheridan’ Assistant Training Officer, Lawrie Dunn; Equipment Officer, Wilma Forsyth; Community Engagement Officer, Tammi Balfour. The five Hedley children, Meika, Bill, Alison, Mark and Michael took their mother, Rowena, with more than 40 family members, to the Argyle Inn to celebrate her 83rd birthday. Unfortunately Rowe’s husband, Bill, was too unwell to attend. The Hedley family owned the hotel for over 20 years. It is 30 years ago in June that the family sold the business. Rowena and the children had many memories of those years and were amazed at the transformation of the hotel and the refurbishments made. Remember to put your name in for the Red Cross lunch by May 25. The lunch will be held in the Jameson Hall on Friday, June 1, 12pm. The guest speaker will be Dr Meredith Burgman.

Michael,Gordon,941,http://news.psu.edu/story/522512/2018/05/21/impact/love-game-drives-players-coaches-grow-handball-penn-state,"The Penn State women's handball team won the national championship in its first season. Two of the team's coaches are from the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — 2013 was shaping up to be a great year for Simao Hamilton Yala. He was playing professionally for the junior handball team in his home country of Angola when the senior team called his number. Soon after, as one goalie parted ways, he jumped in to fill the spot. And, at the coach’s request, that’s where he stayed. Yala quickly propelled his team to qualifying for the International Handball Federation World Men’s Handball Championships, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete for the world title. But, as his team entered the tournament, Yala wasn’t guarding the net. Something better had come up. Yala took advantage of a scholarship to continue his education in the U.S. He joined Penn State Abington before heading to University Park, where he’s a senior majoring in mining engineering in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences (EMS). Yala calls it “the year of D” because of all the decisions he faced. He remembers his mother, Ana Cassua, who knew his love of the game, pleading with him to get a quality education. “I had to decide to stay home and play handball or come to Penn State to get an education,” Yala said. The U.S. is one of the best countries in the world. My mom cried because she knows that I really love handball. She said ‘please, go get an education. Then you can do whatever you want. But, please, first get an education.’ ” Yala is one of many EMS students to have played on the team. As things were beginning for Yala, so was the club sport handball at Penn State. That’s thanks to two members of EMS. Academic adviser Michael Gordon, who played soccer for Seton Hall, helped found the club in 2012 after the London Olympics generated interest in the sport. The assistant coach and former player who fell in love with the game has seen the program grow from “four guys throwing a ball around the gym, not knowing the rules” to competitive teams of about 120 men and 30 women. This season, the women’s team won its first national championship in its inaugural season and the men’s team, now in its fifth season, won its regular season conference title and made the Elite 8. Gordon said although there is a bump in excitement after each Olympics, few in the U.S. know much about the game. Most who enter the club at Penn State adapt their skills from football, soccer or basketball. “The way we try to describe it to people is it’s like water polo on land or soccer with your hands,” said Gordon, who this past weekend was named Most Valuable Goalie for Division I at the U.S. Open Handball Championships in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. “That’s the best first description that we can give.” Handball is a fast-paced, high-scoring indoor game where players attempt to toss a ball that’s larger than a softball into indoor-soccer-sized nets. Because the game allows for some contact, similar to basketball, and games feature dozens of scored goals, it’s gained popularity at Penn State and elsewhere. Head coach Thomas Lauvaux, who is an associate research professor of meteorology and atmospheric science, also has a hand in the team’s success. Lauvaux played regionally in France before switching to volleyball while a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State because he found little interest in the sport here. Lauvaux found out about the club and jumped at the chance to get involved. Originally, he wanted to play but he found that, because of his knowledge of the game, coaching is where he would have the most impact. “Initially, it was just a little club. We were trying to get a team together that could show up at the next game and not look bad. We weren’t even worried about competing,” said Lauvaux, who was named Coach of the Year for the 2015-16 season. “Now it's on another level. I think about practice, what the focus is going to be, the weak spots I noticed in the last tournament.” Yala spent a couple years at Penn State before finding the handball team, relinking him to a sport he fell in love with as a child. He’s not competing for a world title but he’s helping a team grow as he does the same for his career. He traded athletic accolades for academic achievements, but in some ways those two intersect. Both require hard work for the rewards. “If you practice and work hard you can get everything you want,” Yala said. “We can be one of the best teams in the country, if we put the work in.” He’s been able to advance his education while remaining close to the sport. After all, he says, college is more than just an education. “It isn’t just about the degree,” Yala said. “It’s about the experiences that you accumulate throughout the years, whether it be clubs you join, students you meet or faculty who engage you. That’s what I love about Penn State.” A member of the Penn State men's handball team scores a goal. Members of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences are credited with creating the men's and women's teams and improving them to championship-caliber squads. 312 Old Main, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 814-865-7517 The Pennsylvania State University © 2015

Jane,Powers,940,http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/culture/ct-redeye-concerts-20180522-story.html,"Ester is the latest project of Anna Holmquist, who has built a full band with her “folk-y singer-songwriter vibe.” Ester will hold a release party at the Hideout on May 29 for its first album, “Curtains.” The independent recording will be available online and on streaming services as well as through cassette tape. Q: How did Ester come together? A: I've been doing solo or smaller group music in Chicago for quite a number of years now and at the end of 2017, put together a full band for my own music where I’m the sole songwriter. It feels like a super group to be able to work with these talented musicians. It’s different people from bands the Curls, Coleslaw, Tobacco City, Richard Album, the Jellies, the Caleb Willitz Band, Tragic Trip and Emily Jane Powers. Q: What’s the story behind the album? A: This album has been probably two and a half to three years in the making. It was on pause for a while, so I’m excited to put it out. I think it’s a little bit of a quieter, gentler rendition of my songs. It’s a lot of older songs. I chose the name “Curtains” because I’m sort of seeing it as the end to a certain chapter of my music and the beginning of a new one with a full band. Q: What do you like about playing with more musicians? A: I think it’s really awesome to see how other people interpret your songs and see what ideas they come up with musically. I wouldn’t be able to think of that by myself. Working with other musicians, especially such talented ones like I’m working with, really helps to expand your idea of what’s possible musically.

Jacob Janak competes in the shot put. East Butler's Amanda Aerts wins the 1600 meter state championship on Saturday in Omaha. Jacob Janak competes in the shot put. The East Butler boys and girls track teams were led by Amanda Aerts and Mathew Janak at the 2018 NSAA Track and Field Championship. Both athletes won multiple medals on the track and accounted for most of the team scoring. Amanda Aerts got her first ever gold medal at the state meet by winning the 1600-meter run. Early on Aerts jumped out in front and set the pace for the entire race. In the final lap, Madison Gerken of McCool Junction broke off from the rest of the pack and caught up to Aerts. Heading into the last 100-meters both runners went back and forth. Aerts held off the furious late kick of Gurken and won by seven-tenths of a second in a time of 5:25.39. In the 3200-meter run, Aerts finished third overall in a time of 12:17.47. She was in the front pack until the mile point, when the eventual champion Jade Richard of Plainview broke off. Aerts dug down and outkicked Diller Odell’s Haley Jones down the straightaway in the final lap. “It’s really amazing because last year I wasn’t able to compete due to a stress fracture,” said Aerts. “I made it but was unable to run, so this year just being able to come back and come out on top is just indescribable.” The Tigers only other event at the state meet for the girls was the 4x800 meter relay. The team of Amada Aerts, Olivia Bohac, Sophia Bergman, and Hallie Zitek finished one spot back of a medal in ninth place with a time of 10:34.59. Mathew Janak finished with two medals for the East Butler boys team in the 100 and 200-meter dashes. In the prelims of the 200-meter dash, Janak recorded the fastest time with a 23.14. Sterling’s Tristan Dirks and Johnson-Brock’s Ty Hann’s times were right behind him. In the finals, Janak got out to a fast start, by faded down the stretch with the front of the pack. He finished fourth overall with a time of 23.40. Janak was paired with eventual champion Braiden Gomez in heat 3 of the prelims for the 100-meter dash. He finished second behind Gomez with a time of 11.35. A mixture of a strong wind on Saturday and a slow start hampered his time in the 100-meter dash finals. He finished eighth overall with a time of 11.84. In the 3200-meter run Cristian Hofpar ran his best time of the year with an 11:08.75. He beat out Jared Bessmer of Osmond by one-tenth of a second for fifteenth place. Trevor Havlovic qualified for the finals of the 110-meter hurdles, by posting the eighth fastest time in the prelims with a 16.24. He improved on that time in finals by running a 16.02, good enough to earn sixth place. Colton Munger of North Central won the race with a time of 15.31. In the 300-meter hurdles, Havlovic was eighth out of eight competitors in heat three of the prelims. He finished with a time of 45.48. Jacob Janak in the shot put ended up in ninth-place with a throw of 46-11. He improved by eleven inches from districts, but it wasn’t enough to beat Jared Hornback of Giltner for eighth. In the discus, Brandon Rezac earned a seventh-place finish for East Butler with a throw of 148-07. Andrew Davis of Pawnee City won with a toss of 165-05. Dalton Bohac couldn’t quite find the forty plus foot mark that he produced at districts in the triple jump. He ended up twenty-second out of twenty-four competitors with a jump of 37-09.75. The East Butler girls finished in a three-way tie for thirteenth place in the final standings with 13 points, and the boys were twentieth with 11 points. Giltner won Class D for the girls with 89.50 points, and the boy's championship was won by Axtell with 65 points. Click to view our area sections and weekly inserts!

Andrew,Davis,938,https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/china-said-to-consider-ending-birth-limits-as-soon-as-this-year/44134132,"The following content is sourced from external partners. We cannot guarantee that it is suitable for the visually or hearing impaired. Bloomberg Pedestrians and a child wearing a child harness walks along a pedestrian shopping area in Shanghai, China, on Friday, Sept. 29, 2017. China's earliest economic indicators hinted that growth continued to moderate in September as official drives to curb debt risk and clear the skies weighed on activity. (Bloomberg) -- China is planning to scrap all limits on the number of children a family can have, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would be a historic end to a policy that spurred countless human-rights abuses and left the world’s second-largest economy short of workers. The State Council, China’s cabinet, has commissioned research on the repercussions of ending the country’s roughly four-decade-old policy and intends to enact the change nationwide, said the people, who asked not to be named while discussing government deliberations. The leadership wants to reduce the pace of aging in China’s population and remove a source of international criticism, one of the people said. Proposals under discussion would replace the population-control policy with one called “independent fertility,” allowing people to decide how many children to have, the person said. The decision could be made as soon as the fourth quarter, the second person said, adding that the announcement might also be pushed into 2019. QuickTake: China’s Family Size Limits ""It’s late for China to remove birth limits even within this year but it’s better than never,"" said Chen Jian, a former division chief at the National Family Planning Commission, who’s now a vice president of the China Society of Economic Reform. ""Scrapping birth limits will have little effect on the tendency of China’s declining births."" Baby-related stocks climbed in China Tuesday, with Ningbo David Medical Device Co., a maker of infant incubators and obstetric equipment, surging by as much as 10 percent. Childcare firms climbed with toy makers, while infant formula producers Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co. and Bright Dairy & Food Co. jumped at least 1.4 percent. On Monday, Danone, which has doubled its share of China’s baby food market in the past five years, rose to a session high before paring gains, while U.K.-based Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc shares erased declines in London. The policy change would close the book on one of the largest social experiments in human history, which left the world’s most-populous country with a rapidly aging population and 30 million more men than women. The policies have forced generations of Chinese parents to pay fines, submit to abortions or raise children in the shadows. Two-Child Policy The U.S. and other Western nations have criticized the coercive measures required to enforce the birth limits, including steep fines, sterilization and forced abortions. The 2015 shift toward a two-child policy was part of a gradual effort to loosen the birth limits over the years as China’s working-age population began to wane. An initial feasibility study was submitted to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in April, according to one of the people familiar with the discussions. That study found there would be “limited” benefits to lifting birth restrictions nationwide. Li requested more research on the social impact of scrapping the policy altogether, the person said. Neither the State Council Information Office nor the National Health Commission immediately returned faxed requests for comment Monday. ""The policy shift will hardly boost the number of newborns in China,"" said Huang Wenzheng, a specially-invited senior researcher of Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank. ""China’s number of births will continue to drop dramatically, considering a sharp decrease in the number of fertile women and declining fertility willingness."" Still, the move underscores growing concern among Chinese policy makers that more dramatic action is needed three years after allowing all families to have two children instead of one. Births fell 3.5 percent to 17.2 million nationwide last year, according to the Bureau of National Statistics, erasing almost half of the increase in births caused by relaxing the policy. China’s graying society will have broad consequences for the nation and the world, weighing on President Xi Jinping’s effort to develop the economy, driving up pension and healthcare costs, and sending foreign companies further afield for labor. The State Council last year projected that about a quarter of China’s population will be 60 or older by 2030, up from 13 percent in 2010. “The low birth rate and low number of newborns from the previous two years after the two-child policy sent a strong message to the decision-makers that the young generation has a weak willingness to have more children,” Chen said. “China’s population issues will be a major hurdle for President Xi Jinping’s vision of building a modernized country by 2035.” Why more children may be bad for Chinese growth: Bloomberg Economics’ take. In March, China removed the term “family planning” from the name of the newly consolidated National Health Commission -- the first time since 1981 that no agency bears the name. Xi and Li also omitted any reference to the phrase from key policy reports in recent months. Gender Gap While China credits birth limits with helping to launch a decades-long economic boom under reformer Deng Xiaoping, they have also exacerbated demographic imbalances, with many parents choosing to abort female fetuses. China has 106 men for every 100 women, compared with 102 globally, according to the CIA World Factbook. Such moves have done little to increase the fertility rate, with many parents concerned about the costs of raising additional children in a society accustomed to focusing family resources on one. Nonetheless, Chinese policy makers have resisted calls by economists and demographers to relinquish control amid concerns over the impact of a sudden increase in births or older parents angry about missing the chance to expand their families. Even a short-lived baby boom could prove lucrative for businesses who cater to childrens’ needs in the world’s most populous county. Chinese consumers bought $19.4 billion of infant products between September 2016 and August 2017, an 11 percent increase, according to an annual report released by Nielsen Holdings Plc in November.

Michael,Gordon,936,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/21/can-this-be-the-start-of-ash-taylors-run/,"TITANS ""When he runs, you know he's on. When he kicks and he chases, you know he's on. If he's playing both sides of the ruck, you know he's on. ""And he needs to [do all that]."" Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan was summarising not just his prize halfback Ash Taylor but perhaps his team's chances of being ""on"" as surprise a finals hope. Cbus Super Stadium last Saturday. Titans, desperate to avoid six straight defeats, versus Knights. We'd seen what we're used to from Taylor – big spiralling kicks, marshalling his teammates with authority. The acute grubber kick was to follow. Then, in the 38th minute, he ran the ball deep in Newcastle territory not once, but twice, in the same set. A shimmy and dummy on the right. Two tackles later, a dart and a left-handed offload in a two-man tackle to send Dale Copley over for a try. In the coach's box Brennan pumped his fist and smiled. For weeks he'd taken a line out of Forest Gump the movie and had been telling his halfback, 'run Ash, run."" ""If a half doesn't run, the defence just worries about the support runners,"" Brennan said. ""But if you have a half who genuinely runs and they have to worry about you, it opens it up for those around you."" Taylor was definitely on last Saturday. That try, a kick to the left for Alexander Brimson to score the match-winning try. A field goal to seal the victory. He even nailed a couple of goals from out wide after Michael Gordon handed him the role after suffering a cork to his kicking leg. Taylor knows the score. He is an avid watcher of video of football and opposing halfbacks. A genuine student of the game. He's smart, mature, confident, skillful and ambitious. And he has the speed and strength to trouble any defence not just with his boot and the ball out of his hands, but his feet and running anticipation… when he's on. ""I have been wanting to do it for a long time but I haven't found the right time,"" Taylor said about his ball-running. ""I really want to take the line on now. ""The great halfbacks of the game like Johnathan Thurston and Cooper Cronk do run the ball. I need to make sure I have the option to run the ball at all times."" And then he agreed that Penrith's comeback kid Ivan Cleary has been more consistent in big-play moments. ""You have to be more consistent as a half, he's been playing some great footy the past couple of seasons,"" Taylor said of Cleary. ""Him being a rookie like me doesn't mean I can't learn off him too, and all other halfbacks in the NRL. ""I have been watching a lot of footy in the last month and just want to keep adding stuff to my game. ""I'm still finding my feet as I try to be that dominant half."" Perhaps Taylor has been worried too much about the big picture. Like emulating the great Thurston. About playing for Queensland. About being his team's main man. He admits it can be a distraction, although no one can doubt his focus to improve. Sometimes relying in instinct, and the moment right now rather than the moments that may or may not come, can add up to more in the long run. ""It can be pressure from outside to perform, you can let it be a distraction,"" Taylor admits. ""There are different stages when you have to step up as an individual and provide the big plays at times and I have probably been off that the last month and Garth has challenged me about that."" The 38th minute, Titans v Knights, May 19. A turning point or a moment that just fades? Fox Sports commentator Matt Russell summed up Taylor's try-creator this way: ""Ash Taylor stands up when his team needs it."" Taylor wants to, and knows he needs to, stand up more consistently. And run.

Journal Staff REPORT The Davis New Mexico Scholarship program has announced 26 high school seniors from Santa Fe and Albuquerque who will receive full four-year scholarships to a partner college. “These students are the latest class in this fast growing scholarship, which now supports 82 students from Northern New Mexico who are the first in their families to earn a four-year college degree,” according to a news release from the program. The program, which boasts a 98 percent retention rate among its scholars so far, is funded by the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and its Trustee Andrew Davis. The Davises last year made a three-year $11.6 million commitment to fund 100 scholars to and through college. The Davis partner colleges are the University of Portland, St. Edward’s University, University of Denver, Loyola Marymount University, Lawrence University and Southwestern University. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “This is about possibility,” Andrew Davis said in a statement. “This is about what these students do when they come back home and demonstrate to their communities that it is possible to go to college, that it is possible to successfully navigate college, and that it is possible to improve not only their neighborhoods but also the world.” The 2018 Davis New Mexico Scholars are: Otto G.

Digging deeper I realised that what he meant, among other things, was perhaps that Nepal continues to be a surrogate space for Tibet, particularly Tibetan Buddhism, to the Western mind. This explains why there is less awareness of the ‘paubha’ outside Nepal. And the fact that most of the best ‘thangka’ produced here is actually collected by collectors in China, brings in another geopolitical twist since works produced in Tibet would surely never find space on Chinese walls. Both the art forms, of the primary ‘paubha’ indigenous to Kathmandu Valley and its later evolved form of the ‘thangka’ in Tibet, were initially driven by religion and spirituality. They served the dual function of being a meditative practice in itself for an artist practitioner, as well as an artefact or ‘ritual object’ necessary for spiritual practice. The obvious patrons were everyday individuals keen on religious practice, monks, monasteries, and of course the royalty and aristocracy. Each piece took hours, sometimes hundreds of hours, to make and were therefore expensive. Plus it required years and years of hands on training and practice along with years of study in Buddhist philosophy and rituals. The world was a quieter place then, and time moved much slower than it does today. The market was limited. And the economy ran on a different mechanism, where everyone had a given, traditional place. It is a different, faster world now. The market mechanism works differently. There is nothing ‘given’ in terms of one’s place in society or within the economy. And one does not need to be a spiritual practitioner to be able to appreciate or own a ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’. The market for these art forms have boomed globally, especially for the ‘thangka’, thanks to Tibetan Buddhism’s incursions into the Western hemisphere since the 1960s. Restricting its production only to those who were traditionally allowed to do so, would throw the mechanism of a capital driven economy awry. History required that the making of it be democratised, market demands required that more of it was created faster, cheaper and in great numbers. And so what was once a sacred tradition practiced by an initiated few, became a means of livelihood for many across caste, class and gender barriers. And so we are at a quandary today. On one hand we prefer to advocate the cause of authenticity against vulgarisation. Of protecting a sacred tradition restricted to a select few. In which case we will be speaking against democratisation of a tradition that now allows hundreds to feed their families and support their communities. Michael Gordon makes a good case for this with the selection of artists he has chosen to showcase in ‘Sacred Survival’. While the famed Lok Chitrakar and Tenzin Norbu come from families, who have been traditionally artists for generations, the remaining five have had to break multiple glass ceilings—constituted by tradition, caste, religion, gender and formal education—to arrive at successful careers. For some, like Karam Rinchhen Gurung or Lok Chitrakar, the practice remains centred on ‘dharma’ or a spiritual quest. For others, like Bhim Thapa, it is means to support hundreds of families with food, clothing and shelter in earthquake devastated Sindhupalchowk. For Tualaram Lama, it is about encouraging artistic and economic solidarity within the Tamang community. For Tenzin Norbu, it is about promoting education, supporting schools, encouraging sustainable development in remote Dolpo. For Muna Moktan and Sonam Dolma, it is about breaking gender barriers within a patriarchal system and earning a living in a male dominated field; it is also about empowering the next generation of women. Gordon has shown specimen artworks by these artists on the ground floor of the Siddhartha Art Gallery. Most of them are unfinished, in process and cover a wide stylistic range between Norbu’s extraordinary conflation of Western imagery with the ‘thangka’ style and Lok Chitrakar’s exquisite ‘paubha’ iconography. But what makes the show even more interesting are the four blank canvases upstairs, stretched on to frames, that act as screens for projecting seven visual narratives catching the artists at work on the pieces. Each projection is accompanied by an audio interview that captures their life story and painting paraphernalia set out on the floor. The focus is very much on the process involved, on the individual lives lived, on their daily struggles; on how they negotiate tradition and make it relevant today. The catalogue text prepared by Gordon is detailed and comprehensive enough to require no further explanation for the endeavour. As Sujan Chitrakar succinctly pointed out in his inaugural speech, we are now at a point in history where we need to take stock of the processes involved, of their place within the economy and not treat these art forms as if they are practiced within a tradition insulated from the market. But we must also be wary of being reduced to the market’s demands. That is indeed a difficult ropewalking act to pursue. The fact that these traditional art forms are surviving, and experiencing an influx of artists to boot, who chose it as a viable means of livelihood, means that these art forms are negotiating our globalised world’s economic structures and rules. It is important that we learn to focus on that for it will surely give us insights into processes that have escaped us till now. But more importantly, it may even show us the route we must take to make the world a more equitable place. Sometime ago, I remember writing in this column a piece that I find relevant today and so am quoting it again: ‘Oikos is an ancient Greek word that has evolved into the “eco” of both economics and ecology. It is a fact that though the two words share the same prefix, they are somewhat antithetical to each other in terms of ethics. In terms of the art world, they are not the best of friends either...That economics drives the production of art globally today is a fact we cannot bypass or ignore. As responsible inhabitants of Earth in the 21st century we can only try and rescue it from the absolute grasp of market mechanisms and try and restore it to ecology to some extent.’ Well done Michael Gordon! May we continue to witness more such queries in the coming years. @media(max-width: 468px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/margin-left: 5px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat: no-repeat;margin-top: -9px;margin-left: -2px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}}@media(min-width: 478px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;height: 90px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;margin-left: 15px;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 84%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 79%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 105%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 100%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;width: 90%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 97%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}}@media (max-width:768px){.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{margin: 0 auto;display: block;width: 300px;}}function gaEvent(eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel){ga('send','event',eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel);} Published: 20-05-2018 08:18 Click here for your comments Comment via Facebook Don't have facebook account?

The world number 17 was the highest-ranked athlete to compete today with the top-16 seeds all receiving a bye through the round of pools and preliminary stage at the Chinese city’s Jing'an Sports Center. Cadot advanced from Pool 1 with five wins out of six, ranking second behind the United States’ Nick Itkin who beat him 5-1. He will next play Great Britain’s James-Andrew Davis, who finished runner-up in Pool 17 before securing his place in the round-of-64 with a 15-13 victory over South Korea’s Im Cheolwoo. Standing between Itkin and a place in the last-32 is South Korea’s Lee Kwanghyun. Top seed Alessio Foconi, who formed part of the gold medal-winning Italian team at last year's World Championships, will firstly have to find his way past Russia’s Pavel Borontov. Borontov advanced from Pool 7 with two wins from his six outings before defeating Japan’s Ryohei Noguchi 15-6 and Germany’s Felix Klein 15-13. Both the men’s and women’s events will conclude tomorrow with the direct elimination rounds and final. Yesterday saw the women's round of pools and preliminary stage take centre stage with Russia’s Kristina Samsonova setting up a last-64 clash against top-seeded compatriot Inna Deriglazova.

Iran dominate second day of the IFBB Men's World Bodybuilding Championships At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Iranian judoka Arash Miresmaeili was disqualified for weighing in at nearly four pounds above the limit for his weight class of his under-66 kilograms match against an Israeli opponent Ehud Vaks in the first round. It was claimed Miresmaeili had gone on an eating binge to protest the International Olympic Committee's recognition of the state of Israel. Iran does not recognise the state of Israel, and Miresmaeili's actions won praise from high-ranking Iranian officials. Mohammad Khatami, the country's President at the time, was quoted as saying Miresmaili's actions would be ""recorded in the history of Iranian glories"". He was later awarded $125,000 by the Government - the same amount given to Olympic gold medallists.

Andrew,Davis,930,https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/boxing/i-can-die-a-happy-man-warrington-ecstatic-after-historic-world-title-win-1-9172373,"Warrington overwhelmed Selby and short odds in favour of the Welshman with a relentless display in front of a huge Elland Road crowd, cutting Selby early on and beating him on a split points decision. Selby, who was making the fifth defence of the belt he won in 2015, struggled to cope with Warrington’s intensity and was rocked on several occasions as he fought to recover from a bad start which left blood streaming from his left eye midway through the second round. Warrington celebrated at the final bell and he and Selby - bitter adversaries for the past two years - shared some mutual respect but a crowd of 20,000 were incredulous as Canadian judge Andrew Davis scored the fight 115-113 in favour of Selby. The two remaining judges, however, gave the victory to Warrington as the 27-year-old claimed a world belt in his 27th professional fight. “I could die a happy man now, I really could,” Warrington said. “I couldn’t put it into words. What an occasion, what a night. It’s a fairytale ending. “I’ve been doubted for a very long time. I was doubted at English level, I was doubted at British level. I wasn’t meant to go any further. But number one in the world. No-one would ever have thought I’d got the speed, the punching power or the boxing intelligence but I outboxed, outfought and outsmarted a brilliant champion in Lee Selby.” Warrington, a Leeds United fan and season-ticket holder, has repeatedly stated his ambition to fight for a world title at Elland Road and promoter Frank Warren realised that dream by securing the venue in January. The Kaiser Chiefs warmed up the crowd with a set before the clash with Selby and Warrington was joined on his ringwalk by former Leeds captain Lucas Radebe, who flew in from South Africa. Warrington said the atmosphere inside Elland Road had helped to cure a sudden crisis of confidence in the hours beforehand. “I’ve always been confident throughout the build up to the fight, in the press conferences and the open workouts,” he said. “I’ve always massively believed that I had this fight won. “But earlier today I just got hit by a massive wave of nerves. I started thinking ‘what if it’s not meant to be. I’ve got the expectation of a whole city on my shoulders.’ As soon as I got into the venue tonight, it all lifted. As soon as I got in that ring and looked about I thought ‘there’s no way I’m losing this fight.’ The proof’s in the pudding.” Warrington and Selby have had an acrimonious relationship since a mooted meeting between them fell through two years ago fell. Selby accused Warrington of “bottling” the fight. Warrington said he had merely wanted a new date to allow him to get married that summer. The pair were involved in several bitter exchanges in the lead up to this weekend’s clash but Warrington attempted to end their feud, saying: “Prior to this fight I always had respect for Lee because it takes a good fighter to win world title and defend it more than one occasion. “He took it personal a few years ago and naturally I'm a lad from an estate so I responded. There was a lot of animosity in the build-up and in the last week but I said to him after the final bell ‘what’s done is done. We’ve just had 12 rounds to sort it out.’ Hopefully we’ll leave it at that.” In a statement released on Twitter this morning, Selby congratulated Warrington but said the fight would be his last at featherweight after a battle to make the nine-stone limit. ""I was Britain's longest reigning world champion but it came as a price,"" Selby wrote. ""I've been making the featherweight limit for 10 years but it was one fight too many and my performance badly reflected that. Congratulations to Josh and I wish him the best in the future."" ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

Michael,Gordon,928,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/19/gold-coast-titans-break-drought-with-late-win-over-newcastle-knights/,"MATCH REPORT The Gold Coast Titans gave a glimpse of what is possible from their 'Generation Next' in their 33-26 victory in one of the season's most dramatic see-sawing clash with Newcastle at Cbus Super Stadium. Halfback Ash Taylor, in his best performance for two months, stole the match in the dying minutes when he elected to kick high rather than take a field goal to break a 26-26 deadlock, and his 19-year-old halves partner Alexander Brimson cleaned up a rebound from Dale Copley to seal the game with his first NRL try. Phillip Sami scored two tries on the left wing, Brimson showed some touches of real class, while 21-year-old Keegan Hipgrave was aggressive and enthusiastic in his first run-on appearance. And 18-year-old Titans prop Moeaki Fotuaika was part of the drama too, the first of two Gold Coast players sin-binned, leaving them with 11 men for a minute after Jarrod Wallace followed him early in the second half for a professional foul. Yet the most sensational moment of the match came from the kid everyone in the NRL is talking about, Knights fullback Kalyn Ponga, with a 90-metre try that looked like it would give Newcastle an incredible victory. Ponga showed why he is regarded as the NRL's superstar of the future when he was given the ball by winger Ken Sio on a kick-return 10 metres from his own line but go around the Titans' chasers and showed blinding speed to tear away for a try. Brock Lamb's conversion gave Newcastle a 26-18 lead with 20 minutes remaining. Typical of this match, there was an instant turning point straight after. Daniel Saifiti spilled the ball when returning the kick-off. From the scrum the ball shifted right and Brenko Lee pushed off Nathan Ross with a right-hand fed and fed the unmarked Anthony Don a free run to the line. Taylor took over the goalkicking duties from Michel Gordon and landed the goal for 26-24 Newcastle, then levelled the scores with a penalty goal soon after before laying on the final try for Brimson. Taylor sealed the game with just over two minutes remaining when he set for a field goal on the fourth tackle and landed it from 25 metres out in front, ensuring the Titans broke a five-match losing season and kept their season alive. The Titans struck first when Kalyn Ponga spilled a bomb and the Titans sent the ball left, with Brimson sending Phillip Sami over in the corner. Unbelievably, the Titans' next points – a penalty goal to Gordon to take the lead to 8-0 – came from a scrum win against the feed sparked by returning hooker Nathan Peats. The Titans received a penalty in front of the posts in the next set and took the two points on offer. Sione Matu'atia struck back quickly for the Knights with the visitors' first points, stepping off his right foot to beat Dale Copley one-on-one. Back-to-back penalties in their own quarter saw Brock Lamb handed an easy penalty goal attempt and he levelled the scores at the 32-minute mark. Round 11 - Round 11 - Saturday 19 May Home Team Titans Away Team Knights Venue: Cbus Super Stadium Match broadcasters: Just before half-time Titans fans saw the side of Taylor that has been held back too often this season – his running game. The second time he ran the ball to the line in the same set produced a try for Copley on the left, when Taylor went at the line with intent and fed a class one-handed pass to Copley in the tackle. Promising 18-year-old Titans prop Fotuaika, had a start to the second half that he will want to forget – dropping the ball cold in his first hit-up of the half before being sin-binned in the following set for holding onto Mata'utia too long. Two plays later Slade Griffin sent Herman Ese'ese over for Newcastle's second on the left edge. Sami scored his second for the Titans in the 46th minute after Copley brilliantly threw a left-handed offload out the back to the unmarked Sami. Gordon converted from wide out for the home side to again gain supremacy at 18-14. For a minute the Titans were down to 11 men when Wallace was sent to the sin-bin for a professional foul, joining Fotuaika. Wallace put his arm out to obstruct Danni Levi from an offside position and referee Grant Atkins had no hesitation in disposing of Wallace for 10 minutes. Just 60 seconds later the Titans were back to 12 men with Fotuaika's return but the Knights kept the pressure up and were rewarded with a try to Ken Sio in the left corner after Ponga skipped outside his defender and threw a wonderful long ball. But the home side would finish the stronger to end a five-game losing streak. There were several tremendous individual efforts. Mitchell Barnett was outstanding for the Knights, Ponga very good while veteran Titans fullback Michael Gordon was excellent.

Michael,Gordon,928,https://www.areanews.com.au/story/5410519/titans-power-home-to-end-nrl-losing-streak/%3Fcs%3D4783,"Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan has heralded the rise of Ashley Taylor, with his Newcastle opposite only able to shake his head in frustration as the Titans ended a five-game NRL losing streak. The halfback was best on ground in the Titans' comeback 33-26 win, the hosts scoring the game's last 15 points despite having two men sin-binned in a fluctuating second half at Robina. Rookie five-eighth Alexander Brimson was the man of the moment, scoring at the death to cap a remarkable comeback after some Kalyn Ponga brilliance looked to have consigned the Titans to a sixth straight loss. With the game in the balance the Knights fullback raced 95 metres, slicing through some staggered defence and then nailing the footrace for a 26-18 lead. But the game turned when Daniel Saifiti dropped the ball from the restart, the Titans piling on two tries and a field goal as Nathan Brown's side slipped to 6-5 this season. Second-gamer Brimson completed the comeback when he pounced on a loose ball, the 19-year-old mobbed after planting the match-winner in the corner. ""They were shot ducks, we were on a roll and Daniel Saifiti just dropped the ball from the kick-off,"" Brown said. ""It's a carbon copy of the last three games ... get ourselves in very strong position and someone makes an unforgivable error."" Gold Coast had both Moeaki Fotuaika and Jarrod Wallace sin-binned amid repeated time-wasting incidents, with the pair both off briefly in a penalty-laden second half. The Knights couldn't capitalise though, with the Titans retaining the lead while a man down. Herman Ese'ese and Dale Copley traded tries either side of Fotuaika's binning before Ken Sio's four-pointer was converted to give the visitors a 20-18 lead entering the final quarter. Ponga's long-range effort looked to be enough before the desperate Titans stormed home to keep their season afloat. ""It was probably not our best performance but as far as character and morale, it's right up there,"" Brennan said. ""We need to be better with our discipline .. (but) they believe in each other and that showed. ""I thought Ash was enormous today; he really took control of that football team and that's a couple of weeks in a row he's backed it up."" Halfback Taylor put his mark on the contest with two minutes to play in the half, drawing two defenders in another strong run before a backhanded flick pass found Copley for a 12-8 lead. He then assumed the goal kicking duties in the second-half from Michael Gordon (corked knee), kicking two from the sideline and a tough field goal to ice the win.

FORGET the Royal wedding, the real drama and theatre on Saturday night was found at AAMI Park in Melbourne as a Cameron Smith-less Storm went down to the Manly Sea Eagles. Storm star and Origin hopeful Curtis Scott became the first man in three years to be sent off after throwing a wild punch at Dylan Walker in the second half. The Storm were in all sorts, failing to score a try on home soil in a gruelling 80 minutes of footy. Earlier in the night, the Gold Coast Titans rocked back from the edge of defeat to seal a thrilling 33-26 victory against the Knights, while the Cowboys threw away victory on the final bell with a penalty against Jake Granville offering South Sydney a 20-19 win on full time. 9.30pm Scott sent off in NRL drama Curtis Scott is in trouble.Source:FOX SPORTS Curtis Scott was sent from the field after giving Dylan Walker a shiner midway through the second half as Melbourne and Manly squabbled in a low-scoring slugfest in the Victorian capital. The blue that followed had fans up in arms after the referee sent Walker, who was the first to cop a punch, to the bin alongside Api Koroisau. SEE THE INCIDENT IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE This is mayhem in Melbourne. Suspect Curtis Scott can say goodbye to State of Origin after that.

The Storm failed to score a try, while the Sea Eagles scored four, and doubled Manly’s errors with 16 in the match AAMI Park. They completed their sets at a season-low 61 per cent with Manly topping the 80 per cent mark. Winger Josh Addo-Carr was also put in the sin-bin for a professional foul and Nelson Asofa-Solomona on report for a dangerous tackle. “It was madness out there really but I can’t remember the last time we’ve played this poorly, especially in the second half,” Bellamy said. “I thought we did a reasonable job in the first half but the second half was crap. “I’m really, really disappointed.” With regular skipper Cameron Smith suspended for the match, Slater took the reins for the first time in his 15 years at the club but it is likely to be one will want to forget. “It lacked a lot of things,” a shattered Slater said. “There were some real dumb plays, some irresponsible plays — we just didn’t have any responsibility with the football. “At times we were courageous defending on our tryline but as soon as we got the ball, we’d turn it back over. “It’s hard to beat anyone when you do that.” Bellamy said it was up to the players to sort out their poor ball control if they were serious about mounting a proper title defence. “They need to sort out how we’re going to fix it,” the coach said. “We’ve given them some ideas but they haven’t really bought into that so that will be our first job on Monday, to see the importance because it’s really hard to win games with that type of completion rate.” — with AAP 7.30pm Rabbits escape in last-gasp win North Queensland coach Paul Green will stick with the reshuffled backs set-up that almost secured an NRL victory over South Sydney. Michael Morgan was moved from the halves to fullback with Te Maire Martin playing alongside Cowboys skipper Johnathan Thurston in a game the Cowboys led going into the final minute. Morgan’s drop goal gave them the lead for the first time with four minutes remaining before Adam Reynolds’ penalty stole a 20-19 victory for the Rabbitohs. Both Cowboys tries came from Morgan linking with Thurston and then setting up Antonio Winterstein to dive over in the left corner. Green explained his decision to switch his backs around was more about getting the most out of Martin than Morgan. “It was probably more about how we get Te Maire more involved,” Green said. “In previous games when he gets in there he lifts the tempo of how we play. I thought he was sharp and kept them honest on that side. “I thought we showed some really good signs there in attack. Morgs laid on a couple of tries. At this stage we’ll probably stick with it.” Thurston was quick to praise Morgan’s desire to do the grunt work needed from a fullback. “Big Tom or George (Burgess) come through the line one-on-one, 120kg and he sat him on his rear end so he was good on both sides of the ball,” Thurston said. “There’s a lot of positives signs from tonight (in) the changes the coaching staff made. We need to take that moving forward. “We’ve definitely got the gameplay and structures in place to win games.” — AAP 6.50pm Twist in Napa farce Suncorp Stadium has launched an investigation after footage revealed a fan throwing an unidentified object at sin binned Sydney Roosters star Dylan Napa as he left the field following a head-on collision with Korbin Sims on Friday night. .@suncorpstadium has launched an investigation after a projectile was thrown at the head of controversial @sydneyroosters Dylan Napa in the @brisbanebroncos thrilling win. https://t.co/Y8XaZHyZe5 @ChrisGarry7 #7News pic.twitter.com/v31VVAM5si 5pm Taylor seals the deal Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan has heralded the rise of Ashley Taylor, with his Newcastle opposite only able to shake his head in frustration as the Titans ended a five-game NRL losing streak.

Napa was placed on report for leading with his head in the tackle, which resulted in him being marched at a crucial juncture in their six-point defeat at Suncorp Stadium. However the match review committee came up with a clean sheet on Saturday. Roosters coach Trent Robinson vehemently disagreed with the sin-binning after the match, claiming it was merely an accidental head clash. “He (Sims) stepped off the right, rolled into the head of Dylan, Dylan wasn’t even looking sideways and they’ve called that he intentionally went to knock him out with his head ... it’s just wrong,” Robinson said. “It’s no one’s fault there. “You’re allowed to be physical in our game and if someone wants to step off their right foot to avoid the contact with the left shoulder he’s got to go across the head to the other side of the body and he didn’t get there ... that’s how they clashed heads. “There’s other issues there why we didn’t win the game, but that’s a gross error and unacceptable at this level.” The development means Napa will be free to play in next Thursday’s clash against Parramatta, and avoids any potential suspension that could have ruled him out of the State of Origin opener on June 6.

The Broncos centre played his part in one of the great NRL duels at Suncorp Stadium, taking hit after hit from Sydney Roosters ace Latrell Mitchell before landing the final blow in the hosts’ 28-22 win on Friday night. First Mitchell, still just 20, took the Broncos’ right-side defence to the cleaners as he laid on two first-half tries. He left Roberts clutching at air more than once but crucially the Brisbane flyer responded. He lifted in defence and displayed his best in attack, setting up a try to start the second half before pinning his ears back and beating five Roosters to score himself. Roberts ran right by Fittler, who was commentating on the sidelines, for the solo effort that had even Bennett smiling. Josh Dugan, Euan Aitken, Dylan Walker, Curtis Scott and Jarrod Croker are also in the mix for a berth in the centres for the Blues. But nobody could blame Fittler for acting on what he saw on Friday night when he selects his team for the June 6 Origin opener in Melbourne. “I don’t think Brad Fittler’s that crazy that he didn’t see what he did there tonight,” Bennett said. “He’s much more mature, in the past he would’ve gone through the back door on us but tonight he held it together mentally. “He didn’t let his demons interfere with the way he had to play ... he’s grown so much.” Roosters coach Trent Robinson agreed the pair had put themselves in the mix while also putting half Luke Keary’s name forward after a solid showing in a losing side. — AAP Jump back to top Three huge games met fans on Saturday with biffs, send-offs and sin bins littering an exciting evening of footy.

After more than 20 years of working with Arnold, Ocean Spray is looking to shake up its agency roster. SelectResources International is running the review. Arnold—which Ocean Spray credited five years ago with keeping its cranberry grower-owner advertisements ""fresh""—is not believed to be defending the account. ""We are extremely proud of our 20-plus-year relationship with Arnold and all the work we have done together to build the Ocean Spray brand,"" a spokeswoman wrote in an email to Ad Age. ""As we work to expand our portfolio and cause disruption in the food and beverage space, we feel it is important for us to look at our business differently, both internally, as well as how we work with agency partners. We look forward to expanding our roster of agencies to help fuel the next chapter of the brand's success."" In February, the Lakeville-Middleboro, Massachusetts-based company announced President and CEO Randy Papadellis would be leaving after 18 years at the company. At the time, Ocean Spray named Bobby Chacko, who had been serving as a senior vp and chief growth officer since 2017, as president and chief operating officer. A month later, the company said its board of directors had unanimously elected Chacko as its CEO. He also still holds the president role. Arnold has seen some changes itself recently. In late April, Ad Age reported, the agency's CEO Pam Hamlin and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Scott Feyler were planning to depart the agency. Ocean Spray has been on a mission to prove the health benefits of its products. It announced last year it would invest more than $10 million the following five years to research the antimicrobial benefits of cranberries, and the role any benefits might play in combating antimicrobial resistance. Its Ocean Spray Cranberry Health Institute was set to launch this year. Ocean Spray Cranberries also petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to be able to use health claim language pertaining to the ""consumption of cranberry products and reduced risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women"" in September. But outside researchers have questioned those claims. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. spent $21.8 million in measured media in the U.S. in 2017, according to Kantar Media.

John,O'Neil,924,http://westseattleblog.com/2018/05/what-the-admiral-neighborhood-association-heard-from-spd-sdot-and-sub-pop/,"West Seattle, Washington We’ve already reported on the biggest news from this week’s Admiral Neighborhood Association meeting – the announcement of this year’s Summer Concerts at Hiawatha lineup. But that wasn’t all that happened. Here are the rest of the toplines: COMMUNITY POLICING: The area’s assigned Community Police Team Officer John O’Neil introduced himself. He’s a 14-year SPD veteran, Navy veteran, father of three. “The human element of police officers has been lost …because we don’t share,” he explained as his rationale for a personal introduction. “A lot of time, people see the uniform, and they see a robot.” He has been working in western West Seattle for about six months now. He explained that CPT officers “handle the long-term problem calls. … We want to connect with people. We want to be at these meetings.” But “if someone’s breaking into your house,” don’t call him! He also told people NOT to report crimes via social media – SPD won’t see it. In Q&A he was asked about noise at bar closing time. If it’s a chronic problem, that’s something you can bring to the attention of your Community Police Team officer, he said. He also talked about the realities of policing our area and staffing challenges – prioritizing, shifting resources when needed (especially in times of emergencies such as last week’s deadly shooting at West Seattle Stadium), etc. Asked about the cruising/noise problem, Officer O’Neil said that’s still a work in progress. He also talked about what it’s like trying to catch racers on West Marginal Way SW. A frustrated neighbor complained about how long it takes to get a response for a public nuisance, which segued into dealing with street disorder and campers. Officer O’Neil said that they have many protocols of what they can and can’t do. He also talked about how officers are tied up doing many things, not just responding to 911 calls; he told the story of a stolen-car report that hadn’t been responded to for eight hours because no one was available. He said he understood why the car’s owner was upset and even encouraged him to file a complaint. Back to the issue of street disorder, Officer O’Neil says the department has a new policy about dealing with RVs, though he did not elaborate on what’s in that policy. (We’re still trying to find out more from the city about what the new policy entails.) Much frustration overall was vented, and while Officer O’Neil had no answers, he tried hard to explain the reality of what police deal with. WEST SEATTLE NEIGHBORHOOD GREENWAY: Mitchell Lloyd of SDOT brought an update; he said the timeline isn’t set yet for the second phase of the project. He said more than 200 responses were received in the recent online survey. If you have questions about the project, look for SDOT at the West Seattle Bee Festival on Saturday (11 am-2 pm at High Point Commons Park). Questions at the meeting included whether the project might correct some signage problems, such as one nearby area where an attendee said signs say “20 mph when children are present” but should say 20 mph at all times. Next project milestone, Lloyd said in response to a question from Wymer, will be proposing three or four specific routes in the North Admiral Connection, and then analyzing and gathering feedback on them. SUB POP 30TH ANNIVERSARY UPDATE: Sub Pop Records reps stopped by with an update on the August 11th plan for Alki Beach. They’re still planning to close Alki SW between 56th and 63rd SW, with some “soft” closures on side streets (“local access only”) – same pattern as the Alki Summer Streets “car-free day” events that have been held in the past. Asked about the plan for, for example Beach Drive in the Constellation Park area, they said they haven’t gotten that far yet. They’re still working on renting lots from which they can run shuttles – Jack Block Park, West Marginal Way SW, etc. They also are planning to double Water Taxi service that day – an extra boat will be brought in, so there will be four runs each hour. Water Taxi shuttles will continue to run and SP will work with bike-rental companies too. “We will heavily message ‘don’t drive’, and … to respect the residents who live here,” said CEO Megan Jasper. They’re also aiming for it to be a zero-waste event. And Alki Playground/Whale Tail Park will have not only a family-friendly zone but also food trucks lined up on 59th. Beneficiaries of the event – particularly the beer gardens – will include the Southwest Seattle Historical Society and YouthCare. KEXP radio will be a partner; the lineup will be announced May 29th. “Will there be a surprise guest?” they were asked. “Right now they’re ALL surprise guests,” Jasper said, to laughter. Meantime, they reiterate that they really appreciate feedback, opinions, thoughts, questions – and have already heard a lot from community groups in particular – so if you have anything to ask/say, bring it up. One person wondered if people will be encouraged to leave their dogs home, given that they’re not allowed on the beach … good point, she was told. OTHER SUMMER EVENTS: ANA needs volunteers to sell treats at the post-parade games at Hamilton Viewpoint Park after the West Seattle 4th of July Kids’ Parade. … Nicole from Fit4Mom talked about the parade – they recently launched crowdfunding, as reported here … ANA also is hoping to march in the West Seattle Grand Parade on July 21st (if you can help, let the group know!). ADMIRAL BUSINESSES: ANA president Larry Wymer said he is trying to revive the Admiral merchants’ group that had formed years ago. He hopes to have a representative of the business community on hand every month; this month, it was Benjamin Jury, whose company Duos took over The Sanctuary at Admiral – where the ANA meets – months ago. It’s often used for weddings, he said, but also can be a great place for parties and reunions. EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION HUB: Up to 10 more volunteers are needed to continue organizing Admiral’s hub. Mary Coucoules is coordinating it and you can e-mail her if you are interested, coucou@spu.edu. The Admiral Neighborhood Association meets every other month – mostly on second Tuesdays, but sometimes (like this month) that changes, so watch for announcements! The next meeting is currently scheduled for 6:30 pm July 10th. I was thinking just the other day about the Admiral road diet-rechannelization project that happened in late 2016. The SDOT decks, early on, had mentioned “evaluation” that was going to occur afterwards.Has SDOT produced a follow-up report on vehicle speeds/volume, parking utilization, bike lane usage, or crash types/statistics like one would expect a follow-up evaluation to have?

John,O'Neil,924,https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/classic-scottish-cup-final-was-so-painful-for-dundee-united/,"©2018 Evening Telegraph As Motherwell try to block Celtic’s bid for a double treble in today’s Scottish Cup Final, most football fans would be delighted if the tie is a repeat of the Steelmen’s last success in the competition. All, probably, except Dundee United fans. For although ’Well’s 1991 success came in a final that is often labelled the best-ever, the fact it was the Tangerines sixth in a losing run at Hampden spread over 17 painful years made it a day to forget for Arabs. Having fallen at the final hurdle in 1974, ’81, ’85, ‘87 and ’88, the United support that headed for Hampden that day should possibly have feared the worst. The fact, however, four of those five defeats had been to the Old Firm and were not entirely unexpected, meant they made the journey believing this was going to be their year. On paper there was good reason for that optimism. Motherwell were a decent side but with stars like Maurice Malpas, Dave Bowman, Jim McInally, Miodrag Krivokapic and the precocious young talent of Duncan Ferguson and Ray McKinnon in their ranks, United were clear favourites. And although a header from former Tannadice favourite Iain Ferguson had Motherwell up at half-time, once Bowman fired an equaliser 10 minutes into the second half, things seemed to be back on track. That goal, though, sparked this game into life and, just three minutes later, the late Phil O’Donnell had restored the opposition lead. And when Ian Angus got their third with 25 minutes left, another final failure looked sealed. United had other ideas and, as the avalanche of goals continued, almost straight away John O’Neil pulled one back with a fine header. After that the Motherwell goal was bombarded with attack after attack but, with keeper Ally Maxwell performing heroics, despite picking up a serious abdominal injury in an accidental collision with John Clark, it looked like the equaliser wasn’t going to come. Until, that was, in one desperate last attempt to save the final, deep in injury time goalie Alan Main launched a massive kick down the park and Darren Jackson got their before Maxwell to knock the ball into the net. It was almost the last touch of normal time and such a blow to a ’Well team that looked out on their feet and seemed to have one hand on the cup. Surely United would go on and win in extra-time. Just four minutes into the first added period, though, what proved the final blow was struck when Steve Kirk earned himself immortal status at Fir Park with a header to put his team 4-3 up. United threw everything into attack but this time there was no way back. And what had been dubbed the family final, because of the absence of the Old Firm and the fact opposing managers Jim and Tommy McLean were brothers, ended in controversy. Believing Main had been fouled at the winning goal, several players confronted referee David Syme in the tunnel afterwards and that led to bans being dished out. “Jimmy McInally had blisters so he’d taken his boots of out on the pitch and unfortunately one of them seemed to bounce off the ref’s head,” said goal scorer Bowman. “We did certainly feel their fourth goal shouldn’t have stood so that, and the fact we lost, meant it might have been a classic final but for us there was no consolation. “Thankfully, we went on to win the cup three years later. “However, nothing really ever makes up for the ones you lost.” © DC Thomson Co Ltd 2018.

According to the Reuters news agency, Bramson, who took a 5% stake in Barclays in February via his Sherborne Investors investment vehicle, has been pressing for Barclays’ management to slim down the investment banking arm to those parts that directly serve corporate clients. According to Reuters’ sources, that would mean the culling of the cash equities, currency and fixed income trading desks. Barclays has struggled to rebuild its reputation since its most prominent scandal in 2012, when it paid a £290mln fine to the US and UK authorities for rigging Libor, which measures the rate at which banks can borrow from one another. More recently, chief executive Jes Staley somehow managed to keep his job despite being fined £642,430 for trying to identify a whistle-blower at the bank. Staley joined Barclays from US hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, so he will be no stranger to the tactics of activist investors. He replaced Antony Jenkins, a veteran of the retail banking arm of Barclays, who was appointed to clear up the reputational damage sustained during the wheeling & dealing tenure of his predecessor, Bob Diamond. Here's the detail on activist investor Ed Bramson's plan to shake-up Barclays https://t.co/PmqIfJYERV Staley has generally shifted the emphasis back towards investment banking and it is thought that he would be resistant to Bramson’s proposals. Some shareholders told Reuters they believed Bramson might be underestimating the challenge of stripping out the investment bank’s underperforming units without hurting stronger parts. “I am pretty sure returns in Cash Equities are fairly rubbish but it’s very hard to do ECM (equity capital markets business) and some M&A activities without it,” one of Sherborne’s own major investors told the news agency. “I think the Markets bit of Barclays CIB is more profitable than he thinks it is, if anything it is the Commercial Bank that is the laggard,” he added. Shares in Barclays were down 0.3% at 208.4p in a flat market. Barclays is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services, with an extensive international presence in Europe, the USA, Africa and Asia....

A link has been sent to your friend's email address. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs The Salem Rocks were solid winning their third consecutive Division 1 regional boys track and field title.(Photo: BRAD EMONS) It didn't rain, it didn't storm for a change, but Salem unleashed its own version of ""Thunder and Lightning"" in Friday's Division 1-Region 4 boys track and field meet at Canton. The Rocks, led by seniors Andrew Davis and Sharriff Dyer, repeated as champion by scoring a team-best 125½ points to lead a one-two-three Plymouth-Canton Educational Park finish. Plymouth was runner-up with 92, while Canton placed third with 78. Livonia Churchill (72½) and Westland John Glenn (64) rounded out the top five. Dyer, an individual state placer last year, in the 300-meter hurdles, proved to be lightning quick on his feet as he bettered his own P-CEP record in his specialty event with a time of 38.61. Related: Grand Blanc holds off Brighton, Novi for KLAA boys track and field title Related: Rock-solid: Salem girls bring home first regional track title since 2013 And this time it occurred in conditions that were pretty ideal. Although it was overcast, temperatures hovered near the 70-degree mark with a slight wind. It was a far cry from the previous week when temps dipped into the low 40s coupled with torrential rains during the Kensington Lakes Activities Association meet May 11 at Canton. ""I think just the weather . . . the weather has been good and last week we had a lot of rain,"" said Dyer, who figured in three first-place finishes. ""And also just practicing through the week and I really felt my stamina is getting better."" Dyer was also a member of the Rocks' first-place 4 x 200 relay team along with John Paul DeLa Cruz, Jason Warras and Andrew Davis (1:29.45). Davis, bound for Northwood University to play football, provided the thunder in the Rocks' potent lineup also he teamed up with Jason Warras, Julius Nelson, Jaelin Burge for a first in the 4 x 100 relay (43.53). Davis also contributed a runner-up finish in the open 100 (10.96). ""He (Davis) is just a hammer when it comes to those relays,"" Salem first-year coach Jim Crabill said. ""He makes an impact. He's just fast, an awesome guy and has been a leader on this team the last four years now."" Salem's Sharriff Dyer broke his own record in the 300 hurdles and was a regional champ in two relay events. (Photo: BRAD EMONS) Meanwhile, the foursome of Berry Matthews, Hezekiah Williams, Davis and Dyer also capped off the night with a victory in the 4 x 400 relay (3:23.91). ""Sharriff ran really well in the 4 x 200, he's dominant in the 300 hurdles and I don't think he's lost yet this year,"" Crabill said. ""He ran a great leg on the 4 x 400, which was a great race and a great time."" Salem senior Alex Howie contributed a first in the shot put (52 feet, 6½ inches), while also finishing runner-up in the discus (141-8). ""Everybody performed, everybody had a great night and we did our job,"" Davis said. ""It's Michigan (weather), it's on-and-off. We had a perfect day today, a little windy, but it was great, and we came out here and we performed."" Crabill said everything went according to script for the Rocks, who will graduate a talented senior class that has gone 25-2 in KLAA dual meets the past three seasons while winning three straight division and regional titles. ""We were very surprised how well the plan went today, everything worked out the way we wanted it to for the most part,"" Crabill said. ""It was nice to see John Paul DeLa Cruz take second in the 300 hurdles. He peaked at the right time and that was a big one. Our relays did well and Alex Howie did was he was supposed to do in the throws, but I'd probably say John Paul in the 300 hurdles was a very nice surprise."" Plymouth, meanwhile, dominated the distance events by scoring 56 of its total points between the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 individual races, along with winning the 4 x 800. The Wildcats were led by senior Ethan Byrnes, who swept the 1,600- and 3,200 in 4:27.05 and 9:47.12, respectively. Sophomore Carter Solomon was runner-up in both events, while Patrick Byrnes, a freshman, captured the 800 (1:57.97). The Byrnes brothers, Solomon and Brandon Boyd were the 3,200 relay champs in 8:02.29. Canton, meanwhile, got field event victories from junior James Deese (discus, 146-5) and senior Chuck Carey (pole vault, 13-0). Other individual winners included Churchill's Martell Dooley, long jump (21-6½), while Glenn got firsts from senior Rothus Stewart (high jump, 6-7), senior David Graham (100 dash,10.94) and junior Jared Tarrance (400, 49.21). Dearborn Edsel Ford's Michael Bates took the 110 hurdles (14.99), while Wyandotte Roosevelt's Naythan Haslam captured the 200 (22.09) to round out the individual regional champions. The top two finishers in each event, along with additional state qualifiers from the regional, now advance to the Division 1 state finals on Saturday, June 2 at East Kentwood. ""Expectations are to win in a variety of events, 4 x 200, the 300 (hurdles) and also the 4 x 400,"" Dyer said. ""Just do our best and try and win."" And Salem's sprint standout Davis is geared up, too, for the state meet. ""We looking to do some damage, we're going to place and we hope we win . . . that's what our goal is . . . win,"" he said.

Andrew,Davis,921,http://www.nwherald.com/2018/05/18/girls-track-and-field-mchenrys-pauly-leads-way-for-local-competitors-at-class-3a-state-meet/a4f3chx/,"CHARLESTON – The difference between ecstasy and agony tends to be quite thin at the IHSA Girls Track and Field State Meet. Late Friday afternoon, after more than an anxious half hour of sapping her cellphone’s battery hitting refresh, an act of futility as it turned out, Prairie Ridge senior Natasha Schaffer watched as a meet worker posted the Class 3A triple jump results. A few feet away, Andrew Davis, the father of Huntley sophomore Daryn Davis, awaited the same results outside of Eastern Illinois University's O'Brien Stadium. Schaffer looked, then walked away, dejected. She had missed the 12-competitor finals for the first time … by one spot. Her high school career was over, her next competitive jump will be next year at Minnesota. Andrew Davis stepped up, looked at the sheet and FaceTimed Daryn with the news – she was the final competitor in the finals and will have a chance at repeating as a medalist if she can improve in Saturday’s finals. Daryn Davis’ qualifying jump was 36 feet, 9 3/4 inches, one-half inch better than Schaffer's. “The whole time I knew I was 12th or 13th,” said Davis, who took sixth last year. “Sometimes I have to prepare myself to not jump tomorrow, then he called and finalized that. It was a lot of relief. Now I can try to match what I did last year.” Schaffer was disappointed but pleased that it was Davis, her friend through competition, who got the final spot. “I definitely have jumped better marks with my eyes closed,” said Schaffer, who was third last year. “It’s nice to know I can do better than I did today, and in college I can move up.” Schaffer and teammate Valerie Tarazi sat together waiting for the results. Shortly after the triple jump was posted, the discus results went up, and Tarazi’s 120-6 effort got her into the finals. The other local finals qualifiers were McHenry’s Jenna Pauly (high jump and pole vault), Cary-Grove’s Tabor Gleason (high jump) and Huntley’s McKenzie Krich (high jump). Pauly scratched out of the 100 meters to stay at the pole vault. She was satisfied by making finals in both of her other events. “I was really nervous because I went in freshman year and no-heighted (in high jump),” she said. “I really wanted to come and make finals and prove to myself I could do it. My goal is trying to get 11-9 or 12-0 in pole vault, and I really want to jump another inch (off my personal best) and get 5-8 in high jump.” Krich suffered a torn right ACL last summer and missed the golf and basketball seasons, but she came back strong for track and will join Fox Valley Conference friends Pauly and Gleason in the finals. “It’s outstanding. I couldn’t be more happy,” Krich said. “I’ve overcome so much. I was off for six months, and in that time I got a lot of strength back, and I recovered very strong. I’ve become way stronger than I was before and come back better than I did.” Tarazi, wearing her Auburn socks for where she will swim next year, qualified on her final throw. She had thrown out of the sector and scratched on her first two attempts. “I was going to be a little disappointed if I didn’t make it (to finals),” Tarazi said. “My last throw I held back a little bit, just because I wanted to be sure it landed in and stay in the ring. I wanted it to be very under control. I got three more throws (Saturday). I’m so excited.” Class 3A State Meet Local Results 4x100 relay: Huntley (Belonax, Krog, Oladipo, Lackovic) 49.54. 100 high hurdles: Walker (Cary-Grove) 15.70, Davis (Huntley) 16.23. 800 meters: Raclawski (Huntley) 2:20.72, Stebbins (McHenry) 2:23.48. 4x200 relay: Huntley (Lackovic, Oladipo, Handchetz, Krog) 1:44.63. 1,600 meters: Oury (Hampshire) 5:11.71. 4x400 relay: Huntley (Handchetz, Oladipo, Smith, Raclawski) 4:07.17.

Phillip,Frost,920,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/05/18/better-buy-opko-health-inc-opk-vs-myriad-genetics.aspx,"Returns as of 11/19/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/19/2018 If you're looking for stocks that have made tremendous comebacks in 2018, Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK) and Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) definitely fit the bill. Opko stock was down nearly 20% this year before roaring back. Myriad Genetics saw its share price plunge close to 40% earlier in 2018, but a strong rebound has the stock price close to where it began the year. Which of these two comeback stories is the better choice for investors now? Here's how Opko Health and Myriad Genetics stack up. Image source: Getty Images. Opko Health's Q1 results are a great place to start in determining why investors might want to consider the stock. After a painfully slow launch, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug Rayaldee began to enjoy some decent momentum. Total prescriptions for Rayaldee soared 730% year over year and jumped 38% higher than 2017 Q4. Some analysts think that Rayaldee could reach peak annual sales in the ballpark of $700 million. There's a long way to go to hit that mark, but for the first time in quite a while, there's reason for some optimism about the drug. The biggest source of revenue for Opko, though, is BioReference Labs (BRL). BRL is the third-largest clinical laboratory in the U.S. It focuses on genetic testing. In addition, BRL's sales team markets Opko's 4Kscore prostate cancer test. The business hasn't performed all that well in recent quarters. However, Opko put a new management team in place and thinks that BRL's revenue will improve in 2018. Opko could have several new products on the way. The company hopes to get a green light soon from the FDA for marketing the Claros point-of-care prostate cancer test. A phase 3 clinical study is in progress evaluating human growth hormone product hGH-CTP in treating growth hormone-deficient children. The company also has several phase 2 pipeline candidates, including an experimental drug targeting treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as type 2 diabetes and obesity drug OPK88003. One other reason many investors like Opko is the company's CEO, Phillip Frost. Frost is a billionaire with a long track record of success in the pharmaceutical industry. He has remained enthusiastic about Opko's prospects despite challenges through the years and has invested heavily in the company. Looking at Myriad Genetics' latest quarterly results also highlights the key arguments for the stock. Myriad topped expectations in fiscal Q3 thanks to surprisingly strong volume for its hereditary cancer testing. But the molecular diagnostics company has expanded into additional higher-growth areas, especially personalized medicine. Myriad's most promising personalized medicine product is GeneSight, a genetic test that helps determine which antidepressant is best-suited for a particular patient. Myriad thinks that the global market size for this diagnostic test could be close to $10 billion. The company recently reported results from a large study that showed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were 50% more likely to achieve remission and 30% more likely to respond to treatment when GeneSight was used to determine the appropriate medication. The company also won FDA approval earlier this year for BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic for Lynparza in breast cancer patients. AstraZeneca and Merck co-market Lynparza for treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. BRACAnalysis CDx could be a significant source of growth for Myriad. Lynparza could eventually win approval for treating prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other indications. If AstraZeneca and Merck pick up more approved indications for the drug, Myriad stands to benefit. Don't write off Myriad's hereditary cancer business, either. The company launched a new product last year that could help gain market share. RiskScore helps predict the risk that a woman will develop breast cancer. The test uses clinical risk factors and genetic markers. Both Opko Health and Myriad Genetics are enjoying nice rebounds and could have room to grow. I think, though, that Myriad is the better pick. In my view, the decision comes down to financial health. Opko continues to lose money, while Myriad is profitable. But while I think Myriad is the better choice, I don't see either of these stocks as great ones to buy right now. Myriad's shares currently trade at 26 times expected earnings. That steep valuation might be warranted if the company delivers on its potential. My preference, however, is to stay on the sidelines until there's more evidence that Myriad will be able to do so.

Michael,Gordon,919,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/us/nassar-michigan-state.html,"Supported by By Mitch Smith, Jess Bidgood and Anemona Hartocollis After John Engler took over in January as Michigan State University’s interim president, he stressed again and again the need to quickly settle an onslaught of sexual abuse lawsuits against the school. The university met that demand on Wednesday when it agreed to a $500 million settlement with 332 women and girls who said they were abused by Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar. Mr. Engler described the settlement as an opportunity to move forward, a step “important for the healing process, not only for the survivors, but also for the university community.” But the battles are far from over for Michigan State, which still faces fierce scrutiny and heavy fallout from the actions of Dr. Nassar, a university employee and sports doctor who for about 20 years preyed on girls and young women under the guise of medical care. “The next part is the hard part,” said State Senator Curtis Hertel Jr., a Democrat whose district includes the campus. “You have to change the culture of the university.” First there is the question of how to come up with half a billion dollars, a burden that could fall in part on students and taxpayers. Then there are the investigations by the state attorney general and the federal Education Department that could lead to criminal charges for administrators and federal penalties. Those challenges do not include the mountain of work that must be done to prevent future abuse, repair the university’s battered image and attract new students. There is no playbook for such a task. “I think it’s such a profound topic that I don’t think anyone should feel comfortable telling them what to do,” said Jim Rawlins, the admissions director at the University of Oregon. “There aren’t many other cases like this where you can say, ‘oh yeah, it’s one of these.’” Dr. Nassar’s case captivated the nation in January during his sentencing in state court. For days, woman after woman recounted his abuse and how, if they complained, they were mostly ignored by law enforcement and university officials. Some of the women were famous gymnasts, assaulted by Dr. Nassar in his role with the United States Olympic team. Others were local residents who sought treatment at the university clinic. Soon after Dr. Nassar was sentenced to prison, Michigan State’s longtime president, Lou Anna K. Simon, resigned. Scandal can scare off students. In the aftermath of abuse by an assistant football coach at Pennsylvania State University, applications declined for a time, though the cause was debated. And at the University of Missouri’s flagship campus, where protests against racial bias drew national attention in 2015, enrollment dropped off so much that some dorms were closed. Marie Bigham, director of college counseling at the Isidore Newman School, a private college prep school in New Orleans, said many of her students avoided colleges they believed had behaved badly. Several of her students declined admission to Howard University this year after a financial aid scandal broke there, she said, adding, “my young women — we can’t talk about Michigan State.” For the moment, it appears Michigan State has avoided a loss of new students. The university expects to enroll its largest-ever freshman class this fall, and said this month that the number of admitted students who had paid enrollment deposits was 2 percent higher than that of a year ago. But the full effects of the blow to the university’s reputation may not be felt until next year. “Michigan State has a long road ahead,” said Michael Gordon, a principal at Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis communications firm in New York. “I think so far they have really failed on talking about how as an institution, they will change culturally and change how they do business.” The $500 million settlement has largely been welcomed as a necessary step by Michigan State students and alumni who are disgusted by Dr. Nassar’s conduct. Sydney Ewing, 18, is preparing to head to Michigan from Texas in the middle of the summer to start her coursework early, and to train with the gymnastics team, which she committed to join last fall. She said she has often thought of the scandal, but never doubted her decision to join the team. “The settlement is incredible,” Ms. Ewing said, adding that the agreement helped restore trust in the school’s administration. “After this settlement, I do believe in them.” But it also raises uncomfortable questions. Victoria Vander Velde, 18, who will enroll at Michigan State in the fall, received a text message from another freshman-to-be on Thursday about whether their tuition might rise as a result of the settlement. “There’s so many things that Michigan State could pull money from,” said Ms. Vander Velde, who is looking for deals on a fridge and futon for her new dorm room. “I’d be pretty upset that we’d have to pay a lot more money to go.” Jean Beck, who with her husband donates money for a scholarship at Michigan State, said they would stop giving immediately if they thought the money was to be used for the settlement, instead of for students. “All these kids are taking out loans mostly to get through school,” Ms. Beck said. “That’s going to impact their lives for years. They did nothing to deserve it.” It remains uncertain whether those fears are founded. The university has said little about how it intends to pay for the settlement, beyond that it expects insurance to pick up at least some of the cost, and that taxpayers and students could also be on the hook. Mr. Engler, who was not made available for an interview despite repeated requests, wrote in a letter to students and alumni that he would meet with university trustees in the days ahead to devise a plan. “The early and successful conclusion of mediation will be beneficial to those who have suffered at the hands of Nassar,” Mr. Engler wrote. “It also allows M.S.U. to continue making important change to prevent sexual misconduct and assaults on and off our campus.” Doris Burke contributed research.

Michael,Gordon,919,http://www.wbtv.com/story/38225310/a-purported-gang-godfather-has-a-message-for-charlotte-so-he-wrote-us-a-letter,"CHARLOTTE, NC (Michael Gordon and Jane Wester/The Charlotte Observer) - In a last-minute effort to sway his jury, the purported godfather of a notorious East Coast gang wrote in a letter that he had been the victim of a tricked-up government prosecution straight out of ""a Grimm brothers fairy tale book."" ""The prosecution's case is all smoke and mirrors to dupe and deceive the good citizens of North Carolina and waste their tax payers' dollars,"" Pedro ""Magoo"" Gutierrez wrote in a letter addressed to Observer readers. ""Good citizens ... I ask that you hold the government accountable for this travesty of justice against these defendants ... and that they be found not guilty."" The 12 good citizens on Gutierrez' jury did not follow his instructions. After a full day of deliberations, the alleged head of United Blood Nation was found guilty of racketeering conspiracy. Two other defendants, including a New York state prison inmate who the government says is Gutierrez' top lieutenant, were also convicted of the same charge. Sentencing by U.S. District Judge Frank Whitney of Charlotte will come at a later date. ""We have a message for the UBN and all other criminal organizations: We are coming for you,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray said after the verdicts. ""Person by person, set by set, clique by clique, and leader by leader. You are in our sights."" The close of the two-week trial drew strikingly different reactions from opposite sides of the Charlotte courtroom. Prosecutors and FBI agents shook hands, hugged and pounded each other on the backs. But as the guilty verdicts were announced, the daughter of defendant Cynthia ""Lady Bynt"" Gilmore of Raleigh buried her face in her hands and began crying. A bailiff told her to leave. As the courtroom door closed behind her, Gilmore's daughter broke down into a series of howling sobs that echoed throughout the courthouse as she was led away by a friend. Exactly one year before their convictions, Gutierrez, Gilmore and James ""Grown"" Baxton were among 83 purported members of the United Blood Nation named in a sweeping federal indictment. Gutierrez, 45, and Baxton, 44, both New York state inmates, were accused of running a 15,000-member crime syndicate from inside their prisons that sold drugs and firearms, dabbled in identity theft and other white-collar crimes, and meted out violence ranging from extortion to murder. Prosecutors and the FBI said Gilmore, 42, a mother of five, served as a vital part of the chain of command, making numerous trips to visit her co-defendants to discuss gang business while also funneling money to both imprisoned gang leaders. Thirty-five other alleged gang members named in the indictment have pleaded guilty to an array of charges. In Gutierrez's three-page, hand-printed letter - a photocopy was emailed to the Observer on Thursday morning and later confirmed as authentic by Gutierrez's attorney - the alleged crime boss said the government's accusations were part of a ""sensational and fictionalized narrative ... the 'Godfather' of Bloods, allegedly running a faction of the 'gang' in Charlotte from a New York prison cell."" During closing arguments Wednesday, Gutierrez's lawyer echoed his client's argument. Appearing powerful benefited Gutierrez in prison, attorney Brett Wentz said. But he was in ""special housing"" with extra supervision, no phone calls and limited visits for the majority of his years in prison, he said. So, Wentz asked, how could he have done what the government said he did? Gutierrez said prosecutors had not shown the jury a single victim of crime from the alleged conspiracy. ""The good citizens of North Carolina are left to ponder while scratching their heads ... A conspiracy against what or whom?"" he wrote. Gutierrez, who was imprisoned in New York on a murder charge at the time of the most recent indictment, said the Charlotte jurors never heard that ""Cynthia Gilmore is a wife and a mother of five ... and that Mr. Baxton and Mr. Gutierrez have been in their child's lives being good fathers despite being in prison."" ""The government attempts to strip these defendants of their humanity and make them out to be monsters,"" he wrote. He accused prosecutors of using ""scare tactics"" by insisting that an anonymous jury hear the trial of the three gang leaders — ""thereby denying the defendants ... the fundamental right of a fair and impartial jury."" In his letter, Gutierrez asked the jurors to see through the government's artifice and for his readers to ""demand that the injustice against these defendants end(s)."" He ended his letter this way: ""Respectfully submitted, the defendant, Pedro Gutierrez."" At about 11 a.m. Thursday, Gutierrez, Baxton and Gilmore all sat impassively as, one by one, the guilty verdicts were read aloud. 1 Julian Price Pl.Charlotte, NC 28208(704) 374-3500

Steve,Cummings,916,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-pot-cannabis-store-1.4667515,"The Yukon government aims to undercut the illegal marijuana market in the territory, setting the price for pot at $8 a gram, which officials say is cheaper than marijuana sold illegally. ""Our plan is to try to compete [with] or eliminate the illicit market, so the $8 a gram puts a value option in there,"" said Steve Cummings, the director of operations for the Yukon Liquor Corporation. The average price per gram for non-medical marijuana is $9.52 in Yukon, about $2 higher than the national average of $7.43, Statistics Canada reports. The store will temporarily be on Industrial Road in a building currently under a Yukon government lease. Cummings said the exact opening date of the store is still unknown, but the liquor corporation is looking at Sept. 1 as a tentative date. The federal law hasn't been passed by Parliament yet, but it's expected to happen this summer. Cummings said the store over time will add higher-priced premium pot. ""There should be a wide selection whereas perhaps on your corner dealer right now is not as good a selection,"" he said. He said another advantage over buying black market pot is that the product in the government store will be tested for unsafe additives. Cummings said the goal is to eventually close the store when regulations are in place to let the private sector take over retail sales. ""We are opening up as a kind of a primary showcase store, to kind of show what the private sector should look like,"" he said. The store will sell cannabis and oils. Cummings said edibles won't be available until they're legalized by the federal government. That won't happen until next year at the earliest. He said the liquor corporation still hasn't decided whether to sell accessories like bud grinders and pipes. Cummings said the store also has a duty to educate the public about the potential health and other risks associated with marijuana use. ""Yes, we're opening up the retail operations, but with our dual mandate, we're not promoting the sale of cannabis, we are facilitating it,"" he said The liquor corporation has looked at the experience of other jurisdictions where pot is sold in retail stores including Vancouver and Skagway, Alaska, said Cummings. But there's still a sense of history being made in Yukon. ""It is all brand new, we don't know what's going to happen here, and I mean it is such a huge change. ""It's a brand new product out there, you don't have a lot of new product introductions like this as monumental as what we're seeing here,"" he said. The $8 per gram does not include taxes. An example provide by the federal finance department says an $8 gram would cost $9 plus GST. The liquor corporation says an adult can buy up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent, per transaction. Equivalents are 150 grams fresh cannabis or 30 cannabis plant seeds. The most that can be possessed in public is 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent. A police officer can issue a ticket or lay a criminal charge if a person is caught with more than that. The corporation says there is no limit on how much cannabis can be kept at home, but there can be no more than 4 plants in a home. It says adults are responsible for keeping children safe from the plants and their products. The liquor corporation also announced Thursday that it made a deal with Ottawa-based Canopy Growth Corporation to supply marijuana to the store, its second agreement with a supplier. It will purchase product from local growers, once any are licensed by the federal government. There aren't any licensed producers in Yukon yet. The corporation says it can sign on as many suppliers as it wants depending on demand. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Steve,Cummings,916,https://thewest.com.au/news/augusta-margaret-river-times/hawks-pleased-with-renovated-clubrooms-ng-b88837492z,"The Augusta-Margaret River Hawks Football and Netball Club has welcomed newly renovated change rooms, training space and bar. Shire of Augusta-Margaret River Cr Ian Earl officially opened the space last month at a well-attended opening afternoon. The Gloucester Park Hall has been converted into a training space with heavy-duty rubber flooring, a physio and first aid room, disabled toilets and an umpire’s change room. Showers and change rooms were also renovated, and the bar received a new ceiling. Hawks president Steve Cummings said the renovations were well received by club members. “You can feel the vibe is different .... the camaraderie between players has lifted,” he said. “And gone is the old smoke-stained ceiling from the days when you could smoke in the bar.” Cr Earl said he remembered playing football for the club when there was only one room for two teams. “Both sides and the umpires changed together with only a sheet screen between us,” he said. The club will also celebrate the official inclusion of netball into its name with a ladies’ day tomorrow, with drinks and nibbles from 3pm. The home games against Bunbury tomorrow start with colts at 12.10pm, reserves at 2.20pm and league at 4.30pm at Gloucester Park. © The West Australian and Seven West Media (WA).

(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for Room To Read) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Room to Read, a global non-profit that believes World Change Starts with Educated Children®, held its annual New York Gala last night at SECOND with honorees Samantha Barry, Editor-in-Chief of Glamour, and Jamie Forese, President of Citigroup. Grammy Award winner Ashanti was in attendance as well as performed. The evening brought New York’s elite business and philanthropic communities together with the media industry to raise $3 million, which will support 60,000 children on Room to Read’s programs in literacy and girls’ education, it was announced last night by Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read’s CEO. The emcee for the evening was Sara Eisen, CNBC anchor, and event chairs were Scott Kapnick, Sabine and Richard Chalmers, and Marc Seidner. Other notable guests included Dilshad Vadsaria, actress and Room to Read ambassador, and Kimberly Vandenberg, Olympic medalist and Room to Read ambassador. Barry, on behalf of Glamour and The Girl Project, was presented with the Superhero Award for Glamour’s commitment to world change through empowering women and girls. Glamour’s philanthropic initiative, The Girl Project, aims to unleash the vast economic and social power of girls through education. Through a $200,000 grant from The Caterpillar Foundation, The Girl Project is supporting Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. Barry joined Glamour in January 2018 to oversee all content development, production and consumer experiences for Glamour’s digital, social, video and print platforms. “I am so honored to receive the Superhero Award and to have the opportunity to continue Glamour’s legacy of enabling progress via the education of young women,” said Barry. “Our mission aligns with Room to Read’s efforts to promote change, and it is truly a privilege to be working alongside them in helping to educate youth and create a better world.” Forese, on behalf of Citi, was presented with the Champion Award for Citi’s transformational impact on literacy and girls’ education. Citi’s e for Education campaign, a global initiative which has raised over $22 million for education-focused non-profits, has invested $3.1 million in Room to Read’s programs since 2013. Forese is President of Citigroup and Chief Executive Officer of the Institutional Clients Group. “We are incredibly proud of our partnership with Room to Read,” said Forese. “Together, we share in the goal of enabling progress and helping to eliminate generational poverty. We are grateful for their tireless work and commitment in helping to ensure that children have access to quality education.” Speakers at the event included Neema Mwita, a young woman from Tanzania who, through her personal story, demonstrated the change that is possible through education. Mwita was one of only two girls in her village primary school class, out of 100 students, who continued to secondary school. She pursued her education and obtained a university degree in law, defying barriers such as early marriage and pregnancy that exist for women in communities where Room to Read implements its programs. Mwita is now employed by Room to Read as a social mobilizer, mentoring and advocating for a cohort of girls enrolled in Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. “Room to Read is changing the game for children around the world, and tonight we recognize Citi and Glamour for their meaningful and impactful contributions to further our vision of a world in which all children can pursue a quality education and reach their full potential,” said Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read CEO. Red carpet photos are available here. Photos from inside the event are available here.

The Friday evening show is the largest variety show every produced in the festival's eighteen-year history. The entertainers hail from all over the U.S. and will perform in a variety of shows, in one of the most extensive cabaret festivals in Massachusetts. All festival events share the theme of sophisticated and soulful 1950s music and will showcase the unique art form of live cabaret. Producer Patricia Fitzpatrick will award scholarships to three emerging performers, to further encourage the cabaret art form. Fitzpatrick has built the festival upon the idea that ""education is the key that unlocks all further endeavors"" (a phrase that inspired her as a young person). ""The varied music shows pull seasoned performers to the festival, and in turn they commit to offering workshops, master classes, and Q&A sessions to aspiring vocalists"", she says. The scholarships are underwritten by Fr. Jeffrey Hamblin, M.D., a longtime supporter of the Provincetown CabaretFest. According to Hamblin, ""I hope to enable the perpetuation of this culture of song in the hope that this vibrant art form will not be lost but will engage intellectually and emotionally those who perform and those who listen, to discover that 'life is a cabaret!'"" Performers slated to appear at the festival include: Mark Alan, Jo Brisbane, Joe Della Penna, Brian DeLorenzo, John DeMarco, Dawn Derow, Jay Cee Driesen, Patricia Fitzpatrick, Rod Ferguson, Michael Garin, Stephen Hanks, Jeff Harnar, Jason Henderson, Jim Keating, Vivienne LaBarbera, Tom La Mark, Jeff Macauley, The Max & Cam Duo, David Meulemans, Mardie Millit, Carolyn Montgomery, John O'Neil, Carol O'Shaughnessy, Brian Patton, Joni Rapp, Alex Rybeck, Lydia Sabosto, Warren Schein, Bryon Sommers, John Spinks, Janet Stanton, Zoe Stewart, John Thomas, Richard White, Nancy & Dave Wilber Duo, and Kevin Wood.

Ernie Masche/Record File Photo: Bandys' JaTay Culliver is one of a handful of local athletes who will compete at the NCHSAA track and field state championships this weekend at NC A&T. Culliver will look to win state titles in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. HICKORY – Following numerous dominant performances in Regional competition over the weekend, high school athletes across the area are preparing to be crowned the top performer in their respective events at this weekend’s NCHSAA track and field state championships. Bunker Hill played host to the 2A West Regional meet last Saturday, with the Bears’ Cameron Mcdaniel winning in the long jump and triple jump. Bandys also had a two-time winner as JaTay Culliver outran the field in the 100- and 200-meter dashes. The Trojans’ Alex Reavis claimed the high jump title as well and will enter the state event with the best mark of any other competitor. Hibriten’s short relay team also picked up a pair of Regional gold medals, as did the Panthers’ Miles Simon in the 300-meter hurdles. Newton-Conover also had a Regional champion with its 4x400 girls relay squad. And at the 3A West meet held at Watauga, Alexander Central’s Lyndon Strickland won titles in the shot put and discus – though he won’t be the only Cougar competing for a state championship this weekend. To qualify for the state meet, competitors had to finish in the top four in their event at Regionals. The state championships will take place at North Carolina A&T State University, with the 2A and 4A meets going Saturday and the 3A meet moved from Friday to Sunday due to the threat of severe weather. On the strength of victories from Culliver and Reavis, Bandys placed fourth at the 2A West Regional, six points ahead of fifth-place Hibriten and 20 in front of Bunker Hill in seventh. Joining the Trojans duo at state will be Chase Clanton, who qualified for the 300-meter hurdles by finishing fourth in the Regional. Speaking of Bunker Hill, the Bears send two of their boys to Greensboro. Along with Mcdaniel, Raheem Carson qualified for state after taking second in the 100-meter dash with a time of 11.13 seconds. Andrew Davis and A’Qui Thompson will look to bring a state championship back to Fred T. Foard. Davis finished fourth in the Regional pole vault event, while Thompson took second in the 400-meter dash. Hibriten will have five members of its 2AA state-winning football team looking to add another championship to cap their academic year. Aaron Logan, Karson Pilkenton, McKinley Witherspoon and Jonas Brown had the top Regional times in the 4x100 and 4x200 relay races. Witherspoon will also race in the 200-meter dash. And Simon, the MVP of the football title game, ran the 300 hurdles in 40.03 seconds to qualify with the fourth-best time for any 2A boy this season. Newton-Conover’s Jalen Johnson has a shot at three different titles this weekend. He’ll race in the 200- and 400-meter dashes as well as the 4x400 relay team with Keldon Stinson, Caleb Henze and Noel McIver. Additionally, Brandon Johnson qualified for the 100-meter dash. Micah Cobb is Maiden’s lone state qualifier. He placed third in the Regional discus event. Bunker Hill and Newton-Conover are the only area teams to send girls to the 2A championships. For the Bears, Caroline Hilliard will compete in the 800- and 1,600-meter races, having finished third in both events at the Regional. Naeousha Ramseur will also have a shot at three titles: she qualified for the 100-meter dash as well as the 4x100 and 4x200 relays with teammates Na’Mya Hector, Jahlein Summers and Jada Perkins. Add the Red Devils’ Brianna Carson to the list of possible three-time winners as well. She qualified in both the 100- and 400-meter dashes. And her 4x400 relay team with Anna Loudermelt, Elaina Ramseur and Mia Macon won at Regionals and will be in the top half of the state field. Strickland had the top marks in the 3A West shot put (49-01.50) and discus (155-11) and enters state among the top four in each event. Fellow Cougar Cooper Castellaw placed third in the 3,200-meter run with a time of 10:01.60, booking his ticket to state as well. Hickory and St. Stephens each had one runner qualify for the state meet. The Red Tornadoes’ Elijah Milsaps took fourth in the 300-meter hurdles (41.34), while the Indians’ Jayden Hefner also finished fourth in the 1,600-meter run (4:29.90). Alexander Central had a trio of girls place third in their respective events at the 3A West Regional. KeyKey Miller qualified for the state triple jump event with a mark of 35-06.50. Kacey Payne will represent the Cougars in the shot put after her distance of 32-01. And Madison Ratchford had a mark of 104-10 in the discus to join Miller and Payne at state. Carter Lewis will be the lone representative for South Caldwell at the state championships. He qualified for the pole vault by placing fourth in last weekend’s 4A West Regional at Providence High School, posting a mark of 13.00 feet. Only five 4A pole vaulters across the state have reached a higher distance this year. Whenever Aaron Schnautz posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

But Division III track athletes took that to heart Wednesday, as six records fell on just the first day of district competition. Southeastern's Lane Ruby and Paint Valley's Travis Burton were among four individuals and one relay team who set new marks during Day 1 competition at Southeastern High School. Ruby, a sophomore, qualified for the regional meet with a leap of 21-10¾, breaking the district meet record set two years ago by Adena's Brian Hall, while his cousin, Ellie Ruby of Wheelersburg, knocked down two district hurdles records. Her 14.69 in the girls 100 hurdles was not only good enough for first, but topped the mark set in 2014, while her 46.02 in the 300 hurdles also topped the field and the previous record set seven years ago. Burton threw 176-05 to win the south division of the district over fellow conference competitors Eric Hurtt from Adena and Jonathon Fisher of Huntington. All three will move on to the regionals and scored for their teams. Burton's throw bested the mark set one year ago by former Bearcat teammate Jacob Ott, who was in attendance Wednesday and now throws at Walsh. Paint Valley’s Travis Burton, seen here in a competition earlier in the 2018 season, broke the Division III district record in the discus Wednesday. (Photo: Robert McGraw/Gazette) In addition to those records, Leesburg Fairfield's boys 3200 relay of Matthew Mangus, Brandtson Duffie, Andrew Davis, and Bennett Hodson ran the track in 8:20.66 to break the record set one year ago by the Lions, when Duffie and Mangus were also on the team. Portsmouth's Lynsey Shipley broke the decade-old 100 dash mark with a 12.44, besting the former mark of 12.5. While those tremendous performances were being logged, Adena's boys team jumped out to a first-day lead in the north competition. The Warriors have 35 points, with Paint Valley at 29 and Huntington at 21, while Nelsonville-York leads the south with 38 points to Belpre's 23. Federal Hocking leads the girls' competition by one point over Wheelersburg, 14-13. Other local athletes advancing to the regional meet included: Also scoring points on Day 1, but not advancing, included Issac Alley of Paint Valley (seventh, boys south discus); Piketon's Alisha Jones (sixth, girls high jump, and seventh in shot put); Southeastern's Electa Seymour (eighth, girls high jump), the boys 3200 relay team, and Ethan Redman (sixth, boys north pole vault); Adena's Tate Myers (eighth, south long jump) and Huntington's Quentin Montgomery (fifth, boys south pole vault) and the girls 3200 relay team (eighth).

Andrew,Davis,912,https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/belt-up-and-hit-the-road-to-better-china-relations-20180517-p4zfys.html,"This coming week I’ll be in Beijing because I believe that the rise and rise of Asia, particularly China, is inevitable and, properly handled, will be good for all. The truth is that the 19th century belonged to Europe and our great ties with those nations, especially Great Britain, helped us establish ourselves in the modern world. The 20th century was driven by the force of the North American economy and it became the American century. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, left, shakes hands with China's President, Xi Jinping.Credit:AP But the 21st century belongs to Asia and the wider non-Asian community needs to understand that this is not a new phenomenon. By the middle of this century, Asia will hold 50 per cent of the world’s wealth. Australia will have three of the four biggest economies in the world as neighbours - China, Japan, India and quite possibly Indonesia. America will recede in importance but will have a great presence. It will be a challenging time as we all learn to live together in a rapidly changing power dynamic, but live together we must. “The alternatives are unthinkable,"" say Charlie and Louise. Author and academic Arne Westad says: ""For most of the time since the dawn of human civilisation, Asia has been in the lead, economically and technologically. It is more likely that Western predominance started with the industrial revolution and may be ending with the information revolution."" So, I head to Beijing where a highlight will be a performance by the great Melbourne Symphony Orchestra under the baton of internationally acclaimed chief conductor Sir Andrew Davis. I was involved with the hiring of Sir Andrew some years ago and this is his farewell tour. Geoff Raby, the former Australian ambassador to China, caused a stir during the week. He believes that our relations at a government level are strained if not actually broken. But I would argue that cultural and educational exchanges complement the strong relationship between nations and can transcend the passing parade of individual governments. And so, as Sir Andrew conducts to a packed audience at the architecturally brilliant Beijing concert hall, NCPA, I know that we’ll all be doing a good thing for the long-term relations between the countries. And while I’m there, I will be having further talks about the rollout of the One Belt, One Road initiative. In particular, I’ll be meeting with Professor Wang Yiwei, who is the director of the Institute of International Affairs at Renmin University of China. His book, The Belt and Road: What Will China Offer The World In Its Rise, is the first book produced in China about the subject. He will be visiting Australia later this year. Professor Wang points out that this is China’s new Silk Road for the modern world and will transform global trade. We’ll see how that works out. There are dangers, but this practical and large-scale trade initiative will expand the world economy as the belt and road winds its way from Asia through China, Europe and on to Africa. It’s a very big idea and we need to come to terms with a radical shift of power that is only just beginning. Our federal government actively supports business getting on with it in China and always has.Our Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, gets a bit of flack, but I have to say she has been incredibly helpful, as has her department, for my visit next week. It’s not only our fine musicians who are getting on with the job of building people-to-people relations. Tomorrow night, Port Adelaide will play the Gold Coast Suns at the Jainwan Stadium in Shanghai and the game will be telecast across China to a bigger viewing audience than has ever watched an AFL game at home. We need to engage with the irreversible trends of the modern world rather than standing back and appearing somehow fearful. China is our biggest trading partner and yet many of our 1 million Chinese Australians sometimes feel we don’t recognise them or the great contribution they have made to our country since the 1850s and even earlier, when their ancestors traded with Aboriginal nations in northern Australia centuries ago. There is more for us to do. One Belt, One Road was launched in Beijing in May 2017 and the Victorian Premier was the only Australian government leader invited. Premier Daniel Andrews made a speech at the conference and we can now see how the relationship with China is paying off with increases in jobs, trade and investment in Victoria. He has insisted on every minister of his government visiting China and they have. Other states are now getting into the game and engaging with China. We must build a sense of community between Asians and Australians. It can’t just be about the dollars, although it will make a stronger economy for Australia.

Michael,Gordon,910,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article211157969.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 16, 2018 12:04 PM So much for the lure of the road. Bill and Jennie Mangan say their dream of spending the first 10 years of joint retirement traveling the country inside their luxury RV quickly faded beneath a cloud of diesel fumes pouring into their bedroom at night as leaking hydraulic fluid seeped into a basement drawer. Then there was the sewage, which they say pooled daily in their bedroom and geysered from their shower drain like an off-color Old Faithful each time they flushed the toilet. The combination, the couple says, left their new Thor Tuscany 44MT smelling like a $270,000, rolling outhouse. Once upon a time, the Mangans hoped to join more than the 1 million estimated American retirees who have discarded permanent addresses for golden years of adventure made possible by roomy and tricked-out recreational vehicles. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. No longer. This week, the couple sued Thor Industries, the Indiana company that built their RV, seeking a full refund of the sale price plus $100,000 in damages for the 160 separate defects that the couple says have crippled the vehicle during the short time they've owned it. Today, Bill and Jennie's would-be chariot to a new way of life sits in a Lincoln County campground, not far from the conventional home they have under construction in nearby Denver. ""We bought the RV for fun, and all it's been is work, headaches, expense and horrible experiences,"" Jennie says. ""We don't believe in this vehicle. There's no trust that it is going to stay put together for the next 10 years. I don't want it anymore. I'm done."" The lawsuit says the couple's highly anticipated life on five wheels instead bogged down into hours lost on the phone or laptop debating warranties and service claims. When they actually drove their 45-foot-long RV anywhere, they say, it was usually a two- to three-day trip to some RV service center in a distant state. In fact, the Mangans say they took so many 1,000-mile drives to North Carolina-based RV garages from their former New Hampshire home that they found they actually loved the state. They hope to move into their new Lincoln County house by July. Sedentary living never looked so good, Jennie says. Thor is a major name in the RV industry, with the Tuscany its premium model. Thor Industries is the parent company of Thor Motor Coach, which built and assembled the Mangans' model. A Missouri couple on their honeymoon said they could not use the bathroom in their cruise cabin aboard Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Triumph because of ""black sewage,"" smelling of poop, that would bubble up out of the shower drain. On the Better Business Bureau website, Thor receives 3.2 stars out of five. Several of the customer reviews posted closely track what the Mangans say has been their experience — multiple problems surfacing in the RVs soon after purchase. BBB says 36 complaints, most for problems with Thor's products or service, have been closed in the last three years. T. Michael Pangburn, the attorney for Thor Industries, said in a Wednesday email to the Observer that the company has a limited one-year warranty along with a backup service plan to handle most problems that arise with its vehicles. ""While Thor Motor Coach, Inc. has legal defenses to the lawsuit, it wishes to seek an amicable resolution of the dispute if at all possible,"" Pangburn wrote. ""It is disappointing to learn that an owner of a Thor Motor Coach product is dissatisfied."" The Mangans started searching for an RV in anticipation of Jennie's planned March 2017 retirement from her job as a software engineer. She says they hunted the country online for the best model and price, and believed they found it at a dealership outside Raleigh. Charlotte Water crews responded to a sewage spill in Mecklenburg County on Tuesday, April 24, 2018. Wastewaters overflowed Monday night making its way down to Long Creek, which flows into the Catawba River and Lake Wylie. When she climbed aboard the Thor in the store's parking lot in June 2016, Jennie says she was overwhelmed by the vehicle's sophistication and beauty. ""Like a shiny penny,"" she says. Still, the RV needed several days of final repairs before the Mangans could drive it off the lot, the lawsuit says. The first night they had it, they say, a water line broke. Jennie says she and Bill parked by an all-night Wal-Mart so she could use the store's bathroom. By the time, they made it back to New England, the ""big stuff,"" as Jennie calls it, began cropping up. On a trip to Florida, she says, sewage from a leaking bathroom pipe puddled on the ground beneath the RV. When the pipe was fixed and the overall water pressure increased, she says, so did the size of the excremental plumes firing out of the shower drain. According to the complaint, the Mangans' RV has spent a combined six months at various shops and still has problems. A month and a half into ownership, the couple began asking for a full rebate, first from the dealership and eventually Thor; the company has never responded, the lawsuit says. Without the help of an attorney, the couple has sued under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, a 1975 law designed to protect consumers against misleading warranty claims. The couple also has filed a complaint in state courts against the Raleigh dealer. The Mangans say Thor and its products ""have ruined our dreams of ever traveling with any form of RV, now and in the future,"" the lawsuit says. ""This ... without a doubt has been the most horrible experience of our lives so far."" Researcher Maria David contributed.

Michael,Gordon,910,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/17/wests-tigers-coach-ivan-clearys-penrith-blueprint-turned-wests-tigers-around-elijah-taylor/,"WESTS TIGERS Wests Tigers lock Elijah Taylor says there are plenty of similarities between his current club's surprise 6-4 start to 2018 and the way coach Ivan Cleary elevated Penrith – this week's opponents – to some impressive finishes when he was at the Panthers. Taylor has now played under Cleary at three clubs – the Warriors, Panthers and Wests Tigers – and was at the foot of the mountains when Cleary oversaw the departures of big names and local favourites Michael Jennings, Luke Lewis, Lachlan Coote and Michael Gordon in 2012-13. There are shades of the Tigers parting way with their own stars like James Tedesco, Aaron Woods and Mitch Moses last year. The Panthers in 2014 surged to a remarkable fourth-placed finish and upset minor premiers the Roosters in the first week of the finals before narrowly going down to Canterbury in the grand final qualifier. That was despite a catastrophic injury toll with stars Peter Wallace, Tyrone Peachey, Bryce Cartwright and Kevin Kingston going down with season-ending injuries among other less serious injury woes. ""[It's about] the retention and recruitment of players, who he's brought in, who he's let go. He's let go of some big names,"" Taylor told NRL.com of the club's current culture and their re-entry to the winners' circle last week after a mini-slump. ""He had to do the same at Penrith with Luke Lewis, Michael Jennings, Michael Gordon, Lachlan Coote. He's made some tough decisions but he's putting together a team where he feels everybody will buy in and do what he wants and it's good to see it's happening now,"" Taylor added. Cleary continued that policy this week, dropping his round 10 man of the match Mahe Fonua for being late to training. The policy that commitment and a team-first attitude trumps all was on show right from round one when David Nofoaluma was bumped to reserve grade and Tui Lolohea put on notice. Meanwhile, lesser-known players like Corey Thompson, Esan Marsters, Alex Twal, Matt Eisenhuth and Michael Chee-Kam are either establishing themselves as genuine first graders or producing career-best form. ""When I first went to Penrith we didn't have the big name players but we all ripped in for each other and all turned up for each other in defence,"" Taylor recalled. ""We managed to get to a couple of finals series. That's the blueprint, it's something that's working for us. The way we play our football, it's not flash, it's all hard work, it's all scramble D. Our games are pretty scrappy sometimes and it's all down to the wire."" The important thing in snapping a three-game losing streak against the Cowboys at Leichhardt last week was a return to what had been working over the opening six rounds. And the return of Russell Packer didn't hurt either. ""We went away from what works for us [in the loss to] the Warriors [the week before],"" he said. ""The first five rounds we were turning up for each other defensively scrambling hard for each other and that kind of went away in the Parramatta and Warriors games. Russell Packer coming back helped as well. We know what works for us but we've got to bring it every week."" Taylor, like Cleary, will see plenty of familiar faces this Thursday night – incluiding the coach's son Nathan, who Taylor remembers as a ball boy back at the Warriors. ""It's always good to play against your old friends, friends you spent your career with and played with and used to be in the trenches with some of them in the hard times, you build those good relationships,"" he said. ""It's good to see [Nathan] back on the field, young kid, great talent. We've got to focus more on what he brings to the table. ""His show and go, running ability with the football, his kicking game and he's a strong defender as well. Their forward pack runs hard - Reagan Campbell-Gillard, James Fish, big Viliame [Kikau] on the edge. It's going to be a very physical game against Penrith."" The always-calm coach hadn't been any different this week despite a rare chance to coach against his son. ""Ivan doesn't give too much away,"" Taylor smiled. ""It's good he's dealt with that the way that he's wanted to but he's just treating it as another game. We're preparing for another team. That's all he can do at the moment.""

Vicks who turned in a round of 86 today for first place in the D Flight also won his flight here last season with a score of 87.

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:05 pm 2018 Summer Editorial Intern Fifteen people are in custody after a six-month-long narcotics investigation by the Southeast Minnesota Violent Crimes Enforcement Team and Rochester Police Department. Daniel Paul Wateski, Trisha Ruth Severson, Shari Margaret Horsman, Richard Victor Dessner, Julie Lynn Bigelow, Shannon Machel Deheve, Michael Gordon Janvrin, Lihn Chanhnoy, Larry Edward Schaaf, Richard Alan Betts, Zane Briant Rose, Michael Steven Nord, Toby James Bruce, Gabrielle Karin Henderson and Rebecca Jo Nelson, all from Rochester and the surrounding area, were all arrested Tuesday in connection to the investigation. Called “spring cleaning” by Capt. Scott Behrens of the Olmsted County Sheriff’s office and Cmdr. Vince Scheckel of the SEMVCET, 27 people in total were targeted for arrested for selling narcotics based on probable cause. According to Scheckel, the 15 in custody and the 12 others who are wanted are reportedly mid-level dealers, mostly moving meth ounces at a time. He added that more arrests are imminent. Scheckel also said the investigation spanned eight counties in Southeast Minnesota, but that most of the 15 people arrested Tuesday were in Rochester. A total of about 30 officers were involved. Arraignments for those in custody will begin at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday in Courtroom 7 on the sixth floor of the city-county Government Center. 2018 Summer Editorial Intern Spencer is a 2018 summer editorial intern for the Post Bulletin covering general assignment and sports stories.

Michael,Gordon,904,http://www.wbtv.com/story/38207208/they-dreamed-of-adventure-in-their-new-rv-but-they-say-they-got-geysers-of-sewage,"LINCOLN COUNTY, NC (Michael Gordon/The Charlotte Observer) - So much for the lure of the road. Bill and Jennie Mangan say their dream of spending the first 10 years of joint retirement traveling the country inside their luxury RV quickly faded beneath a cloud of diesel fumes pouring into their bedroom at night as leaking hydraulic fluid seeped into a basement drawer. Then there was the sewage, which they say pooled daily in their bedroom and geysered from their shower drain like an off-color Old Faithful each time they flushed the toilet. The combination, the couple says, left their new Thor Tuscany 44MT smelling like a $270,000, rolling outhouse. Once upon a time, the Mangans hoped to join more than the 1 million estimated American retirees who have discarded permanent addresses for golden years of adventure made possible by roomy and tricked-out recreational vehicles. No longer. This week, the couple sued Thor Industries, the Indiana company that built their RV, seeking a full refund of the sale price plus $100,000 in damages for the 160 separate defects that the couple says have crippled the vehicle during the short time they've owned it. Today, Bill and Jennie's would-be chariot to a new way of life sits in a Lincoln County campground, not far from the conventional home they have under construction in nearby Denver. ""We bought the RV for fun, and all it's been is work, headaches, expense and horrible experiences,"" Jennie says. ""We don't believe in this vehicle. There's no trust that it is going to stay put together for the next 10 years. I don't want it anymore. I'm done."" The lawsuit says the couple's highly anticipated life on five wheels instead bogged down into hours lost on the phone or laptop debating warranties and service claims. When they actually drove their 45-foot-long RV anywhere, they say, it was usually a two- to three-day trip to some RV service center in a distant state. In fact, the Mangans say they took so many 1,000-mile drives to North Carolina-based RV garages from their former New Hampshire home that they found they actually loved the state. They hope to move into their new Lincoln County house by July. Sedentary living never looked so good, Jennie says. Thor is a major name in the RV industry, with the Tuscany its premium model. Thor Industries is the parent company of Thor Motor Coach, which built and assembled the Mangans' model. On the Better Business Bureau website, Thor receives 3.2 stars out of five. Several of the customer reviews posted closely track what the Mangans say has been their experience — multiple problems surfacing in the RVs soon after purchase. BBB says 36 complaints, most for problems with Thor's products or service, have been closed in the last three years. T. Michael Pangburn, the attorney for Thor Industries, said in a Wednesday email to the Observer that the company has a limited one-year warranty along with a backup service plan to handle most problems that arise with its vehicles. ""While Thor Motor Coach, Inc. has legal defenses to the lawsuit, it wishes to seek an amicable resolution of the dispute if at all possible,"" Pangburn wrote. ""It is disappointing to learn than an owner of a Thor Motor Coach product is dissatisfied."" The Mangans started searching for an RV in anticipation of Jennie's planned March 2017 retirement from her job as a software engineer. She says they hunted the country online for the best model and price, and believed they found it at a dealership outside Raleigh. When she climbed aboard the Thor in the store's parking lot in June 2016, Jennie says she was overwhelmed by the vehicle's sophistication and beauty. ""Like a shiny penny,"" she says. Still, the RV needed several days of final repairs before the Mangans could drive it off the lot, the lawsuit says. The first night they had it, they say, a water line broke. Jennie says she and Bill parked by an all-night Wal-Mart so she could use the store's bathroom. By the time, they made it back to New England, the ""big stuff,"" as Jennie calls it, began cropping up. On a trip to Florida, she says, sewage from a leaking bathroom pipe puddled on the ground beneath the RV. When the pipe was fixed and the overall water pressure increased, she says, so did the size of the excremental plumes firing out of the shower drain. According to the complaint, the Mangans' RV has spent a combined six months at various shops and still has problems. A month and a half into ownership, the couple began asking Thor for a full rebate; the company has never responded, the lawsuit says. Without the help of an attorney, the couple has sued under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, a 1975 law designed to protect consumers against misleading warranty claims. The Mangans say Thor and its products ""have ruined our dreams of ever traveling with any form of RV, now and in the future,"" the lawsuit says. ""This ... without a doubt has been the most horrible experience of our lives so far.""

John,O'Neil,902,http://abc3340.com/news/local/pickens-county-medical-center-wins-2-million-federal-grant,"by Elizabeth Lane PICKENS CO MED CENTER.JPG People in Pickens County no longer have to worry about the future of their medical facility. They narrowly beat out a long list of other hospitals for a multi-million dollar grant. A declining population, lack of transportation and low-quality care are factors CEO John O'Neil said plays into the death of rural hospitals like the Pickens County Medical Center. ""It's important that rural healthcare survives, we know it's personal and local,"" O'Neil said. People living in Carrollton were thrilled at the news that a $2 million grant will keep their facility going. They believe its impact reaches far beyond the walls of the hospital. ""If I have to go to the emergency room, I go right in,"" Chastity Marchant said, ""They take you right in and treat you like family. It's a small town, everybody knows everybody. The doctors are great. Nothing like a hometown hospital."" Senior Program Manager Bethany Adams and her team at the National Rural Health Resource Center will spend the next three years increasing the workforce, improving emergency services, and strengthening the system, all in an effort to make sure rural care is here to stay. ""We are thrilled to be working with this community because of the leadership here, the commitment. And that's what it's going to take to move toward the future and make these implementations and changes,"" Adams said. County leaders said it's hard to put a dollar amount on the worth of the grant, because it's something they never could have afforded to do alone. Hospital executives will also use the grant to recruit new doctors to Pickens County. They said they are already getting interest.

Andrew,Davis,901,https://www.riverbender.com/articles/details/rising-stars-two-alton-fighting-irish-teams-win-memphis-championships-28532.cfm,"ALTON - The Alton Fighting Irish Soccer Club had two teams win the recent Adidas Premier Invitational Championship in Memphis, Tenn. The 2006 Irish girls team finished the tournament 3-1 with victories over teams from Tennessee, Mississippi and Missouri, but had to earn the Championship the hard way. ""We won the first game 3-1 but came out slow against a good Northern Mississippi team and got down 2-0 early. We felt we outplayed them the last 45 minutes but the first 15 minutes cost us. We lost 3-2 and had to earn our way back into the winners' bracket"", said Irish Coach Andrew Davis. ""Then we were able to win 2-1 against a good JB Marine team from St. Louis who is two divisions ahead of us in our league. That put us into the Championship against the Mississippi team we lost to 3-2."" The Irish won the Championship 3-0. ""This was some of the best competition we have faced. So for us to win against higher division teams lets us know the team has even more potential"" said Irish Coach Robert Stephan. ""That the girls regrouped and fought back says a lot about their determination"". This is the 2006 Irish Girls third championship this season, with the team earning first place in the Lou Fusz Fall Invitational and as well as the recent Glen-Ed Spring Kick-Off in Edwardsville.

The Irish 2008 girls also claimed a Championship in Memphis after going 4-0 against clubs from Mississippi and Tennessee. ""This was a great experience for our players and parents. We are proud of their development and look forward to watching them in the future"" said Irish Coach Matt Waters. ""This is a fun group to watch. They have speed, skill and play great defense"" added Stephan. The 2008 Irish girls won the Lou Fusz Fall Invitational and placed second in the top division of the recent Glen Ed Spring Kick-Off in Edwardsville. Team members include Izzi Hough, Maddie Waters, Lydia Schrumpf, Allie Weiner, Alex Stephan, Kyridis Orr, Lilly Hannigan, Jessica Eales, Rayna Raglin, Emma Hough and Ava Hernandez.

Andrew,Davis,901,http://goodtimes.sc/santa-cruz-arts-entertainment/stage/theater-review-jewel-theatre-odd-couple/,"Jewel Theatre has fun with Neil Simon’s wildly retro ‘Odd Couple’ Anyone alive in the latter part of the 20th century knows something about Neil Simon’s Tony-Award-winning hit comedy The Odd Couple. Premiering in 1965, the play was adapted into a film in 1968 and then splashed into television history during the 1970s. Three comic geniuses—Art Carney, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Randall—played the fastidious, neurotic half of the couple, Felix Unger, while Walter Matthau and Jack Klugman provided the slovenly, cigar-smoking foil Oscar Madison. Media icons, every one. So it’s inevitable that Santa Cruz audiences will bring their own preconceptions to the Jewel Theatre’s smart version of the Simon comedy classic. Directed with sitcom style by Stephen Muterspaugh, the production moves fast and looks terrific. A vintage gem, the play pulls us back into the era where Mancini and Sinatra poured from record players. Oscar, a sportswriter, composes his newspaper articles on a typewriter, and as the play opens we see a quartet of men sitting around a poker table. The cigars, late-night poker games and rotary telephones aren’t the only indications that we’ve been plunged into a whole other zeitgeist. Felix Unger (played with cringeworthy fussiness by Shaun Carroll) has just been kicked out by his wife. When he arrives at Oscar’s apartment late for the card game, he’s an emotional mess. Well, nobody wants to play cards anymore, so the others leave and Oscar invites his friend to move in with him. The opening act of Odd Couple is a comic delight, loaded with slick dialogue glistening with men-in-groups repartee and the growing tension between a slob and an OCD perfectionist. In the second act, we meet two young women Oscar has invited to dinner, a pair of English sisters who live in an upstairs apartment. Felix has knocked himself out cooking, setting an impeccable table, but things start to go wrong. He breaks down and begins to relive the pain of his failed marriage. Without revealing too much, let’s just say that the women are sympathetic. Oscar explodes and kicks Felix out. Of course, things are resolved in the end, but not before Oscar (played with Ralph Kramden ferocity by David Ledingham) has chewed and swallowed most of the scenery out of his love/hate frustration with the irritating Felix. A special shout-out to the poker players—Jesse Caldwell as the no-nonsense Roy, a tightly wound Scott Coopwood as Speed, Andrew Davis as Vinnie, and Geoff Fiorito as Murray the cop—a close knit ensemble of professionals showcasing just how good live theater can be. The heavy lifting in this production falls to Ledingham, whose looks channel James Garner more than shaggy Walter Matthau. His zest and timing move everything along with sparkle. The English gals are priceless as sketched by April Green and Erika Schindele—their ditzy blonde giggling and leggy antics (great shoes by B. Modern) are straight out of Goldie Hawn’s glory days. But that’s part of where the Simon play exposes its mid-20th-century roots—New York, urban, pre-psychedelics and sexual revolution, a time before enormous change in social customs, gender roles and cultural acceptance. Period pieces can flourish in dramatic form, but comedy lives and dies on its interrogation of the immediate context; the here-and-now world. Simon’s work reflects a culmination of values on the verge of being (largely) overthrown. How men act in a domestic setting without a female housewife is the linchpin of this comedy, and it is one that doesn’t travel into the 21st century without considerable faultlines. The male stereotypes Simon explored have been mashed, if not swallowed. Ditto for females. We can admire the cast’s abilities, but find it harder to gain traction with women as airheads who live to care for men, and men whose immediate goals involve beer, poker, and the aforementioned airheads. Felix, as written by Simon, isn’t gay, he’s simply an insufferable perfectionist. It’s a hard character to play today with complete conviction. Pro tip: if the contemporary dramatic sitcom by Kate Hawley hadn’t just been seen on the same stage, it might have been easier to surrender to the Neil Simon scenario. Hawley’s Coming of Age was fresh, surprising and relevant. The Simon play has some enormous laughs, and some wise sparkling lines. But its moral assumptions make it a stretch for today’s audience. Still, anyone who did see Coming of Age will definitely want to see Odd Couple. The juxtaposition of the two plays will provide ample fuel for discussion—which is exactly what vibrant theater should do. The Odd Couple by Neil Simon will be performed at the Tannery Arts Center’s Colligan Theater through May 27. A matinee show has been added on May 19. jeweltheatre.net. Christina Waters was born in Santa Cruz and raised all over the world (thanks to an Air Force dad), with real-world training in painting, music, winetasting, trail running, organic gardening, and teaching. She has a PhD in Philosophy, teaches in the Arts at UCSC and sings with the UCSC Concert Choir. Look for her recent memoir “Inside the Flame” at bookstores everywhere.

Andrew,Davis,901,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Election-news-Pulse-Nightclub-drag-queen-attacked/62871.html,"Mark Harrisa Baptist pastor with a long history of social conservatismwon the GOP primary in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, ousting Rep. Robert Pittenger, who is now the first congressional incumbent of either party to lose a primary this cycle, The Huffington Post noted. Harris' upset victory could make it easier for Democrats to pick up the seat in November. The 9th District is on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's list of targets. Dan McCready, a former Marine Corps captain who founded a solar farm company, easily won the Democratic primary. Democratic gubernatorial challenger Cynthia Nixon, a self-proclaimed lesbian, is using the phrase ""Vote for the homo, not for the Cuomo"" in her campaign against incumbent New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York Daily News noted. She switched up a campaign slogan he's rumored to have coined during his father's ( Mario Cuomo ) failed run against Mayor Ed Koch in 1977. Posters with the original slogan""Vote for Cuomo, not the homo""were intended to capitalize on homophobia and innuendo about Koch's sexuality. In his race for San Diego County Supervisor District 4, Nathan Fletcher is campaigning as a Democrat who promises to be a progressive vote on issues, but is now struggling to explain a controversial, anti-LGBT voting record while he was in the State Assembly, SDGLN.com noted. In 2008, Fletcher ran as a pro-life, pro-gun conservative Republican for the 75th Assembly District and wonthanks largely to high profile endorsements from individuals like Karl Rove, leaders within the far-right evangelical community, and supporters of the controversial Prop 8 Initiative that banned same-sex marriage. Monterey County sheriff candidate Scott Davis told KSBW that he wants to become the first openly gay sheriff in California historyand he is running against his boss, Sheriff Steve Bernal. In a KSBW video, Davis recently talked about being gay, and explained why he is a champion of LGBTQ and immigrants' rights. The video is at http://www.ksbw.com/article/monterey-county-sheriff-s-candidate-scott-davis-hopes-to-be-california-s-first-gay-sheriff/20533145. Scott Livelythe author of a book claiming that the Holocaust was orchestrated by gay men who ran the Nazi Partywill appear on a Massachusetts gubernatorial primary ballot later this year after garnering enough support at the Republican Party's state convention, Newsweek.com noted. Lively will now face off with incumbent Gov. Charlie Baker in September's primary. Lively ( the founder of an anti-LGBT group, Abiding Truth Ministries ) wrote a 1995 book, The Pink Swastika, in which he asserted that the Nazi Party that took power in Germany in the 1930s was controlled by ""militaristic"" gay people who inspired the murder of approximately 6 million European Jews. Orlando's onePULSE Foundation has created an interim memorial dedicated to the victims of the June 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre, NewNowNext.com reported. The memorialwhich will serve as an temporary fixture until the foundation finds an architect to design a permanent memorial and museumhas opened to the public. Before the public launch, members of the foundation came together with survivors, first responders, local leaders, and families of victims to honor the 49 lives lost to anti-LGBT gun violence during the shooting. Alabama's first openly gay lawmaker will head an LGBTQ coalition in Florida after her retirement this year, U.S. News & World Report noted. Democratic Rep. Patricia Todd from Birmingham has accepted a job as executive director of One Orlando Alliance, a coalition of LGBTQ organizations formed after the 2016 PULSE nightclub shooting. Todd has served 12 years in Alabama's House; she helped pass a law to allow marijuana medication for seizures and unsuccessfully pushed to add sexual orientation as a protected category under a hate-crime law. Philadelphia drag queen Aloe Vera was recently attacked and had to go through surgery, Instinct Magazine noted. The attack, by a 34-year-old man named Carmelo Villanueva, was so serious that it prompted the need for jaw surgery. A fundraiser was held May 7 for Vera at the ICandy Nightclub in Philadelphia's Gayborhood so that she could pay off the operation. Mourners held a vigil May 13 for a transgender woman who was murdered in Dallas, NBCDFW.com reported. Police found 26-year-old Carla Patricia Flores-Pavon unconscious in her apartment; authorities later said she had been choked. Monica Roberts, a board member of Dallas-based Black Transwomen Inc., attended the vigil and expressed disappointment that the murder was not being handled differently. Vermont lawmakers have passed a bill that will require all single-user bathrooms in public buildings or places of public accommodation to be marked as gender-neutral, CNN reported. The bill passed with a large majority in the House in April 2017, and then took a year to reach the Senate, where it passed unanimously. According to the bill, ""a single-user toilet may be identified by a sign, provided that the sign marks the facility as a restroom and does not indicate any specific gender."" Republican Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed into law a bill that critics say will allow adoption and foster care agencies to ban same-sex couples on religious grounds, The Hill reported. The bill states that private child-placement agencies should not be required by law to ""participate in any placement of a child for foster care or adoption when the proposed placement would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies."" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan signed a bill into law that will protect Maryland youth from the practice of conversion therapy by health professionals, a National Center for Lesbian Rights press release noted. According to the release, the bill-signing was the result of targeted grassroots advocacy efforts by the NCLR, local Maryland LGBTQ advocacy group FreeState Justice and the Human Rights Campaign. Conversion therapy survivor and NCLR Born Perfect Campaign Strategist Mathew Shurka said, ""The state of Maryland took an important step to ensure that all of Maryland's young people know that they are born perfect."" AIDS Walk New York will bring together 20,000 people on Sunday, May 20, in Central Park to raise millions of dollars for Gay Men's Health Crisis ( GMHC ) and other tri-state area AIDS service organizations, a press release noted. The event will feature a line-up of stars including Matt Bomer, Zachary Quinto, Queer Eye's Antoni Porowski and Tan France, Rosie Perez, Nico Tortorella, the Pointer Sisters, RuPaul's Drag Race contestants and many more. Participants will have a choice of the traditional 10K walk through Central Park and the streets of the Upper West Side, or the Macy's-sponsored five-mile run contained entirely within the park. The Bureau of Prisons rolled back some measures that helped prevent transgender prisoners from being harassed, assaulted and sexually abused, USA Today reported. The rules, posted just two days before President Trump's inauguration, laid out a number of guidelines for how prisons and guards should treat transgender inmates. Now, under Trump, some of the policies have been altered, according to an updated manual posted to the Bureau of Prisons website. The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) responded to news that the Trump-Pence Administration has ordered the Bureau of Prisons to use ""biological sex"" in determining how transgender prisoners are assigned housing, putting them at significant risk of sexual abuse, assault and other types of discrimination, a press release noted. In part, HRC Government Affairs Director David Stacy said, ""The decision to disregard a transgender person's gender identity is harmful and disrespectful. This unconscionable decision ignores medical expertise and defies common sense. Transgender people under the control of the Bureau of Prisons will face greater risk of violence and discrimination."" Among New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's potential replacements is Alphonso David, Gov. Andrew Cuomo's chief counsel, LGBTQ Nation noted. David's appointment would be a particularly pointed statement by the state legislature, which will name Schneiderman's successorin addition to being a gay Black man, David is the son of immigrants. Born in the United States, David was raised in Liberia; after his father was jailed in a military coup, the family sought asylum in the States, and it was granted because David was a U.S. citizen. The Kansas Legislature approved a bill that allows faith-based adoption agencies to turn away gay and lesbian couples based on religious beliefs, and Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer said he would sign it, Reuters reported. Under the measure, the Kansas Department for Children and Families cannot block any foster or adoption agency, including those that receive public funds, from participating in its programs only because it refuses to adopt or place children with LGBT people. Seven states have similar laws on the books, according to Human Rights Watch. The four young men accused of attacking a gay couple on South Beach face stiffer penalties after prosecutors charged them under Florida's hate-crime enhancement law, the Miami Herald reported. The group was charged with aggravated battery committed with prejudice, which means each could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the attack that took place during Miami Beach's annual gay-pride parade. Lopez and his companions, Luis M. Alonso Piovet, 20; Adonis Diaz, 21; and Pablo Reinaldo Romo-Figueroa, 21, began to call the victims ""maricones,"" an anti-gay slur in Spanish; video shows they then repeatedly punched the two victims, Rene Chalarca and Dmitry Logunov, in the face, causing cuts and bruises. In Houston, Ben and Rene Ruiz, who were in the midst of a divorce, died in a murder-suicide inside a million-dollar home near the Galleria, ABC13.com reported. Authorities said police were called to the home for a welfare check after a close and longtime friend of the couple got a disturbing text. The couple, who have been common-law married since 1996, have a marriage license from 2016 but recently filed for divorce in March. Domestic terrorist Mark Anthony Conditt was a user of Grindr, police have revealeddespite his history of homophobic blog posts, PinkNews reported. Conditt was responsible for a series of bomb attacks in Austin, Texas, in March, killing two people and injuring six. He killed himself in an explosion on March 21, detonating a bomb in his car as he was pulled over by police. Former California Gov. George Deukmejian died May 8and Q Voice News stated that he left a decidedly anti-gay legacy. For example, the publication noted, Deukmejian vetoed two bills ( one in 1984 and one in 1986 ) that would have prevented discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation. Also, Deukmejian vetoed a bill in 1986 that would have prevented AIDS patients from being fired or denied housing. Deukmejianwho Bloomberg and other media outlets said more than doubled the size of the prison system in the state during his two terms in office during the 1980swas 89. On May 17, Rutgers University—Camden will confer an honorary doctor of laws degree to Anita Hill, a school press release noted. ( In 1991, Hill accused then-nominee for the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment. ) She is chairing the Commission on Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace created in late 2017 in response to the surging national crisis regarding sexual harassment, particularly in the media and entertainment industries. Hill will receive her honorary degree from the school at the commencement ceremony for the Rutgers Law School in Camden, where she also will deliver her accepting remarks and the keynote address. The Mormon church said it will sever its century-old ties with the Boy Scouts of America at the end of next year and place its remaining 425,000 boys into a gospel-focused youth program it is developing, Time.com noted. The announcement by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Boy Scouts didn't come as a complete surprise after the religion last year removed 185,000 boys between the ages of 14 and 18. The Boy Scouts decided in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders and announced last year it would allow girls in its ranks. In May 2018, the organization said it will change the name of its flagship program next year to Scouts BSA to account for the inclusion of girls. A church in West Virginia has been voted out of its local Baptist association because its pastor says gays and lesbians should be welcomed, according to a U.S. News & World Report article. The Times West Virginian reported the Fairmont Baptist Association voted to disfellow the First Baptist Church in early April. Pastor Valerie Gittings had endorsed a local human rights ordinance protecting sexual orientation. In a February statement, she said ""many progressive Christians reject outright the idea that homosexual behavior is a violation of God's law."" Google's annual developers conference, ""i/o 2018,"" started May 8and many posted on Twitter that attendees were being encouraged to wear ""pronoun stickers,"" SFGate.com noted. ABC 7 reporter Matt Keller tweeted a photo of a station at the conference check-in with stickers reading ""they,"" ""him"" and ""her"" and a sign reading, ""We care about your pronouns. Add a sticker to your badge to share with others which ones you prefer."" Pronoun stickers are becoming increasingly common at conferences to foster inclusiveness and reduce instances of misgendering. Pittsburgh City Paper recently profiled Jarrell Brackett, who will become the city's first openly gay professional boxer when he steps into the ring May 25. In part, Brackett said, ""I really want to be that guy that every other guy is compared to. Be the first openly gay boxer? Great. I'm in! I'm proud of that. I want my community to be proud of that."" He added, ""I am a black, gay, left-handed male who went to private schools and grew up to be happy. ... God didn't create us to make money, he made us to serve him and to enjoy our lives to the fullest. That's what I'm doing."" Philadelphia Pride has announced the names for its grand marshal paneland, for the first year ever, it's introducing a couple to the mix, Instinct Magazine noted. The couple gaining the inaugural honor are Dante Austin and Robert ""Tito"" Valdez. Austin is the LGBT liaison to the sherriff's office and Valdez is an assistant city solicitor in the child welfare department. A California student says she was told to cover up her LGBTQ T-shirt at school, according to LGBTQ Nation. Eighth-grader Andria Zavala ( of Clark Intermediate School in Clovis, California ) said that she was sent to the principal's office when a guidance counselor saw her wearing a white T-shirt that said ""Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Questioning"" on it. Zavala has said that other students are allowed to wear clothes with logos and beliefs written on them. A woman in St. Michael, Alaska, is accused of ordering the rape of a man who failed to pay his drug debt to her, LGBTQ Nation reported. Julia Haworth, 30, is facing charges stemming from an assault that occurred in April 2017, when prosecutors say she promised Austin Matthias, 24, a bottle of alcohol in exchange for raping a man. Matthias was indicted last June on two counts of first-degree sexual assault, and Haworth was indicted on one count of solicitation of sexual assault and one count of first-degree sexual assault. Town & Country magazine is apologizing after Monica Lewinsky said she was disinvited from its annual social change summit because former President Bill Clinton was attending, CNN noted. Lewinsky had posted cryptically on Twitter Wednesday, ""dear world: please don't invite me to an event ( esp one about social change ) and —then after i've accepted— uninvite me because bill clinton then decided to attend/was invited."" At the event, Clinton introduced March for Our Lives panelists, including Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students Emma GonzÃ�lez and Delaney Turr, at the magazine's fifth Philanthropy Summit held at the Hearst Tower in New York City. Oliver North, the new head of the National Rifle Association, has a controversial past as the central figure in the 1980s Iran-Contra affairbut he has also courted controversy for his views on LGBT rights, the Washington Blade noted. In a speech at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference, North, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, compared fighting against gay rights to the abolitionists' fight during the 19th century against slavery. Years after President Obama signed repeal of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" North also engaged in veiled criticism of openly gay service.

Pinewood junior Haley Welch gave the Hammond goal keepers fits during Pinewood’s 6-2 victory over Hammond in the SCISA AAA semifinals. Naturally, the spirits were in contrast at the end of SCISA Class AAA Girls Soccer championship game May 12. Senior captain Hannah Rodgers and goal keeper Anna King played their final game for the Pinewood Girls Soccer Team May 12. Pinewood junior Haley Welch gave the Hammond goal keepers fits during Pinewood’s 6-2 victory over Hammond in the SCISA AAA semifinals. Naturally, the spirits were in contrast at the end of SCISA Class AAA Girls Soccer championship game May 12. The Pinewood Prep Girls Soccer Team failed to bring home the prize this year, but Panther coach Gail Osborne plans to return to the state finals next season. Pinewood (18-4) fell 3-1 to Porter-Gaud (16-5-3) in the SCISA Class AAA championship game May 12 at Cardinal Newman School in Columbia. Junior Haley Welch had the sole Panther goal. Senior Anna King turned in a strong performance as Pinewood’s goal keeper, but still suffered the loss. “I credit my team for working their socks off,” Osborne said. “They gave it everything they had, but we just didn’t have enough. Porter scored a freak goal to go up 3-1. I mean Mari (Gillum) is a great player, but that was just a freak goal and it made it hard to come back. After that we just couldn’t find an answer, but I’m proud of our girls for getting to the final for the first time since 2015.” Pinewood only has two seniors on the team, King and Hannah Rodgers. Both were key players this season, but the Panthers should remain strong next year. “We started two eighth-graders and several freshmen today so as a team you tell them to watch this moment,” Osborne said. “While it hurts we want them to keep it in the back of their mind because we want to be back for sure next year.” Pinewood stands to return 17 varsity lettermen next season including juniors Welch, Haley Baker, Grace Powell, Abbey Martichenko, Emma Robertson and Meaghan Veale. Osborne, who has been the Pinewood coach since 2004, has led the Panthers to four state championships and now to two state runner-up seasons. Pinewood struck first in this year’s title game. Welch won a ball and charged up the middle. She broke left and shot right, sending a ball past the Cyclone keeper at the 28:52 mark of the first half. Porter made some pushes to tie later in the half, but couldn’t find the net. At the 31:25 mark, the Cyclones sent a high, promising shot toward the Panther goal, but King made her first of several leaping saves in the match and the Pinewood lead held until halftime. Porter-Gaud earned a series of corner kicks early in the second half and Sara Burns Gibson took advantage of one by sending the ball into the net to tie the game. At the 48:52 mark, Abi Stock scored the go-ahead goal for the Cyclones. At the 55:40 mark, Gillum took a direct kick from way out and sent a booming shot just above King’s reach for the 3-1 Cyclone lead. The match bore little resemblance to Pinewood’s semi-final match May 9 that saw the Panthers defeat Hammond 6-2 to advance to the title game. Welch was only a goal shy of having a pair of hat tricks against the Skyhawks and Rodgers added a second-half goal for the Panthers. “It’s been a couple of years so we have been hungry for this, especially the kids who have been with me since eighth or ninth grade,” Osborne said following the match. “It’s time. They have worked really hard and they deserve to go to state.” Hammond (10-9) was eliminated with the loss, but fielded a young team this season so just advancing to the state semi-finals shows promise. “For us just to host a game during the first round of the playoffs was huge,” Hammond coach Rafael Marquez said. “That is the first time in school history we have done that and we came here and competed despite having a lot of injuries. We started nine freshman today so the future is bright.” Welch scored her first two goals in the first 12 minutes of the match. With approximately 22 minutes remaining in the first half, a teammate sent a beautiful pass straight up the middle to her and she beat a defender and placed a shot out of the keeper’s reach and into the right side of the net for her hat trick. Roughly two minutes later, Martichenko spotted Welch in front of the net and passed to her and the junior quickly scored another goal for a 4-0 Panther lead. Hammond finally managed to answer a score after Kate Oliver sent a free kick into the box. A player put a body on the ball and Graham Jenkins got the rebound and sent a shot into the net. Less than a minute later, Powell lobbed a free kick deep into Hammond territory. After one bounce, Welch gained possession and charged into the box to score her fifth goal of the half. Approximately 12 minutes into the second half, Powell got another assist on Rodgers’ goal that put the Panthers ahead 6-1. “I liked our teamwork tonight,” Osborne said. “We have really worked hard this year to not play as individuals, but to play as a team. From the beginning we have said that it doesn’t matter who puts the ball in the back of the net, it is really everyone’s goal.” Hammond’s other goal came late in the match. Keeper/forward Briggs Edmunds scored the Skyhawk goal off a cross. There's an election coming up on Nov. 6.

Michael,Gordon,899,http://interlochenpublicradio.org/post/composer-and-leading-avant-garde-guitarist-glenn-branca-has-died-69,"Glenn Branca, the guitarist and composer who merged noise and art music and who influenced a generation of New York artists, has died at age 69. His wife, the guitarist Reg Bloor, posted an announcement of his death on Monday afternoon, writing that Branca had died in his sleep of throat cancer on May 13. Branca's work oversaturated audiences and players alike with walls of sheer sound, and he experimented with the harmonic series and alternative tunings to visceral effect. Uptown critics didn't always understand what Branca was after; in 1983, a New York Times reviewer called one of his symphonies ""dull, brutal murk ... diffuse and shapeless."" Regardless, his music influenced a huge range of other artists, and his collaborators included David Bowie, Kronos Quartet and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. Born Oct. 6, 1948, in Harrisburg, Pa., Branca first fell in love with musicals as a kid, but as a teenager was intrigued by both The Kinks and Olivier Messiaen — a dichotomy that could well describe the rest of his musical life. He began experimenting with reel-to-reel machines to create his own musique concrète (""concrete music"") — collages of manipulated tape. He began attending college at York College, but soon moved to Boston to study theater at Emerson College, and then lived briefly in London. Upon returning to Boston in 1974, he founded an experimental theater group called Bastard Theater, where he focused on creating sound works to be performed live by the actors and musicians. In 1976, Branca moved to New York, where he remained for the rest of his life. There, he began collaborating with Jeffrey Lohn a project that built upon his theater experimentation before becoming the band Theoretical Girls, in which the pair were later joined by drummer Wharton Tiers and keyboardist Margaret De Wys. Theoretical Girls began playing at the intersection of the worlds of visual art, performance art, rock and punk, at foundational New York City performance venues like Franklin Furnace and the Kitchen as well rock clubs like CBGB, and became an integral force in the city's fertile No Wave scene. By the late '70s, Branca had turned his attention more fully to the guitar, both solo and in deafening ensembles, in works that eventually encompassed a huge range of sonics and textures. His output included symphonies and chamber pieces for both electric and acoustic ensembles, an opera, a ballet, works for chorus, pieces for newly created instruments — like harmonic guitars with three bridges and percussive ""mallet guitars"" — and massively scaled works for electric guitars, including 2001's Symphony No. 13 (Hallucination City), scored for 100 instruments. In a 2016 interview with Pitchfork, Branca succinctly described the many musical streams that fed him beyond classical and rock. ""I had been listening to people like Penderecki and Messiaen and Ligeti as well as the jazz music of the '60s, especially what Miles was doing,"" he said. ""And I wanted to take all of that and put it into the context of rock music. There were a lot of people doing new and interesting things with rock. But I wanted to take it farther than that. My real influence was punk. I must have listened to the first Patti Smith album 300 times."" In turn — deliberately or not — Branca helped nourish a new generation of musicians, both punk-inflected and arty-classical. Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo played in Branca's guitar ensemble in the early '80s, and Branca put out Sonic Youth's earliest albums, Sonic Youth and Confusion Is Sex, on his own label, Neutral. Notably, he did the same for composer and Bang on a Can co-founder Michael Gordon, releasing The Michael Gordon Philharmonic in 1987. At some level, Branca kept his musical universes divided in his head and in conversation — almost code-switching between the two, as the composer and critic Kyle Gann observed in a 1994 Village Voice interview that was republished in the book Music Downtown: ""Branca keeps his worlds almost schizophrenically separate. To rock critics he'll talk Aerosmith, the Ramones, the Dolls, Henry Cow and Orchestra Luna... With me he uses a different set of references, equally obscure: Kryzsztof Penderecki, Dane Rudhyar, Hans Keyser."" ""I feel grateful to have been able to live and work with such an amazing source of ideas and creativity for the past 18 1/2 years,"" Bloor wrote in the post announcing Branca's death. ""His musical output was a fraction of the ideas he had in a given day. His influence on the music world is incalculable. Despite his gruff exterior, he was a deeply caring and fiercely loyal man. We lived in our own little world together. I love him so much. I'm absolutely devastated. He lived a very full life and had no regrets. Thank you to all the fans and all of the musicians whose support made that possible."" View the discussion thread. Matt Marks, a young composer, musician and founding member of the contemporary music ensemble Alarm Will Sound, died suddenly Friday, May 11. The group made an announcement Saturday on Twitter, with no cause of death given. Marks was 38.

Michael,Gordon,899,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article211084859.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 14, 2018 01:43 PM Three-and-a-half years after Doug and Debbie London were executed in their home, the last of the Charlotte gang members linked to the killings have been sent to federal prison for the rest of their lives. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Max Cogburn handed down life sentences to convicted United Blood Nation members Randall ""Foe"" Hankins, Nana ""Ratchet"" Adoma, and Ahkeem ""Lil Keem"" McDonald. Three other gang members linked to the killings already are serving life sentences. Hankins, according to federal prosecutors and the FBI, was a key planner of the gang's October 2014 shootings of the Londons, a Lake Wylie, S.C., couple whose Pineville mattress store had been the target of an attempted robbery by three UBN members that May. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Prosecutors say the Londons were gunned down to keep them from testifying against Adoma and another gang member who had participated in the robbery attempt. A federal jury convicted Hankins of two counts of racketeering murder last year in connection with the Londons' deaths. At the same trial, Adoma and McDonald were convicted of the 2013 execution-style slaying of Kwamne Clyburn, a homeless teenager who was bound and shot seven times with two different weapons in Pressley Road Neighborhood Park. His offense: falsely claiming to be a Blood, which gang members consider a capital offense. Adoma and McDonald also were convicted of gang-related offenses in the London shootings. In all, a dozen UBN members have now been sentenced in the case. Nine pleaded guilty to avoid a trial and already serving sentences from 13 years to life. Jamell Cureton, who ordered the Londons' deaths and helped plan the hit from his Mecklenburg jail cell, along with triggerman Malcolm Hartley both entered guilty pleas to avoid possible death penalties. Cureton also took part in the Clyburn killing, prosecutors say. UBN has become North Carolina's largest and most influential gang, exerting their power from Charlotte-area neighborhoods to prison cell blocks. Two alleged national leaders of UBN remain on trial this week in Charlotte, accused of running an East Coast criminal network from their New York prison cells. The brazen level of violence behind the Londons' deaths sent tremors through both the court system and communities far removed from normal gang activity. UBN members, according to authorities, took on a veritable mantra when discussing their plot against the Londons: ""No witnesses, no case."" “I can’t remember another example of that level of contempt for the law,” veteran prosecutor Anne Tompkins, who served as U.S. Attorney in Charlotte when the couple was killed, said before the first sentencing in the case last year. In this file video from April 22, 2015, law enforcement officials talk about a federal indictment that charges 12 gang members with racketeereing conspiracy. Seven face additional charges, including murder. The United Blood Nation gang has been ti “It took violence to a level I had not seen before, and it was startling. ... It made me very frightened for a lot of people.” Clyburn's death had remained unsolved until the FBI stumbled upon the gang's involvement in the agency's investigation into the Londons' deaths. In gang parlance, Clyburn was killed when he failed a ""DNA check,"" meaning he could not prove gang membership. “We had to roll the (expletive),” McDonald told other gang members after Clyburn’s killing, according to a prosecutor’s courtroom statements. “That s--t ain’t right."" In a Monday email to the Observer, a member of Clyburn's family thanked those who had identified and successfully prosecuted Kwamne Clyburn's killers. ""It has been a long journey ... Justice is being served,"" said the relative who did not want to be identified out of fear for his safety. ""To the defendants, I love you and forgive you. I don't know why you did what you did, but I don't hate you."" Daniel London, who was downstairs when his parents were killed, said Monday that after a ""long and arduous"" process for his family, ""I feel like we are finally coming to the end."" ""My parents and myself believed and had faith in God,"" London wrote in an email to the Observer. ""We see the destiny of all of this ... resulting in a major gang crackdown and reckoning for many others. ""Thank you to the Department of Justice and all those involved in ensuring that my parents received their due outcome of these proceedings.""
