Bob,Diamond,2040,https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/fintech-investors-and-founders-to-judge-startup-battlefield-africa/,"TechCrunch will soon be returning to Africa to hold its Startup Battlefield competition dedicated to the African continent. The event, in Lagos, Nigeria, on December 11, will showcase the launch of 15 of the hottest startups in Africa onstage for the first time. We’ll also be joined by some of the leading investment firms in the region. The event is now sold out, but keep your eyes on TechCrunch for video of all the panels and the Battlefield competition. Here are just some of the investors and founders who will be judging the startups competing for US$25,000. Olugbenga Agboola is the CEO of Flutterwave, a payments technology company headquartered in San Francisco with operations and offices across Africa and Europe. Prior to co-founding Flutterwave, Olugbenga contributed to the development of fintech solutions at several tech companies and financial institutions such as PayPal and Standard Bank, among others. He is a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits under his belt. He is a software engineer with a Master’s Degree in Information Technology Security and Behavioral Engineering, as well as an MBA. Barbara Iyayi is the chief growth officer and managing director of Africa for Element, which deploys AI-powered mobile biometrics software to develop digital platforms globally. Barbara was part of the founding team of Atlas Mara, a London stock exchange-listed company, co-founded by Bob Diamond, ex-CEO of Barclays Bank, which was the first-ever entity to raise more than $1 billion to invest in, operate and manage financial institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the Regional Lead for M&A and Investments, she led investments into banks and developed the banking platform’s entry into seven countries in Africa. Notably, she led the acquisition and first-ever merger of two banks in Rwanda, to be the leading innovative retail bank — Banque Populaire du Rwanda — and led a $250 million equity investment in Union Bank of Nigeria. Aaron is an early-stage investor, entrepreneur and strategic advisor to both startups as they scale and corporates as they transform to gain agility for disruptive innovation. Over the last five years he has specifically focused on innovation in Africa, working with global brands and entrepreneurs across diverse industries, from financial services to health to mobile to agriculture. As managing director at MEST, he is dedicated to training, investing in and incubating the next generation of global software entrepreneurs in Africa. He manages a portfolio of 30-plus startups spanning fintech, media, e-commerce and agritech. Sam Gichuru is founder and CEO of Nailab, one of Kenya’ s leading business incubators. His contribution in establishing the startup business ecosystem in Kenya, through Nailab, has been significant, and as a result was invited as a key speaker during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, held in Nairobi and officiated by then U.S. President Barack Obama. Sam has been instrumental in propagating the development of a strong and vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it’s through this engagement that he was most recently selected by Jack Ma to lead, through Nailab, the Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a $10 million Initiative that seeks to discover, spotlight and support 10 African entrepreneurs every year for the next 10 years. Olufunbi Falayi is a partner at Passion Incubator, an early-stage technology incubator and accelerator that invests in early-stage startups.

Please turn on JavaScript for the best possible experience. Quick links By Gareth Dennison | 03/12/2018 HOUSE-building is finally expected to start on the site of a notorious estate — 11 years after the old properties were demolished, the council has said. The former Chesterhill area at Thrybergh (pictured) was promised regeneration after the bulldozers arrived in 2008 and attracting developers has proved difficult. There has been criticism that Rotherham Borough Council’s local plan — moving land out of greenbelt — has meant developers’ heads have been turned elsewhere. Work on Chesterhill and nearby Whinney Hill had been expected to begin in 2016 but the scheme from Keepmoat — announced in 2013 — fell through. Rotherham Borough Council has said a procurement exercise to find a new partner will begin before the end of the year. A spokesman added: “These are strategically important sites and will make a significant contribution to the borough’s housing growth target. “The council will ensure that development commences as soon as possible and it is anticipated that work will start during 2019.” It is expected that the sites will accommodate about 240 homes when finally developed. Campaigner Michael Sylvester raised the matter with cabinet members earlier this year — pointing out that RMBC’s website still had the 2016 start date target. He has now been offered a meeting with Jane Davies, head of strategic housing and development, to discuss the efforts being made to find a development partner. Mr Sylvester said: “There are still questions around why the last scheme failed, and what lessons have been learned. “Why did the failure only became public after my questioning at cabinet in May? Why was the 2016 story published if proposals were not at an advanced stage?” Mr Sylvester welcomed the meeting offer — but asked that the invitation be extended to the chairmen of Dalton and Thrybergh parish councils. “They were heavily involved in the failed Keepmoat proposals and have not been kept well informed with regards to the development status,” he added.

Paula,Lunder,2037,https://www.macon.com/news/business/article222523650.html,"December 02, 2018 02:39 PM The Maine College of Art has received a $3 million donation to help pay tuition and plan for its future. MECA President Laura Freid tells the Portland Herald Press the gift from Peter and Paula Lunder through the Lunder Foundation is the largest donation for financial aid in the school's history. The college will use $2.5 million of the donation to pay for tuition for students from low- and middle-income families. The gift is a challenge match and could increase to $6 million. MECA Vice President Matt Goetting says it will allow the school to expand its financial aid program and recruit more students from Maine. Goetting says reducing the debt burden is a nationwide issue.

Andrew,Davis,2034,http://www.wdrb.com/story/39572870/as-ntsb-gets-to-work-mentor-figure-killed-in-plane-crash-remembered,"MEMPHIS, Ind. (WDRB) -- At the Mockingbird Valley Soccer Club, a Saturday night match of youth soccer felt different. ""I think it's still shock,"" said Scott Budnick, the Kentucky Fire Juniors boy's program director. ""I'm still struggling to get my head around it."" Wayne Estopinal, one of the three who died in a Friday plane crash, made the complex possible with lots of money, love and energy. ""You knew you were in the presence of someone with a lot of influence and with a lot of passion,"" said Tim Nowak, the girl's program director. ""He wanted to share the game, most particularly, with the youth, because I think he wanted to share his love of the sport and the culture with the future players of tomorrow,"" added Budnick. Both Nowak and Budnick worked for Estopinal and learned a lot from him. ""Wayne's made me a better coach. There's no doubt about,"" Nowak said. ""He challenged me personally to be better at what I do."" Clark County's coroner has now officially identified 63-year-old Estopinal as one of the three who died in the crash, along with 54-year-old Sandra Johnson and 32-year-old Andrew Davis. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board now has boots on the ground to investigate the crash. ""Typically, what happen is the investigator will arrive on scene and will begin documenting the scene and examining the aircraft. They will be looking for the four parts of the aircraft: that's the nose, two wings, and the tail,"" said Keith Holloway, a spokesperson for the NTSB. Holloway says the investigator will work to recover those bits and pieces quickly, especially evidence that's perishable, in an effort to determine a cause. ""Our goal is to determine what caused it and to prevent it ... possibly prevent it ... from happening again from a safety perspective,"" he said. ""We don't assign blame."" He says no two crashes are the same. Investigators will determine if weather, human error, mechanical issues, or a combination played a part. ""I suspect the investigators should probably be on the scene for the next couple of days,"" he said. Holloway wants anyone who witnessed the crash and has information about it to call authorities or e-mail the NTSB at witness@ntsb.gov. Related stories: Copyright 2018 WDRB Media.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://www.nola.com/news/2018/12/shreveport-woman-among-three-killed-in-indiana-plane-crash-ap.html,"By The Associated Press MEMPHIS, Ind. â Coroners have identified the final two people killed when a small Chicago-bound jet crashed shortly after taking off from a southern Indiana airport. The Clark County coronerâs office said Saturday the crash on Friday (Nov. 30) killed the pilot, 32-year-old Andrew Davis of Sellersburg, Indiana, and 54-year-old passenger Sandra Holland Johnson of Shreveport, Louisiana. Authorities had previously identified the third person killed as 63-year-old Wayne Estopinal from Louisville, Kentucky. He was an architect and a board member of Ball State University. A cause for the crash hasn't been determined. The Federal Aviation Administration says flight plans indicate only three people were on the small plane when it left Clark Regional Airport late Friday morning en route to Chicago's Midway Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Cessna Citation.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/marie-mitchell/,"Marie Mitchell, an associate professor in the Terry College of Business, conducts research that helps organizations promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Where did you earn degrees and what are your current responsibilities at UGA? I have a bachelor’s degree in political science, minoring in English literature, from George Mason University, a master’s degree in human resource management from Rollins College, and a Ph.D. in business administration, specializing in organizational behavior, from the University of Central Florida. I teach a variety of management topics (e.g. negotiations, leadership and human resource management) at all levels—undergraduate, MBA (full-time, professionals and executives) as well as doctoral students. Beyond teaching, my research focuses on social and ethical issues within organizations, such as mistreatment and unethical behavior in the workplace. I work closely with students—mentoring scholarship, sitting on dissertation committees and advising Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities projects. I also enjoy other service-oriented activities, such as being a member of the Terry College Diversity Advisory Council, and serving as the faculty advisor for the UGA Chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management. When did you come to UGA and what brought you here? I joined UGA in 2009 as an assistant professor, coming from the University of Nebraska. I was thrilled to join the Terry College of Business’ department of management, which is filled with smart, productive and friendly colleagues. It was clearly the right fit for me. What are your favorite courses and why? Negotiations is one of my favorite courses to teach. The material is immediately applicable to students, and it is fun to watch them develop over the semester. Many students have followed up with me, seeking advice on how to improve on topics like traversing job offers, organizational conflicts and career development. I also have had students send me updates on successes, negotiating more to their base salary or discussing win-win solutions at work. It makes me proud. Teaching doctoral students is another favorite. My doctoral seminars emphasize theory and methods, and so we engage in lively conversations about how to evaluate published work and developing research ideas. It’s enormously satisfying when students bring their ideas to life in a research publication. Those types of teaching moments are enriching because they make a lasting impact on the students’ lives. Marie Mitchell meets with doctoral students in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) What are some highlights of your career at UGA? I have had a number of highlights in my research, teaching and service. My research has contributed to strides in the management literature by demonstrating the implications of abusive supervision and the causes of unethical work behavior. There are many teaching high points—e.g., each time a student emails a success story, and publishing with Ph.D. students. Teaching recognitions are also meaningful. In 2017, I received the Terry College Outstanding Teacher Award and the Executive MBA Teacher of the Year Award. This year, I was selected to receive the Teaching Excellence Award for the Terry College. Lastly, there are many meaningful roles I have served for the university (e.g., Academic Honesty Panel), Terry College (e.g., Diversity Advisory Board, Special Certificate Programs), and my department (e.g., Society for Human Resource Management Faculty Advisor), as well as serving as an associate editor for the journal Personnel Psychology, where I shape scholarship for the organizational sciences. How do you describe the scope and impact of your research or scholarship to people outside of your field? My research appeals to outsiders because I study deviant, unethical and dark work behaviors. These behaviors can create a lot of dysfunction for organizations, their members and society more generally. As a recent example, I gave interviews on my research that explained why performance pressure motivates workplace cheating behavior. Interviewers understood the impact of the study, given high-profile examples (e.g., Wells Fargo employees opening fraudulent accounts, the Volkswagen emissions scandal). I also relay how costly these behaviors are and highlight how organizations can dissuade employees from engaging in these behaviors and how to promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Organizations and their employees can impact society because, when they act inappropriately, it can send a ripple across society that promotes new laws and regulations and a general sense of distrust in business. Accordingly, outsiders “get” the scope and need for what I study. How does your research or scholarship inspire your teaching, and vice versa? My research on workplace relationships feeds into my course material on cultivating relationships, leadership and performance management. Developing and maintaining strong work relationships are critical for heightening employee performance and effective work environments. My research on ethics is highlighted in every course I teach—ethics is a foundation by which all management topics should align. Likewise, the topics discussed in my courses enrich ideas for my research, fine-tuning the applicability of what I study to practitioners. What do you hope students gain from their classroom experience with you? I am very hopeful that students gain skills, knowledge and abilities that will enrich their lives. Describe your ideal student. The ideal student is curious, engaged, dedicated and coachable. Students who approach their studies with zest and ask critical questions set a high bar in the classroom. However, coachability—the ability to learn and develop—also is needed for success. Being able to identify what works and what can be improved upon is critical for a student to grow and for them to pay it forward by developing others. Favorite place to be/thing to do on campus is… One of my favorite things to do is walk through campus, particularly during the fall. Campus is beautiful. Watching the students hustle to class, play with their dogs, study on the lawn and engage with one another is fun. Marie Mitchell listens to a doctoral student during a meeting in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) Beyond the UGA campus, I like to… I love spending time with my family, and enjoy traveling and cooking. Community/civic involvement includes…. I am actively involved in the academic community outside of UGA, sitting on journal editorial boards, being associate editor at Personnel Psychology and serving in a variety of roles for the Academy of Management. I also give time to the overall UGA community by guest speaking as an ethics expert or providing job negotiation workshops to student groups. Favorite book/movie (and why)? As an undergraduate minor in English literature, one book had a lasting impact: “The Wide Sargasso Sea” by Jean Rhys. This book explains how the crazy wife ends up in the attic in Charlotte Bronte’s novel, “Jane Eyre” (which I also love). There are two key learning moments from it. First, the book provides a cautionary tale of getting caught up in pressures from society and of relationships that can impair a person’s development and freedom. Second, I had to write a paper about this book, comparing it to another. I can’t even remember the name of the other book, and that stood out in my analyses, forcing my teacher to ask me to redo my paper. What sticks with me from that experience is that when you are passionate about something, it shows. Be passionate and interested in what you do. The one UGA experience I will always remember will be… I have had many memorable experiences at UGA. In participating in various graduations, though, I truly enjoyed hearing Alton Brown speak. He was entertaining and funny, while also relaying good takeaways for students. Is there anything else you’d like to add? (Other pertinent information to share) I’m a mom of two—both are UGA students—and a wife of my supportive and loving husband, Chad. Our family also includes our two dogs, who keep us smiling.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/gallery-sec-championship-2018/,"Three unanswered touchdowns from No. 1 Alabama lifted the Crimson Tide past No. 4 Georgia Bulldogs in a 35-28 finish Saturday in the 2018 SEC Championship Game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Bulldogs will represent the Southeastern Conference and play Big 12 runnerup Texas in the Allstate Sugar Bowl scheduled for Jan. 1, 2019, in New Orleans. Kickoff for the game between the fifth-ranked Bulldogs (11-2) and the Big 12 Longhorns (9-4) is scheduled for 8:45 p.m. and be televised on ESPN. This will be the fifth all time meeting between the programs. “It was a tremendous atmosphere, the SEC Championship Game once again is one of the best games of the year,” Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said. “A lot of credit goes to Alabama, they outperformed us in the second half. The game had a lot of momentum swings – up and down, back and forth, which we knew it would. We have a lot of champions on this team and a lot of kids that have a heart of a lion like these two [Jonathan Ledbetter and Jake Fromm at the podium] right here, especially. They lead this team and care about this university and play really hard.” “[The Sugar Bowl] will be an outstanding experience for our coaches, players, and fans,” Smart said. “Most of our coaches and none of our players have had the opportunity of a Sugar Bowl trip and I’m especially proud for our seniors who have worked so hard over the last 12 months. It also presents a great opportunity for our fans who have been so supportive of our team throughout the season.” UGA photographers Andrew Davis Tucker, Peter Frey and Dorothy Kozlowski captured Bulldog Nation supporting the team in the gallery above.

Michael,Gordon,2032,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/environment/article_7da69ba8-f4c2-11e8-b613-0fae15bf505f.html,"Though Louisiana enjoyed a quiet hurricane season — which ended with the turn of the calendar — there was an above-average number of Atlantic storms. Meteorologists kept expecting an El Niño system, the development of particularly warm water in the Pacific Ocean, to form and beat back tropical storm formation in the Atlantic, but it never came, explained state climatologist Barry Keim. Instead, the season became more active toward the end, he continued. That's good news for Louisiana, which normally faces the most danger from hurricanes earlier in the season. Toward the end of the season, more storms are shunted up the East Coast. A hurricane has never made landfall in Louisiana in the month of November, Keim said. Just three storms struck the Gulf Coast in 2018 — Alberto, Gordon and Michael. Gordon came closest to Louisiana, prompting an emergency gear-up that included the mobilization of the National Guard, but it veered east of the state. ""We kind of dodged a bullet there. ... It had almost no effect on Louisiana,"" Keim said. Nevertheless, 2018 was a notable season. For the fourth year in a row, tropical storms formed prior to the official June 1 hurricane season start date, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out. And for the first time in a decade, four storms were active at the same time. The 15 total tropical storms were higher than the average 12. Florence and Michael were the most destructive, ravaging the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle, respectively. Keim expects both names to be retired, as is done with storms that are particularly strong or do significant damage. He emphasized that just because this year was slow doesn't mean 2019 will be as well. ""You just never know,"" Keim said. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!
