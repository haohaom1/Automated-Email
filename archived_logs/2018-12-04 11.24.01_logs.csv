Bob,Diamond,2040,https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/fintech-investors-and-founders-to-judge-startup-battlefield-africa/,"TechCrunch will soon be returning to Africa to hold its Startup Battlefield competition dedicated to the African continent. The event, in Lagos, Nigeria, on December 11, will showcase the launch of 15 of the hottest startups in Africa onstage for the first time. We’ll also be joined by some of the leading investment firms in the region. The event is now sold out, but keep your eyes on TechCrunch for video of all the panels and the Battlefield competition. Here are just some of the investors and founders who will be judging the startups competing for US$25,000. Olugbenga Agboola is the CEO of Flutterwave, a payments technology company headquartered in San Francisco with operations and offices across Africa and Europe. Prior to co-founding Flutterwave, Olugbenga contributed to the development of fintech solutions at several tech companies and financial institutions such as PayPal and Standard Bank, among others. He is a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits under his belt. He is a software engineer with a Master’s Degree in Information Technology Security and Behavioral Engineering, as well as an MBA. Barbara Iyayi is the chief growth officer and managing director of Africa for Element, which deploys AI-powered mobile biometrics software to develop digital platforms globally. Barbara was part of the founding team of Atlas Mara, a London stock exchange-listed company, co-founded by Bob Diamond, ex-CEO of Barclays Bank, which was the first-ever entity to raise more than $1 billion to invest in, operate and manage financial institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the Regional Lead for M&A and Investments, she led investments into banks and developed the banking platform’s entry into seven countries in Africa. Notably, she led the acquisition and first-ever merger of two banks in Rwanda, to be the leading innovative retail bank — Banque Populaire du Rwanda — and led a $250 million equity investment in Union Bank of Nigeria. Aaron is an early-stage investor, entrepreneur and strategic advisor to both startups as they scale and corporates as they transform to gain agility for disruptive innovation. Over the last five years he has specifically focused on innovation in Africa, working with global brands and entrepreneurs across diverse industries, from financial services to health to mobile to agriculture. As managing director at MEST, he is dedicated to training, investing in and incubating the next generation of global software entrepreneurs in Africa. He manages a portfolio of 30-plus startups spanning fintech, media, e-commerce and agritech. Sam Gichuru is founder and CEO of Nailab, one of Kenya’ s leading business incubators. His contribution in establishing the startup business ecosystem in Kenya, through Nailab, has been significant, and as a result was invited as a key speaker during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, held in Nairobi and officiated by then U.S. President Barack Obama. Sam has been instrumental in propagating the development of a strong and vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it’s through this engagement that he was most recently selected by Jack Ma to lead, through Nailab, the Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a $10 million Initiative that seeks to discover, spotlight and support 10 African entrepreneurs every year for the next 10 years. Olufunbi Falayi is a partner at Passion Incubator, an early-stage technology incubator and accelerator that invests in early-stage startups.

Please turn on JavaScript for the best possible experience. Quick links By Gareth Dennison | 03/12/2018 HOUSE-building is finally expected to start on the site of a notorious estate — 11 years after the old properties were demolished, the council has said. The former Chesterhill area at Thrybergh (pictured) was promised regeneration after the bulldozers arrived in 2008 and attracting developers has proved difficult. There has been criticism that Rotherham Borough Council’s local plan — moving land out of greenbelt — has meant developers’ heads have been turned elsewhere. Work on Chesterhill and nearby Whinney Hill had been expected to begin in 2016 but the scheme from Keepmoat — announced in 2013 — fell through. Rotherham Borough Council has said a procurement exercise to find a new partner will begin before the end of the year. A spokesman added: “These are strategically important sites and will make a significant contribution to the borough’s housing growth target. “The council will ensure that development commences as soon as possible and it is anticipated that work will start during 2019.” It is expected that the sites will accommodate about 240 homes when finally developed. Campaigner Michael Sylvester raised the matter with cabinet members earlier this year — pointing out that RMBC’s website still had the 2016 start date target. He has now been offered a meeting with Jane Davies, head of strategic housing and development, to discuss the efforts being made to find a development partner. Mr Sylvester said: “There are still questions around why the last scheme failed, and what lessons have been learned. “Why did the failure only became public after my questioning at cabinet in May? Why was the 2016 story published if proposals were not at an advanced stage?” Mr Sylvester welcomed the meeting offer — but asked that the invitation be extended to the chairmen of Dalton and Thrybergh parish councils. “They were heavily involved in the failed Keepmoat proposals and have not been kept well informed with regards to the development status,” he added.

Paula,Lunder,2037,https://www.macon.com/news/business/article222523650.html,"December 02, 2018 02:39 PM The Maine College of Art has received a $3 million donation to help pay tuition and plan for its future. MECA President Laura Freid tells the Portland Herald Press the gift from Peter and Paula Lunder through the Lunder Foundation is the largest donation for financial aid in the school's history. The college will use $2.5 million of the donation to pay for tuition for students from low- and middle-income families. The gift is a challenge match and could increase to $6 million. MECA Vice President Matt Goetting says it will allow the school to expand its financial aid program and recruit more students from Maine. Goetting says reducing the debt burden is a nationwide issue.

Andrew,Davis,2034,http://www.wdrb.com/story/39572870/as-ntsb-gets-to-work-mentor-figure-killed-in-plane-crash-remembered,"MEMPHIS, Ind. (WDRB) -- At the Mockingbird Valley Soccer Club, a Saturday night match of youth soccer felt different. ""I think it's still shock,"" said Scott Budnick, the Kentucky Fire Juniors boy's program director. ""I'm still struggling to get my head around it."" Wayne Estopinal, one of the three who died in a Friday plane crash, made the complex possible with lots of money, love and energy. ""You knew you were in the presence of someone with a lot of influence and with a lot of passion,"" said Tim Nowak, the girl's program director. ""He wanted to share the game, most particularly, with the youth, because I think he wanted to share his love of the sport and the culture with the future players of tomorrow,"" added Budnick. Both Nowak and Budnick worked for Estopinal and learned a lot from him. ""Wayne's made me a better coach. There's no doubt about,"" Nowak said. ""He challenged me personally to be better at what I do."" Clark County's coroner has now officially identified 63-year-old Estopinal as one of the three who died in the crash, along with 54-year-old Sandra Johnson and 32-year-old Andrew Davis. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board now has boots on the ground to investigate the crash. ""Typically, what happen is the investigator will arrive on scene and will begin documenting the scene and examining the aircraft. They will be looking for the four parts of the aircraft: that's the nose, two wings, and the tail,"" said Keith Holloway, a spokesperson for the NTSB. Holloway says the investigator will work to recover those bits and pieces quickly, especially evidence that's perishable, in an effort to determine a cause. ""Our goal is to determine what caused it and to prevent it ... possibly prevent it ... from happening again from a safety perspective,"" he said. ""We don't assign blame."" He says no two crashes are the same. Investigators will determine if weather, human error, mechanical issues, or a combination played a part. ""I suspect the investigators should probably be on the scene for the next couple of days,"" he said. Holloway wants anyone who witnessed the crash and has information about it to call authorities or e-mail the NTSB at witness@ntsb.gov. Related stories: Copyright 2018 WDRB Media.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://www.nola.com/news/2018/12/shreveport-woman-among-three-killed-in-indiana-plane-crash-ap.html,"By The Associated Press MEMPHIS, Ind. â Coroners have identified the final two people killed when a small Chicago-bound jet crashed shortly after taking off from a southern Indiana airport. The Clark County coronerâs office said Saturday the crash on Friday (Nov. 30) killed the pilot, 32-year-old Andrew Davis of Sellersburg, Indiana, and 54-year-old passenger Sandra Holland Johnson of Shreveport, Louisiana. Authorities had previously identified the third person killed as 63-year-old Wayne Estopinal from Louisville, Kentucky. He was an architect and a board member of Ball State University. A cause for the crash hasn't been determined. The Federal Aviation Administration says flight plans indicate only three people were on the small plane when it left Clark Regional Airport late Friday morning en route to Chicago's Midway Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Cessna Citation.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/marie-mitchell/,"Marie Mitchell, an associate professor in the Terry College of Business, conducts research that helps organizations promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Where did you earn degrees and what are your current responsibilities at UGA? I have a bachelor’s degree in political science, minoring in English literature, from George Mason University, a master’s degree in human resource management from Rollins College, and a Ph.D. in business administration, specializing in organizational behavior, from the University of Central Florida. I teach a variety of management topics (e.g. negotiations, leadership and human resource management) at all levels—undergraduate, MBA (full-time, professionals and executives) as well as doctoral students. Beyond teaching, my research focuses on social and ethical issues within organizations, such as mistreatment and unethical behavior in the workplace. I work closely with students—mentoring scholarship, sitting on dissertation committees and advising Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities projects. I also enjoy other service-oriented activities, such as being a member of the Terry College Diversity Advisory Council, and serving as the faculty advisor for the UGA Chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management. When did you come to UGA and what brought you here? I joined UGA in 2009 as an assistant professor, coming from the University of Nebraska. I was thrilled to join the Terry College of Business’ department of management, which is filled with smart, productive and friendly colleagues. It was clearly the right fit for me. What are your favorite courses and why? Negotiations is one of my favorite courses to teach. The material is immediately applicable to students, and it is fun to watch them develop over the semester. Many students have followed up with me, seeking advice on how to improve on topics like traversing job offers, organizational conflicts and career development. I also have had students send me updates on successes, negotiating more to their base salary or discussing win-win solutions at work. It makes me proud. Teaching doctoral students is another favorite. My doctoral seminars emphasize theory and methods, and so we engage in lively conversations about how to evaluate published work and developing research ideas. It’s enormously satisfying when students bring their ideas to life in a research publication. Those types of teaching moments are enriching because they make a lasting impact on the students’ lives. Marie Mitchell meets with doctoral students in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) What are some highlights of your career at UGA? I have had a number of highlights in my research, teaching and service. My research has contributed to strides in the management literature by demonstrating the implications of abusive supervision and the causes of unethical work behavior. There are many teaching high points—e.g., each time a student emails a success story, and publishing with Ph.D. students. Teaching recognitions are also meaningful. In 2017, I received the Terry College Outstanding Teacher Award and the Executive MBA Teacher of the Year Award. This year, I was selected to receive the Teaching Excellence Award for the Terry College. Lastly, there are many meaningful roles I have served for the university (e.g., Academic Honesty Panel), Terry College (e.g., Diversity Advisory Board, Special Certificate Programs), and my department (e.g., Society for Human Resource Management Faculty Advisor), as well as serving as an associate editor for the journal Personnel Psychology, where I shape scholarship for the organizational sciences. How do you describe the scope and impact of your research or scholarship to people outside of your field? My research appeals to outsiders because I study deviant, unethical and dark work behaviors. These behaviors can create a lot of dysfunction for organizations, their members and society more generally. As a recent example, I gave interviews on my research that explained why performance pressure motivates workplace cheating behavior. Interviewers understood the impact of the study, given high-profile examples (e.g., Wells Fargo employees opening fraudulent accounts, the Volkswagen emissions scandal). I also relay how costly these behaviors are and highlight how organizations can dissuade employees from engaging in these behaviors and how to promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Organizations and their employees can impact society because, when they act inappropriately, it can send a ripple across society that promotes new laws and regulations and a general sense of distrust in business. Accordingly, outsiders “get” the scope and need for what I study. How does your research or scholarship inspire your teaching, and vice versa? My research on workplace relationships feeds into my course material on cultivating relationships, leadership and performance management. Developing and maintaining strong work relationships are critical for heightening employee performance and effective work environments. My research on ethics is highlighted in every course I teach—ethics is a foundation by which all management topics should align. Likewise, the topics discussed in my courses enrich ideas for my research, fine-tuning the applicability of what I study to practitioners. What do you hope students gain from their classroom experience with you? I am very hopeful that students gain skills, knowledge and abilities that will enrich their lives. Describe your ideal student. The ideal student is curious, engaged, dedicated and coachable. Students who approach their studies with zest and ask critical questions set a high bar in the classroom. However, coachability—the ability to learn and develop—also is needed for success. Being able to identify what works and what can be improved upon is critical for a student to grow and for them to pay it forward by developing others. Favorite place to be/thing to do on campus is… One of my favorite things to do is walk through campus, particularly during the fall. Campus is beautiful. Watching the students hustle to class, play with their dogs, study on the lawn and engage with one another is fun. Marie Mitchell listens to a doctoral student during a meeting in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) Beyond the UGA campus, I like to… I love spending time with my family, and enjoy traveling and cooking. Community/civic involvement includes…. I am actively involved in the academic community outside of UGA, sitting on journal editorial boards, being associate editor at Personnel Psychology and serving in a variety of roles for the Academy of Management. I also give time to the overall UGA community by guest speaking as an ethics expert or providing job negotiation workshops to student groups. Favorite book/movie (and why)? As an undergraduate minor in English literature, one book had a lasting impact: “The Wide Sargasso Sea” by Jean Rhys. This book explains how the crazy wife ends up in the attic in Charlotte Bronte’s novel, “Jane Eyre” (which I also love). There are two key learning moments from it. First, the book provides a cautionary tale of getting caught up in pressures from society and of relationships that can impair a person’s development and freedom. Second, I had to write a paper about this book, comparing it to another. I can’t even remember the name of the other book, and that stood out in my analyses, forcing my teacher to ask me to redo my paper. What sticks with me from that experience is that when you are passionate about something, it shows. Be passionate and interested in what you do. The one UGA experience I will always remember will be… I have had many memorable experiences at UGA. In participating in various graduations, though, I truly enjoyed hearing Alton Brown speak. He was entertaining and funny, while also relaying good takeaways for students. Is there anything else you’d like to add? (Other pertinent information to share) I’m a mom of two—both are UGA students—and a wife of my supportive and loving husband, Chad. Our family also includes our two dogs, who keep us smiling.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/gallery-sec-championship-2018/,"Three unanswered touchdowns from No. 1 Alabama lifted the Crimson Tide past No. 4 Georgia Bulldogs in a 35-28 finish Saturday in the 2018 SEC Championship Game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Bulldogs will represent the Southeastern Conference and play Big 12 runnerup Texas in the Allstate Sugar Bowl scheduled for Jan. 1, 2019, in New Orleans. Kickoff for the game between the fifth-ranked Bulldogs (11-2) and the Big 12 Longhorns (9-4) is scheduled for 8:45 p.m. and be televised on ESPN. This will be the fifth all time meeting between the programs. “It was a tremendous atmosphere, the SEC Championship Game once again is one of the best games of the year,” Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said. “A lot of credit goes to Alabama, they outperformed us in the second half. The game had a lot of momentum swings – up and down, back and forth, which we knew it would. We have a lot of champions on this team and a lot of kids that have a heart of a lion like these two [Jonathan Ledbetter and Jake Fromm at the podium] right here, especially. They lead this team and care about this university and play really hard.” “[The Sugar Bowl] will be an outstanding experience for our coaches, players, and fans,” Smart said. “Most of our coaches and none of our players have had the opportunity of a Sugar Bowl trip and I’m especially proud for our seniors who have worked so hard over the last 12 months. It also presents a great opportunity for our fans who have been so supportive of our team throughout the season.” UGA photographers Andrew Davis Tucker, Peter Frey and Dorothy Kozlowski captured Bulldog Nation supporting the team in the gallery above.

Michael,Gordon,2032,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/environment/article_7da69ba8-f4c2-11e8-b613-0fae15bf505f.html,"Though Louisiana enjoyed a quiet hurricane season — which ended with the turn of the calendar — there was an above-average number of Atlantic storms. Meteorologists kept expecting an El Niño system, the development of particularly warm water in the Pacific Ocean, to form and beat back tropical storm formation in the Atlantic, but it never came, explained state climatologist Barry Keim. Instead, the season became more active toward the end, he continued. That's good news for Louisiana, which normally faces the most danger from hurricanes earlier in the season. Toward the end of the season, more storms are shunted up the East Coast. A hurricane has never made landfall in Louisiana in the month of November, Keim said. Just three storms struck the Gulf Coast in 2018 — Alberto, Gordon and Michael. Gordon came closest to Louisiana, prompting an emergency gear-up that included the mobilization of the National Guard, but it veered east of the state. ""We kind of dodged a bullet there. ... It had almost no effect on Louisiana,"" Keim said. Nevertheless, 2018 was a notable season. For the fourth year in a row, tropical storms formed prior to the official June 1 hurricane season start date, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out. And for the first time in a decade, four storms were active at the same time. The 15 total tropical storms were higher than the average 12. Florence and Michael were the most destructive, ravaging the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle, respectively. Keim expects both names to be retired, as is done with storms that are particularly strong or do significant damage. He emphasized that just because this year was slow doesn't mean 2019 will be as well. ""You just never know,"" Keim said. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Joel,Cutler,2031,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20181201/football-joel-cutler-wont-return-as-coach-at-upper-arlington,"Joel Cutler is looking to his future, one that will not include a sixth season as Upper Arlington High School football coach. Cutler led the Golden Bears for almost five full seasons but was placed on administrative leave Oct. 17 while the handling of health and wellness issues for his players was investigated. The school district posted the supplemental contract for his position Nov. 30. Cutler said he contacted the district office earlier in the day and informed them he did not intend to re-apply for next season. “At this point, I’m just focusing on my future and the next chapter of my career,” said Cutler, who did not comment on the investigation. “It’s been a trying situation. I’m very lucky to have a supporting, understanding wife (Elaine) and two wonderful sons (T.J. and Zack) and great family and friends. I’m very grateful for any and all support I’ve received throughout the whole process.” According to district director of communications Karen Truett, Cutler notified the district Nov. 30 that he was not going to re-apply for the job. “Coach Cutler does not intend to apply for the head football (coaching) position in 2019,” athletics director Tony Pusateri said. “We’re just going to go on from here.” UA went 1-1 in Cutler’s absence but lost to Dublin Coffman 17-0 on Oct. 26 to end the regular season and fall short of making the playoffs in Division I, Region 2. The Bears finished 5-5 overall and 3-2 in the OCC-Central Division and placed ninth in the Region 2 computer ratings as the top eight teams qualified for the postseason. Not counting the games he missed this season, Cutler went 29-21 overall and 14-13 in the league at UA. The Bears made the playoffs just once, in 2015, and went 0-11 against their two biggest rivals, Coffman and Hilliard Davidson. Assistant coach Barry Fox led the team in Cutler’s absence. “The whole time I’ve been here, I’ve been blessed with a great group of men, both coaches and players, who always strived to do the right thing,” Cutler said. “I’m pleased with and proud of how they handled the situation.” Cutler will continue to teach physical education at Greensview Elementary School in the UA district. Applicants to succeed Cutler should send a cover letter, résumé and references to Kristy Garrison at kgarrison@uaschools.org by Dec. 8. dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Nov. 30, 2018.(Photo: By Pat McDonogh, Courier Journal)Buy Photo The pilot killed in a small jet crash in Southern Indiana with two others was a beloved husband and father who had only this year joined the architectural firm that owned the plane. Andrew Davis, 32, was taking passengers Wayne Estopinal and Sandra Holland Johnson to Chicago from Clark Regional Airport on Friday when it crashed in a rural area a few miles from the airport. All three died and investigators are still determining what caused the crash. Davis, of Sellersburg, was an associate corporate pilot at TEG Architects, a firm led by Estopinal. The company announced in September that he had joined the firm this year, according to a news release on TEG's website. Sarah Barlowe, his sister, told the Courier Journal that he had started at the beginning of the year. He was married and had two young children, according to a Facebook post by a friend. Related: Indiana jet crash victim Sandra Johnson had zest for life, friends say Around 2 a.m. Saturday, his wife, Erica, posted on Facebook about the crash. Hundreds of people commented on the post with condolences. Please tell me this nightmare is over.... I’m waiting for his never ending flight to land. I’m waiting for our celebration weekend we were going to have. I’m waiting to make more adventures with you. We waited there for you, but you didn’t show. You always show. Time has stopped, my body is numb, my stomach aches, my beautiful cloud is dark. I’m hoping to see Jesus through this all. So many things I don’t understand. Just please come home we miss you!!! — Erica Davis on Facebook Earlier this year Andrew Davis traveled on a mission trip to Salcedo, Dominican Republic, with a group from the New Albany-based Northside Christian Church, according to a post on his Facebook page. Davis was part of a team of 300 people that helped build homes and host sports camps, among other activities. According to a Facebook post by his wife, his project was to help build a house in four days. Sam Thomas, Northside's executive pastor, said Andrew Davis' family has been attending Northside for almost 20 years. In addition to going on the mission trip, he was also involved with the church's college-aged ministry. ""When we found out about this, you could just feel the loss,"" Thomas said. ""He was by all accounts really gregarious and got to know a lot of people very well."" On Sunday, Davis' family and his wife Erica were in attendance. After the service, churchgoers lined up to hug them, hold them and pray with them. His wife Erica's Facebook page is filled with loving pictures and videos of her husband and children and odes to his support. In October, she wrote: ""He brings balance to my life, what more could I ask for. He is a rare kind."" And in September: ""I'll fly with you till the ends of the Earth."" Read this: A normal takeoff then silence. What air traffic heard before plane crashed Davis graduated from Indiana State University with a degree in professional aviation flight technology and aerospace administration. Previously, he was a lead captain and corporate pilot at Soin International and Muncie Aviation Co., according to TEG. He was taking Estopinal — an influential local figure who helped design University of Louisville sports facilities and bring Louisville City FC to the city — and Johnson to Chicago's Midway International Airport from Clark County Regional Airport. The plane, which was based in Clark County, never made it. Some six minutes after taking off, the plane turned back for the airport shortly before crashing near Memphis, Indiana. There were no survivors. It still isn't clear why the plane went down. Air traffic control chatter around the time of the crash appears to show a normal takeoff for the Cessna from Clark County Regional Airport. A few minutes later, though, a Louisville air controller is heard asking the plane to call back. Only silence followed.

Background: Indiana plane crash kills 3, including LouCity founder Wayne Estopinal More: Pilot of crashed Indiana jet also worked for Wayne Estopinal's firm The Chicago-bound jet lost contact with air traffic controllers and tried to return to the Clark Regional Airport just before it crashed in a wooded area around 11:30 a.m., authorities said. There were no survivors. It is not yet clear how the plane went down. Investigators worked through the night and were still on the scene Saturday afternoon combing through what was left of the plane.

The three victims worked for TEG Architects, where Estopinal was the president. His company owned the jet.

Andrew,Davis,2030,https://www.gazetteseries.co.uk/news/17269505.yate-and-sodbury-scooter-club-makes-huge-donation-to-hospital/,"Dursley 6°c Yate and Chipping Sodbury Scooter Club have been thanked by the Bristol Children’s Hospital after donating £1000 to the facility over the last two years. The club, which has been running for just over three years, was started by Yate residents Kevin Milford and Andrew Davis. Originally starting with just the pair of them, the group has grown to have over 150 members on their Facebook page and regularly have 15-30 scooters attending monthly meetings. Existing members of the group range from 5 to 75-year-olds, with enthusiasts being able to show off their classic, vintage scooters to one another. In October this year the club held their 2nd annual charity soul night, this gave members and guests a chance to enjoy classics from the 60’s and 70’s. Sponsored by Mark’s Mobile Butchers, the event raised an incredible £650.00 for the hospital, on top of the £350 raise from the original event in 2017. The club are however looking for a new sponsor for next year’s events after every single bit of profit made from the two events was given to the BRCH. Andrew Davis revealed after handing over the cheque for the money that the club would love to see new faces join. “We are a community club that welcomes anyone with an interest in Scooters,” he said. “Everyone is welcome to come along to our monthly meetings and become involved in a very social community. “We attend scooter rallies around the UK and often meet other clubs around the South West.” Anyone wanting more information can find the group on Facebook and Instagram under Yate and Sodbury Scooter Club Lydia McGivern of Above & Beyond said: “Thanks so much to everyone at the Yate and Sodbury Scooter Club for all their amazing fundraising for the second year in a row. “They were really dedicated and have raised an incredible amount for the Play Centre at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. “The funds they have raised will be invaluable to the team at the hospital.""

Andrew,Davis,2030,https://www.broadwayworld.com/chicago/article/Photo-Flash-TheLyric-Opera-of-Chicago-Presents-CENDRILLION-20181130,"The Lyric Opera of Chicago premiere of Jules Massenet's charming fairytale opera Cendrillon (Cinderella) opens Saturday, December 1 at 7:30pm. There are six performances Dec. 1 through Jan. 20 at the Lyric Opera House, 20 N. Wacker Dr., Chicago. Tickets start at $49 for adults and just $20 for children, and are available now at lyricopera.org/Cendrillon or at 312-827-5600. Lyric's presentation of Cendrillon features a fabulous international cast of new and returning artists to portray the colorful characters of this familiar and beloved fairytale. Australian soprano Siobhan Stagg makes her American debut as the titular Cinderella, English mezzo-soprano Alice Coote returns to Lyric in a signature portrayal as the pouting prince whose passions are awakened, and Canadian soprano Marie-Eve Munger (Lyric debut) sings stratospherically high notes as the glamorous and sassy fairy godmother. Cinderella's henpecked father Pandolfe is sung by Australian-born bass-baritone Derek Welton (Lyric debut). American mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Bishop(Lyric debut) portrays the bossy stepmother, while Ryan Opera Center soprano Emily Pogorelc (Lyric debut) and mezzo-soprano Kayleigh Decker play the absurdly funny stepsisters. Members of the Lyric Opera Chorus nearly steal the show with their hilariously exaggerated movements and outlandish costumes, portraying courtiers, servants, and a parade of hopeful princesses. Sir Andrew Davis conducts the Lyric Opera Orchestra in the production he led previously in Barcelona. French director Laurent Pelly (Lyric debut) is also the costume designer, and the whimsically sculptural attire onstage is sure to draw gasps of astonishment and delight. Belgian native Barbara de Limburg (Lyric debut) has created scenery incorporating giant storybook pages. Duane Schuler is lighting designer, Michael Black is chorus master, France-based Laura Scozzi (Lyric debut) is the original choreographer, and French choreographer Karine Girard (Lyric debut) is the revival choreographer. Cendrillon is performed in French with projected English translations.

Steve,Cummings,2028,https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/andrea-tafi-not-listed-dimension-data-roster-2019-despite-rumours-will-join-team-401515,"The 52-year-old says he has found a team to support his Paris-Roubaix return Andrea Tafi Andrea Tafi has not been listed in the 2019 Dimension Data roster despite rumours he would ride for the South African team. Tafi plans to ride Paris-Roubaix next year, 20 years after he took home the coveted cobble trophy. The 52-year-old has registered with the UCI testing pool and says he has found a team to support his ambition. >>> Bradley Wiggins takes full control of Team Wiggins Rumours had circulated that Tafi would join Dimension Data for the 2019 Monument, but the team has denied that. The 2019 rider roster for Dimension Data, published last week, includes Brits Mark Cavendish and Steve Cummings, as well as new signings Enrico Gasparotto and Giacomo Nizzolo, but no Tafi. Head of performance at Dimension Data, Rolf Aldag told Cyclingnews that Tafi will not be riding for the WorldTour team. Aldag said: “He’s not with us, I can guarantee you that.” Tafi won the French cobbled Monument in 1999 as Italian champion, then 32 years old, with Team Mapei. The Tuscan retired in 2005. His last participation, 14 years ago, he placed 42nd racing for Team Saunier Duval. >>> Team Sky unveil 2019 kit Australian Mathew Hayman (Mitchelton-Scott) won the race in 2016 at 37 years old. The oldest winner is Frenchman Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle, who won twice, the second time in 1993 at 38 years old. No one ever retired and returned 20 years later to race, let alone win. Tafi’s former team-mate Paolo Bettini recently spoke publicly to discourage Tafi from riding the cobbled Classic. Bettini said: “To Andrea I say, I hope you don’t race, you need to do something else in your life at 52 years old.” Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

Sara,Burns,2024,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-shooting-city-budget-taxes-1.4925871,"Fredericton council has voted against relying only on a tax increase to cover a $2.1 million budget shortfall partly caused by the shootings of four people in August. Council may also try scaling back or postponing projects such as the Officers' Square revamp, the all-wheel sports plaza, a new performing arts centre and a new swimming pool, said finance committee chair Greg Ericson. ""Everything's on the table,"" Ericson told Information Morning Fredericton. Residents could still see a tax increase alongside budget cuts, but Ericson expected it would be less than the three per cent proposed by staff earlier this month. If councillors can't find enough suitable cuts to pay for the deficit, they may revisit the three per cent increase, which would cost the average Fredericton homeowner $66 a year. According to a Nov. 19 city report, the shooting of two police officers and two civilians will cost the city up to $1.5 million over the next two years, but that's not counting the cost of the regimental funeral and the special investigation. Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were shot death outside a north-side apartment building on Aug. 12. ""The year 2018 has seen some extraordinary events that have had some really serious impacts on the city's budget,"" Ericson said. Ericson said the Officers' Square revamp is likely safer from cuts than other public works projects because of the safety elements involved, including failing infrastructure. A renovated square is also ""part of a larger vision for helping the economic development of the downtown,"" he said. Ericson said the city is trying to stay away from cuts in projects to replace aging infrastructure because if something fails, it is much more expensive to repair. ""There's that renewal portion that's on the table, but we're loath to go at it because that's what offers the ounce-of-prevention-equals-a-pound-of-cure dynamic,"" Ericson said. He said there's no time for public consultation on this issue, so they will have to look back on previous public consultations to create priorities. ""I think what we have to do is consult what we've done for public engagement leading up to this moment and to assess how broad the support is for these projects,"" he said. Ericson said he understands that raising taxes may have an impact on Fredericton residents, especially people with low income, but the shootings were unforeseen. ""We've got a lot of time still in the budget process to make sure that at the end of it, no one can doubt our thoroughness and know how much time and attention we've put into trying to avoid a tax increase.""

Michael,Gordon,2023,https://www.theage.com.au/national/a-welcome-chance-to-strengthen-australian-journalism-20181129-p50j8t.html,"Billionaires are becoming increasingly strategic in their philanthropy. They are not only giving to the poor but also looking for ways to deliver long-term change in our society. Frank Lowy blazed a trail when he endowed his foreign policy think tank, as did Andrew Forrest when he endowed a fund to fight global slavery. Judith Neilson – a Sydney-based property billionaire and art-gallery owner – set a new precedent on Monday by pledging $100 million for ‘‘targeted funding and education’’ to ‘‘strengthen Australian journalism and help restore faith in its central role in a healthy democracy”. Billionaire Judith Neilson has pledged $100 million to further the cause of journalism.Credit:Janie Barrett The Age welcomes the initiative, which is obviously close to our hearts, and wants to highlight what might be required to maximise the impact of this generous fund. The entry of not-for-profit organisations into journalism is not new. In Europe and the US, many news organisations operate as not-for-profits. Some web-based news organisations are financed by donations and bequests. Australia already has a huge not-for-profit news organisation called the ABC, and various think tanks and journalism faculties also popularise research via online sites such as The Conversation. It sounds easy to make good journalism but it is actually hard. And expensive. The challenge is not just to produce information but to package it and focus it so that it has an impact on society and brings about concrete change. This is something we aim for every day. Ms Neilson has indicated her institute will start by encouraging reporting on Asia. The Age is right there and maintains correspondents in Jakarta and Beijing. If the Neilson Institute is to make a difference, it must think how to complement, rather than simply reproduce, what other foreign correspondents already produce. The Australian media did a fine job covering the drama of the cave rescue in Thailand, without help. The Age argues that the institute’s focus should be stories that have a measurable impact on Australia’s relations with the region, but the money must also be directed to the stories that take a long time to report and require costly travel outside the big cities. Offering journalists, including Age journalists, help in that task could be invaluable, although we have been managing well without it. The freshly launched Michael Gordon Fellowship will also help journalists cover social interest stories in Australia that may not be reported on without extra funding. If the institute promotes journalism, it will quickly discover that everything it does will be political. The Age strives for evidence-based, impartial public-interest journalism but still comes under attack from all sides of politics. The institute must have a board that ignores these jibes, but it will be able to do so only if it steers away from the flood of opinion and promotes real investigative journalism. As for-profit news organisations have cut budgets, coverage of some topics has been stretched thin. Journalism on Indigenous and rural affairs could do with help, and there is a need for forensic, time-consuming investigations into business. If the institute produces its own journalism, it should complement what we already do. It can help the whole journalism world, too, by offering resources and infrastructure such as public databases so we can push the boundaries further. Copyright © 2018

James,Crook,2022,https://www.pendletoday.co.uk/sport/more-sport/trawden-athletics-club-youngsters-steal-the-show-1-9467949,"Some of the best runners in the country converged on Liverpool on Saturday with places in the British Athletics team for next month’s European Cross Country Championships in Holland up for grabs. And again it was the youngsters from Trawden AC who stole the show. Stan Stephenson was second in the Under 11 boys’ race, with Harry Smith sixth and Harry Jordan 25th; Joss Waiting, Eve Hartley and Isabel Holt ran well in the Under 11s girls’ event; Abigail Stratton, Amelia Dugdale and Ellie Singleton were the pick of the Under 15s’ girls, with Harry Beechey giving a strong performance in the Under 15s’ boys, and Jasmine Aherne was the pick of the Under 17s girls. In the men’s race, Jamie Osborne, Adrian Blackledge, David Howard, John McDonald, Chris O’Brien and Allan Boult were the leading Trawden runners with Katie Lomas, Dawn Tibbs, Julie Townson, Caroline Fleming, Jenny McAndrew and Jen Townson putting in strong team runs in the ladies’ race. One of the most eagerly-anticipated events of the running calendar followed on Sunday with the Lee Mills Fell Relay at Stacksteads. The testing 10.7km route sees teams of four running in relay format. Kevin Salter, Mark Storey, Paul Redman and David Fort were 18th team, with Jamie McIlvenny, Craig Storozuk, Adam Wallwork and James Crook 20th. Shaun Heys, Martin Greenwood and Kevin Fenton-Clough were 38th and there were also good performances from the ladies teams – Claire Storozuk, Lucy Brown, Emily O’Connor and Vic Rogan, and Tracy Parkinson, Karen Windle, Elaine Corcoran and Liz Allison. Also on Sunday, the Kong Mini Mountain Marathon series concluded with a four-hour race in Derbyshire with Mick Dobson and Kerrie-Anne Bretherton winning the mixed veteran 40 category, to earn a series win. Fionnuala Swan and Fiona Hall were fifth, to earn them a seventh in the series. Saturday saw the Wesham 10k with David Lord claiming 32nd and the V55 prize and Robert Smith making a welcome return to racing, and on Sunday Stephanie McArdle-Watson put in a strong performance in the Wilmslow 10k. Saturday also saw more than 60 Trawden runners in parkrun action - the majority at Pendle, where Adam Holda was second and Isabel Hartley first lady and the furthest afield being Linda Ensby and Graham Denney at the Western Springs event in New Zealand. ©2018 JPIMedia Ltd.All rights reserved.
