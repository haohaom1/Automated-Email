Returns as of 11/14/2018 Shares of Opko Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) soared 19.1% higher as of 11:26 a.m. EST on Monday. The healthcare company topped analysts' expectations with its third-quarter results, announced after the market closed on Friday. Opko also again defended itself and CEO Phillip Frost against fraud allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September. Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate was that Opko would lose $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Instead, the company posted a net loss of $27.7 million, or $0.05 per share. This was a marked improvement from the prior-year period loss of $35.9 million, or $0.06 per share. Image source: Getty Images. However, Opko's bottom-line improvement didn't come from tremendous gains on the top line. The company's revenue increased only 1.5% year over year to $249.8 million. Opko's better-than-expected Q3 net loss stemmed primarily from spending cuts, particularly in selling, general, and administrative expenses. While beating Wall Street estimates is a good thing, the reality is that Opko can't use spending cuts to generate improvement indefinitely. Although the company continues to see incremental prescription growth for Rayaldee, sales for the secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug still aren't anywhere close to where the company needs them to be. Opko's statements during the company's Q3 conference call didn't provide any new details on the SEC fraud allegations. Steve Rubin, Opko Health's executive vice president-administration, said that the company is working with advisors to respond to the allegations. The charges of fraud against Opko Health and Phillip Frost came at a point where it seemed the company was beginning to turn things around. Opko's Q3 results reflected some improvement, but it wasn't enough to convincingly show that the company is coming back in a strong way. And it's still too soon to know what will happen with the SEC allegations. It's possible that Opko will successfully defend itself against the SEC. It's also possible that Rayaldee and other products will generate solid revenue growth for the company over time. For now, though, there are still too many questions to make Opko Health stock a good pick for most investors. Keith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The benchmark TA-35 index turned down 1% in the minutes after 5 P.M. on the news and closed down nearly 0.6% for the day at 1,694.32 points. The TA-125 index lost 0.6% to 1,480.69 on turnover of 1.29 billion shekels ($350 million). Bank shares were big losers: Hapoalim declined 1.55% to close at 26.01, Leumi 1.5% to 24.31 and Israel Discount down 1.3% to 12.92. TowerJazz dropped 4.2% to 53.70, extending a month of declines that has seen its share price plunge 27%. Gilat Satellite fell 8.6% to 35.97 after it revised 2018 revenue projections to as low as $265 million from as high as $305 million. Kamada added 1.7% to end at 20.27. Its net loss widened more than tenfold year on year in the third quarter but it said it expected to meet its 2018 projections. (Eran Azran) Trading suspended in bonds of U.S. property developer Brookland Trading in Brookland Upreal bonds was suspended on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Monday after the New York-based property company called a meeting of bondholders for Tuesday. S&P Maalot added Brookland to its credit watch list with a “negative” outlook. The developments came after TheMarker reported that the company would need to reschedule debt. Israeli investors hold about 150 million shekels ($40.7 million) in Brookland bonds, whose prices dropped as much as 5% to lift their yield to junk levels of 30% before trading was suspended. Brookland’s problems appear to stem from its failure to sell assets as it had planned in order to boost its cash position. The company, controlled by Israel Boaz Gilad, was among the first of a wave of U.S. property companies to sell bonds in Tel Aviv, issuing two series in 2014 and 2015. The company declined Monday to comment beyond its official TASE statements.

The email address you have provided is already registered. Bezeq, Israel’s largest telecommunications company, took a step forward Monday in its long-awaited plan to merge its Pelephone, Yes and Bezeq International units to help it compete more effectively. The company said Moti Elmaliach was stepping down as CEO of Bezeq International, clearing the way for Ran Guron to take his job. The CEO of Pelephone, Bezeq’s cellular unit, Guron has already taken on the role as CEO of Yes, the satellite television unit. Taking on the Bezeq International job will give the three units a single CEO as a preliminary step to a full merger. Meanwhile, TheMarker has learned that Ilan Segal, now Pelephone’s marketing chief, will be named head of marketing for all three subsidiaries and report to Guron. Bezeq is merging the three units amid delays in regulatory approval to merge the three into Bezeq itself to create a seamless management and operational structure. Bezeq shares ended up 1% at 4.47 shekels ($1.21). (Nati Tucker) Opko Health shares gyrate amid concerns over cash situation Opko Health shares went on a roller-coaster ride on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange over the last two days amid worries about its cash situation. The Miami-based health care holding company reported Friday that it burned through $22 million in cash during the third quarter, leaving it with just $44 million. That compares with $194 million in cash at the end of 2015. A day before the quarterly report was issued, Opko raised more than $150 million, mostly from controlling shareholder Phillip Frost, who bought $70 million of a $92.5 million share offering and agreed to provide the company with a $60 million credit line. The five-year credit line carries an interest rate of 10%. Without the cash infusion, many investors worried that Opko would not have had the money to continue operations for the next 12 months. Opko shares, which fell 10.6% Sunday, ended up 5.9% in Tel Aviv on Monday at 13.23 shekels ($3.59).

Sep 20, 2018 @ 1:03 pm By Bruce Kelly It's time for Dr. Phillip Frost to resign as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., the home of 4,300 retail brokers and financial advisers. The risk to Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation, as well as to the four independent broker-dealers it controls, is simply too great for Dr. Frost to continue his association with the brokerage. All brokerage firms are required to have a minimum level of liquid assets, or net capital, to remain in business and meet their financial obligations. A broker-dealer's reputation is almost an intangible sort of net capital; if it is less than sterling, the reputational capital can drain out of the firm, sometimes overnight. Clients get nervous or complain, and advisers start looking around to jump to a new broker-dealer. That's why Dr. Frost, who owns close to 36% of the company's stock, must go. Dr. Frost, who has a medical degree, is an octogenerian whose past investments have mostly been in the pharmaceutical arena. On September 7, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dr. Frost and nine other individuals for allegedly participating in ""long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock."" The SEC's complaint illustrates in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off the ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges. Dr. Frost's involvement in the alleged scheme poses tremendous risk to Ladenburg's reputation and brand. The market clearly believes that there is new risk associated with Ladenburg Thalmann. The company's stock price has cratered since September 7, the day the SEC released its complaint. It opened that day at $3.43 per share before falling 15% for the day. And the share price has worsened. On Wednesday afternoon, shares were trading at $2.35, down 31.5% since the SEC's complaint. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network Inc. ""The controversy is likely to lead to further fundamental deterioration; financial firms are sensitive to reputational risks,"" according to a post published Tuesday on Seeking Alpha, whose author, Hindenburg Investment Research, is a short seller of Ladenburg Thalmann shares. That means that aptly titled Hindenburg is betting the price of those shares will go down. ""Plus, the worst may not be over; signs point toward possible criminal charges."" ""We think Phil Frost should resign to avoid more reputational damage to the firm,"" according to the article. ""As the investigation and enforcement process continues forward, it is almost assured to create more negative headlines and spook clients."" The Seeking Alpha post also details the amount of leverage on Ladenburg Thalmann's balance sheet and the drag that could present for shareholders. Hindenburg Investment Research is led by Nate Anderson, who describes himself as performing hedge fund due diligence and marketing in his profile on Twitter. Other analysts, including those on Seeking Alpha, have had kinder outlooks on Ladenburg Thalmann in the wake of the SEC's allegations about Dr. Frost. ""If you are convinced that the issues with [Dr. Frost] are not life threatening, (and I do not believe they are), then the baby bonds are definitely worth a look,"" wrote a firm called Rubicon Associates in another Seeking Alpha post. ""Of these, I favor the Ladenburg Thalmann 7.25% notes due 9/30/2028."" Others were also sanguine about Ladenburg's future. ""It is important to note for Ladenburg shareholders that Dr. Frost serves as a non-executive member of the board of directors and does not hold any operational executive position at the company and that, as noted in previously published reports, Ladenburg's business is robust and its financial position is strong, with $390 million in book value and nearly $250 million in cash,"" wrote Alexander Paris, an analyst with Barrington Research, an investment bank that has done business with Ladenburg Thalmann in the past year. ""This opinion piece was published by investors disseminating misleading information to push their own agenda, and we categorically reject its wrongheaded conclusions with respect to Ladenburg's financial strength and stability,"" wrote Ladenburg CEO Richard Lampen in a message to InvestmentNews. ""Ladenburg continues to be one of the most well-capitalized and well-resourced firms in the independent financial services industry."" A spokesman for Dr. Frost, Jamie Tully, did not respond to questions about the future of Dr. Frost at Ladenburg. But in a statement, Dr. Frost wrote: ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives. I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name."" Was the Seeking Alpha post by Hindenburg an example of a short seller trying to take advantage of negative news about a company? It could very well be. What is clear is that Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation must be protected, for the benefit of its advisers and their clients. That means Dr. Frost should leave the company as soon as possible.

1053951,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Phillip Frost is a Miami billionaire and one of 10 people the SEC charged with fraud on September 7th. He is accused of being a part of when the SEC calls a series of ""classic pump and dump schemes"" that generated more than $27 million. Frost is the founder of the pharmaceutical company OPKO Health. The SEC alleges that Frost and nine other investors manipulated the stock prices of three companies for their own gain. Basically, the 10 investors allegedly promoted the companies without admitting that they owned a stake. Then they waited for the stock prices to rise and sold their shares. This meant that the so called retail investors were left holding stock that was nearly worthless. The group is accused of ""brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,"" said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/Getty Images Both Frost and OPKO Heath are named in the suit. The SEC believes that Frost allegedly participated in two of the three pump and dump schemes that earned him about $1.1 million. Frost has a net worth of $3.7 billion. In a statement, OPKO Health said that the SEC did not notify them of their plan to file a lawsuit and said the complaint was riddled with ""serious factual inaccuracies."" The company said that if the SEC had followed its own standard procedures, Frost and OPKO would have happily provided documentation that answered a number of the SEC's questions and cleared Frost and OPKO of the charges. The pump and dump scheme was reportedly spearheaded by South Florida businessman Barry Honig. He is one of the biggest shareholders in the cryptocurrency company Riot Blockchain Inc. The virtual currency company's stock took a nosedive of 24.3% after the news of the fraud charges broke. Riot Blockchain was subpoenaed in April as part of a formal SEC investigation. Honig is believed to be the primary ringleader who asked the other defendants in the case to buy or sell stock, engage in promoting the companies, among other things. Honig allegedly made more than $3.4 million while running the pump and dump scheme. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved"

One of these patents is already the subject of an inter partes review by the Patent Trial and Review Board of the USPTO to determine the patent's validity, and both are the subject of existing litigation against ChromaDex charging it with misuse of its intellectual property. ""While we would not normally issue a statement, and instead prefer to let these matters play out in court, ChromaDex's actions have made it necessary to do so,"" said Elysium Health CEO Eric Marcotulli. ""We have built our growth strategy around scientific research and product development, while ChromaDex has built its around litigation and misrepresentation, which are not new tactics for their leadership."" The press releases issued by Elysium Health in 2018 included announcements that the company had been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for its experimental therapeutic EH301 for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was recognized by the Good Housekeeping Institute for innovation, and had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mayo Clinic and Harvard University to use nicotinamide riboside for dietary supplement applications in the slowing of aging and age-related diseases. During the same period, ChromaDex announced that it had abandoned direct involvement in development of a nicotinamide riboside-based treatment for children afflicted with Cockayne Syndrome so that it could focus on its TruNiagen dietary supplement sales strategy, coopted the results of studies carried out by independent research institutions to promote TruNiagen, and frequently sought to publicize its dispute with Elysium Health and the ongoing litigations, including in direct advertising for TruNiagen. ChromaDex has thus far remained silent on the alleged involvement of several of its major investors and the former co-chairs of its board of directors in a fraudulent ""pump and dump"" scheme detailed in a civil complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2018, and described in an SEC press release entitled ""SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes."" Among those named as defendants, Phillip Frost and Michael Brauser are and historically have been among the largest holders of ChromaDex stock, and Barry Honig was, along with Brauser, co-chair of ChromaDex's board of directors until March 2015 when they abruptly resigned. Current ChromaDex board member Steve Rubin is also an executive and board member of OPKO Health, which invested in ChromaDex in 2012, of which Frost and his affiliates are significant shareholders, and is also named as a defendant in the SEC's lawsuit. ""It is not surprising that the SEC is investigating the alleged unscrupulous conduct of these ChromaDex-affiliated individuals, who have previously represented to us their continuing control over the company,"" said Marcotulli. ""We have reason to believe that ChromaDex's efforts to undermine Elysium Health, including through these baseless lawsuits, is connected to these individuals and their current associates at the company. In deference to the judicial system, we have declined to comment publicly for the last two years and we do not intend to make a habit of commenting on ongoing litigation."" Elysium Health takes intellectual property rights very seriously and respects the intellectual property rights of others. Elysium Health is confident that it does not infringe any valid claim of the patents described in ChromaDex's most recent baseless lawsuit and trusts that the court will arrive at the same conclusion.

1053951,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Menu Source: Shutterstock Now that the biotechnology sector is well on its way to bouncing back after bottoming in May 2018, investors may feel like they missed out. The fears that previously plagued biotech stocks are no longer as big a threat. The government is no longer putting companies hiking drug price in their cross-hairs, at least not for now. This favorable environment should help biotech firms carry out their plans for the rest of the year. So, if you’re interested in getting into biotech stocks, where should you begin? Well, here is a list of seven great options to get you started. OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK) fell by over 20% in the last month after the SEC suspended trading in the stock on Sep. 11. The regulator asked the company to provide information related to the securities lawsuit against OPKO’s Chairman and CEO, Phillip Frost. On Sept. 7, the SEC charged the CEO and others with a stock promotion scheme. Despite this distraction for the company, the value of the business could improve if RAYALDEE, which treats patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism, is a commercial success. The FDA approved the drug, which works by raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lowers parathyroid hormone levels in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the second quarter, prescriptions for the drug rose 36% from Q1. OPKO expanded its sales team to 64 representatives, a move that helped drive that growth. The drug is now available to 83% of the overall insured population. Adoption, reimbursement and growing awareness of the drug through the marketing efforts from the sales team will drive sales higher. Operationally, improving collection yield and cutting the accounts receivable balances and DSO will eventually help the bottom line. Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) lost half its value in 2018. The downtrend started when Roche and Exelixis ended Roche’s Phase 2 MODUL study. This included Exelixis’ COTELLIC (cobimetinib) for patients suffering from CRC or metastatic colorectal cancer. The negative developments will hurt future earnings, which is why the stock continued to fall with no “bottom” in sight. In its second-quarter report, released on Aug. 1, the company reported earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue of $186.1 million, up 88%. Both numbers beat consensus estimates and yet the stock continued falling. EXEL is looking to complement its cabozantinib development activities. Still, management sees healthy growth for this business, even after factoring increased competition. It is developing potential new indications for cabozantinib, be it single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is seeking collaborations with early stage biotech this year and beyond, keeping its financial risks low. Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN), whose shares rallied to $6.99 recently only to pull back, made only $210,000 in revenue in its second quarter. This biotech’s potential lies in its imetelstat drug, which is being tested in two randomized clinical trials. The drug is a potential treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer and also a “maintenance treatment following a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen in patients with NSCLC.” On Sept. 13, GERN stock fell in the double-digits and gave up over 20% gains intraday after markets worried over Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continuing with imetelstat. In its presentation, JNJ appeared more likely to continue, since it mentioned the Myelofibrosis-treating drug as a 2019-2021 potential filing (slide 15). The irrational drop in GERN stock in so short a time may have created an entry point. When JNJ added imetelstat on its compassionate use list and, together with Geron, spent four years planning for its use, chances are good JNJ remains committed to the project. Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FOLD) is not having a good year, after falling by a third from its yearly high. The company won the FDA’s approval for Galafold (migalastat), a drug that treats adult patients with Fabry disease, an inherited disorder. The approval, posted on Aug. 10, sent the stock lower in what could have been a “sell on the news” event. Markets may have shifted their concerns over the launch risks. But Amicus already hired and trained a full launch team. With over 3,000 diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. and Japan and a peak worldwide TAPP (Total Amenable Patient Population) of 4,200–6,000, FOLD stock could recover as revenue from drug sales grows steadily in the years ahead. Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR) recovered from its lows in July, topped around $70 by the start of the month, only to close recently at $58.33. Last month, the company reported revenue of $1.09 million, up sharply from $34.59 million last year. EPS totaled $5.33. These solid numbers should have sent the stock higher but markets may have expected more or, once again, sold on the news. Nektar has an excellent future ahead. Its pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, which studies TLR-78 agonist. Nektar — 255 looks at an IL-15 candidate that stimulates both NK-cells and memory T-cells. At the end of 2019, Nektar will report the first data for NKTR-214. This study will enroll patients who have relapsed to at least two prior lines of therapy but have no more than three prior treatments. That is just one of the studies I mention. Nektar is embarking on the initiation of 20 registrational trials with NKTR-214 and will initiate trials for other targeted therapies and I-O therapies. The company is a strong believer of the molecule as a central therapy in immune-oncology. Wall Street analysts are bullish on NKTR stock. From the four analysts (tracked on Tipranks.com) offering a price target, the average is $92 a share, which would give investors 58% in upside. Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) did not fall big like the other picks but is still stuck in a range and is down 16% year-to-date. Valuations are very compelling as shares trade at a 24 times earnings and 8 times forward earnings. Much of Celgene’s deep future value depends on management accelerating its next innovation cycle. Ozanimod and fedratinib regulatory submissions are on track, so expect at least two blockbusters adding to Celgene’s revenues. The company reported two positive Phase III trials — MEDALIST in MDS and BELIEVE in beta-thalassemia. If approved, patients suffering from chronic anemia have a treatment option. In the second quarter, Celgene reported a 17% year-on-year growth in net product sales. Earnings rose 16% in that period. Management raised its revenue forecast to $15 billion, up from $14.8 billion. It now expects net sales of REVLIMID, a drug treating multiple myeloma, to top $9.7 billion, up from a previous guidance of $9.5 billion. Investors seeking a slow, steady biotech stock should consider Celgene. The round trip from $90 in August to $120, and back to $94 on Sept. 18 should pique investor interests. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY) rose after the European Commission approved ONPATTRO (patisiran), a drug that treats adults afflicted with hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. Investors sold ALNY shares in the last week after the company failed to win the FDA’s support for the cardiac indication. The full manuscript, entitled ‘”Effects of Patisiran, an RNA Interference Therapeutic, on Cardiac Parameters in Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis: an Analysis of the APOLLO Study,” will be published in Circulation. Patients suffering from neuropathy will be prescribed this medicine. The heart block is not a major risk for those taking the drug. With the stock nearly 40% below its yearly high, biotech investors may want to pick up some ALNY stock. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not own any of the shares mentioned in this article.

1053951,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused one of Republican Attorney General candidate Ashley Moody’s financial supporters of manipulating stock markets to make millions for himself and co-conspirators. According to a complaint brought against Barry Honig, he and a ring of South Florida investors orchestrated a classic pump-and-dump scam. Moody campaign officials say they are refunding Honig’s contributions and disassociating from him completely, but the micro cap fraud case draws fresh questions how Moody as attorney general might treat white collar crime should more donors come under scrutiny. Pump and Dump SEC officials say Honig and other investors arranged the discount purchase of stock in three different companies, then engaged in deceitful trading to create the illusion of market activity. The group of investors sold the stock at inflated prices, reaping millions at the expense of duped investors. “As alleged, Honig and his associates engaged in brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “They failed to appreciate, however, the SEC’s resolve to relentlessly pursue and punish participants in micro cap fraud schemes.” According to the SEC, Honig acted as “primary strategist” in the micro cap fraud scheme. The scheme involved at least three unnamed companies, according to the SEC. First, Honig and other investors, including Miami billionaire Phillip Frost in two of the businesses, bought a large amount of stock at a discount by purchasing a shell company, executing a reverse merger or engaging in financing favorable to the company. Then investors sat on the cheap stock while Seeking Alpha blogger John H. Ford, another defendant in the complaint, or another “promoter” wrote misleading articles hyping the stock, the SEC alleged. The ring of investors meanwhile engaged in trades to create a false impression of market activity right before “news” broke in the blogs. The SEC says Honig directed executives at the companies to sign public filings omitting his and other defendants’ ownership in stock or the size of their holdings. Finally, the investors dumped their stock as prices jumped. The SEC complaint says investors made $9.25 million in stock sales from one company, $9.5 million from a second and $8.3 million from a third. Potential for Favoritism All the investors in the scheme — Honig, Frost, John Stetson, Michael Brauser, John R. O’Rourke III and Mark Grossman — live in South Florida, while the company executives facing charges were based in New York at the time of the activity; Ford lives in California. The SEC says the illegal practices took place from 2013 through this year. Only Honig donated to the Friends of Ashley Moody committee. In the past, he has given to congressional campaigns for former Republican U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite and retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, according to Open Secrets. The SEC filed its complaint in federal court in Manhattan, but it involves plenty of financial activity in Florida, and as more details come out, state laws may come into play. The Florida Attorney General’s Office includes a Consumer Protection Division that investigates and litigates civil cases including theft and deceptive trade practices. Officials with the Moody campaign now are distancing themselves from Honig. “Upon learning of the SEC complaint filed against Barry Honig earlier this month, Melanie Bonanno, chair of the Friends of Ashley political committee, started the process to refund his contribution,” said Christina Johnson, a Moody campaign spokeswoman. The refund doesn’t yet show up in the state’s campaign finance database, but the committee shared a copy of the check. Bonanno sent a letter to Honig on Sept. 11, three days after the SEC announced charges: “In light of the pending SEC complaint, enclosed please find a refund of your donation.” But opponents likely won’t make distancing Moody from Honig easy. The Boca Raton businessman had been one of the top 30 donors to Friends of Ashley Moody as of Sept. 7, the last filing deadline. Of course, the potential influence of political donations has caused headaches for the Attorney General’s Office before. Attorney General Pam Bondi suffered withering criticism over a $25,000 donation by the Trump Foundation in 2013 to a political committee supporting Bondi’s candidacy. The donation came as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump and his Trump University of deceptive conduct. Officials at the Attorney General’s office before the donation was made told two newspapers they were looking into the Trump University case, but after the donation, the office said it was not pursuing its own investigation, according to liberal watchdog group CREW. The issue became a national story after Trump launched his presidential bid and Bondi endorsed him. Bondi also endorsed Moody immediately after she launched her candidacy. Democratic opponent Sean Shaw‘s campaign made mention of the Bondi controversy in its own critique of the Friends of Ashley Moody connection to Honig. “America already has its hands full with the amount of corruption coming from the Trump White House,” said Shaw spokesman Michael Starr Hopkins. “Pam Bondi accepted $25,000 to call off the Trump University investigation and it looks like Ashley Moody was willing to be bought for less until she got caught.

1053951,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Miami biotech billionaire and philanthropist Dr. Phillip Frost says he was stunned by the stock trading fraud charges filed against him earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Frost denies the allegations, saying in a statement, they ""are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts."" Frost declined WLRN's invitation for an interview. In an interview with WLRN, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton did not address the charges against Frost, citing ""a longstanding commission policy"" not to comment on enforcement actions. He also refused to discuss Frost's claim that the SEC ""departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” However, Clayton did address the type of stock trading his agency accuses Frost of conducting and the agency's investigative role. Frost made his fortune in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. He is a dermatologist by training and has bought, built and sold companies. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to groups throughout South Florida. He still runs OPKO Health, a publicly traded drug and diagnostic company headquartered in Miami. The SEC accuses Frost of participating in a scheme manipulating the price of low-cost, thinly traded stocks. Nine others are charged along with Frost. They’re accused of buying shares of three companies, touting their business prospects and then selling when the stock prices went up. It’s called a 'pump and dump' scheme. ""Pump and dump is a manipulation scheme that has been around about as long as markets have been around,"" says Clayton. Frost says he remains a long-term investor in both companies included the federal charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission claims Frost made at least $1 million in the trades. Together the scheme allegedly made $27 million dollars for those accused of taking part. Here is an edited excerpt of WLRN's interview with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. WLRN: Explain where the illegal action happens in (a pump and dump trade). If an investor is successful they may want to brag about how successful they are. Is that considered a pump? Clayton: You're raising a very important issue, which is how do you differentiate between legitimate market activity and a scheme. And we try very hard to make sure that when we do bring actions as a commission, that we're not adversely affecting legitimate market activity. What are some of the hallmark signs of a pump and dump that the Securities and Exchange Commission uses as it reviews those kinds of transactions to decipher between what may be illegal activity and what could be legitimate market activity? I'll give you a stark example that the company actually doesn't do anything...or no meaningful business activity or no meaningful change in its business activity despite increasing in value by a substantial amount. What's the threat of these pump and dump schemes? People people use the word confidence a lot. Confidence is critical in our marketplace. To the extent people are doing things that would undermine confidence, it's important to deter them or stop them. I know you won't address the specific charges against Dr. Frost and others that were filed earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company that Frost heads up, OPKO Health, released a statement saying, ""The SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to filing the complaint."" Again, I'm not asking you to address the specifics of the against Dr. Frost, but does the SEC usually tell targets about possible charges before they're filed? It's not appropriate for me to comment. Generally speaking, is there a practice that the commission has in engaging with a person of interest in these types of cases prior to charges being filed? We have a number of policies and procedures in place but I'm not going to comment on a specific one in this context. Would one of those procedures be discussing potential charges? Like I said, I'm not going to comment on specific procedures, but I can tell you that we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we do things in an appropriate manner. Would one of those policies and procedures be the process that OPKO Health describes? Like I said I'm not going to comment. (With) an enforcement action involvving a fairly well-known corporate executive, is that something that you would be made aware of prior to the action being taken? I'm not going to comment on our on our policies and procedures. We handle matters the same regardless of who's involved. That's that's the right way to approach these things."

Or maybe not. The British rider has had a frustrating and winless campaign, but is determined now to use it as a force for change.Related ArticlesCummings: Best way to respond after Worlds snub was to carry onCummings waiting for his chance in Volta a CatalunyaCummings keeping calm in the eye of the stormCummings: I have to fight for my Tour de France spot10 riders who need to save their seasons “It’s good you know, sometimes you need a season like that,” he told Cyclingnews at the Vuelta a España, where he had his Grand Tour fill after missing out on selection for the Tour de France. “You rip everything you’ve been doing apart and it’s an opportunity to change some things and go forward. I think it’s just given me a chance to explore everything really, lots of new ideas. That’s how I see it, anyway.” Cummings had enjoyed a highly successful spell since joining Dimension Data in 2015, and seemed liberated and rejuvenated, even in his late 30’s. He won a stage of the Tour de France in his first year and then added another in a 2016 season that also included wins at Tirreno-Adriatico, Vuelta al Pais Vasco, Criterium du Dauphine, and the overall title at the Tour of Britain. In 2017 he claimed the road race and time trial double at the British national championships and then a stage of the Giro della Toscana later in the year. This year, however, he has no wins and has failed to finish half the races he has started. His programme was altered by the team, and the situation was only compounded by the long injury list at the team. For someone who describes himself as ‘goal-driven’, having to fill gaps at late notice was far from ideal. On top of the Tour de France snub, Cummings was informed last week that he hadn’t been selected for the British team for the upcoming World Championships. He has clashed with British Cycling over selection in the past but this time, though disappointed, he could see it coming. “You think about the Worlds when we won with Cav and that was what I was hoping for – that we could go and someone could win the Worlds and I could be part of that again. It wasn’t like I thought I could win the Worlds or anything like that. Of course, it’s disappointing but it’s the way it is, isn’t it, I just haven’t performed as well as I could have this year, for one reason or another,” Cummings said. “I think the course suits the Yates brothers, I’d say they were favourites and I think the team has to be what’s best to help them. It looks like a really good team. Personally of course it’s disappointing but to see how British cycling has grown and how many riders we have for different roles, that’s really cool. We have super talented riders coming through and everyone there deserves their place. I’m excited to watch and wish everyone well.” Cummings has made it to the end of the Vuelta. He was present in a couple of breakaways but has had a quiet three weeks and was mostly seen in his favoured position at the very rear of the peloton. Rather than trying to salvage something from his trying season in Spain – and at his upcoming outings in the autumn Italian Classics – he is already laying the foundations for the next one. “Doing this Vuelta is almost like starting afresh into next year. I’m looking at everything in my daily routine to try and get back to the level I had before. That’s the goal,” he said. “I think you have to remain open. As soon as you close off to new ideas and new thinking it’s not a good way, so you have to just have to try and remain open and look to improve all the time. Perhaps over time you find certain things that work well for you or did work well for you. Sometimes a bad experience can be a good one because it just forces you to go over everything you’re doing and make some positive changes.” There is no specific area of his regime that Cummings has identified needs changing. His is a global approach, drilling right down as deep as the meaning of why he gets on his bike every day. “I think I’m just in this mode now of just kind of exploring all the possibilities, the hows and whys. It’s difficult to explain… it’s nothing I haven’t done before, it’s just going over everything, like pulling everything apart, and asking, ‘Why? Why?’. “A lot of it is not really on the bike, it’s off the bike. If you plan like that off the bike, which is how work anyway – I’m very much goal driven – then going on the bike is just part of the process and it’s a lot easier for me to understand what I’m doing. “I’m looking for new ideas, new things, and new thinking. Maybe I don’t change anything or maybe I change small things that make a big difference. I think it’s going back to having a really good solid plan that we’ll deliver, and sort of the desire and commitment to believe in that plan, and then execute it.” 'It's almost like I get more respect from Italian people,' says British rider Dimension Data rider finding form at Spanish stage race Dimension Data rider looking to maximise his remaining time at the top © Immediate Media Company Ltd. 2017 The website is owned and published by Immediate Media Company Limited."

In a statement emailed to reporters Friday afternoon, Frost said he was “stunned” by the SEC’s civil complaint, filed a week ago. He said he believed the SEC had “departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” The SEC declined to comment. The agency alleges that Frost — along with nine other defendants and related companies including Frost’s OPKO Health Inc.—manipulated the share price of multiple small-cap drug and health companies by touting their potential on trading websites without disclosing their ownership positions. The SEC alleges Frost made more than $1 million from the purported scheme. As of Friday morning, Forbes listed Frost’s net worth at $2.4 billion. “The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,” Frost said in his statement. “I invested in two of the entities identified in the complaint. These investments were made because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term shareholder in both companies.” No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. Though the SEC complaint did not name the companies involved, multiple media outlets have reported them as Cocrystal Pharma (formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.), and MabVax Theraputics Holdings. Each trades at less than $5 a share. Frost has been an active investor in small-cap companies for at least a decade, SEC filings show. In January, MabVax disclosed that it was under investigation by the SEC. Trading in Miami-based OPKO, which Frost runs, was halted Sept. 7 and reopened about 1 p.m. Friday. Shares closed down approximately 15 percent Friday, to $3.90. The company has also denied any wrongdoing. Frost remains on the board of directors at the University of Miami, the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science and Coconut Grove Bancshares. “Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives,” Frost said in his statement Friday. “I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand."

""I was stunned by the SEC's lawsuit and deny the allegations it contains against me,"" Frost said. ""It was particularly disturbing that the SEC departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action."" According to the SEC, Frost and nine associates manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies during a five-year period from 2013 to 2018, generating over $27 million. Frost is accused of taking part in two of the three schemes led by Barry Honig. According to the SEC, the group acquired large amounts of stock at deep discounts, then illegally promoted and manipulated trading to boost the price. Once the market price was inflated, the SEC charges the group dumped its shares into the inflated market. The SEC claims Frost, the founder of pharmaceutical company OPKO, and the group reaped millions off unsuspecting investors. ""The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,"" Frost said.

The Frost family donated $35 million to the construction of the science museum, with an additional $10 million for the construction of a planetarium. A museum spokesperson released a statement last week, saying the museum is grateful for the Frosts' generosity. Frost also serves on the board of trustees at the University of Miami.

Vector, which owns most of Douglas Ellimam through a subsidiary, is based in an office building at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami.

1096862,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Photograph by Adam Powell A collection of fire trucks from throughout Caswell, Person, Orange, and Rockingham Counties convened at Prospect Hill Volunteer Fire Department this past weekend for ISO rating testing with the North Carolina Office of Fire Marshal. The ISO rating process is intended not only to help local rural fire districts improve their service, but also to potentially lower homeowner insurance rates in the community. Posted: Tuesday, August 28, 2018 6:27 pm Caswell County undergoes fire ISO inspection testing By Adam Powell Messenger Editor caswellmessenger.com On the morning of Saturday, August 25, a large collection of volunteer firefighters from throughout Caswell County and surrounding communities made their way to the Prospect Hill Fire Department for the first round of testing in the county’s ISO inspection process. Caswell County, despite being entirely made up of non-municipally funded volunteer fire districts, is undergoing the ISO inspection process in order to improve its service to the local community, while also potentially reducing the home insurance liability on local consumers. The ISO inspection process has been two years in the making, as local firefighters countywide have been undergoing specialized training in order to help maximize the ISO rating scores that were tested over the weekend. ISO representative Tom Ramp joined numerous state fire officials at Saturday’s testing. Also on hand were a pair of Caswell County Commissioners - Sterling Carter and Rick McVey - as well as County Manager Bryan Miller. It’s a unique thing to see rural volunteer firemen, without necessarily the pressure that larger municipally-funded fire districts have to maintain certain ISO rating, undergoing training and testing that typically only takes place within larger, more heavily-populated fire districts around the state. It seemed to inspire the state fire inspection officials on hand at Saturday’s testing. “It’s been a long time coming. I’ve got more training hours up here in Caswell County than I’ve got at my own fire department back home,” Vernon Ward, Senior Field Inspector for the North Carolina Office of State Fire Marshal said. “I’ve been up here the last two years, helping get this going. “We’d like to use you all as an example with other counties to do this. Because this really helps us out, and hopefully it helps you all out,” “I want to thank you all a whole lot for getting prepared and doing this as a whole. I think in a month or so, when we come back, I think we’re gonna see good fruit to bear,” Ward added. “Vernon has got a property tax assessment from the county office, but I took care of it for him,” Vernon Massengill of the Yanceyville Fire Department joked. “We do this from Murphy to Manteo,” added Derrick Clouston, Deputy Director of Fire and Rescue Training at OSFM. “And to see this type of dedication in what you’re doing for your community and your county, it’s unreal. On behalf of (N.C. Insurance) Commissioner (Mike) Causey, and the whole Office of the State Fire Marshal, we just want to say thank you for having our staff here. Thank you for the warmth you’ve shown us.” “We’re looking forward to seeing what kind of fruit this bears,” Clouston added. “Because I’m gonna tell you - this is unheard of, what you’re doing. You’re making history. And I want to congratulate you on being willing to step forward and do this is a community. We just want to thank you for all your help and all your hard work.” Fire districts across North Carolina are given insurance ratings from 1 to 9, with 1 being the best possible score. Some of the factors that go into Ratings Inspections includes Emergency Communications, Fire Departments, local water supplies, and community risk reduction. Scores of 1 typically only go to large urban fire districts. In North Carolina, the Charlotte Fire Department holds the only Class 1 ISO rating. Seven fire districts across the state hold a 2 ISO rating - almost all large, densely populated cities such as Raleigh, Durham, and Greensboro, among others. Numerous rural fire districts across the state have an ISO rating of 9 - the lowest possible score. Factors that typically result in a 9 ISO rating include long distances to make service calls, a lack of water supply, and districts only having one or two fire trucks to respond to calls. Although multiple Caswell County fire districts have a rating of 9, the ISO inspection process could move certain local districts up to an ISO rating of 7, which could save homeowners approximately $75 dollars per $100,000 of home value in home insurance premiums. “We’re doing just like we’ve been practicing for two years,” said Massengill to the assembled firemen. “Today’s the day we’ve been working for for a long time. You’ve practiced hard. You’ve done well. We just need to show these guys. Don’t be scared of these (state inspection) guys. I know most of these guys. Most of these guys have been in the position we’re in. They want to help us.” Some of the fire departments that were represented at the ISO inspection included Yanceyville, Prospect Hill, Providence, Roxboro, Yanceyville, Hurdle Mills, Boonsboro, Cherry Grove, Leasburg, Casville, Williamsburg, CEFFO Fire/Rescue, Semora, Pelham, Ruffin, and Milton. Caswell, Orange, Person, and Rockingham Counties were all represented. “I’d like to thank the out-of-county guys. I think we’ve got Williamsburg here. Ruffin is here. Hurdle Mills is here. Yanceyville Road and Roxboro, and CEFFO,” Massengill said. Testing field sites were located at Ridgefield Road, Baldwin Farm, Kimbro Road, and along Old Highway 62. The dump site was at Kimbro Road, while the fill site was along Old Highway 62. Tests included filling trucks, dumping trucks, driving the truck against a running clock, handling hoses, and dealing with suction, among other challenges. Drivers were timed in 200-foot increments, whether they were dumping items or filling up. At the fill site, the timing started when the trucks started moving, prompted by a whistle. When the truck was filled up, the drivers were able to leave. At the dump sites, inspection officials monitored how quickly - and how safely - the firefighters conducted their dumps. Upon leaving Ridgefield Road, there was a dump tank along the Painter Road extension. “We just need you to get rid of your water - most of it - before the next fill site,” Massengill explained. “The biggest thing is safety,” Ward said. “There’s a lot of trucks moving, a lot of stuff going on. So the priority of this whole exercise is safety. You want to get good times. You want to do things correctly. But we’ve got to do it safely.” Fire personnel handling hose and setting up drills during the field site setups were required to be in boots, bunker pants, helmets with chin straps fastened, and gloves. Observers were required to wear traffic vests. “We’ve got to record these times. Of course, the better the time, the better,” Ward continued. “But the biggest thing is being safe.” Massengill thanked the Prospect Hill Fire Department not only for helping set up the ISO inspection by getting everyone together and organizing the trucks, but by providing a meal for the firefighters and the state inspection officials. “I’d like to thank Prospect Hill Fire Department. These guys have been so good as to do this. They got all our trucks lined up,” Massengill said. In approximately a month, the ISO officials will be back in Caswell County to provide data from the testing session, and to let local fire officials know the areas in which they need to improve to get better ISO ratings in the future.

1014074,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"August 27, 2018 The 100,000-square-foot complex is the first College-owned residence downtown since Colby’s move to Mayflower Hill in the mid-20th century Marking an important moment in the history of Colby College and the City of Waterville, the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, housing 200 students, faculty, and staff, opened this month in downtown Waterville. Part of a broader revitalization effort undertaken by the College, city leaders, and local businesspeople and community organizations, the complex is bringing energy to downtown and will ultimately deepen the connection between the Colby community and the broader Waterville community. Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons as night falls over Waterville. Photo: Copyright Trent Bell Photography. “This project grabbed my interest because I was a Waterville boy, and I have always wanted to see Colby and Waterville be more closely tied together,” said Trustee Bill Alfond ’72 who, along with his wife, Joan, made a leadership gift toward the effort. “I see this as a bridge between two things I love—the College and the city.” The student residential experience at Alfond Commons will be centered around a robust civic engagement program that ties the students’ academic pursuits to their work with local organizations. Through their research, coursework, and service, students will participate in efforts of nonprofits and other organizations and contribute expertise and analysis to help the community better understand a range of issues and how to solve complex challenges. “The opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons marks a pivotal moment for Colby and the city it has proudly called home for two centuries,” said President David A. Greene. “This development is a critical step in physically reconnecting the city and the College and helping to support a vibrant Main Street for businesses, residents, and visitors.” Student lounges in the Alfond Commons allow for conversations and space to study. Photo: Copyright Trent Bell Photography Civic Engagement Re-envisioned With the opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, Colby is implementing a new and innovative program for civic engagement and community partnerships. Students residing in the complex are required to participate in civic engagement activity that will connect them to community organizations, enhancing their learning and contributing to the important work of these groups. “We are developing a set of experiences that support our local partners while at the same time preparing our students to be active participants who will create positive change in the communities,” said Dean of the College Karlene Burrell-McRae ’94, who oversees the efforts. “Our hope is that this program can become a national model for civic engagement.” Commitment to Downtown Increasing residential density on Main Street has been a central element of a broad strategy to make Waterville a lively, welcoming place for residents and visitors. In the past three years, Colby has renovated a historic bank building that now houses the global tech company CGI, as well as Portland Pie Co. on the retail level. Colby is currently developing plans for a hotel that will be located at the other end of Main Street and bring more visitors to downtown, and Colby has partnered with Waterville Creates! on a center for contemporary art and film, also on Main Street. “A primary goal of our downtown efforts has been to catalyze outside investment and commercial growth, bringing energy and a sustainable economic model to the city,” said Vice President of Planning Brian Clark. “We expect the opening to add to the incredible momentum we are seeing in Waterville, with new businesses opening, new jobs coming to the city, and overall growth in population and real estate activity.” The Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons is located on the site of a former parking lot, where buildings were demolished during urban renewal. It marks the first new construction on the downtown section of Main Street in more than 50 years. Supporting Community and Commerce The first level of the complex was designed to support community organizations as well as businesses that will complement the existing mix on Main Street and benefit from being located in brand-new retail spaces with up-to-date infrastructure. Camden National Bank will be moving into the southeast corner of the building this fall. Colby’s investments in downtown, which currently total $65 million, have begun to catalyze additional activity. In the past year the downtown area has seen more real estate transactions than in several previous years combined, which is resulting in both new jobs and an increased property tax base.

1015016,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"August 26 2018, 12:01am, The Sunday Times Bob Diamond is braced for a showdown with investors at the annual meeting of his Africa-focused bank. Glass Lewis, the shareholder advisory group, has raised concerns about corporate governance at Atlas Mara, which the former Barclays chief executive co-founded and chairs. It has recommended that investors oppose Diamond’s re-election as chairman this week, arguing that as co-founder he cannot be considered independent. “The UK code states a chair should meet the code’s independence criteria upon appointment,” Glass Lewis said. “We strongly believe the company should appoint a qualified non-executive director, who was also independent on appointment, as chair.” ISS, another influential advisory group, has raised similar concerns but proposed that shareholders abstain from the vote.

1015016,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Atlas Mara, Bob Diamond’s pan African investing vehicle could witness a shake-up as shareholders kick against his position of Chairman. Atlas Mara owns stakes in several banks across Africa including tier two lender Union Bank. Atlas Mara has progressively increased its stake in the tier two lender, and Diamond has never hidden his desire to take control of the bank. Atlas Mara currently has a 48% stake. In a notice sent to the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Atlas Mara, the Pan African banking vehicle set up by Bob Diamond, announced it had acquired an additional 1% stake in tier two lender, Union Bank. This amounts to 280,956,166 shares. There was no disclosure on which investors the shares were bought from. Private equity firm, African Capital Alliance (ACA) also owns a stake in the bank. Union Bank closed at N5.55 on Friday’s trading session on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, unchanged from the prior day. Year to date, the stock is down 28.35% Results for the half year ended June 2018 show gross earnings increased from N72 billion in 2017 from N83 billion in 2018.

1106452,11/14/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"A former Barclays chief executive has joined the Bank of England’s chief economist, Citigroup’s investment chief and other leading bankers in predicting that the sector could soon lose swathes of jobs to technology. Customer services, middle and back office roles − making up 50% of all jobs in the sector − are in line to be replaced entirely by computers, Antony Jenkins has claimed, adding that the workforce would have to become more entrepreneurial. PwC report: AI will create more jobs than it replaces by 2037 AI will be business-critical in five years Why robots should ‘report’ to HR He told the BBC: “We’ve already seen something like 25% of branches close between 2011 and 2015; my expectation is at least another 50% of branches will close over the next five to 10 years. Jenkins, now the chief executive of banking and technologist firm 10x, said: “Similarly I think we’ll see something like a 50% or even greater reduction in the people employed in the industry.” The big four banks (Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and HSBC) currently operate 4,500 branches in the UK, having axed 4,000 in the past decade. If Jenkins’ prediction comes to fruition the UK would, within 10 years, be left with fewer than 2,500 branches of the big four. Also this week the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane forecast on the BBC Today programme that a “fourth industrial revolution” of technological change would lead to a “hollowing” out of the jobs market and may see rising inequality, social tension and many people entering poverty. We needed to learn the lessons of past industrial revolutions that the country was unprepared for, he added. Haldane said: “That hollowing out is going to be potentially on a much greater scale in the future, when we have machines both thinking and doing − replacing both the cognitive and the technical skills of humans.” It was vital, he said, that people were given the training to take advantage of the new jobs that would become available as part of a “new technological wave”. If the country was not to suffer a vast amount of “technological unemployment” jobs focusing on face-to-face interaction and negotiation would need to be created. Citigroup’s investment bank president Jamie Forese this week told the Financial Times that the bank would shed up to half of its technology and investment staff in the next five years. He said: “We’ve got 20,000 operational roles. Over the next five years could you make it 10,000?” Sales and research could be key areas where banks would continue to hire people, Forese forecast, but: “What people are doing, the type of work being done by the human rather than the machine will change.” Many straightforward roles, such as data-entry in banking, would be replaced by automation. John Cryan, former CEO of Deutsche Bank told a conference in Frankfurt last September: “In our banks we have people behaving like robots doing mechanical things − tomorrow we’re going to have robots behaving like people,” he said. “We have to find new ways of employing people and maybe people need to find new ways of spending their time … The truthful answer is we won’t need as many people.” Tara O’Sullivan, chief marketing officer at corporate learning provider Skillsoft, told Personnel Today that the technological revolution would disproportionately affect roles more often carried out by women: “It will be women who bear the brunt of the implementation of these technologies.” She said that estimates by the US-based Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, revealed that twice as many women as men would lose their jobs because women are typically working in areas that are most likely to be automated. “We’re talking jobs like cashiers, office and administrative roles,” she said. O’Sullivan said she’d like employers to recognise it was their responsibility “to reskill and upskill their employees. We cannot allow millions of women to be laid off without offering an alternate career. We need to provide employees with access to learning which they take can take at their own pace, where and when it suits them, and offer them various options of how to learn.” Comment Name (required) Email (will not be published) (required) Website Artificial intelligence (AI) will create as many jobs as it displaces over the next 20 years, but there will be...

By Christopher Thompson and Aimee Donnellan (The opinions expressed are their own.) LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Heard the one about the City grandee atop a British bank run by a Wall Street investment banker? Barclays investors certainly have. They will remember that when UK corporate financier Marcus Agius had a double act with hard-charging Chief Executive Bob Diamond it ended in vaudeville, with both eventually resigning over the Libor scandal. Appointing Rothschild & Co'sNigel Higgins to oversee Chief Executive Jes Staley should end less disastrously. In that light, the appointment looks like a defence of the status quo and, specifically, Staley's investment bank bolstering as European rivals Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse struggle. By contrast, outgoing chair John McFarlane, according to author Philip Augar, repeatedly clashed with former CEO Antony Jenkins over cuts to Barclays sizeable trading operations in particular. Higgins has three things to bear in mind. One is to avoid hubris: when McFarlane joined he predicted a doubling of the share price in three years, when it actually fell by a third. Another is the need to identify a replacement for Staley. Having led a bruising restructuring since joining in late 2015 and fallen foul of whistleblowing rules, it would make sense for the CEO to step down next year or 2020, ideally when Barclays has achieved its 10 percent return on tangible equity target, in line with its cost of capital. The final issue is Barclays shares' persistent discount to book, currently 30 percent. If returns falter, the age-old question about the utility of having a large investment bank will resurface - as will the appeal of activist investor Edward Bramson. If other shareholders suddenly become receptive to his pleas to cull the rainmakers and traders, Higgins will need to use his relationship skills to explain why Barclays' current structure is fit for purpose. On Twitter Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Barclays said on Nov. 1 that Nigel Higgins, the deputy chairman of Rothschild & Co, would succeed John McFarlane as chairman on May 2, 2019 when he retires after serving his four-year term. - Higgins will join Barclays' board as a non-executive director on March 1, 2019 and take over as chairman in May after the annual shareholder meeting, the bank said in a statement. - ""In Nigel Higgins we have found an ideal candidate. He is a hugely respected banker, a strategic thinker, someone with extensive international experience, and he has a strong positive leadership style,"" said Crawford Gillies, who led the process to appoint a successor to McFarlane. - Barclays, one of Britain's biggest banks, has been subject to radical transformation in recent years. - Since taking over as CEO in December 2015, Jes Staley has pushed an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson. - Bramson's Sherborne Investors holds a 5.4 percent stake in the bank and was in talks with Barclays earlier this year about replacing McFarlane as part of an overhaul, according to a news report by Reuters. - Barclays shares rose 1.4 percent to 178 pence as of 0931 GMT on Nov. 2.

Plans are announced for a new building to provide continued care for those with the development disorder. With an oversized tent and golf cart shuttles to the rescue, downpours didn’t stop the Signs of Hope lawn party Aug. 1 at the Falmouth Foreside home of Sheri and Joe Boulos, longtime supporters of Maine Behavioral Healthcare and Spring Harbor Hospital. “The goal this year is to open your hearts and minds to those who, for no fault of their own, have brains that work differently,” said Sheri Boulos, a member of the development committee. Signs of Hope fundraising was crucial in establishing the organization’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders four years ago, led by autism spectrum disorders expert Dr. Matt Siegel and serving individuals through age 21. The grand announcement at this year’s event was that long-term plans include a major expansion to continue care through adulthood in a new building that will be named after Dr. Girard Robinson. “This is a really important personal honor,” said Robinson, adding that it had been a major challenge in his career to expand access to behavioral healthcare. Over the past 40 years, Robinson has worked as chief medical officer at Spring Harbor Hospital, senior vice president for medical and clinical affairs at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Though retired from those roles, he is serving as interim director of substance use disorders at Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “Dr. Robinson was instrumental in bringing our developmental disorders program to Maine, and we have one of the strongest developmental disorders treatment centers in the country,” said Maine Behavioral Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Steve Merz. “But we want to meet the needs of the children who are now adults, so they don’t have to go away for the services they need.” “Tonight is the first step of raising funds for a major expansion to serve adults as well,” Siegel said. With 150 guests, the majority of whom were host committee members, Signs of Hope raised more than $95,000. “This is crucial to our success, helping us to expand services to a population that is underserved, both locally and nationally,” said Linda Durst, chief medical officer for Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Attendees included parents of young adults with autism who used to have to travel to Boston for care, then were able to access services locally when the center was established – until their children aged out. “We still need to do more for adults once they’ve aged out of high school and have graduated,” said Irene Kapothanasis, whose son Gregory is 25. “They’ve done a marvelous job with pre-K through high school. Now, we need to take the next step.” “Maine Behavioral Health has have done a tremendous job of meeting the needs of children and adolescents, but the specialized needs of this population do not vanish after the age of 21,” said Wendi O’Donovan, whose son Ryan is 22. “In fact, as these children or adolescents become adults, their ability to injure themselves or others grows exponentially.” “We need a whole continuum of care,” said Mary Jane Krebs, president of Spring Harbor Hospital and senior vice president for Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “We’re hoping in the next couple of years to have this larger center. It’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen. It’s really needed.” Amy Paradysz is a freelance writer and photographer based in Scarborough.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:20 EST, 18 August 2018 | Updated: 08:48 EST, 19 August 2018 14 View comments Bob Diamond, the former Barclays chief once dubbed the ‘unacceptable face of banking’, has come under attack from investor groups ahead of his new bank’s annual meeting. Two influential shareholder adviser groups have raised red flags over corporate governance issues at London-listed Atlas Mara, a bank Diamond set up to focus on Africa. Glass Lewis has recommended that investors should vote against Diamond’s election as chairman because as a co-founder of the firm he is not considered independent. Under fire: Atlas Mara chief Bob Diamond Fellow adviser group ISS has raised similar concerns and recommends that investors abstain from the vote on August 29. The organisations are urging shareholders to vote against three non-executive directors including Michael Wilkerson, chief executive of Atlas Mara’s largest shareholder Fairfax Africa, arguing that he is not independent. The other two directors are former Bank of Ireland chief executive Richie Boucher and Hisham Ezz Al-Arab, chairman and managing director of the Commercial International Bank of Egypt. Both groups also oppose a motion that would allow Atlas Mara to sell 15 per cent of its shares without first offering them to existing investors. Diamond, who resigned from Barclays at the height of the Libor-rigging scandal in July 2012, founded Atlas Mara in 2013 and has been chairman since October 2016. Atlas Mara’s shares have fallen 80 per cent in five years. In 2010, the then Business Secretary Lord Mandelson criticised Diamond’s rewards at Barclays and described him as the ‘unacceptable face of banking’. Atlas Mara said it takes governance ‘very seriously’, adding that Diamond’s ‘continued leadership at the board is important to delivering on our business plan and performance objectives’.

Recognizing whether CEO incentives are aligned with shareholders is a crucial part of investing. Incentives can be in the form of compensation, which should always be structured in a way that promotes value-creation to shareholders. Today we will assess McVey’s pay and compare this to the company’s performance over the same period, as well as measure it against other US CEOs leading companies of similar size and profitability. Check out our latest analysis for MarketAxess Holdings My analysis shows that McVey may be paid above the appropriate level, based on the size of MKTX and its recent year’s earnings performance. The question to answer now is whether this level of pay is justified. There are most likely other factors I have not account for, but in any case, this outcome should provide a basis for you as shareholders, to question the board’s decision to increase CEO pay in the future.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"At the launch of The Bank that Lived a little: Barclays in the age of the very free market*, Philip Augar, the author, said while this book is about Barclays it is also about the City. Barclays may have got closer than all the others in seeking to be a global bank in the era after Big Bang in 1986, but in essence all the others wanted that too. It was just that they weren’t any good at it and lost fortunes trying to make it work. So you know who you are Barclays did at least live a little. And Augar’s book makes a gripping read, partly by marshalling the facts, but more by interviewing the people who worked there or thereabouts. Understandably many preferred to remain anonymous but without them he could not have told the story. It helped too that he had worked in the City. The launch also featured Bob Diamond, for a long time the CEO of Barclays Capital, and then the chief executive of the whole group, who left amid the Libor scandal. It was as well he was there — it would have been like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark otherwise — but it was also rather odd. Clearly Augar had interviewed him several times, clearly Diamond did not get it all his own way, but they were surprisingly friendly. Perhaps Diamond has mellowed. Perhaps Augar does not like confrontation. Nevertheless he made some good points. He talked about Diamond’s stare, and how no one wanted to be in the room when it happened. Diamond, for his part, thought no CEO likes bad news. He was building the bank and there was no room for passengers. That actually was the crux of it. Diamond says Barclays had great strengths in its brand and credit rating. On top of that he imposed risk management and financing, which became the bank’s competitive strengths at a time when the euro was making European capital markets viable and companies were beginning to embrace bond finance. He also is a hard-driving American, and Barclays was among the best of the bonus payers, albeit only once he had got rid of the majority of Barclays Capital, who he says did not know what they were doing. Augar also says Barclays today is financially sound. So where did it go wrong? Risk management meant more leverage — much more — and that alarmed regulators. But it was only part of it. The financial crisis got all regulators belatedly on their mettle, but Barclays took no money from government and therefore saw no reason to stop doing what it was doing. Indeed because other banks were disabled it was even more gung-ho. When the regulators made it plain that Barclays Capital had to slow down, the bank took no notice. When the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, handed a letter of concern to the chairman of Barclays, Marcus Agius, the latter again took no notice. It was only when the Bank of England intervened that Diamond realised he had to go. The regulators had all had enough. It has to be said that the non-executives were also poor when they could have made a difference. They were in principle big-hitters but in fact in thrall to Diamond. They did not seem to think Barclays had to toe the line and in spite of the crisis they seemed not to have made any connection with the real world either. But perhaps it was ever thus. Martin Taylor (the earlier ceo who gets a good press in the book) rapidly became disillusioned with his earlier generation of non-executives and decided to quit. Diamond says he was a lightning rod for all the banks so he had to resign; he was the last one standing from the class of 2007 financial crisis, but he took it badly to start with. Augar for his part, thinks the Libor scandal, which was not of Diamond’s making, should not have forced him out. But is that really so? John Varley, the chief executive during the financial crisis, is facing fraud charges along with three others over the raising of share capital from Qatar. This was when the bank was determined to avoid government finance and was looking to raise it from elsewhere. Augar naturally cannot discuss this because it is sub judice, but it is unfinished business. And of course there are other scandals with Libor and the foreign exchange market showing how wrong the culture was. And there are billions of pounds of compensation for PPI, the mis-selling of mortgage protection insurance. But the one which rankles to most observers is how business customers were sold interest rate risk hedging products which only protected them from rates going up. When they in fact went down, the customers were left with huge losses and many lost their businesses as a result. It was a Barclays Capital product, and it made the bank a lot of money, although it has since paid out significant sums in compensation. Barclays has betrayed these customers and nothing will get them back. Did Diamond know; did he care, was it collateral damage or was it devil take the hindmost? Augar’s book is good but only those in the City will like it. The rest of the country has a different take on bankers and the way in which relationships went down the tubes while the bank jacked up profits. Barclays may indeed have lived a little, but is a scandal that so many others had to pay the price.

1053951,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"– First half of 2018 marked by management’s successful execution of corporate, clinical and regulatory strategies – – Topline results from Phase 2a study evaluating CC-31244 for ultra-short treatment of HCV expected in Q4 2018 – ATLANTA, GA and BOTHELL, WA, Aug. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: COCP), (“Cocrystal” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing novel antiviral therapeutics that target the replication machinery of hepatitis viruses, influenza viruses and noroviruses, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and provided a corporate update. Recent Corporate Highlights: Dr. Gary Wilcox, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cocrystal, commented, “We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of the first half of the year. Moving forward, our focus for the second half of this year is delivering on the milestones we have set for our clinical programs. We continue to make progress advancing our Phase 2a study of CC-31244 for the ultra-short treatment of HepC and expect to complete patient enrollment this quarter. Importantly, we look forward to announcing topline results from the CC-31244 Phase 2a study in the fourth quarter of this year and believe the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy data will be integral in guiding our next phase of development for our HepC program.” Clinical Programs Overview Pan-Genotypic Non-Nucleoside Inhibitor for the Ultra-short Treatment of Hepatitis C CC-31244, the Company’s lead product in development for HepC, is an investigational, oral, potent, broad-spectrum replication inhibitor called a non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI). It has a high barrier to drug resistance designed and developed using the Company's proprietary structure-based drug discovery technology. It is active against HepC genotypes 1-6 with low level cytotoxicity in multiple cell types. CC-31244 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical study for the ultra-short treatment of HepC-infected individuals. The Phase 2a open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CC-31244 with Epclusa®. Enrolled subjects will self-administer orally 400 mg of CC-31244 and a fixed dose of Epclusa for 14 days. After 14 days the subjects will continue the treatment for another 4 weeks on Epclusa alone. Subjects will be followed up until 24 weeks after the last dose of Epclusa to determine if they have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are SVR at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) and at 24 weeks post-treatment (SVR24), respectively. Expected Near-Term CC-31244 Clinical Program Milestones: Influenza A and Influenza A/B Inhibitors In addition to the Company’s HepC clinical program, Cocrystal is developing novel, broad spectrum influenza antivirals that are specifically designed to be effective against all important A strains of the influenza virus and to have a high barrier to resistance due to the way they target the virus. Cocrystal’s uniquely developed molecules target the influenza polymerase, an essential replication enzyme with several highly conserved regions common to all influenza strains, including pandemic strains. CC-42344, the Company’s lead molecule, binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 has shown excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu® resistant strains, and shows a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. CC-42344 is currently being evaluated in preclinical IND-enabling studies for the treatment of influenza. Further, the Company has identified molecules which have activity against both strain A and Strain B. Several of these have potencies approaching single digit nanomolar. Cocrystal is comparing them with its influenza A inhibitor, CC-42344 and will determine which program(s) to take forward based on data obtained in Q3 and Q4 2018. The Company is considering both oral and inhaled routes of delivery. Expected Near-Term CC-42344 Clinical Program Milestones: Summary of Financial Results for Q2 2018 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $1,343,000 and $2,897,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $1,002,000 and $3,551,000 for the same periods in 2017. Total research and development expenses were approximately $1,119,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with $1,255,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $136,000, or 11%, was due to the reduction in the timing of clinical trials costs. Total research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $1,997,000, compared with $3,325,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $1,328,000 or 40%, was the result of timing of clinical trials activity. On May 3, 2018, Cocrystal announced the closing of an underwritten public offering. The gross proceeds to Cocrystal from this offering were approximately $8.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. On May 14, 2018, the underwriter exercised the option to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover overallotments for additional gross proceeds of $439,000. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, cash provided by financing activities totaled $8,869,000. Our 2018 financing activities included $7,684,000 net proceeds from the sale of common stock, $1,000,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $185,000 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

They introduced in the U.S. Senate the Census Equality Act, which would begin the process of adding questions allowing respondents to identify their sexual orientation and gender identity in both the decennial U.S. Census and the annual American Community Survey. A transgender woman in Michigan said her male cellmate raped her after her request for a single cell went ignored by Allegheny County Jail officials, NewNowNext.com noted. The unnamed alleged victim told a courtroom the assault occurred on July 17, after officials assigned Taylor John Booth, 21, to her cell, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported.

The Miami Beach Gay Pride Board of Directors has unveiled a new branding initiative for the event, including a new name and graphics, a press relase noted. The new name, ""Miami Beach Pride,"" reflects the changing landscape of the LGBTQ+ and allied communities, and better mirrors the inclusiveness of the celebration, said board chair Bruce Horwich. According to Horwich, a new website is in the works ( MiamiBeachPride.com ), as are new designs for advertising, marketing and social media. They will be unveiled in the coming weeks, leading up to the 11th anniversary celebration on April 1-7, 2019. The ACLU of Massachusetts announced that 14 transgender asylum seekers detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico have been released, according to ACLUM.org . The releases follow an effort organized through the ACLU of Massachusetts' Immigrant Protection Project ( IPP ); 18 volunteer lawyers and two local law students in Western Massachusetts last month filed petitions with ICE via a New Mexico legal services organization, demanding the release of 20 transgender women who are seeking asylum and were detained by ICE at the southern U.S. border in May. A Southern California man charged with the murder of a University of Pennsylvania student allegedly carried out the killing because the victim was gay, USA Today reported. A hate-crime sentencing enhancement was being added to a murder charge against 21-year-old Samuel Woodward in the death of 19-year-old sophomore Blaze Bernstein, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said. Woodward, who is from the upscale seaside city of Newport Beach, has pleaded not guilty to the killing; he is being held on $5 million bail and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on Aug. 22. Speaking at the historically Black academic institution Dillard University, potential Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren delivered what she called ""the hard truth about our criminal justice system: It's racist … I mean front to back,"" Time.com noted.

The Human Rights Campaign has installed a rainbow flag window cling at its new DC headquartersand it has brown and black stripes added to be more inclusive of people of color, LGBTQ Nation reported.

The new stripes are in the form of an arrow pointing right ""to show forward movement,"" writer Daniel Quasar has noted. Also, the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) Foundation has released ""Coming Home to Evangelicalism and to Self,"" a guide for LGBTQ evangelical Christians, a press release noted.

Patricia Todd, who was the first openly gay legislator in Alabama. The West Hollywood City Council unanimoously voted Aug. 6 on a proposal calling on the removal of President Trump's star from the Hollywood Walk of Fame, TheWrap noted. The resolution urged the City of Los Angeles and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which oversees the iconic landmark, to remove the star ""due to [Trump's] disturbing treatment of women and other actions."" The staff report also asked the city and the Chamber of Commerce to revisit qualifications for being included in the Walk of Fame, which features 2,500 stars. Washington, D.C., police are seeking help from the public in their investigation into the July 21 murder of gay resident Michael Miller, who was found shot to death in an alley behind the 1600 block of Minnesota Avenue, S.E., and whose car was reported missing at the time of the murder, The Washington Blade noted. The police statement announcing Miller's death did not disclose that he was gay.

Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy will be a keynote speaker at an Atlanta conference focused on equalitydespite his vocal opposition to marriage equality and his company's record of pumping millions of dollars into anti-LGBTQ groups, ProjectQ.us noted.

Andrew Cuomo has offered to officiate the wedding of two gay men who were denied a marriage license by a local town clerk, LGBTQ Nation noted. Thomas Hurd and Dylan Toften from Root, New York, went to the local courthouse expecting to walk away with a marriage license; town clerk Laurel Eriksen, however, rejected their bid to wed. Eriksen ""didn't process the two men's marriage license application because they failed to make an appointment with her, as everyone is required by her office to do,"" Town Attorney Robert Subik told the Daily Gazette. Still, he admitted that her religious beliefs also played a major role in her refusal. Six civil-rights organizationsincluding the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, Lambda Legal, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, National Center for Lesbian Rights and National LGBT Bar Associationfiled an amici brief urging the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the appeal of Charles Rhines, a gay man on death row in South Dakota, according to a press release. According to the filing, new evidence ""suggests that at least some members of the jury accepted the notion that life in prison without parole would be fun for a gay personso much so that they felt it was necessary to impose the death penalty instead. In other words, significant evidence suggests that the jury may have sentenced Mr. Rhines to death based not on the facts of his case, but because he is gay."" The amicus brief is at https://tinyurl.com/y8eslggc. In Pennsylvania, lawyer Joshua Janis told one of his clients that a civil-union divorce was delayed because the judge had ""something against gay people and that straight people's divorces are put first""but it turned out the 37-year-old Chester County lawyer never even filed a divorce proceeding, Philly.com reported. In all, the Chester County District Attorney's Office said, more than 25 victims have come forward, alleging they paid Janis a total of more than $90,000 for work he did not do. Janis was charged with multiple felony counts of theft and related offenses. Rosie O'Donnell criticized the show Morning Joe for allowing Donald Trump a platform to attack her in 2007, calling out co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Willie Geist by name, TheWrap noted. During an appearance on MSNBC with anchor Ari Melber, the former daytime host accused MSNBC and the mainstream media of providing him a regular platform early on and not standing up to his falsehoods. Although O'Donnell has said she barely knows Trump, the feud between the two is legendary, stretching back more than a decade to their days as television hosts The Georgia Log Cabin Republicans voiced support for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, with the group members saying they ""believe marriage equality is here to stay,"" Project Q Atlanta noted. The Human Rights Campaign said Kavanaugh ""would undermine LGBTQ equality,"" including blocking transgender troops from serving and allowing anti-LGBTQ discrimination. More than a dozen gay men were reportedly smeared and possibly outed after being arrested at an adult entertainment store in Florida, PinkNews reported. The 13 men were charged with public exposure and lascivious acts for engaging in sexual activity at the back of the Pleasure Emporium store in Hollywood, Florida, despite the acts being consensual and taking place in private rooms. Police say two undercover officers entered the adult store after receiving tip offs about sex acts in the store. San Diego State University graduate Robert DeKoven has donated $1 million to the school's LGBT programs, The San Diego Union Tribune reported. The money from DeKoven, a legal research and writing professor at California Western School of Law, will go to SDSU's Pride Center and its LGBT Studies Program. He graduated from the campus in 1980 and later helped write the city's Human Dignity Ordinance, which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation regarding employment, housing and lending. Air Force Academy football player Bradley Kim is joining the growing ranks of openly gay academy and college athletes, according to an Instinct Magazine item that cites Outsports. Kim is a safety for the Air Force football team who's recently come out as gay. After telling friends and family, Kim decided to come out publicly through an Instagram post. After he graduates, he'll move on to serve the military; once his service is done, he hopes to pursue a career in music. Alaska Airlines apologized after a flight attendant asked a gay man to give up his seat next to his partner so a straight couple could sit togetheran exchange that put the airline on the defensive as it rebutted claims of discrimination, The New York Times noted. David Cooley, the owner of a West Hollywood gay bar The Abbey, wrote on Facebook that he and his partner had boarded a flight to Los Angeles from New York when a flight attendant asked if Mr. Cooley's partner would move from his seat ""so a couple could sit together."" However, even though the company apologized, it also said what happened was a ""seating error"" and called itself a ""zero-tolerance company that does not support discrimination of any kind."" Former club-kid ringleader and founder Michael Alig has said times are hard for him since being released from prison, Instinct Magazine noted. Alig, 52who spent 17 years in jail for murdering fellow Club Kid Andre ""Angel"" Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debtrevealed that he's homeless after experiencing a major fallout with the owners of an art factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Alig spoke about his ordeal on an episode of Ernie Glam's web series Peeew!, where he's discussed the usage of hotels as his temporary home of sorts. A white police officer in Michigan who says he was taunted by fellow officers when he told them that he was part Black will receive a $65,000 settlement, CNN noted. Sgt. Cleon Browna 19-year veteran with the police department in Hastings, Michigansaid a series of taunts began in 2016 when he took a genetic test through Ancestry.com and learned that he is 18-percent African. His colleagues at the police department were whispering ""Black Lives Matter"" while pumping their fists as they walked past him and his police chief referred to him as ""Kunta""a reference to a character in Alex Haley's novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family and in the Roots TV miniseries. Reactions were mixed following last month's news that Town Housea 40-year-old St. Paul, Minnesota, LGBTQ+ bar and an all-around institutionwould reopen as a soccer bar, CityPages.com noted. Enter R Lounge, a new ""lounge-style"" gay bar that's headed for downtown St. Paul sometime this year. Bar Zia co-owner Travis Phillips is behind the new place, a small spot that will have room for between 60 and 80, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal reported.

1053951,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Highlights: MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL, LTSF) today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very pleased with our robust second quarter 2018 results with continued strong growth in client assets as well as revenues and profitability. Solid execution by our management team, together with stable equity markets and the increasing interest rate environment, contributed to our strong performance. Our focus remains on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.” Richard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All segments of our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter, with revenues of $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from the prior year period, and a 96.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $25.8 million. The continued growth of our nationwide network of approximately 4,300 independent financial advisors reflects our successful recruiting efforts of talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $168.0 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $75.2 billion, up 13.6% and 18.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to further drive margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.” Adoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (""ASC 606""). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Tables 3 and 4). For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $27.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $31.3 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $3.9 million, and increase in net income per basic and diluted common share of $0.02. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $58.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $65.8 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $5.7 million, and decrease in net loss per basic and diluted common share of $0.03. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company's net income as reported is greater than the net income amounts without the adoption of ASC 606 due to the following: 1) the timing of revenue recognized for commissions on future renewals of insurance policies sold is accelerated, as these future commissions represent variable consideration and are required to be estimated, 2) certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer are now capitalized and have historically been recorded as a period expense, and 3) forgivable loans to independent financial advisors are now amortized over the expected useful lives of their relationship period with the Company's subsidiaries; previously these loans were amortized based on their legal terms. For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Second quarter 2018 revenues were $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from revenues of $311.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.7% to $180.4 million from $133.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity, mutual fund and fixed annuities/insurance products, and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased by 8.9% to $122.6 million from $134.6 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the second quarter of 2018 decreased by 9.0% to $11.7 million from $12.9 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to a decrease in capital raising revenue and strategic advisory services. Also, service fees revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.6% to $27.6 million from $20.3 million, primarily due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs. Net income attributable to the Company for the second quarter of 2018 was $9.3 million, as compared to net income attributable to the Company of $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $0.8 million or $0.00 per basic and diluted common share for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $6.6 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The second quarter 2018 results included $4.6 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.4 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $2.2 million of interest expense. The second quarter 2017 results included $0.1 million of income tax benefit, $8.7 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.7 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company had revenues of $687.1 million, a 14.2% increase from revenues of $601.8 million for the comparable 2017 period. Net income attributable to the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $14.8 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $2.3 million in the comparable 2017 period. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $2.3 million or ($0.01) per basic and diluted common share for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $18.2 million or ($0.09) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $6.7 million of income tax expense, $14.6 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.2 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $4.6 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $4.0 million of interest expense. The comparable 2017 results included $1.0 million of income tax benefit, $17.5 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $3.3 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $1.0 million of interest expense. Recurring Revenues For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.1% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment. EBITDA, as adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, an increase of 96.4% from $13.2 million in the comparable 2017 period. EBITDA, as adjusted, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $46.0 million, an increase of 122.8% from $20.6 million for the prior year period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment and our insurance brokerage segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue due in part to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Client Assets At June 30, 2018, total client assets under administration were $168.0 billion, a 13.6% increase from $147.9 billion at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.3 billion, including approximately $4.0 billion participating in our cash sweep programs. Stock Repurchases During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 489,591 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 472,215 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.47. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $59.5 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.15. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,392,170 shares under its current repurchase plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.

Opko Health has completed recruitment of patients in its global phase 3 study of somatrogon (hGH-CTP) in growth hormone deficient children. Subscribe to our email newsletter The company has used multi-dose disposable pen to deliver an investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon. Somatrogon is a new molecular entity, which maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone and can be combined with a C-terminus peptide to expand its half-life. The study is a randomized, open-label and active-controlled study designed to assess a weekly injection of the investigational long-acting human growth hormone product in more than 30 countries. Opko Health recruited around 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD in the study. The patients were randomized1:1 into two arms, including once-weekly somatrogon and once-daily Genotropin. According to the company, the primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks and secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. In addition, the children completing this study are expected to be recruited in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will secure somatrogon. Somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety in a phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon. Opko also noted that the long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is proved the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. The company secured orphan drug designation in the US and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. Opko Health chairman and CEO Dr Phillip Frost said: “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” Opko entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize somatrogon.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 | Updated: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 3 View comments Of all Britain’s High Street banks Barclays is the most intriguing. It has been through regulatory hell and back as a result of the antics of former bosses Bob Diamond and John Varley, and the effort to steer clear of a UK Government bail-out. Its choice of a Gulf rescue a decade ago, involving Qatar, left a stain which is not yet erased. Under the stewardship of former JP Morgan banker Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank. It has been helped by the Lehman legacy, which gave it a strong client base in America, but has not received unqualified support from Whitehall which has preferred Goldman Sachs and US banks for share sales, such as the return of Royal Bank of Scotland to the public markets. Under the stewardship of Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank Latest results suggest that, in spite of having an arm tied behind its back, Barclays is picking up momentum. A strong quarter for equities in the US saw revenues rise 30 per cent, ahead of some Wall Street peers, and the investment bank’s profits were up 17 per cent. That may not be enough to send activist Ed Bramson, agitating for a break-up of the investment bank, scuttling back to his New York burrow. It is not very helpful for the City and financial services that one of the big backers of Bramson’s outfit Sherborne is Aviva Investors. Indeed, Aviva boss Mark Wilson, who maintains Chinese walls with the investment management arm, is understood to have had his ear bent on the subject. The underlying picture at Barclays is starting to look healthy, with pre-tax profits before various conduct and litigation matters up 20 per cent at £3.7billion in the first half and the bank’s capital base strengthening. But, like other UK financials, it is suffering a Brexit draft. Big fund managers by necessity steer clear of uncertainty. Nevertheless, years of regulatory chaos and management upheaval mean that Barclays has been a serial underperformer. That should be an investment opportunity but not just for renegade, short-term investors in search of sugar rush returns. Brexit bonus The reality about the City and Brexit is that it has little to fear but fear itself. The latest scare story about the migration of Deutsche Bank’s derivatives trading to Frankfurt has left UK competitor, the London Stock Exchange, unfazed. New LSE chief executive David Schwimmer notes that its London Clearing House offshoot saw a 34 per cent increase in client clearing of euro-swaps in the last six months and says that support continues to build. City exports hit a record level in 2017 at £59.6billion in 2017, a rise of £3.6billion on the previous year, says official data just published. And inward investment into UK financial technology was the highest among the major industrial countries in the first half of the year, outpacing the United States. The main downer for the City is uncertainty about a future deal in financial services. There were hints from Brussels this week that something around ‘equivalence’ may be possible if the issue of a tribunal to handle disputes can be resolved. The concern among insurers is that, unfavourable weather in Canada notwithstanding, the Square Mile could be putting itself at a disadvantage. Trump is deregulating Wall Street while the UK is over-regulating, making it more expensive and bureaucratic to work in the City. The UK has been good at exploiting tax and regulatory loopholes which is how the Eurodollar market, followed by US investment banks, arrived here. At times it seems that a legalistic Financial Conduct Authority is fighting battles of a decade ago rather than dealing with the opportunities of being the global financial centre. Onwards and upwards. High off the hog A wonderful insight from Stobart of the way that some directors of public companies regard corporate funds as a personal piggy bank. Former boss and significant shareholder Andrew Tinkler may be a brilliant entrepreneur but it came at a heavy price. As we disclose today, court papers show that Tinkler spent £1m on helicopter travel, £51,399 on a horsebox and bought a £50,000 Range Rover mainly for his daughter’s use. How gallant.

1053951,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"MIAMI, Aug. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) has completed enrollment in the Company’s global pivotal Phase 3 study in growth hormone deficient children, evaluating a single weekly injection of its investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon, delivered in a multi-dose disposable pen. The somatrogon Phase 3 trial is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study taking place in over 30 countries. This study enrolled approximately 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who were randomized 1:1 into two arms: once-weekly somatrogon vs once-daily Genotropin®. The primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Children completing this study may enroll in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will receive somatrogon. Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) is a new molecular entity that maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone, fused with a C-terminus peptide to extend its half-life. In a Phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon, somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety. The long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is confirmed in the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. Somatrogon has received Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” OPKO has a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the development and commercialization of somatrogon. Under the agreement, OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing the product. About OPKO Health, Inc.OPKO Health is a diversified healthcare company. In diagnostics, its BioReference Laboratories is the nation's third largest clinical laboratory; GeneDx is a rapidly growing genetic testing business; the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test is used to confirm an elevated PSA to help decide about next steps such as prostate biopsy; Claros® 1 is a point of care diagnostics platform with PSA and testosterone as the most advanced in development.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Published on By Union Bank Nigeria Plc, the Nigerian lender owned by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara Limited, expects to boost lending for the rest of this year after a N64 billion ($177-million) writedown in the first half caused its book to shrink. UBN’s loan book will probably expand 10-12 per cent this year by focusing on consumer goods, agriculture, agri-processing, services such as education and health, transportation, manufacturing and small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Oyinkan Adewale said on a conference call on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg News. It shrank 9 per cent in the first half compared to the end of 2017 because of the write offs. The Lagos-based company’s ratio of non-performing loans to total credit will improve to below 10 per cent for the full year from 10.8 per cent in the first half and 19.8 per cent at the end of 2017, she said. The real estate industry accounted for about 32 per cent of NPLs, the CFO said. Union Bank recorded a profit after tax of N11.5 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2018 as against N9.2 billion posted in 2017, representing a growth of 25 per cent. The lender in filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) also saw profit before tax up 23 per cent to N11.7 billion from N9.5 billion in H1 2017. Gross earnings grew by 16 per cent to N83.3 billion against N72.1 billion in H1 2017, driven by a 10 per cent increase in interest income and 37 per cent increase in non-interest income. Net interest income before impairment was up by 14 per cent to N34.4 billion from N30.1 billion in H1 2017) driven by an improvement in net interest margins from 7.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent on the back of lower cost of funds. Customer deposits grew by 3 per cent to N826.7 billion in contrast to N802.4 billion in Dec 2017; reflecting 66 per cent increase in foreign currency deposits and the optimization of our local currency deposit book towards low-cost deposits. Commenting on the results, Emeka Emuwa, CEO said: “In the first half of the year, we have continued to see positive results from our efficiency and productivity drive. Across all our business lines, we witnessed strong underlying performance, translating into improved earnings. We continue to focus on the recovery of non-performing loans. “With the resolution in Q2 2018 of the large real estate exposure which was impaired in December 2017, the Group NPL ratio is down to 10.8% from 14.9 per cent at 31 March 2018 and 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2017. The Group continues to demonstrate its ability to deliver strong results notwithstanding a competitive and challenging operating environment.” Gross earnings rose by 16 per cent to N83.3 billion from N72 billion in H1 2017, underpinned by improved Net Interest Margins (NIM), robust treasury trading income, recoveries and alternate channel revenues, on the back of increased customer adoption. Emuwa said :”Our Profit Before Tax (PBT) grew by 23 per cent compared to H1 in 2017. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on productivity, leveraging our enhanced platform to deliver best-in-class services to our customers and taking advantage of targeted opportunities across business lines and geographies.” Stakeholders stall new maritime security bill Stock market closes July on positive track Your email address will not be published.

I look forward to helping the program continue to grow, develop and compete within the Big South Conference and Division I.” In their inaugural season, Handshoe coached the Pioneers to an overall record of 10-5 and a conference record of 5-3 to secure a third place finish in the SAC. She was named the SAC Coach of the Year and saw her offense ranked 23rd in the nation with 13.67 goals per game. Tusculum boasted four All-SAC honorees that season, and Handshoe had four players named to the Athletic Director’s Honor Roll. In 2016, Tusculum won a program-record 11 games and advanced to the SAC Tournament semifinal for the first time in program history. That team boasted two All-Conference picks, one All-Tournament team selection and a CoSIDA Academic All-District first team recipient. Then in 2017, the Pioneers went 5-12 against an extremely tough schedule that included four matches against nationally-ranked teams, two of which were ranked in the top-10. Tusculum battled to earn a spot in the SAC Tournament for the third consecutive year, saw three players earn All-SAC recognition and had four players earn IWLCA Academic Honor Roll honors. In 2018, the Pioneers again challenged themselves with a grueling non-conference schedule, facing three nationally ranked teams. The team won a program-record four consecutive SAC games and earned a spot in the conference tournament for the fourth time. Handshoe had two players named to All-SAC teams. Prior to her time at Tusculum, Handshoe was the head coach at Tennessee Wesleyan College for two seasons. During her time with the Bulldogs, Handshoe posted a 17-18 record and led TWC to the National Women's Lacrosse League tournament twice, where they finished fifth and fourth. While at Tennessee Wesleyan, Handshoe served on the National Women's Lacrosse League Membership committee and was the Appalachian Athletic Conference chair for the Coaches committee. Handshoe started her coaching career as a volunteer coach at Presbyterian College in 2011. Prior to that, Handshoe was a four-year starter at PC from 2007-2010. She earned second-team All-National Lacrosse Conference honors in 2010 and was an All-Tournament Team selection in 2009. Handshoe led PC in scoring her junior and senior seasons. In 2010, the Greenville, SC, native led the team in points (49), goals (36), free position goals (8), shots (70), and shots on goal (60). Her junior year, she paced the team with 28 goals and 20 assists for 48 points. During the shortened 2008 season, Handshoe scored 15 goals over four games. In 2007, she was nationally ranked in NCAA Division II for ground balls and caused turnovers. Her freshman year, Handshoe also was a member of the PC women's basketball team. In the summer of 2007, Handshoe played with USA Athletes International in Prague, Czech Republic, in the Prague Cup International Lacrosse Tournament where she helped the team finish second overall. Handshoe was a key player for J.L. Mann High School during her prep years and led the Patriots to the 2006 SCHSL State Championship. She was named the Tournament MVP and the South Carolina Defensive Player of the Year. Handshoe graduated from PC in May of 2010 with a bachelor's degree in history and minors in physical education and athletic coaching.

Pollock Adds Miller, O'Neil to PC Baseball Staff Presbyterian College head baseball coach Elton Pollock has announced the additions of assistant coach Blake Miller and volunteer assistant coach John O’Neill to the program’s coaching staff. ""Blake Miller and John O'Neil will have an immediate and positive impact on our baseball program,"" Pollock said. ""Miller will take over as our pitching coach and assist with recruiting, while O'Neil will take over with as our infield coach and assist with our hitters. Each brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from prior coaching stints at the Division I level. I am extremely excited to have them joining our staff."" Miller comes to PC from Inspiration Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he was the post-graduate program’s head coach and director of player development since August 2017. While there, Miller oversaw all aspects of running the program including player development, recruiting, budgeting and games. Prior to his time at Inspiration Academy, Miller spent four seasons as the pitching coach at the United States Air Force Academy. In his tenure with the Falcons, he helped elevate their pitching staff to new heights and several new school records. The bullpen collected a program-record 381 strikeouts in 2015 and then 385 strikeouts in 2016. The team posted a program-best 4.54 ERA in 2015, its lowest since 1979. That season, the pitching staff also held opposing batters to a .265 average, the lowest since 1974. Miller helped the program improve its win total from 16 in 2013 to 30 in 2016. Miller saw three of his players drafted during his time at the Air Force Academy. Senior closer Ben Yokley struck out 45 batters in 34.0 innings in 2015 and was a 29th round draft pick of the St. Louis Cardinals. Yokley went on to pitch for the Johnson City Cardinals, in the Appalachian League (Class A), during the summer of 2015. Then in 2016, juniors Griffin Jax and Jacob DeVries were both drafted. Jax was coming off a 9-2 season where he posted a school-record 2.05 ERA and was a third round selection (93rd overall) of the Minnesota Twins. The Cleveland Indians took DeVries in the 38th round of the 2016 MLB Amateur Players Draft. Prior to his time with the Air Force, Miller spent two years as the pitching coach at Savannah State. He was a part of the program’s historic 2013 season that included winning the school’s first MEAC Championship and NCAA Regional bid. Along with defeating two top-25 teams that season, the Tigers improved their win total from 19 wins in 2012 to 33 wins in 2013 and lowered their team ERA from 6.15 to 4.93. During the 2013 season, pitcher Kyle McGowin, under the tutelage of Miller, established himself as one of the best pitchers in the nation. McGowin posted a 12-2 record with a 2.02 ERA. He led the MEAC and ranked third nationally with 135 strikeouts that season. McGowin became the first pitcher in school history to be named a Division I First Team All-American (NCBWA) and win the MEAC Pitcher of the Year award. He was a top-10 finalist for the National Pitcher of the Year award and top-30 finalist for the Golden Spikes Award. Following his junior season, McGowin became Savannah State’s first pitcher to be drafted. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected him in the fifth round (157th overall) in the 2013 MLB Amateur Players Draft. In addition to McGowin’s success, Miller had two pitchers named to the MEAC All-Conference Team and saw five members of his pitching staff earn MEAC Conference pitcher-of-the-week honors. In addition, pitcher Rex Davis was named MEAC Freshmen of the Year in 2012. Prior to coaching at Savannah State, Miller was the pitching coach at Emerald High School in Greenwood, 2008-10. While at Emerald, the pitching staff set school records for team ERA in 2009 and again in 2010. Two of Miller’s pitchers were named to the All-Region Team and three players went on to pitch at the collegiate level. Miller holds a bachelors degree in history from Coker College. He graduated in 2007 after playing four years of baseball for the Cobras. A relief pitcher, Miller’s career record was 6-2 and during the 2005 season he set the previous school record for most appearances in a season with 28. Miller’s coaching career began at Coker when he was a student assistant during the 2007 season. O’Neil comes to PC from the University of Tennessee at Martin where he spent one season as an assistant coach. He worked with all infield positions, base runners, assisted with team offense and coached third base while also overseeing team travel, field maintenance and scouting reports. Prior to his time with the Skyhawks, O’Neil previously served as the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a member of the Mid-Eastern Atlantic Conference, where he was responsible for managing all recruiting efforts and overseeing team offense and infielders during the 2017 season. He served as the Hawks’ interim head coach from January 2015 through August 2016, leading the program to their most non-conference wins (nine) in 2016 and most conference wins (14) in 2015. Under his guidance, the program also saw its most wins over a two-year span (32) in over two decades. Not just focused on the field, the Hawks earned consecutive Male Team Scholar Awards for having the department’s highest team GPA and saw 25 MEAC All-Academic honorees. O’Neil also oversaw the program’s improved fundraising campaigns, playing facility, player equipment and community service involvement. O’Neil served as an assistant coach at Maryland Eastern Shore from August 2011 until he assumed the role of interim coach. In 2012, he assisted the Hawks to the most conference wins in program history and a third place finish in the MEAC Tournament. During the summer of 2011, O’Neil coached the Middlesex Rays of the Atlantic Baseball Confederation Collegiate League. He oversaw the expansion team during their first season with the collegiate wooden bat league. During the 2010-11 baseball season, O’Neil served as the top assistant at the University of the Sciences, which is located in Philadelphia, Pa. He helped guide the NCAA Division-II team to its most conference wins, first conference tournament appearance, first conference tournament win, two First Team All-CACC players, a First Team All-Region infielder and two All-Academic honorees. From 2008-10, O’Neil was the lead assistant at Colby-Sawyer College, a NCAA Division-III program located in New London, NH. He assisted the team to a conference tournament appearance while coaching three All-CCC players, an All-Region selection and two All-Academic honorees. O’Neil played collegiately at Colby-Sawyers College from 2004-08, serving as the team’s starting catcher and designated hitter. At the prep level, he received state awards as an infielder at Burrillville High School in Rhode Island. O’Neil graduated in 2008 with a bachelors degree in Exercise and Sport Sciences with a focus on Sport Management. In 2010, he completed his masters in Sport and Recreation Management with a focus in Coaching from New England College. P.O.

The oncology segment is anticipated to witness the fastest growth. According to various sources, more than USD $38.0 Billion is currently spent by the healthcare industry towards preclinical and clinical development of oncology therapy products. Hence, it is anticipated to grow at a lucrative CAGR and contribute over USD $15.0 Billion towards the clinical trials market by 2025. Advances in new treatments have made cancer a hot investing theme over the past 18 months, helping to power fresh interest in biotechnology stocks. Active companies in the markets today include: Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX), OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK), Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG), Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR), BioTime, Inc. (NYSE: BTX). Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX) BREAKING NEWS: Moleculin Biotech, a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oncology drug candidates, all of which are based on license agreements with The University of Texas System on behalf of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, today announced enrollment has opened for a physician-sponsored clinical trial of WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma and brain metastases in adults. ""We have been eagerly awaiting the beginning of this physician sponsored clinical trial,"" commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and CEO of Moleculin. ""The trial, which is now listed on clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, is now open for enrollment. This is our first investigator initiated trial of WP1066 and an important milestone. Given the unique potential of WP1066, we expect more trials to follow."" The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that can be given to patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous brain tumors or melanoma that has spread to the brain. The safety of this drug will also be studied. WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. We believe that targeting this pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"BancABC Bank BancABC, the local unit of African Banking Corporation, is among the top banks that are generating the bulk of their revenue from interest-bearing activities, a survey of financial institutions operating in the country conducted by the Zimbabwe Independent has revealed. By Kuda Chideme In the year ended December 2017, the bank generated interest income of US$35 million to give it a non-interest-income-to-total-net-income ratio of 39%. The ratio signifies the extent to which a bank’s income is reliant on non-core activity earnings. For the purposes of ranking, the lower this ratio is, the better, even though an entity might be realising more income. Other banks’ ratios are relatively much higher. This type of income can be incidental in nature and, hence cannot be relied upon to continue flowing in. When the interest income is compared in relation to operating expenses, the bank is ranked 5th at 83%. This ratio reflects the ability of the entity to meet the operating expenses from the interest earned. Any figure below 100% means that the bank has to either earn some non-interest income to bridge the gap or face the losses that would be incurred. The bank is sitting on US$400 million worth of deposits, accounting for 4,6% of the industry’s US$8,6 billion. In terms of loans, BancABC has 5,34% of the total US$3,4 billion represented issued loans as at 31 December 2017. The bank reported more than US$50 million in deposit capture in Zimbabwe for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the back of a strong agency banking programme. The group said the agency banking programme continues to be a strong driver of customer growth and deposit capture. In line with the growth in use of plastic money in Zimbabwe due to cash shortages, BancABC also upgraded its digital platforms during the financial year. The programme included the re-introduction of mobile banking, as well as adding instant interbank transfers. The survey also showed that BancABC, at US$20 million, ranks third in terms of total non-performing loans (NPLs). These represent the loans that the borrower is not servicing; neither the interest nor the principal debt. They are not yet regarded as write-offs because of the possible fact that the collateral security could still be sufficient to recover the loan. In the full year, the bank reported an after-tax profit of US$5 million. BancABC has the second lowest return on assets (ROA) at 1,1 %. This is an indication of the return that an entity has made on the assets of the business. A positive ROA is the desired one and the higher the better. National Building Society (NBS) ranks last as it has a negative ROA of -1,2% and that is largely due to the fact that the financial institution is a new market entrant and still establishing the business. In terms of return on equity (ROE), BancABC is also lowly ranked at 6,23%, performing only better than NBS which is the only entity that has a negative ROE of -3,56%. This is a profitability ratio that reflects the return earned on the equity invested in the business, and a high and positive rate represents a good return, whilst a negative one means the erosion of equity. Out of the 18 banks, BancABC is among the institutions with the highest staff-cost-to-total-expenses ratio of 36,7 %. The ratio basically indicates the contribution to total expenses that human resources costs make. A service-based business would tend to have a higher ratio compared to a manufacturing concern. African Banking Corporation, the parent company of BancABC, was acquired by Atlas Mara, an investment group founded by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. It has operations in Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and a group services office in South Africa. BancABC has 23 branches in Zimbabwe.

1020357,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Andrew Walker Davis worked for two years in the office of Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski. (Courtesy Andrew Walker Davis’ family) Updated 5:22 p.m. | Andrew Walker Davis, former senior policy adviser for Rep. Daniel Lipinski, will be remembered Friday in a memorial service in West Hartford, Connecticut. Davis, 29, who died on Sunday after a two-year battle with cancer, worked for Lipinski for two years, most recently on transportation and infrastructure issues. He left the Hill in 2016 to work as an associate at the government relations firm, Chambers, Conlon and Hartwell. “Andrew was a great employee and a terrific guy who I very much enjoyed having on my staff. Very smart and analytical, he helped me achieve a number of legislative victories, especially on the FAST Act surface transportation bill,” Lipinski said in a statement. The Illinois Democrat added, “He worked hard, never shied from long hours or tough challenges, and he made it possible for me to be an effective legislator. He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man. I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” Davis was an avid Washington Nationals and New England Patriots fan and a politics buff. He could recite all the names of the presidents in chronological order and also was a fan of sports trivia, according to his obituary in the Hartford Courant. His family has asked those attending Friday’s memorial service to wear red, his favorite color, or Patriots colors. Davis was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and lived in Silver Spring, Maryland, with his wife Caitlin O’Donnell Davis and their three-year-old son, Alden Stone Davis. “Not only was Andrew a devoted staffer and colleague, he was also someone who I valued as a good friend. Despite whatever we might be working on, he kept a positive attitude, refreshing us all with his humor and wit, never short of a funny rejoinder about some Member’s floor comments,” Lipinski's chief of staff, Eric Lausten, said in a statement. Davis graduated from Union College and Georgetown Law School. Correction 5:22 p.m. | An earlier version of this story misstated the number of years Davis served on Lipinski’s staff.

The latest wrinkle, according to Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and an aide, is that Democrats want the bill’s tax title — currently part of the manager’s package being hotlined on the GOP side — to be folded into the substitute amendment instead. Ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) as recently as Wednesday told reporters that Democrats “didn’t want some monkey business coming around of trying to add taxes on it, but it looks like it’s clean.” Though procedurally either approach leads to the same outcome, Democrats seem to believe that including a clean tax title in the substitute will offer a degree of comfort that it’s inoculated from any extraneous tax amendments that could cause the legislation to implode. Story Continued Below Tl;dr: The bill’s not making it to the floor next week, in all likelihood. WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND: Happy Friday!

Recently named a federal driverless car proving ground, Michigan’s American Center for Mobility offers real world testing environments to validate self-driving systems. Learn how public-private ventures are helping Michigan create a safer world. Visit PlanetM.com ** JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME: Senators wrapped up the week by clearing a House-passed measure (H.R. 5729 (115)) that would prevent the Coast Guard from moving forward with a rule requiring biometric card readers for transportation worker IDs. The bill passed by unanimous consent. It would postpone implementation of the rule, currently set to go into effect on Aug. 23, until the Coast Guard submits a report to Congress showing the effectiveness of its Transportation Worker Identification Credential program as a whole. The service had proposed a three-year delay of the rule for some facilities, but industry groups have pressed for an extension for all facilities, given what they have referred to as years of unclear guidance from the Coast Guard. MONEY DOWN: Amtrak announced Thursday that it plans to spend $370 million over the next three years on a track laying system and other equipment to improve on-time performance for the Northeast Corridor. The investment also will include freight cars, five high-speed surfacing machines and heavy lift cranes for New York Penn Station. “More than 890,000 Amtrak customers and commuter passengers rely on the Northeast Corridor for transportation every weekday, and we are working to make their ride smoother and more reliable,” said Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. UP THE TRACKS: Rural-state senators lavished praise on their long-distance Amtrak services during a Thursday hearing on two rail-related nominees — former Trump aide Rick Dearborn to serve on Amtrak’s board of directors and Martin Oberman to become a Surface Transportation Board member. Many of them sought assurances from Dearborn (a former Senate staffer well liked by members) that those routes are crucial to Amtrak’s national network, which he gave without making many promises besides vowing to work with senators and their staffs. When asked by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) what he would do if he had to choose between lowering Amtrak’s operating losses or shutting down a long-distance line, Dearborn said: “I hope I’m never faced with that decision.” He added that he plans to focus on boosting ridership, which would spur revenue gains that he hopes would help Amtrak’s stewardship of its various services. Mark your calendars: The committee will consider both nominations at an Aug. 1 markup. For your files: A bipartisan coterie of senators wrote to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson Thursday concerned about the prospect of the railroad suspending service along its Southwest Chief route. They asked him to “uphold Amtrak's commitment to intercity rail service across the entire national network” and apply for grant funding recently made available by FRA for rail infrastructure upgrades. MEH: Rep. Bill Shuster's infrastructure plan is running into a familiar stumbling block: revenue. The Pennsylvania Republican, who isn’t running for reelection, has nothing to lose by getting behind a 15-cent gas tax hike, but other lawmakers oppose the move. Shuster’s playing the long game, though — 10 more years of gas tax, and then it disappears entirely to make way for a mileage fee. BACK TO BASICS: TSA needs to set clear goals for its basic training program for airport screeners, GAO said in a new report. The Transportation Security Officer training program offers a two-week intensive course for newly hired agents and private screeners to identify security threats. Though TSA has a model for evaluating its training, it “has not yet established specific program goals and performance measures to assess TSO Basic Training,” according to the report. Specifically, GAO said the agency needs to identify what the trainees are expected to achieve. TSA concurred and said it planned to collect more data from screeners to help it assess the potential impacts of the program. MILESTONE: FAA announced Thursday that it’s issued more than 100,000 Remote Pilot Certificates to commercial and recreational drone users — and that’s on top of the hundreds of thousands of “model aircraft” hobbyists who don’t have to comply with Part 107 certification requirements. MT MAILBAG: Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone (N.J.) and Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) sent a letter to NHTSA Thursday raising concerns about a recently released inspector general report that said the agency had been slow to react to consumer complaints about Takata airbags and ineffectively used its enforcement authorities to push for affected vehicles to be repaired as soon as possible. The lawmakers write that, “despite repeated calls now for NHTSA to open an investigation into the Kia and Hyundai fores, NHTSA has still failed to take meaningful action to keep drivers and passengers safe.” Also: The We Will Ride Coalition, a disability rights group, issued an open letter to automakers urging them to manufacture driverless vehicles that could accommodate wheelchair users and others with disabilities. “We worry that self-driving cars will fall short of the mobility promise they hold because we see no signs that auto manufacturers are developing a fully accessible passenger vehicle,” the group said. This day in history: Today marks one year since the Energy and Commerce Committee approved its driverless car bill (H.R. 3388 (115)) in a 54-0 vote. SHIFTING GEARS: Lynden Tennison will become Union Pacific’s executive vice and chief strategy officer on Aug. 1. Tennison has been with the railroad for 26 years and has served as senior vice president and chief information officer for more than a decade. And Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl has become the new chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority board of directors. She succeeds outgoing board chairman L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. MT INFLUENCE: Southwest Airlines hired Heideh Shahmoradi — former staff director of the Senate Transportation-HUD spending panel — to lobby on appropriations and reauthorizing the FAA. IN MEMORIAM: Andrew Davis, a former staffer for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), died this week following a lengthy battle with cancer. Davis, who was 29, served as Lipinski’s senior policy adviser on transportation and infrastructure for two years. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” (h/t POLITICO Huddle) THE AUTOBAHN: — ""Trump administration to freeze Obama-era fuel standards for cars, light trucks."" USA Today. — “5G mobile internet is (potentially) about to revolutionize transportation.” The Drive. — “For disabled subway riders, the biggest challenge can be getting to the train.” The New York Times. — “Southwest boosts inspections of engine involved in fatal failure.” Bloomberg. — Uber touts the positive impacts it has on the economy.

1096862,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Second Quarter Financial Highlights* *All comparisons versus second quarter 2017. NEW YORK, July 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq:MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. ""The second quarter results show a solid 16.4% year-over-year increase in total trading volume and record Open Trading™ activity, "" noted Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. ""International client breadth and trading activity continues to improve, led by a 27.0% increase in emerging market trading volume and a 32.3% increase in Eurobond volume. We are seeing rapid growth in trading automation in credit, driving improved trading efficiency and lower trading costs for our dealer and investor clients."" Second Quarter Results Total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 increased 11.1% to $107.0 million, compared to $96.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Operating income was $52.0 million, compared to $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.2%. Operating margin was 48.6%, compared to 50.9% for the second quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $40.5 million, or $1.07 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $38.0 million, or $1.00 per share, for the second quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased 10.5% to $96.1 million, compared to $87.0 million for the second quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 1.5% to $71.7 million on total trading volume of $420.8 billion for the second quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $70.6 million on total trading volume of $361.5 billion for the second quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.4% for the second quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.0% for the second quarter of 2017. All other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services and other revenue, increased 16.7% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $1.1 million. Total expenses for the second quarter of 2018 increased 16.1% to $54.9 million, compared to $47.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $2.0 million, professional and consulting fees of $1.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million, technology and communication costs of $1.0 million and employee compensation and benefit costs, mainly due to an increase in headcount, of $0.9 million. Occupancy costs in the second quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.8 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.03. Other income (expense) increased to $1.2 million from $0.6 million due to a $0.5 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 23.9%, compared to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $5.3 million of excess tax benefits, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on August 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,900 shares were repurchased in the second quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.6 million. Balance Sheet Data As of June 30, 2018, total assets were $617.6 million and included $420.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018 was $557.4 million.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding the Company's operating results.

McCaskill (nmccaskill@politico.com or @NolanDMcCaskill) MIDTERM MONEY SPRINT -- House leaders will crisscross the country to raise millions of dollars for candidates and incumbents during the five-week August recess as both parties compete for control of the chamber. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s offices say the leaders have scheduled dozens of events during their summer break. McCarthy aides say he will do more than 30 events in a dozen states, including stops in Ohio, Tennessee, Nebraska, Minnesota, New York and Maine. McCarthy has ramped up his fundraising this year, ascending to a level matched only by Ryan and Pelosi. Story Continued Below “McCarthy’s multiple fundraising entities took in more than $12 million last quarter, with a huge chunk of that coming from a joint committee McCarthy set up with Vice President Mike Pence, another key player in the Republican money chase,” Bres and Heather report. A Ryan aide says the retiring speaker will spend part of next month in Wisconsin doing events with its GOP delegation. The state’s primary is Aug. 14. Then he’ll travel to Illinois, Washington, Oregon and Colorado for fundraisers for incumbents. Pelosi will swing through the Southwest, appearing with Democratic candidates in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, then travel the country with stops in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego, Indianapolis and San Francisco. Pelosi will host her annual donor retreat in Napa in mid-August. Scheduled speakers include former Secretary of State John Kerry, California Gov. Jerry Brown and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. More on other leaders’ summer cash dash: http://bit.ly/2LNIFa9 LEADERS STRATEGIZE TO AVOID SHUTDOWN -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) presented President Donald Trump a government spending strategy designed to minimize the threat of a government shutdown over border wall funding a month before Election Day. The congressional leaders said they will prioritize less controversial bills before the Sept. 30 funding deadline and hope to fund the majority of the government through the appropriations process by the end of September, leaving a fight over border wall funding until later in the year. “Trump made clear to the GOP leaders that he still wants a $5 billion down payment on his wall this year, but he signaled to the leaders that he might be willing to wage that fight after the midterms,” Burgess reports. “Though the House plans to pass a spending bill giving Trump $5 billion for the wall, Senate Democrats are unlikely to agree to fund more than the $1.6 billion initially requested by the Trump administration -- meaning any attempt to fund the Department of Homeland Security could lead to a shutdown.” More: http://bit.ly/2LsRxGo GOP TORN APART OVER TARIFFS -- With the president threatening $500 billion in additional tariffs on China and new duties on foreign cars, Senate Republicans are increasingly focused on crafting legislation to tie his hands. Even Trump ally Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, is working on a bill limiting the president from imposing new national security-based tariffs. There’s just one problem: House Republicans. “[A]cross the Capitol, Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP leaders have all but rejected that approach,” Rachael and Burgess report. “House Republicans, who rarely push back on the president, say it’s more productive to try to convince Trump privately or through letters or committee hearings than to force his hand legislatively.” “Ask them how they expect the president to sign it,” House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said of the Senate. “The split-strategy undermines Hill Republicans’ drive to blunt Trump’s protectionist trade policies,” they write. “Instead, the political party of free markets is watching the president dole out $12 billion in subsidies for farmers hurt by his trade war with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.” Republicans in both chambers agree that an escalating trade war is the greatest threat to their majorities, but House Republicans are far less inclined to challenge the president. More: http://bit.ly/2NLgZDy Trump, for his part, announced Wednesday that the U.S. would pause its plans to impose new tariffs on the European Union and move to resolve differences over trade in an effort to avoid a full-blown trade war.

Senate Majority PAC plans to pour at least $20 million into a voter-mobilization campaign in Republican-leaning states. “The initiative … will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake, but it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans,” The New York Times’ Alexander Burns reports. “Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states.” Much more: https://nyti.ms/2LSD1Ue CONSERVATIVES REACH TO IMPEACH ROSENSTEIN -- Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) filed articles of impeachment late Wednesday in an attempt to oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. “Meadows sidestepped a procedural move that could have forced the issue to a vote this week and laid bare divisions among Republicans,” Kyle reports. “Instead, the House is leaving Thursday for a five-week recess and it's unclear whether conservatives will attempt to force the issue when lawmakers return in September.” The filling followed a meeting with top DOJ officials over a lingering demand for documents. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has rejected impeachment calls, recently describing the document dispute as a “compliance” issue that was on its way to being resolved. “Without GOP leaders’ support, it’s unlikely an impeachment bid could pass the House -- and even if it did, it would be doomed in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to oust any executive branch official,” Kyle adds. “But Rosenstein’s sharpest House critics have previously suggested that laying out articles of impeachment could be enough to prompt Trump to act against Rosenstein on his own.” Much more: http://bit.ly/2LrWv68 Related read: “Election meddling bill would curb president's power, Paul warns,” from Stephanie Murray: http://bit.ly/2Lt4f84 POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP ON RUSSIA -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers the president accepts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Pompeo assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Trump “has a complete and proper understanding of what happened” because he briefed the president on it as CIA director. Pompeo “repeatedly urged lawmakers to pay attention to the administration's policies as opposed to what the president may be implying through public comments,” Nahal Toosi and Stephanie Murray report. Pompeo also said the U.S. “does not and will not recognize the Kremlin's purported annexation of Crimea.” More from the hearing: http://bit.ly/2LFAlMM DEADLINE DAY -- Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday say the DHS secretary told them the Trump administration would meet today’s court deadline to reunify families that were separated at the border due to its zero-tolerance enforcement policy. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters that members “questioned her numerous times” on that claim. “That’s impossible,” he said of the possibility. “We all said this to her.” In a statement, Nielsen said she had a “productive and frank conversation” with lawmakers that included the administration’s reunification efforts. Members had a far different characterization, though. They said the meeting ended with few concrete answers and some unresolved issues.

Davis, 29, spent nearly two years as a senior policy adviser for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), focusing on transportation and infrastructure issues. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” “He had a larger than life presence and a passion for making others smile,” his obituary reads. “He was known for his altruistic disposition and could always be counted on to help family or friends in need. Even in the bleakest of conditions, he was someone who always saw the positive in life.” Davis is survived by his 3-year-old son, Alden, college sweetheart and wife, Caitlin O’Donnell Davis, parents and siblings.

Partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late. Low 51F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:17 pm MADISON COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) - A community is trying to heal after a 6-year-old boy in Madison County was hit and killed by a car. ""He enjoyed class, he loved to dance and he was easy to make friends with,"" said Tamisha Ealy, a teacher at Madison County Central School. Andrew Davis Jr. was the light of his classroom at Madison County Central School. ""He was a sweet little boy,"" Ealy said. ""He reminded me of my son actually because he was quiet and humble and very smart."" According to FHP, a driver was traveling north on Parramore avenue, approaching the intersection at Miller street. That's when FHP says the driver tried to avoid hitting 6-year-old Andrew Davis Jr. ""It devastated me because like I said he's an angel. He was very precious, very mannerable and to hear that someone that young passing away that you had an opportunity to interact with is very devastating,"" said Ealy. On Facebook, comments came pouring in about the loss of the child. ""Everyone made sure they were calling the family, calling people that interacted with this young boy to make sure that everyone was together and okay,"" Ealy explained. ""You know it just seemed like this is the most love I've seen in Madison County."" FHP says alcohol did not play a factor in the accident and charges are currently pending for the driver. Funeral services for Davis are scheduled for Saturday, July 28 at 11 a.m. at the Mount Zion AME Church. We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

1016437,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Race leaders will have to stay on their toes for stages 14 and 15 As the 2018 Tour de France heads towards the end of its second week, the race moves from the Alps to the Massif Central for what is predicted to be a weekend for breakaways. So far, the main breakaway of the day has only succeeded in winning one stage, with Julian Alaphilippe's efforts into Le Grand-Bornand on stage 10. But the coming two stages should be a prime opportunity for the escapees to take the honours. Related ArticlesCalmejane wins Tour de France stage with panacheTwo-year extension for Calmejane at Direct EnergieTour de France: The Alps in review with Thomas, Dumoulin and Roglic - PodcastGeraint Thomas prepares for next yellow jersey battle at MendeHistory repeats itself with Thomas and Froome's leadership contest First up on Saturday is a lumpy stage 14 from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Mende, which features rolling terrain followed by four classified climbs at no higher than second category. The final ascent in Mende – the Côte de la Croix Neuve – may only be deemed to be a category 2 climb, but it's no joke: while only three kilometres in length, it averages a whisker over 10 per cent in gradient. The top of the climb comes 1.5km from the finish, allowing the weaker climbers to get back on, or the stronger time triallists to potentially take a few seconds. Team Sky directeur sportif Nicolas Portal expects any escapees to be successful, but it won’t be a day off for the general classification riders. ""It will be the breakaway that goes for the stage win, but behind them it will be a fight for the GC,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""On the short uphill in Mende, someone is going to try. Sometimes, if you can get 10 seconds on this climb, it's better than nothing. So, for us, it's going to be a case of being very focused on trying not to lose any time, and maybe gaining time."" The Mende finale last appeared at the 2015 Tour de France with Steve Cummings surprising a duelling Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. Cummings had been dropped by the two flyweight climbers, but his power worked to his advantage as he tracked them down over the top of the ascent. Back in the main pack, Chris Froome and Nairo Quintana came over the top together, but Froome was able to add another second to his lead over the Colombian with a faster sprint. Given his finishing move on top of Alpe d'Huez, Froome's Sky teammate Geraint Thomas could potentially pull out a couple of seconds on the line with his superior sprint. Perhaps third-placed Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) will utilise his time trialling skills to eke out a few of his own as the finish flattens out. As Portal says, 10 seconds is better than nothing at all. The Massif Central journey continues on Sunday with a 181-kilometre ride from Millau to Carcassonne. The three classified climbs – a third, a second and a first category one, in that order – are spread across the parcours. The final ascent of the Pic de Nore comes with just over 50 kilometres remaining before a long descent and a flat run to the line, with a final flick upwards before the line. The 12.3km-long category 1 Pic de Nore is a new addition to the Tour de France, with narrow roads and a long drag to the top with an average gradient of 6.3 per cent. There is one ramp of just over nine per cent, but much of the climb is a steady grind. French breakaway specialist Lilian Calmejane, of Direct Energie, is from France's Tarn department, where the climb is situated, and thinks that it could surprise a few people. ""This is a famous col in my region, but it's not a famous Tour de France climb,"" Calmejane told Cyclingnews. ""We climb it by a small, forest road, so I don't think anybody knows this climb very well, and I don't think that even the GC riders will have reconned this stage because it's a transition stage, so they could be surprised by it. ""It makes for a difficult stage, but I don't think it will be a particularly busy day for the riders chasing the overall classification. It's more a day for a breakaway, and for riders like me, I hope."" Portal is also from the south of France, from the nearby department of Gers, in the larger region of Occitanie. While Team Sky did not go to recon the stage, as Calmejane predicted, Portal has first-hand knowledge of the Pic de Nore, having climbed it several years ago. He believes that someone like Peter Sagan could take the stage if he chooses to go on the attack, and says that the general classification riders are unlikely to take too much out of the day. ""It would be quite complicated,"" he said when asked if any of the GC contenders could feasibly take time. ""The Pic de Nore is a climb I did when I was young, and is part of the Montagne Noire range. It's not an easy climb: it's got rough tarmac, and if the weather continues to be hot, then it could be terrible. ""It could be a good stage for Sagan because if he decides to go in the break, then he could win. He could use the team to drop some sprinters because it's pretty hard, and then, from the top, I think there are only around 40 kilometres to go, but that's just enough to possibly stay away. The race could be pretty full on from the bottom of the climb."" After three tough days in the high mountains, followed by a sprint day, stage hunters like Calmejane are eager for a piece of the pie. The 25-year-old, who won a stage at last year's Tour, has already been on the attack numerous times in this year's race, but he has been eyeing up this weekend in particular. ""I'm quite tired, like everybody in the peloton,"" Calmejane admitted. ""But the stages on Saturday and Sunday are two stages that I've reconned and in fact already know very well. They suit me much better than the big mountains."" Team Sky hold the first two positions in the overall classification, with Thomas holding the yellow jersey with a 1:39 advantage over Froome. Sunweb's Dumoulin is very close behind, only 11 seconds down on Froome. At the start of the Tour, Sky had said that they were 100 per cent behind Froome but Thomas' performance has earned him equal billing with the defending champion. Portal says neither has more support than the other, and that having two riders at the top of the GC is the best possible scenario. ""For us, it's a pretty good situation: we have two cards to play. I always say that, but it's true,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""Maybe at the beginning it was more about Froome, but now, to be honest, Thomas has shown that he's super-strong, and who knows how long he can hold it? He doesn't even know. ""It's the same for Froome, coming from the Giro. Who knows how long he can perform? He could pay the price. At the moment, it looks pretty good because we are in first and second, but let's see what the road brings. We need to support them both,"" said Portal.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The chairman of Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, Gian Maria Gros-Pietro, says he knows nothing of his bank’s involvement in co-financing Atlas Merchant Capital’s takeover of Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) or the pan-African Africell mobile-telephone network in cooperation with the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Sources in Washington say Intesa Sanpaolo has expressed interest in entering a co-financing deal with OPIC on the two mega African M&A deals: The circa US$1 billion takeover of Africell – the Beirut-based Lintel Group of Companies’ mobile-phone carrier with subsidiaries in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo and The Gambia – and former Barclays Bank chief executive officer Bob Diamond’s move to take control of Union Bank of Nigeria. Diamond has teamed up with the Dubai-based founder of Atlas Mara, Ashish Thakkar, to create a pan-African universal bank network that currently has banking operations in Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania, and now a major presence in Nigeria through UBN. Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing two African deals with OPIC – now a strategic arm of US President Donald Trump’s administration’s use of private-sector investment in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia as a national-security objective – could cement Italy’s role as the United States’ closest NATO ally. However, it is understood that OPIC and Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing talks are being led by former Intesa Sanpaolo CEO Corrado Passera through his €600 million (US$698 million) Italian SME lending startup Spaxs. Diamond, through Atlas Merchant, is the largest investor in Spaxs. Intesa Sanpaolo spokesman Stefano Lucchini said he had no knowledge of Passera’s or Bob Diamond’s involvement with Intesa Sanpaolo. An Intesa Sanpaolo source said the bank’s London operations had looked at co-financing the UBN and Africell deals along with OPIC. Italian banks, as with Italian companies in general, are top-down institutions in which the board of directors is directly informed of almost any strategic or potentially controversial activity. While co-financing with OPIC carries little risk as the underlying investments are guaranteed by the US government, any involvement by Intesa Sanpaolo with a US government agency such as OPIC could be easily misconstrued by the Italian press harking back to past US-government-connected Italian banking scandals such as the bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano (Vatican/IOR) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro’s Iraqgate scandal. However, Intesa San Paolo co-financing OPIC deals in Africa, Central Asia and North Africa is likely to be raised during Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s meeting with Trump on July 30, sources close to the matter said.

It targets a return on equity (ROE) of about 25 percent in its plans to 2023, compared with just 4 percent for Italian lenders in 2017 net of one-offs and 14 percent at Banca IFIS , a specialty bank which buys and manages bad debts. “This project is an act of confidence in Italy,” Corrado Passera, the chief executive of the new bank whose name has yet to be announced, told journalists. The veteran banker and former industry minister said the bank would scout for small businesses seen to have potential but which had trouble securing funds from mainstream lenders. It would also buy bad loans from rivals. The bank, which will not have branches, aims to tap the expertise of retired corporate executives and use artificial intelligence to identify companies that qualify for lending. Italian banks are slowly emerging from a bad loan crisis triggered by a deep recession. Credit losses and negative interest rates have hammered returns in the sector, which is weighed down by fragmentation and too many branches. The number of specialised banks, known as “challenger banks”, seeking to compete with established players has grown in Britain and other countries but they are still rare in Italy. Passera, who headed Intesa Sanpaolo until 2011, raised 600 million euros ($703 million) in January by listing SPAXS, a special purpose acquisition company that he used to buy small lender Banca Interprovinciale. Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital Fund indirectly owns a 7.7 percent stake in SPAXS and is its biggest investor. Alongside Passera, the chief financial officer will be Francesco Mele who held the same job at Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The new bank aims to deliver a net profit of 40 million-50 million euros in 2020 rising to about 300 million euros in 2023, broadly split between the small- and medium-sized (SME) enterprises lending unit and the bad loan business. Andrea Clamer, who has moved from Banca IFIS to head the bad loan unit, said the bank would invest 3 billion euros buying some of the 135 billion euros in bad corporate loans Italian banks were expected to offload in 2018-2023. The SME unit would also buy so-called “unlikely-to-pay” loans, which are not yet in default and could be recovered by turning around the troubled borrower. Clamer said the new group had agreed to buy a 300 million euro bad loan portfolio, a deal that would go ahead after Aug. 8 when SPAXS shareholders approve the tie-up with Banca Interprovinciale, which also needs regulatory clearing. The new bank targets a core capital ratio of more than 15 percent and plans to rely on digital technologies to keep costs below 30 percent of its income. $1 = 0.8537 euros Reporting by Valentina Za Editing by Edmund Blair All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1012769,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama will take a high-profile role in the 2018 campaign, but in order to keep herself from getting to deep in the muck she’ll seek to elect Democrats under the guise of an ostensibly nonpartisan group which launches Thursday and that is being called “When We All Vote.” According to Politico report about the $8 million effort: The initiative, scheduled to be launched Thursday, is the result of months of quiet conversations and planning full of false starts and uncertainty about whether to go forward. It will have the former first lady appear in public service announcements and at live events throughout the country into the fall, according to multiple people informed of the plans. She’ll be joined by several A-list celebrities, including actor Tom Hanks, country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Houston Rockets star Chris Paul, singer Janelle Monae and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The first PSA will go out Thursday, with more in the process of being lined up, featuring other prominent activists and players. The group will be incorporated as a nonprofit, separate from the Obama Foundation, the personal offices of Barack and Michelle Obama, and Citizen 44, the LLC that the former president himself pays for to handle his own political involvement. Named “When We All Vote,” it will be stocked with prominent Obama alumni, including Valerie Jarrett as president of the board and former first lady chief of staff Tina Tchen as treasurer. Pete Rouse, an Obama senior adviser who served as interim White House chief of staff, will also be on the board . . . Organizers intend to send personal messages to people urging them to register. According to one document describing the group’s plans, it will partner with “outlets that young Americans use most.” So its nonpartisan, right? And the Obamas don’t deceive people, right? I mean, look at the roster of participants. And they’ll be trying to get young people off their video games and to stop texting for a few minutes to vote. Of course, they all vote Democratic. Here’s the video, which has just been released and has not yet been widely seen or even published, far as I can tell. I mean, honestly, have a look that people featured in this video. Young African Americans. An effusive young pajama-boy style white guy with a goatie. Um, Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, they are not likely conservative Republicans, as the makers of this video fully understand. And they are there to appeal to Democrats. This will be a tax-free effort to register Democrats. Thank you for contributing to Michelle’s new project. Michelle Obama is expanding her role in the Obama campaign, heading up a new effort… She raised money last night in Chicago for Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias and then at… President Obama will raise substantially less in the second quarter of his campaign than the… LOL, have they checked out the videos and testimonials at the FB #WalkAway Campaign site ? That’s where all their “targeted” reach seems to be hanging out. If Trump weaponized the IRS like obama did, they’d be dead in the water,lol! Well, we knew it was coming, didn’t we? We just weren’t sure of how they were going to format their anti-Trump, anti-American campaign for the midterms. Now we know. Good for her. If there’s one thing voters like? It’s a lecturing scold telling them what to do. You go, girl! Hope it works as well as her school lunch campaign did… I wonder if she’ll grow bored with this…remember #BringBackOurGirls? Re: When we ALL vote. That includes the illegals in California. And everywhere else. Screw each and everyone. Celebrities? BWAHAAAA. Dead to me. Amazing she could find time between attending Beyoncé concerts in Paris and vacations and all. This isn’t quite as extreme as the Democrat preparation for the Supreme Court nominee hearings but it’s close. See: https://freebeacon.com/culture/liberals-send-female-senate-democrats-pee-proof-underwear-oppose-trumps-scotus-pick/ OMG, what next? Reading the Freebeacon article was really quite disgusting. The idea of Elizabeth Warren wearing pee absorbing undies is just too much. Obviously, this limelight for MO leads to her being the nominee for president of our Republic in 2020. Follow the money right to the billionaire who has been NObama’s puppeteer for a long time! Do they really believe they are fooling us? Bring it, Moochie! Cheesey comes to mind, you go girl! Hand out those Obama iPads all day, don’t forget to check ID Ah, yes, and I am oh so sure (not) she will continue to adhere to her own standard of “when they go low, we go high”. I do so hope that the Republicans (well, Trump and his allies) do well in November. First, we need a better Congress and second, if/when the blue wave doesn’t materialize that will drive even more of the leftists insane. Just-call-me-Meesh-coat-tail rider seems to have put on the pounds — why doesn’t she just eat some healthy school lunch menus?

I’ve been fooled by book value before.” Forescout Technologies, Inc.: “I feel even [more] strongly about this now and I also like, by the way, Palo Alto. I like Cyberark.

And I like Proofpoint, particularly because now we are back battling with the Chinese on intellectual property and that means that the Chinese might be making it so that we need more cybersecurity.” Applied Materials, Inc.: “Applied Materials, I think, at this level, is too cheap. I saw Lam Research going up. Now, it may take the whole cycle. It may actually literally take six to nine months for Applied Materials to come back, but I am urging patience.” Cardinal Health, Inc.: “It yields almost 4 percent. I liked it higher. It is hard for me to imagine how this stock got all the way down to $50. It is just not that bad at 10 times earnings.” Buckeye Partners: “Don’t buy any more.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Bradford 7°c Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond Former Barclays chief Bob Diamond has said he “didn’t think it was fair” that he took the blame for banking misconduct during the Libor scandal, but admitted he could have “done things better” during the financial crisis. The long-time banker – whose short stint as chief executive lasted from 2011 to 2012 – recalled the day he was asked to step down as chief executive, calling it “the most challenging” professional decision of his life. He had been told he had lost the confidence of the Bank of England, the Chancellor and the City watchdog despite Barclays having been the first to settle with authorities over Libor-rigging – paying £290 million in 2012. He begrudgingly bowed to board pressure. “The request for me to resign was, in my mind, not the right decision in terms of how I conducted myself, how I behaved, how I was doing in the institution, the support I had from the various constituencies.” Mr Diamond claims he decided to step down to protect both the bank and his family. “I decided that if I act according to everything I believe, then the number one is what’s good for Barclays and the second thing is what’s good for my family. “And I had to admit that I had become a lightning rod. I didn’t like that. “It didn’t feel like me, it didn’t look like me, I didn’t think it was appropriate, I didn’t think it was fair, but I had become a lightning rod and I thought it was better for me to step down and do the right thing than ask the board to support me.” When asked whether he thought it was fair that current Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has been able to keep his job despite having been fined by regulators for unmasking a whistleblower, Mr Diamond told the Press Association: “I don’t worry about that stuff.” Mr Diamond, who was speaking at a How to: Academy event in Westminster, also recalled how the Libor scandal brought him in front of the Treasury Select Committee, where he came face to face with its former chairman and Tory MP Andrew Tyrie. “It was gruelling to be in front of the Treasury Select Committee. There are few people I have met that I respect more than Andrew Tyrie. He had a tough job that day. I had a bit of a harder one, but I think he … is a good man.” The former Barclays boss – who now heads his own financial services firm Atlas Mara – stressed that Barclays remains one of the few to have survived the financial crisis without a Government bailout. But Mr Diamond said he was willing to admit he had not always done his best, particularly in the lead-up to the financial crisis. “There was no banker who didn’t make mistakes during this period, so could I have done things better? Absolutely. “I think what I’m proud of though, is that during that period Barclays survived, we were stable.” ­Looking ahead, he expects the banking landscape to become more localised, with successful strategies set to be more regional than global for international lenders. The transition away from “universal” banks will mean the sector will innovate and fail if necessary, without bringing down the entire financial system, he said. Mr Diamond added: “If I am correct and the exciting part of financial services is going to be more national, regional and less global – more focused on selective and less universal – then failure again is an option. “If these smaller, national firms fail, we’re not creating systemic risk. “It’s OK, some of them are going to fail and many of them are going to be very successful so … I’m very optimistic about the future of financial services.” Get involved with the news in your community This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

1096862,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission staff might be toying with the idea of regulating electronic fixed-income trading venues at self-regulatory organizations, according to the line of questioning from the latest Fixed-Income Markets Structure Advisory Committee open meeting. During the last panel discussion, Brett Redfearn, director of the Division of Trading and Markets at the SEC, posed questions to the subcommittee on technology and electronic trading how they would address regulating the electronic fixed-income market starting from a clean slate. He raised the issues of which key regulatory objectives there should be, whether regulations should support operational transparency, system integrity, resiliency standards, as well as other typical topics that SROs face currently. The subcommittee went as far as proposing that the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board create a working group tasked with reviewing the regulatory framework for the corporate and municipal bond markets’ electronic trading platforms. The proposal also noted that any revised regulatory framework should ensure fair and effective markets without any regulatory gaps or hamper the innovation of new trading protocols and business models. At the same time, the proposal’s authors also recommended that the SEC should amend Regulation ATS and any other applicable rules to take in the account the nature of fixed-income market structure and trading protocols as well as the cost-benefit of existing and future regulations. Ben Macdonald,Bloomberg “It might have cost the industry $2.5 billion to implement MiFID II just to arrive at pre-trade transparency for about 400 bonds,” Ben Macdonald, global head of enterprise products at Bloomberg and president of Bloomberg SEF. “The cost-benefit of that is worth bearing in mind. With that said, what I think MiFID II does very well is laying the foundation of an ecosystem of trading that ultimately provides a funnel of post-trade reporting.” “There are a lot of lessons to be learned from that process,” agreed Doug Friedman, general counsel at Tradeweb. “The regulation must recognize the differences in how markets trade, the impact of trading, and reporting on liquidity, the time and cost of resources associated with any implementation, and also the opportunity costs. You have to prioritize regulatory and compliance over what might be commercial innovation potentially.” No matter what happens, regulators need to address the arbitrary nature of the existing regulatory framework regarding electronic fixed-income trading, stressed Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess and chairman of the subcommittee. Depending on whether a venue caters to click-to-trade retail investors or institutional investors who prefer requests-for-quotes, the SEC and FINRA may regulate them as an ATS operator or a broker-dealer, he noted. “There is at least one example of an e-trading participant in both retail and institutional markets that are not regulated by either FINRA or ATS regulations today,” McVey added. “The committee believes that the differences are based on trading protocols and not business models and, to a certain extent, revenue models.” And receive exclusive articles on securities markets Cantor Fitzgerald cites execution quality, customization, and access to liquidity as trading differentiators.

1106452,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citi (NYSE: C) has been awarded World’s Best Investment Bank at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence, held in London on 11th July. The bank was also named World’s Best Bank for Financing and World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility. Commenting on Citi’s success, Euromoney noted that: “The rationale behind Citi’s nomination as the world’s best investment bank this year is simple, but impressive. In every part of the world that Euromoney considered the credentials of the leading regional investment banks, Citi was a genuine contender. These arguments speak to two incontrovertible facts about Citi’s Institutional Clients Group (ICG) today: no other firm comes close to the scale and breadth of Citi’s wholesale banking operations; and Citi hasn’t just built and maintained a global network, it has built one that works and is increasingly valued by its clients, who view Citi as a true partner to their own global businesses. Competitors are now catching on that Citi has something they don’t. Clients realized this a lot earlier.” Citi was also recognized across a number of regional categories including: Jamie Forese, President of Citi and Head of Citi's Institutional Clients Group commented: ""Citi has had a tremendous 12 months, delivering on our commitments by leveraging the synergies of our ICG platform. We continue to see evidence in our results that our major advantage when serving large, sophisticated clients is our global network -- one that cannot be replicated by our competition. Being recognized by Euromoney is a testament to our capabilities."" On being named World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, Ed Skyler, Citi’s Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chair of the Citi Foundation said: “The societal issues impacting our communities today require a different level of engagement from companies. It’s no longer about being a good corporate citizen. We must use our business, our philanthropy and our voice to stand for issues that matter most.” The Euromoney Awards for Excellence are recognized as the most prestigious in the financial services industry. About Citi: Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.

Sarah Cascone & Caroline Goldstein, July 10, 2018 There’s art to be seen all over the world this summer, so why not plan a vacation with an exhibition or two in mind? We’ve scoured the globe to bring you this list of the 29 most tantalizing art shows going on view in the next few months. Glexis Novoa, Wat [detail], 2013, graphite on canvas, 49 x 107 inches, Courtesy of the artist and David Castillo Gallery Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907). Courtesy of Neue Galerie. There are shows all over the world this year dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the deaths of Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, but only one of them features the famed “Woman in Gold,” Klimt’s gilded masterpiece Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. It’s the jewel of the Neue Galerie’s collection, and if you haven’t seen it yet, the museum’s upcoming show, which examines the two artists’ work in light of the so-called “joyous apocalypse”—the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I—is the perfect opportunity to do so. Susan Meiselas, Roseann on the way to Manhattan Beach, New York, 1978, from the series “Prince Street Girls,” 1975-90; © Susan Meiselas/Magnum Photos Since the 1970s, photographer Susan Meiselas has documented occurrences as wide-ranging as the armed conflict in Central America to the Kurdish genocide to carnival strippers. Timed here to the release of her new book, Mediations, an exhibition of the same name comes to SFMOMA from the Fundació Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona, and the Jeu de Paume, Paris. Joana Vasconcelos’s Lilicoptère (2012). Work produced in collaboration with Fundação Ricardo do Espírito Santo Silva, Lisbon. © Joana Vasconcelos, VEGAP, Bilbao, 2018. Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos named her current show after a Velvet Underground song, as a tribute to Nico, who sang vocals on the track. The title work, a massive carnival mask sculpture made of bronze and mirrors, is joined by some of the artist’s greatest hits, as well as new works. Robert Rauschenberg, L.A. Uncovered #1 (1998). Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, gift of the artist and Gemini G.E.L., ©Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. LACMA makes the case that Robert Rauschenberg, who lives between New York and Florida, is actually a Los Angeles artist. He was inspired to pursue a career in the arts after being stationed with the Navy at California’s Camp Pendleton in 1944 and ’45, and later worked closely with the LA print workshops Gemini G.E.L. and Styria Studio. The exhibition also touches on Rauschenberg’s work with scientists and engineers from Teledyne Technologies as part of LACMA’s Art & Technology program, as well as his 1981 photography project In + Out City Limits, and 1998 screenprint series LA Uncovered, both of which feature views of the city. Lee Friedlander’s Miles Davis (1969). Image courtesy of the artist and Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco. New York-based photographer Lee Friedlander made his first trip to New Orleans in 1957 and has been visiting ever since. Now, the New Orleans Museum of Art has brought together some of the artist’s earliest streetscapes, self-portraits featuring reflections and shadows, and documentation of jazz culture. The latter work captures not only the musical greats and second-line parades, but also New Orleans’s lesser-known jazz musicians. Choctaw-Cherokee painter and sculptor Jeffrey Gibson destroyed much of his early work before recommitting to his artistic practice in 2011. That date marks the starting point for this exhibition at the Denver Art Museum, which is known for its commitment to showing Native American art. Gibson’s colorful wall hangings, beaded punching bags, rawhide paintings, sculptures, and videos draw parallels between the Native American experience and the Civil Rights movement, all while reflecting the influence of the history of contemporary art. The show will later travel to the Mississippi Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art. Gabriele Münter, Portrait of Marianne von Werefkin (1909). Photo courtesy of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. The Louisiana Museum in Copenhagen will exhibit some 130 works by the late German Expressionist Gabriele Münter, many of which are being shown for the first time, in the artist’s first comprehensive retrospective in decades. A founding artist of the Blaue Reiter group (Blue Rider) with her romantic partner Wassily Kandinsky and artist Franz Marc, Münter has—surprise, surprise—long been overshadowed by her male contemporaries. With an oeuvre of more than 2,000 paintings, and some 1,200 photographs, watercolors, stained glass works, and prints—not to mention thousands more drawings—it’s hopefully just a start to an overdue reassessment of her career. Robert Delaunay, Circular Forms (Sun and Moon), (1913–31). Courtesy of Kunsthaus Zürich. A master of light and color, Robert Delaunay was a major figure of the Parisian avant-garde in the early 20th century. For its upcoming comprehensive show, the Kunsthaus Zürich has amassed 80 paintings and works on paper by the artist to complement two major Delaunay canvases from its permanent collection: Circular Forms (Sun and Moon) (1913–31) and the monumental Circular Forms (1930). The Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. In this historical exhibition, the Ashmolean Museum examines the way our lives are influenced by superstition and so-called “magical thinking.” Objects on view will include engraved rings meant to ensure another’s love and mummified cats. Laure Prouvost’s Ahead of Us (2018). Courtesy of the artist and Nathalie Obadia (Paris and Brussels), carlier | gerbauer (Berlin), and Lisson Gallery (London and New York). For her first Paris museum show, 2013 Turner Prize winner Laure Prouvost—on tap to represent France at the 2019 Venice Biennale—presents a world overrun by nature, a possible vision of the future inspired by global warming. Visitors enter through a corridor of woven tapestries, and can drink from the centerpiece, a large fountain of breasts. Miriam Schapiro, The Beauty of Summer (1973–74). Courtesy of Eric Firestone Gallery, ©Miriam Schapiro/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. Pioneering feminist artist Miriam Schapiro, who died in 2015, was a founding member of the Pattern and Decoration movement. The Museum of Arts and Design pairs 29 works by Schapiro, including her signature collage-painting hybrids, which she dubbed femmages, alongside 28 works by contemporary artists, such as Sanford Biggers, Jeffrey Gibson, and Sara Rahbar. The show reveals her widespread influence and her willingness to embrace disciplines traditionally relegated to the realm of craft and women’s work. Blending traditional Hungarian textile techniques with contemporary art influences—as well as the feminist art movement of the 1960s and ’70s—Anna Torma’s vibrant embroidered multimedia works straddle the line between domesticity and fantasy. “Mike + Doug Starn: Big Bambú,” installation in progress at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Photo courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, ©Mike and Doug Starn. Brothers Mike and Doug Starn have created a new version of their massive interactive project Big Bambú, which was a hit when it appeared on the rooftop of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2010. They’ve now built a multi-story installation of 3,000 bamboo poles at the MFA Houston, the first indoor edition of the piece. Guests who want to climb onto the upper levels should plan ahead and wear flat, rubber-soled, enclosed footwear. Guerrilla Girls at Abrons_preview (2015). Photo courtesy of Andrew Hindrake. In the wake of the #MeToo movement there couldn’t be a better time to revisit the work of the anonymous female art collective the Guerrilla Girls, known for their searing critiques of the art world. The Dallas Museum of Art has brought together 109 posters, books, videos, and ephemera created by the group between 1985 and 2016. Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg, Worship (2016). Film still courtesy of Lisson Gallery and Gio’ Marconi, Milan, ©Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg/Bildupphovsrätt, 2017. Nathalie Djurberg’s darkly fantastical stop-motion animated films are scored by Swedish producer Hans Berg. In their latest show, the duo will present new sculptures and installations, as well as their recent efforts in virtual reality. Eduardo Chillida, Mesa de Omar Khayyâm III (1983). Photo courtesy of the Telefónica Art Collection. The Rijksmuseum has secured loans of nine of Eduardo Chillida‘s monumental steel sculptures for an impressive outdoor exhibition. The Spanish artist is known for blending traditional artisanal iron-forging techniques with the innovations of Modernist abstraction. Don’t miss his Homenaie a Calder, inspired by the mobiles of Alexander Calder. Installation view of “The Music of Color: Sam Gilliam, 1967–73” at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Photo courtesy of the Kunstmuseum Basel. The Kunstmuseum Basel revisits the most radical period in the career of American artist Sam Gilliam, who, in 1967, began painting on unstretched canvases and then folding and crumpling the wet paintings to create works that border between sculpture and painting. The show also highlights Gilliam’s signature drape painting series, which he began in 1968. ©Viviane Sassen, Ra (2017). Courtesy of Stevenson Gallery, Cape Town, South Africa The Hepworth Wakefield showcases the work of Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen, who cites Surrealism as a major influence on her work. The exhibition is presented as a series of “image poems” in the tradition of Surrealist collage, featuring photography series from the last decade as well as the artist’s new work. For the follow up to her ground-breaking installation The Dinner Party, the pioneering feminist artist Judy Chicago set about creating works of art that depicted the miracle of birth—an act rarely pictured in the history of art. (Chicago has argued if men delivered babies, art museums would use much more space emphasizing this essential part of the human experience.) In making these bold female symbols, Chicago continued championing woman-centric art traditions historically denigrated as craft, working with professional textile artists—as she did with The Dinner Party—to help execute her vision. Works from the series will appear this fall at the ICA Miami, but see them in Pasadena first, as the museum has sadly announced its imminent closure.

The adventures of Italian autobiographer Giacomo Casanova have become reduced in the popular imagination to his famed exploits with women. But his writings offer an unparalleled account of everyday life and customs in 18th-century European society. The MFA takes a look at Casanova’s world—and the persistently relevant issues of political, social, economic, and sexual power—presenting a selection of 250 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, decorative arts, furniture, costumes, and musical instruments. Richard Avedon, “Dovima With Elephants (1955), featuring a Dior evening gown. Photo courtesy of the Richard Avedon Foundation. The Getty presents 198 fashion-related objects, from magazine covers and ad campaigns to garments and photographs, in this in-depth survey of the history of fashion photography, which rarely gets institutional attention. The show takes as its starting point Edward Steichen, who took the first artistic photographs back in 1911. It then traces the century since, ending in the digital (but still pre-Instagram) age of 2011. The show includes some of the field’s most famous photos, as well as lesser-known masterpieces and experimental work by the likes of Man Ray and Dora Maar, which contributed to the art form’s development and challenge the notion that fashion photography is merely commercial. Winslow Homer with The Gulf Stream in his studio (c. 1900). Photo courtesy of the Bowdoin College Museum of Art. The Bowdoin College Museum of Art makes the case that landscape painter Winslow Homer was heavily influenced by the burgeoning art of photography. The exhibition presents photographs, paintings, and prints, as well as a professional-grade dry plate camera that was once owned by the artist. Frida Kahlo, by Guillermo Kahlo (1932). Photo: Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons. Perhaps art history’s most celebrated female artist, Frida Kahlo became an icon on the strength of her self-portraits, in which she often wore richly embroidered Mexican garb and colorful flowers in her hair. The Victoria and Albert Museum explores her work and identity through the lens of her fashion, bringing together her clothing and personal possessions, many of which have never been publicly shown before. Her famous wardrobe has remained untouched in the 50 years since her death. Paula Crown, The Architecture of Memory (2018). Photo courtesy of PAHC/studio. Timed to the 16th Venice International Architecture Biennial, the Dallas Contemporary presents an exhibition of work by artist Paula Crown, who has turned the simple red solo cup into an architectural building unit. “Germinal” at Portugal’s Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology. The eminent sculptor Pedro Cabrita Reis was a great champion of emerging Portuguese artists in the 1990s and amassed a collection of more than 400 artworks. This is the first time that the public will have access to a selection of his treasure trove. Chris Moore, photograph of an Alexander McQueen look from Autumn/Winter 2010. Photo courtesy of the artist/the Bowes Museum. Over the last 60 years, Chris Moore has become known as the king of catwalk photography, shooting fashion shows from all the major designers: Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, John Galliano, Comme des Garҫons, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Laurent, Vivienne Westwood, and many more. In the Bowes Museum’s current exhibition, Moore’s historic images ae paired with garments on loan from the world’s foremost fashion houses. Fanette Mellier’s Poster: Specimen (2008). Photo: Matt Flynn © Smithsonian Institution. From Pantone color swatches to Sir Isaac Newton’s 18th-century color treatise, this show is a delightful romp through both the worlds of science and art. The San Francisco sensation Color Factory is participating in the exhibition with a chromatic-walkway that extends from the museum show into the garden, and corresponds with real-life colors encountered in New York City. Modernist master Constantin Brancusi transformed the field of sculpture with his sleek, elegantly simple forms, which often bordered on abstraction. MoMA has mined its own collection to present 11 sculptures by the artist as well as drawings, photographs, and archival materials.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Barclays' modest valuation could be compelling proposition.(AP) Barclays was a traditional, Quaker High Street clearing bank whose roots in Britain and its colonies literally went back centuries. The bank was a traditional and commercial bank with branches across the world Barclaycard was the best-known financial brand in the UK. The transformation of Barclays into Britain's only real bulge bracket investment bank began during London's Big Bank in 1986. I had the honour to interview Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd for the Wharton Journal and he literally predicated a transformation in global banking and the Eurobond market we both adored. My own career saw me shuttle between the Wall Street of the Sherman McCoy era and the late Mrs Thatcher's City of London, amid the trading rooms where Ivy League and Oxbridge brats moved billions of dollars of money across the digital arteries of world finance. Sir Martin and Lord Camoys knew that London's Big Bang was a game-changer event even as asset securitisation and the derivative markets changed the DNA of banking, with debt trading and capital markets the hottest game in deregulated Londonium. Not since Sir Sigmund Warburg had such visionary, cosmopolitan financiers built a global investment bank in a mere decade. Barclays exited equities, failed to compete in mergers and acquisitions with the financial gunslingers of Wall Street and incurred huge trading losses in the Asian/Russian meltdowns of 1998. This was the moment Bob Diamond, a Credit Suisse First Boston bond specialist, became chief executive of Barclays Capital and transformed it into Britain's only real bulge bracket global investment bank. I had the privilege of working with and knowing several Barclays Capital executives in London, Geneva, Dubai and Hong Kong and was awed by their prowess in trading fixed income and currencies across the world. It did not surprise me that Barclays Capital contributed 50 per cent of its parent bank's profit even before the multiple traumas of 2008 that culminated in the failure of Lehman Brothers. Bob Diamond's fall was a Sophoclean tragedy too, when hubris found its nemesis in disgrace and failure. Barclay botched a capital raising mission in the Gulf in 2008 to avert naturalisation by HM Treasury and a cap on banker bonuses, the ultimate anathema. Barclays traders were prominent in the post-crisis Libor and foreign exchange rate manipulation scandal. Bob Diamond was grilled by the House of Commons in Westminster and reputedly fired by Dr Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England. Diamond had made untold billions of dollars for Barclays shareholders but failed the basic tenets of risk compliance. Anthony Jenkins, Diamond's successor, failed to reinvent Barclays as a retail bank and lost the confidence of the board and the City's fund managers with his lack of a compelling strategic vision. Jenkins was fired in 2015 and replaced by Jes Staley, an American investment banker who has shed Barclays' African/Middle East and continental Europe footprint to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays still trades at well below tangible book value on the LSE. New York hedge fund Tiger Global has accumulated $1 billion in Barclays shares but has failed to act as a catalyst for a valuation rerating. In an age of Brexit, Barclaycard and its UK retail banking/mortgage business are obviously devalued, eclipsed by the Serious Fraud Office investigation of the 2008 capital raise and the UK mortgage misselling scandal. Barclays' modest valuation below 190 pence seems compelling to me, even in a world where the Stoxx 600 Bank Index has lost 16 per cent and is the worst-performing sector in Europe. True, the bank suffers from the flattening of the US Treasury, British gilt and German Bund yield curves and the old Lehman equities business in New York has hardly set the bottom line on fire. Thankfully, the Crown Court has dismissed criminal charges against Barclays for its 2008 capital raise since a conviction could have cost it its banking licence. Yet fund managers have still not forgiven the bank for its dividend cut or colossal litigation linked losses after the Libor scandal. Barclays paid $2 billion in March 2018 to a Department of Justice probe into the sale of toxic mortgage backed securities to investors. However, all these grim realities are amply reflected in the huge regulatory/litigation risk discount in the shares. The non-core excess baggage is gone. The Basel Tier One capital ratio has been boosted by the restructuring. When will Barclays rerate? Not now. The writer is a global equities strategist and fund manager.

Using ICFs and IFAs to enhance energy efficiency Effective sound control of doors Several U.S. projects are among the shortlisted contenders for this year’s World Architecture Festival (WAF) Awards. Now in its 11th year, the international program received more than 1000 entries from 81 countries. “This has been a terrific year for the WAF Awards, reaching our largest entry total to date,” said Paul Finch, program director. “This has not resulted in any decrease in quality—if anything the opposite. It has been extremely gratifying to review entries from more than 81 different countries and note the way in which architects are absorbing lessons from contemporaries across the world.” The shortlist contains 536 entries across 31 categories. Shortlisted projects represent a variety of building types, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, hotels, cultural/civic projects, and landscaping. Among the U.S. shortlisted projects is San Francisco’s Studio Dental II, which appears in the Health–Completed Buildings category. Designed by Montalba Architects, the facility is a redesign of a historical building in the city’s financial district, which features modern amenities and aesthetics, while simultaneously remaining true to its historic base. The Form4 Architecture-designed Innovation Curve in Palo Alto’s Stanford Research Park is cited in the category of Office–Completed Buildings. The project, which also made the shortlist in 2014 in the Future Projects category, is an open, flexible workspace design, which features sweeping metal curves that are intended as architectural metaphors for the ups and downs of exploratory research and development. Atlanta’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, designed by global design firm HOK, received mention in the Sport–Completed Buildings category. The 71,000-seat facility features eight triangular ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) “petals” that move together along 16 individual tracks, allowing the semitransparent roof to open and close like the aperture of a camera. Other shortlisted U.S. projects include: The United States is among the top five countries entering WAF 2018, alongside China, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The winners will be announced in November at the World Architecture Festival in Amsterdam. In addition to the awards presentation, the three-day event will include keynote addresses from architecture critic and theorist Charles Jencks; Caroline Bos, cofounder/principal urban planner at UNStudio; Aaron Betsky, president of the School of Architecture at Taliesin; and Sir David Adjaye, principal at Adjaye Associates, who recently spoke at AIA Conference on Architecture 2018 in New York City.

1020357,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi said they embrace tabloid gossip, to a degreebecause it means their same-sex marriage is viewed as normal, Page Six noted. ""The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,"" de Rossi told Us Weekly. ""I'm not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, 'Oh, now we're finally accepted.' We get the same st as every celebrity couple."" The Arrested Development star and DeGeneres tied the knot in 2008. Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is starting a human-rights organization called Highest Hopes Foundation, Page Six revealed. The rock singer said the nonprofit will support ""communities subject to discrimination or abuse on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity."" Panic! at the Disco will donate one dollar of each ticket from U.S. dates of its ""Pray for the Wicked Tour"" to Highest Hopes. The tour starts July 11 in Minneapolis and will also visit cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Tampa and New York City. Urie also announced on June 29 on the Today show that he's pledged a $1 million gift to GLSEN to provide resources, training, and support to students working to create student-led GSA clubs in their K-12 schools, through his foundation, a press release noted. Rolling Stone has released a list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Farand topping the list is Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love,"" ETCanada.com noted. Filling out the rest of the top five, in order, were ""Paper Planes"" by M.I.A., ""Seven Nation Army"" by The White Stripes, ""Hey Ya!"" by Outkast"" and ""99 Problems"" by Jay-Z. A few of the other songs included Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" ( #95 ), Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" ( #87 ), LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"" ( #77 ), Kendrick Lamar's ""DNA"" ( #64 ), Sia's ""Chandelier"" ( #52 ), U2's ""Beautiful Day"" ( #40 ), Outcast's ""Ms. Jackson"" ( #23 ), Adele's ""Rolling in the Deep"" ( #8 ) and Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" ( #14 ). Olympic figure skater and Dancing with the Stars winner Adam Ripponthe first openly gay U.S. athlete to medal in the competitionrecently explained in InStyle how, for him, coming out was ( and still is ) an ongoing process. In part, he stated, ""My coming-out wasn't one moment. It's a process never really ends. Coming out is about about finding out who you are in stages, through moments of self-discovery."" An executive in the luxury Hakkasan nightclub firm, Beth Bartolini, caused controversy after calling Katy Perry BFF and nightlife maven Markus Molinari a ""tr—ny"" in a text messagethen accidentally sending it to him, Page Six noted. Molinari posted the misdirected texts to Instagram, and received support from Hollywood pals Milla Jovovich, Lydia Hearst and Mia Moretti. Molinari posted Bartolini's texts with the caption: ""Normally I wouldn't reply or give any attention to negativity people may say about me because it doesn't effect my universe, but it being PRIDE MONTH and you being a longtime 'friend' I decided to post this because this type of bullying/ignorance/ and just out right mean girl behavior should NEVER be tolerated & should be brought to light."" Bette Midler was accused of homophobia after posting ae tweet about President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Gay Star News noted. ""Trump and Putin are meeting in Finland next month,' she wrote., adding, ""That's a long way to travel for a blowjob, but hey  Putin's got the money."" Some criticized Midler, while others defended her. In 2016, Midler apologized after a transphobic tweet about Caitlyn Jenner. One lucky queen took home the crown on the season-10 finale of RuPaul's Drag Racebut the episode itself scored a win of its own, EW.com noted. VH1 announced the grand finalewhich ( spoiler alert ) had New York City native Aquaria winning the titlebroke a ratings record for the Emmy-winning reality series, posting its most-watched conclusion in its nine-year history. Roughly 527,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic tuned in to watch the finale. Terry Crews said he was threatened with retaliation for speaking out about a sexual assault by a Hollywood agent, saying the producer of The Expendables 4 warned of vague ""troubles"" unless he withdraws his civil suit, according to Deadline.com . In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Crews said Expendables producer Avi Lerner called his manager and asked that the actor to drop his sexual-assault case against Adam Venit in order to appear in the fourth installment of the action film. Lerner himself has been sued for sexual harassment, hostile work environment and gender discrimination by a woman identified only as Jane Roe. On a related note, rapper/actor 50 Cent ridiculed Terry Crews for testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is a survivor of sexual assault, Out.com revealed. The rapper took to Instagram to post a photo of Crews shirtless with the words, ""I got raped / My wife just watched"" and then another photo of Crews with a rose in his mouth that said ""Gym time."" The post has since been taken down. Crews told TMZ of 50's post, ""I prove that size doesn't matter when it comes to sexual assault."" NBC has made a final decision on the show Champions, opting not to renew the freshman comedy for a second season, Deadline noted. Reportedly, there have been discussions with Netflix about picking up the series. Created by Charlie Grandy and Mindy Kaling, Champions centers on Vince ( Anders Holm ), a gym owner who lives with his younger brother, Matthew ( Andy Favreau ), and is on the verge of secretly selling the gym and moving to Florida when his high school fling, Priya ( recurring guest star Kaling ), unexpectedly drops off their 15-year-old son, Michael ( J.J. Totah ) on his doorstep. Totah, who's out, was often applauded for his depiction of an openly gay teen. Lee Daniels has been slapped with a $5 million lawsuit by Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder Damon Dash, who alleges that Daniels stiffed him out of a producer credit on a biopic about legendary comedian Richard Pryor, TheWrap reported. The suit says that attorneys for both sides went back and forth for years in an effort to mediate the situation. Alleging breach of contract and other counts, the suit seeks damages ""in an amount to be determined at trial, but estimated at no less than $5 million."" ""He believed in me when nobody else did,"" Daniels later said of Dash, with a promise to end the lawsuit, Deadline noted. A judge has ordered Sony to disclose the names of people it interviewed as part of an internal investigation into its former Kemosabe Records CEO Dr. Lukefollowing claims by singer Kesha that he raped her, Page Six noted. The record label has previously argued that information is protected by attorney-client privilege, but Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter disagreed in her order, demanding they name names within 20 days. Dr. Lukereal name Lukasz Gottwaldsued Kesha in 2014 after she went public with allegations that he'd raped her. Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse is teaming with tennis champion Serena Williams to fight domestic abuse, ReelChicago.com noted. Since 2005, Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse has empowered more than 1.3 million survivors on the road to safety and security through its educational resources, including The Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse Moving Ahead curriculum. Beginning this summer, Purple Purse will team with female artists in six cities: New York, Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles; Williams unveiled the first mural, by artist Isabel Castillo Guijarro, in New York City. Sony Music Entertainment announced y that it has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Prince's estate for 35 previously released albums from the legendary musician's catalog, CBS Los Angeles noted. The music will be distributed by Legacy Recordings, a division of SMEwith worldwide rights beginning immediately for 19 previously released album titles originally released between 1995-2010. However, several of Prince's biggest albums, including Purple Rain, are not part of the new deal due to their status as soundtrack recordings, Complex added. Camila Cabello has become the first artist to top the Billboard pop and adult pop charts with the first two songs from a debut album, according to the publication. Cabello's ""Never Be the Same"" reaced the top of Billboard's Adult Pop Songs radio airplay chart, dated June 30. The set's lead single, ""Havana,"" featuring Young Thug, led Pop Songs for seven weeks ( beginning Dec. 9 ) and Adult Pop Songs for one frame ( March 3 ). Multi-platinum award-winning singer/songwriter and global superstar Josh Groban announced his eighth studio album, Bridges, which will be released on Sept. 21 via Reprise Records, a press release noted. The album is available for pre-order at joshgroban.lnk.to/Bridges, and fans who pre-order the album will receive three downloads of new songs including the new single, ""Granted,"" along with songs ""Symphony"" and ""S'il Suffisait D'Aimer."" The album will also be available as in a deluxe version with two bonus tracks. Oscar winner Jared Leto ( Dallas Buyers Club ) will star in and Daniel Espinosa will direct Morbius, based on the Marvel comic, TheWrap.com noted. The Morbius character was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic book in 1971. In the comics, Michael Morbius is a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who is transformed into a vampire while attempting to cure a rare blood disease. A Manhattan judge had a message for Madonna: Stop messing with your neighbors, Page Six noted. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gerald Lebovits said the pop superstar was ""merely harassing"" fellow residents of her Upper West Side co-op for continuing to seek records from the board after she lost a legal bid challenging a rule that required her to be physically present in her $7.3-million home when any of her family or staff are there. Drake has confirmed that he is a fathervia music on his new album, Scorpion, JustJared.com noted. The rumors dropped over a year ago that Drake got former porn star Sophie Brussaux pregnant and now he finally is confirming that he is the father of her baby. On the song ""Emotionless,"" Drake raps, ""I wasn't hiding my kid from the world, I was hiding the world from my kid."" Following a $20-million suit over his song ""Photograph"" ( which was settled out of court ) and another over ""The Rest of Our Life,"" which he composed for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, singer Ed Sheeran is facing another lawsuit over ""Thinking Out Loud,"" Variety noted. Owners of that song's copyright claims that it lifts from Marvin Gaye's 1972 classic ""Let's Get It On"" and are seeking $100 million in damages. Neon has acquired worldwide rights to Sharp Edges, a 1986 documentary about Tonya Harding competing at the National Figure Skating Championships at the age of 15, Page Six reported. Yale University student Sandra Luckow made the film as part of her senior thesis. It follows Harding going to her first National Figure Skating Championships, where she placed sixth. The movie features interviews with Harding and her mother, LaVona Golden. ( Alison Janney won an Oscar this year for portraying Golden in the film I, Tonya. ) Already facing rape and criminal sex act charges and a potential 25 years behind bars, Harvey Weinstein has been hit with even heavier legal weight from the Manhattan D.A.that could see him in jail for life, Deadline noted. ""A Manhattan Grand Jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York's Penal Law,"" said District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Joining the two women identified in the previous indictment in late May, the new indictment also includes two counts of predatory sexual assault. In a new interview, Australian actor Guy Pearce suggested that Kevin Spacey inappropriately touched him during their time together filming the 1997 movie L.A. Confidential, TheWrap noted. When asked by TV host Andrew Denton about his time working with Spacey, Pearce said, ""Yeah… yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor; incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He's a handsy guy. ... Thankfully I was 29, and not 14."" Actress Heather Locklear has gone to rehab, according to a Page Six item that cites TMZ. The former Melrose Place star voluntarily agreed to check herself into a long-term treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health issues after she spent time in a psychiatric ward. She was recently arrested after drinking a bottle of tequila, crashing her Porsche at her California mansion and then attacking cops when they arrived. Wynonna Judd's daughter, Grace Pauline Kelley, has been sentenced to eight years in prison after violating probation in November, according to Page Six, which cited Radar Online. The country star's 22-year-old daughter has landed herself time at West Tennessee State Penitentiary after leaving a drug recovery program last year and violating her probation. Jerry Seinfeld questioned ABC's decision to cancel Roseanne Barr's rebooted sitcom in the wake of her incendiary tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, TheWrap noted. ""I didn't see why it was necessary to fire her,"" Seinfeld told Entertainment Tonight ""Why would you murder someone who's committing suicide? ""I think they should get another Roseanne. They brought Dan Conner backhe was dead and they brought him back. So, why can't we get another Roseanne?""

There were 25 area golfers who left home on Tuesday, June 26 heading to Olde Mill Golf Resort in heavy fog and 100% rain in the forecast to participate in the Laidback Golf Tours first MAJOR of this season. Upon arrival they found the fog lifted and a beautiful seventy degree overcast perfect golfing day. It was like God had an umbrella over the course as clouds and rain mist surrounded the area. The fifty- year old breath-taking Ellis Maples designed course again proved it’s worth giving up only three rounds in the seventies, one eagle and twenty birdies to the entire field. The A Flight had to be determined by a play-off by the same top two finishers from the 2017 event here. Both David Turner and Steve Cummings finished regulation play tied at 76. They proceeded to the par 5 first hole where the both made par. On the second play-off hole a par 3; David Turner claimed his first win of this season as he again made par while Cummings bogied the hole. This was the third year in a row Turner has taken the top spot here at Olde Mill. Turner also claimed a skin with one of his three birdies of the day. Cummings got his fourth second place finish of the season to go along with one win in his five season starts. Johnny Gauldin collected third place with his round of 78. Danny Daniel captured his first win of the season by carding two birdies for a score of 84 in the B Flight. Both his birdies were capped by Turner in the skins game but aided in holding off second place finisher Lyle Heath. Heath who was playing in his first tournament of the season had one birdie on his way to finishing at 86. Tony Burtt shot ten strokes below his average today in the C Flight. Burtt whose average score is 92 posted three birdies today and turned in a score of 82. It was his second lowest round in four seasons on the Tour and gave him his first win since the two he won back in 2016. Mike Reynolds claimed the flight’s second place with his round of 86. This was Reynold’s second outing since joining the Tour. Brian Martin has only played in two tournaments this season due to his work schedule but has won both times. Martin carded one birdie on his way to claiming his second win of the season in D Flight with a score of 87. Jody Myers who won the flight here back in 2016 finished second today with a score of 89. It was Myers first outing of the season also due to heavy work schedule.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Sarah Butcher 28 June 2018 Bob Diamond is a busy man. After taking over loss-making British stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon in March 2017, the former CEO of Barclays this week invested in Kepler Cheuvreux, a French brokerage firm created from the combination of the former equity brokerage arms of Crédit Agricole, Julius Baer, UniCredit, Dexia, Swedbank and Rabobank. Diamond now owns 27.7% of Kepler Cheuvreux in a deal funded by his Atlas Merchant Capital investment vehicle and by Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies. - He's up to something. That something may well involve expanding his new mid-cap empire. Diamond's hiring intentions at Panmure are well known. In April, the British bank hired Bill Dale, formerly head of research at Nomura, to expand its coverage of small and mid-cap companies in the UK. In May, Panmure also let it be known that it plans to double its UK headcount as it pushes into corporate finance. What's less well known is that there's been quite a lot of hiring at Panmure already. Analysis of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register suggests that the number of registered employees at Panmure has risen 17% since Diamond took the helm 15 months ago. Following the addition of 13 people, Panmure Gordon now has 88 UK registered employees in total. Recent additions include Emma Earl as a director in corporate finance (formerly of Cairn Financial Advisors), Charles Lesser as head of natural resources banking (formerly of Macquarie), Matthew Webb as an equity researcher covering food and beverages (also formerly of Macquarie), and Sandra Bjorck as an associate in the investment bank. There have also been a handful of exits, including Duncan Monteith, a healthcare banker who went to Numis, and Mark McGuinness, a sales trader who left in February 2018 and has yet to resurface. Even so, the direction of travel is clear. Not everyone at Kepler Cheuvreux is enamoured of their new part-owner. ""Everything in the press concerning us is now about Bob Diamond,"" says one senior employee at the French firm. ""But he is just one of several shareholders and doesn't have the controlling vote. Our aspirations are much bigger than Bob."" Laurent Quirin, chairman of Kepler's advisory board, said Diamond's investment will help the brokerage expand globally in an environment where MiFID II and bank disintermediation are creating opportunities. Kepler's traditional method of growth has been to create alliances with banks looking to outsource business areas, although Quirin said there may be organic growth too. Some market observers have suggested that Diamond could look to combine Panmure and Kepler - a move which could lead to layoffs in London, where both firms have equity brokerage staff. The insiders we spoke to suggested this is unlikely, however. ""This is just about growth,"" said one. ""Kepler is looking for expansion opportunities both internally and through external alliances."" Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you’d like to share?

Ex-Barclays CEO Bob Diamond’s investment vehicle Atlas Merchant Capital and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild’s equity strategy arm have acquired stakes in French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux. Atlas acquired a 19.7% stake in Kepler Cheuvreux, while Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies (ERES) acquired an interest of 8%. Purchase prices were not revealed. Last year, Atlas partnered Qatari investment firm Qinvest to buy UK-based stockbroker Panmure Gordon. Atlas managing director and head of UK and European business Matthew Hansen said: “The decision to invest in Kepler Cheuvreux was based on an analysis of their market leading positions in pan-European Research, Advisory and Execution. In Research, which is the cornerstone of their business, they have the largest research coverage in mainland Europe and are prospering in the post Mifid II research environment. “The Advisory business is perfectly suited to the firm’s partnership model. In Execution, they have an algorithmic trading capability which competes head-to-head with the global brokers.” The French broker also has equity capital markets partnerships with UniCredit, Credit Agricole CIB, Rabobank, Swedbank and Belfius. Italian lender UniCredit has now increased its stake from 5.2% to 10.3% in Kepler Cheuvreux, while French private equity firm BlackFin Capital Partners and its co-investors have offloaded their stake. The shareholding changes are subject to regulatory nod. Kepler Cheuvreux chairman of the supervisory board Laurent Quirin said: “We now look to leverage the contacts and expertise of Atlas Merchant Capital and Bob Diamond, its founding partner and CEO, on a global scale. “Both Atlas and ERES will help us to invest in our organic expansion and in our targeted acquisition strategy. We believe that Mifid II and bank disintermediation create opportunities. We envisage signing more alliances with banks which are looking to outsource processes or businesses.” Kepler Cheuvreux offers research, execution and advisory services. The group employs nearly 550 staff across offices in Paris, Amsterdam, Boston, Brussels, Frankfurt, Geneva, London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Oslo, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Thu 28 Jun 2018 01.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 4 Jul 2018 06.14 EDT ‘Guys, you’ve got to hear this,” I said. I was sitting in front of my computer one day in July 2012, with one eye on a screen of share prices and the other on a live stream of the House of Commons Treasury select committee hearings. As the Barclays share price took a graceful swan dive, I pulled my headphones out of the socket and turned up the volume so everyone could hear. My colleagues left their terminals and came around to watch BBC Parliament with me. It didn’t take long to realise what was happening. “Bob’s getting murdered,” someone said. Bob Diamond, the swashbuckling chief executive of Barclays, had been called before the committee to explain exactly what his bank had been playing at in regards to the Libor rate-fixing scandal. The day before his appearance, he had made things very much worse by seeming to accuse the deputy governor of the Bank of England of ordering him to fiddle an important benchmark, then walking back the accusation as soon as it was challenged. He was trying to turn on his legendary charm in front of a committee of angry MPs, and it wasn’t working. On our trading floor, in Mayfair, calls were coming in from all over the City. Investors needed to know what was happening and whether the damage was reparable. A couple of weeks later, the damage was done. The money was gone, Diamond was out of a job and the market, as it always does, had moved on. We were left asking ourselves: How did we get it so wrong? At the time I was working for a French stockbroking firm, on the team responsible for the banking sector. I was the team’s regulation specialist. I had been aware of “the Libor affair”, and had written about it on several occasions during the previous months. My colleagues and I had assumed that it would be the typical kind of regulatory risk for the banks – a slap on the wrist, a few hundred million dollars of fines, no more than that. The first puzzle was that, to start with, it looked like we were right. By the time it caught the attention of the mainstream media, the Libor scandal had reached what would usually be the end of the story – the announcement, on 27 June 2012, of a regulatory sanction. Barclays had admitted a set of facts, made undertakings not to do anything similar again, and agreed to pay fines of £59.5m to the UK’s Financial Services Authority, $200m to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a further $160m to the US Department of Justice. That’s how these things are usually dealt with. If anything, it was considered quite a tough penalty. But the Libor case marked the beginning of a new process for the regulators. As well as publishing their judgment, they gave a long summary of the evidence and reasoning that led to their decision. In the case of the Libor fines, the majority of that evidence took the form of transcripts of emails and Bloomberg chat. Bloomberg’s trading terminals – the $50,000-a-year news and financial-data servers that every trader uses – have an instant-messaging function in addition to supplying prices and transmitting news. Financial market professionals are vastly more addicted to this chat than tween girls are to Instagram, and many of them failed to realise that if you discussed illegal activity on this medium, you were making things easy for the authorities. The transcripts left no room for doubt. Trader C: “The big day [has] arrived … My NYK are screaming at me about an unchanged 3m libor. As always, any help wd be greatly appreciated. What do you think you’ll go for 3m?” Submitter: “I am going 90 altho 91 is what I should be posting.” Trader C: “[…] when I retire and write a book about this business your name will be written in golden letters […]”. Submitter: “I would prefer this [to] not be in any book!” Perhaps it’s unfair to judge the Libor conspirators on their chat records; few of the journalists who covered the story would like to see their own Twitter direct-message history paraded in front of an angry public. Trading, for all its bluster, is basically a service industry, and there is no service industry anywhere in the world whose employees don’t blow off steam by acting out or insulting the customers behind their backs. But traders tend to have more than the usual level of self-confidence, bordering on arrogance. And in a general climate in which the public was both unhappy with the banking industry and unimpressed with casual banter about ostentatious displays of wealth, the Libor transcripts appeared crass beyond belief. Every single popular stereotype about traders was confirmed. An abstruse and technical set of regulatory breaches suddenly became a morality play, a story of swaggering villains who fixed the market as if it was a horse race. The politicians could hardly have failed to get involved. It is not a pleasant thing to see your industry subjected to criticism that is at once overheated, ill-informed and entirely justified. In 2012, the financial sector finally got the kind of enemies it deserved. The popular version of events might have been oversimplified and wrong in lots of technical detail, but in the broad sweep, it was right. The nuanced and technical version of events which the specialists obsessed over might have been right on the detail, but it missed one utterly crucial point: a massive crime of dishonesty had taken place. There was a word for what had happened, and that word was fraud. For a period of months, it seemed to me as if the more you knew about the Libor scandal, the less you understood it. That’s how we got it so wrong. We were looking for incidental breaches of technical regulations, not systematic crime. And the thing is, that’s normal. The nature of fraud is that it works outside your field of vision, subverting the normal checks and balances so that the world changes while the picture stays the same. People in financial markets have been missing the wood for the trees for as long as there have been markets. Some places in the world are what they call “low-trust societies”. The political institutions are fragile and corrupt, business practices are dodgy, debts are rarely repaid and people rightly fear being ripped off on any transaction. In the “high-trust societies”, conversely, businesses are honest, laws are fair and consistently enforced, and the majority of people can go about their day in the knowledge that the overall level of integrity in economic life is very high. With that in mind, and given what we know about the following two countries, why is it that the Canadian financial sector is so fraud-ridden that Joe Queenan, writing in Forbes magazine in 1989, nicknamed Vancouver the “Scam Capital of the World”, while shipowners in Greece will regularly do multimillion-dollar deals on a handshake? We might call this the “Canadian paradox”. There are different kinds of dishonesty in the world. The most profitable kind is commercial fraud, and commercial fraud is parasitical on the overall health of the business sector on which it preys. It is much more difficult to be a fraudster in a society in which people only do business with relatives, or where commerce is based on family networks going back centuries. It is much easier to carry out a securities fraud in a market where dishonesty is the rare exception rather than the everyday rule. The existence of the Canadian paradox suggests that there is a specifically economic dimension to a certain kind of crime of dishonesty. Trust – particularly between complete strangers, with no interactions beside relatively anonymous market transactions – is the basis of the modern industrial economy. And the story of the development of the modern economy is in large part the story of the invention and improvement of technologies and institutions for managing that trust. And as industrial society develops, it becomes easier to be a victim. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described how prosperity derived from the division of labour – the 18 distinct operations that went into the manufacture of a pin, for example. While this was going on, the modern world also saw a growing division of trust. The more a society benefits from the division of labour in checking up on things, the further you can go into a con game before you realise that you’re in one. In the case of several dealers in the Libor market, by the time anyone realised something was crooked, they were several billions of dollars in over their heads. In hindsight, the Libor system was always a shoddy piece of work. Some not-very-well-paid clerks from the British Bankers’ Association would call up a few dozen banks and ask: “If you were to borrow, say, a million dollars in [a given currency] for a 30-day deposit, what would you expect to pay?” A deposit, in this context, is a short-term loan from one bank to another. Due to customers’ inconvenient habit of borrowing from one bank and putting the money in an account at another, banks are constantly left with either surplus customer deposits, or a shortage of funds. The “London inter-bank offered-rate” (Libor) market is where they sort this out by borrowing from and lending to each other, at the “offered rate” of interest. Once they had their answers, the clerks would throw away the highest and lowest outliers and calculate the average of the rest, which would be recorded as “30-day Libor” for that currency. The process would be repeated for three-month loans, six-month loans and any other periods of interest, and the rates would be published. You would then have a little table recording the state of the market on that day – you could decide which currency you wanted to borrow in, and how long you wanted the use of the money, and the Libor panel would give you a good sense of what high-quality banks were paying to do the same. Compared with the amount of time and effort that goes into the systems for nearly everything else that banks do, not very much trouble was taken over this process. Other markets rose and fell, stock exchanges mutated and were taken over by super-fast robots, but the Libor rate for the day was still determined by a process that could be termed “a quick ring-around”. Nobody noticed until it was too late that hundreds of trillions of dollars of the world economy rested on a number compiled by the few dozen people in the world with the greatest incentive to fiddle it. It started to fall apart with the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, and all the more so after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when banks were so scared that they effectively stopped lending to each other. Although the market was completely frozen, the daily Libor ring-around still took place, and banks still gave, almost entirely speculatively, answers to the question “If you were to borrow a reasonable sum, what would you expect to pay?” But the daily quotes were published, and that meant everyone could see what everyone else was saying about their funding costs. And one of the telltale signs that a bank in trouble is when its funding costs start to rise. If your Libor submission is taken as an indicator of whether you’re in trouble or not, you really don’t want to be the highest number on the daily list. Naturally, then, quite a few banks started using the Libor submission process as a form of false advertising, putting in a lowballed quote in order to make it look like they were still obtaining money easily when, in fact, they could hardly borrow at all. And so it came to pass that several banks created internal message trails saying, in effect, “Dear Lowly Employee, for the benefit of the bank and its shareholders, please start submitting a lower Libor quote, signed Senior Executive”. This turned out to be a silly thing to do. All this was known at the time. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about it. I used to prepare PowerPoint slides with charts on them that had gaps for the year 2008 because the data was “somewhat hypothetical”. Even earlier, in late 2007, the Bank of England held a “liaison group” meeting so that representatives from the banks could discuss the issue of Libor reporting. What nobody seemed to realise is that an ongoing fraud was being committed. There was a conspiracy to tell a lie (to the Libor phone panel, about a bank’s true cost of funding) in order to induce someone to enter into a bargain at a disadvantage to themselves. The general public caught on to all this a lot quicker than the experts did, which put the last nail in the coffin of the already weakened trust in the financial system. You could make a case that a lot of the populist politics of the subsequent decade can be traced back to the Libor affair. Libor teaches us a valuable lesson about commercial fraud – that unlike other crimes, it has a problem of denial as well as one of detection. There are very few other criminal acts where the victim not only consents to the criminal act, but voluntarily transfers the money or valuable goods to the criminal. And the hierarchies, status distinctions and networks that make up a modern economy also create powerful psychological barriers against seeing fraud when it is happening. White-collar crime is partly defined by the kind of person who commits it: a person of high status in the community, the kind of person who is always given the benefit of the doubt. In popular culture, the fraudster is the “confidence man”, somewhere between a stage magician and the trickster gods of mythology. In films such as The Sting and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, they are master psychologists, exploiting the greed and myopia of their victims, and creating a world of illusion. People like this do exist (albeit rarely). But they are not typical of white-collar criminals. The interesting questions are never about individual psychology. There are plenty of larger-than-life characters. But there are also plenty of people like Enron’s Jeff Skilling and Baring’s Nick Leeson: aggressively dull clerks and managers whose only interest derives from the disasters they caused. And even for the real craftsmen, the actual work is, of necessity, incredibly prosaic. The way most white-collar crime works is by manipulating institutional psychology. That means creating something that looks as much as possible like a normal set of transactions. The drama comes later, when it all unwinds. Fraudsters don’t play on moral weaknesses, greed or fear; they play on weaknesses in the system of checks and balances – the audit processes that are meant to supplement an overall environment of trust. One point that comes up again and again when looking at famous and large-scale frauds is that, in many cases, everything could have been brought to a halt at a very early stage if anyone had taken care to confirm all the facts. But nobody does confirm all the facts. There are just too bloody many of them. Even after the financial rubble has settled and the arrests been made, this is a huge problem. It is a commonplace of law enforcement that commercial frauds are difficult to prosecute. In many countries, proposals have been made, and sometimes passed into law, to remove juries from complex fraud trials, or to move the task of dealing with them out of the criminal justice system and into regulatory or other non-judicial processes. Such moves are understandable. There is a need to be seen to get prosecutions and to maintain confidence in the whole system. However, taking the opinions of the general public out of the question seems to me to be a counsel of despair. When analysed properly, there isn’t much that is truly difficult about the proverbial “complex fraud trial”. The underlying crime is often surprisingly crude: someone did something dishonest and enriched themselves at the expense of others. What makes white-collar trials so arduous for jurors is really their length, and the amount of detail that needs to be brought for a successful conviction. Such trials are not long and detailed because there is anything difficult to understand. They are long and difficult because so many liars are involved, and when a case has a lot of liars, it takes time and evidence to establish that they are lying. This state of affairs is actually quite uncommon in the criminal justice system. Most trials only have a couple of liars in the witness box, and the question is a simple one of whether the accused did it or not. In a fraud trial, rather than denying responsibility for the actions involved, the defendant is often insisting that no crime was committed at all, that there is an innocent interpretation for everything. In January this year, the construction giant Carillion collapsed. Although they had issued a profits warning last summer, they continued to land government contracts. It was assumed that, since they had been audited by KPMG, one of the big-four accounting firms, any serious problems would have been spotted. At the time of writing, nobody has been prosecuted over the collapse of Carillion. Maybe nobody will and maybe nobody should. It’s possible, after all, for a big firm to go bust, even really suddenly, without it being a result of anything culpable. But the accounting looks weird – at the very least, they seem to have recognised revenue a long time before it actually arrived. It’s not surprising that the accounting standards bodies are asking some questions. So are the Treasury select committee: one MP told a partner at KPMG that “I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge.” In general, cases of major fraud should have been prevented by auditors, whose specific job it is to review every set of accounts as a neutral outside party, and certify that they are a true and fair view of the business. But they don’t always do this. Why not? The answer is simple: some auditors are willing to bend the rules, and some are too easily fooled. And whatever reforms are made to the accounting standards and to the rules governing the profession, the same problems have cropped up again and again. First, there is the problem that the vast majority of auditors are both honest and competent. This is a good thing, of course, but the bad thing about it is that it means that most people have never met a crooked or incompetent auditor, and therefore have no real understanding that such people exist. To find a really bad guy at a big-four accountancy firm, you have to be quite unlucky (or quite lucky if that was what you were looking for). But as a crooked manager of a company, churning around your auditors until you find a bad ’un is exactly what you do – and when you find one, you hang on to them. This means that the bad auditors are gravitationally drawn into auditing the bad companies, while the majority of the profession has an unrepresentative view of how likely that could be. Second, there is the problem that even if an auditor is both honest and competent, he has to have a spine, or he might as well not be. Fraudsters can be both persistent and overbearing, and not all the people who went into accountancy firms out of university did so because they were commanding, alpha-type personalities. Added to this, fraudsters are really keen on going over auditors’ heads and complaining to their bosses at the accounting firm, claiming that the auditor is being unhelpful and bureaucratic, not allowing the CEO to use his legitimate judgment in presenting the results of his own business. Partly because auditors are often awful stick-in-the-muds and arse-coverers, and partly because auditing is a surprisingly competitive and unprofitable business that is typically used as a loss-leader to sell more remunerative consulting and IT work, you can’t assume that the auditor’s boss will support their employee, even though the employee is the one placing their signature (and the reputation of the whole practice) on the set of accounts. As with several other patterns of behaviour that tend to generate frauds, the dynamic by which a difficult audit partner gets overruled or removed happens so often, and reproduces itself so exactly, that it must reflect a fairly deep and ubiquitous incentive problem that will be very difficult to remove. By way of a second line of defence, investors and brokerage firms often employ their own “analysts” to critically read sets of published accounts. The analyst is meant to be an industry expert, with enough financial training to read company accounts and to carry out valuations of companies and other assets. Although their primary job is to identify profitable opportunities in securities trading – shares or bonds that are either very undervalued or very overvalued – it would surely seem to be the case that part of this job would involve the identification of companies that are very overvalued because they are frauds. Well, sometimes it works. A set of fraudulent accounts will often generate “tells”. In particular, fraudsters in a hurry, or with limited ability to browbeat the auditors, will not be able to fake the balance sheet to match the way they have faked the profits. Inflated sales might show up as having been carried out without need for inventories, and without any trace of the cash they should have generated. Analysts are also often good at spotting practices such as “channel stuffing”, when a company (usually one with a highly motivated and target-oriented sales force) sells a lot of product to wholesalers and intermediaries towards the end of the quarter, booking sales and moving inventory off its books. This makes growth look good in the short term, at the expense of future sales. Often, an honest auditor who has buckled under pressure will include a cryptic-looking passage of legalese, buried in the notes to the accounts, explaining what accounting treatment has been used, and hoping that someone will read it and understand that the significance of this note is that all of the headline numbers are fake. Nearly all of the fraudulent accounting policies adopted by Enron could have been deduced from its public filings if you knew where to look. More common is the situation that prevailed in the period immediately preceding the global financial crisis.Analysts occasionally noticed that some things didn’t add up, and said so, and one or two of them wrote reports that, if taken seriously, could have been seen as prescient warnings. The problem is that spotting frauds is difficult and, for the majority of investors, not worth expending the effort on. That means it is not worth it for most analysts, either. Frauds are rare. Frauds that can be spotted by careful analysis are even rarer. And frauds that are also large enough to offer serious rewards for betting against them come along roughly once every business cycle, in waves. Analysts are also subject to very similar pressures to those that cause auditors to compromise their principles. Anyone accusing a company publicly of being a fraud is taking a big risk, and can expect significant retaliation. It is well to remember that frauds generally look like very successful companies, and there are sound accounting reasons for this. It is not just that once you have decided to fiddle the accounts you might as well make them look great rather than mediocre. If you are extracting cash fraudulently, you usually need to be growing the fake earnings at a higher rate. So people who are correctly identifying frauds can often look like they are jealously attacking success. Frauds also tend to carry out lots of financial transactions and pay large commissions to investment banks, all the while making investors believe they are rich. The psychological barriers against questioning a successful CEO are not quite as powerful as those against questioning the honesty of a doctor or lawyer, but they are substantial. And finally, most analysts’ opinions are not read. A fraudster does not have to fool everyone; he just needs to fool enough people to get his money. If you are looking to the financial system to protect investors, you are going to end up being disappointed. But this is inevitable. Investors don’t want to be protected from fraud; they want to invest. Since the invention of stock markets, there has been surprisingly little correlation between the amount of fraud in a market and the return to investors. It’s been credibly estimated that in the Victorian era, one in six companies floated on the London Stock Exchange was a fraud. But people got rich. It’s the Canadian paradox. Although in the short term, you save your money by checking everything out, in the long term, success goes to those who trust.

1011876,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"German-born conductor Christian Reif, described as ""the complete package"" by the San Francisco Chronicle, makes his New York conducting debut on Thursday, August 2, 2018 at 7:30 pm at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, part of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival. A former conducting student of Alan Gilbert at The Juilliard School, Reif leads the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE) in a program celebrating the fusion of piano and technology, centered around John Adams's Grand Pianola Music. The concert also includes Courtney Bryan's Songs of Laughing, Smiling, and Crying and a newly revised version of George Lewis's epic chamber piece Voyager using Artificial Intelligence technology. One of the most promising conducting talents of his generation, Christian Reif is currently the Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony and Music Director of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra. He began his tenure in San Francisco during the 2016-17 season following two years in Miami as Conducting Fellow with the New World Symphony, working closely with Michael Tilson Thomas. His April 2018 San Francisco Symphony subscription concerts prompted Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle to write: ""He's a conductor of considerable stature, and everything felt like the work of a significant musical artist."" In the 2018-19 season, Reif will conduct Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and the world premiere of Andrew Norman's Cello Concerto with Johannes Moser on subscription with the San Francisco Symphony and a program that includes works by Britten, Shostakovich and Haydn with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. Additionally, he will make debuts with the Indianapolis Symphony, Omaha Symphony, and Hong Kong Philharmonic and return to work with the Berkeley Symphony and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He will also conduct a production of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at Opera San Jose and a new chamber version of John Adams's El Niño with the American Modern Opera Company as part the Metropolitan Museum of Art's MetLiveArts series in New York. In the 2017-18 season, Reif made a highly praised subscription debut with the San Francisco Symphony and led concerts with the Orchestre National de Lyon, Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, Brucknerorchester Linz and Berkeley Symphony. As part of his duties as Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, Reif regularly conducts the orchestra in many different concert formats, including performances of Hansel and Gretel, an Oktoberfest concert, and two successful Soundbox shows - the orchestra's cutting-edge late-night series. Previous performance highlights include the Juilliard Orchestra, Israel Chamber Orchestra, Nürnberger Symphoniker, Meininger Hofkapelle, Georgian Chamber Orchestra, Salzburg Chamber Soloists and the Munich Chamber Opera in performances of Mozart's La finta semplice. Reif was a Conducting Fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center in the summers of 2015 and 2016. During his time there, he stepped in for Seiji Ozawa to conduct the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland, and he led the TMC Orchestra in Shostakovich's 14th Symphony with soprano Dawn Upshaw, baritone Sanford Sylvan and TMC vocalists. He has worked as cover conductor for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and New York Philharmonic at the NY PHIL BIENNIAL. Reif's enthusiasm in performing contemporary music has led to several world premieres. Among those are Michael Gordon's El Sol Caliente - a city symphony in honor of Miami Beach's centennial - and concertos for DJ and orchestra performed at New World Symphony PULSE events where the concert hall is transformed into a nightclub. A dedicated and enthusiastic educator, Reif has taught piano, and he coaches instrumentalists and works with singers as a répétiteur. He has worked as a Teaching Fellow in the Juilliard School's Ear Training Department and a Music Master Teacher in Miami's National YoungArts Foundation. In his work at the New World Symphony from 2014 to 2016, he regularly hosted and conducted the orchestra's education concerts which were viewed by a global online audience. Christian Reif studied with Alan Gilbert at the Juilliard School, where he completed his Master of Music in Conducting in 2014 and received the Charles Schiff Conducting Award. Prior to that, he studied with Dennis Russell Davies at the Mozarteum Salzburg, where he received a diploma in 2012. He is winner of the 2015 German Operetta Prize, awarded by the German Music Council, and two Kulturförderpreise awards given to promising artists of the region who promote cultural advancement in their communities. Reif is a member of Germany's Conductor's Forum (Dirigentenforum) and is one of the forum's 2017-18 and 2018-19 featured ""Maestros of Tomorrow"".

1016437,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The Team Sky rider shows he's in good form ahead of the Tour de France, winning with a substantial margin Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) at the British National Time Trial. Image: SWPix Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) will wear the stripes of British national time trial champion in the year ahead, having bettered second place rider Harry Tanfield (Canyon-Eisburg) by over half a minute. Tanfield – who had trained on the roads and knew them well – crossed the line in 49 minutes 31 seconds to Thomas’ 48-54. Third place went to five-time National champion, Alex Dowsett (Team Katusha-Alpecin) in 49-48. Defending champion Steve Cummings (Team Dimension Data) did not take to the start line of the 39.7 kilometre course. Tao Geoghegan Hart (Team Sky) set a benchmark at the first intermediate time check, with a time of 18-14. Tanfield was the first rider to post a faster split of 17-38. Tanfield – like his brother Charlie who won the under-23 race – had trained on the course, but Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) showed his post Critérium du Dauphiné form by cruising through in 17-25. Dowsett was not able to match the pace, at 17-45. The second intermediate time check saw Thomas clock 31-16, to Tanfield’s 31-46, Dowsett continuing to lose time to his rivals with 32-03. At the finish, John Archibald (Ribble Cycling) was left in the hot seat for a considerable period, with a finishing time of 50-41. Even Geoghegan Hart – who posted an intermediate time check 15 seconds faster – was not able to better him, clocking a finish time of 51-00 to hold second place until the leaders rolled in. The first rider to knock Archibald off the top spot was Tanfield, but Thomas quickly followed, with Dowsett eventually pushing him off the podium. Archibald was able to hold on to fourth – still an impressive performance for the Scottish rider. Last year’s under-23 champion, Chris Lawless (Team Sky) did not make it to the finish, with reports suggesting he crashed out during the race. “It’s great. Winning Dauphiné was a big boost. I’ve done a good bit of training since and to come here and win the nationals for the first time is great,” Thomas commented after the race. “I’m really happy. I was confident but I really didn’t know what to expect. Obviously Tanfield has been riding really well this year and Dowsett, it’s what he does. “Time trial in the UK is a strong discipline anyway – to come and win is super nice. It’s going to be great, especially in the Tour, to wear that jersey. I won the road race a few years ago and to add the time trial to it is really nice.” 1 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) in 48-54-78 2 Harry Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), at 37s 3 Alex Dowsett (Team Katusha-Alpecin), at 54s 4 John Archibald (Ribble Cycling), at 1-47 5 James Gullen (JLT Condor), at 2-03 6 Tao Geoghagen Hart (Team Sky), at 2-05 7 Jonathan Dibben (Team Sky), at 2-05 8 Daniel Bigham (Ribble Cycling), at 2-30 9 Ashley Cox (Flamme Rouge Cycling Team), at 2-49 10 Connor Swift (Madison Genesis), at 3-03 Charlie Tanfield at the National Time Trial The under-23 men’s title went to Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), who covered the 28.6km course in 36-01. The 21-year-oldwas joined on the podium by a surprising addition of Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling) who clocked in at 36-29, with the less surprising podium appearance of Tom Pidcock (Team Wiggins) rounding off the podium in 37-23. Tanfield placed third in the competition last year, but has had an exceptional season, already taking World and Commonwealth titles in the team and individual pursuit respectively. >>> British National Road Race course Tanfield said after the race: “It’s a local course for me so I’ve spent the last few weeks riding on it on most days.” “I knew exactly what I wanted to do coming into it and how I wanted to ride it so it’s about executing the plan and making sure nothing went wrong on the day. “I’m really happy to have finished it off today, I had two road targets this year – the national time trial and trying to get to the worlds as well. I wanted to show everyone what I could do – it’s my last year in the U23s as well and I wanted to make the most of it.” 1 Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg) in 36-01-85 2 Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling), at 27s 3 Thomas Pidcock (Team Wiggins), at 1-21 4 Ethan Hayter (100% Me), at 1-23 5 Robert Scott (Team Wiggins), at 1-33 6 Matt Langworthy (Saint Piran, at 1-41 7 Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling), at 1-45 8 Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins), at 1-47 9 Joey Walker (Team Wiggins), at 1-54 10 William Perret (University of Derby Cycling Club), at 1-54 The British Road National Championships continue on Sunday, with the women’s and men’s events taking place on the same day.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"3 Min Read * Kepler: eyeing possible acquisitions, IPO * Bob Diamond’s Atlas Merchant to take stake * Edmond de Rothschild firm also buys stake in Kepler * UniCredit ups stake in Kepler to 10.3 pct vs 5.2 pct By Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - Paris-based independent brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said on Wednesday that former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild had agreed to take minority stakes in the firm, which has eyes on a possible flotation. Atlas Merchant Capital, the firm Diamond co-founded in 2013 after his departure from Barclays, will buy a 19.7 percent stake, while Edmond de Rothschild will take 8 percent. Kepler added it was counting on its new partners to help it keep growing through acquisitions, and did not rule out looking for potential targets in the United Kingdom once Brexit terms were clearer, or in the United States. Kepler, which has grown rapidly over the past 10 years through purchases and partnerships with large European banks such as Italy’s UniCredit, also said it could ultimately carry out an initial public offering (IPO) within the next five years. “It’s not unthinkable, it’s part of our plans,” Laurent Quirin, the chairman of Kepler’s supervisory board, told reporters. “We’d need to keep on growing at a good pace.” Kepler did not give financial details of the transactions. As the new investors come in, French-based private equity fund Blackfin Capital Partners, which held 19.7 percent, and French bank Credit Mutuel ARKEA, which held 4.2 percent, will sell out of their current holdings. The company’s management will reduce the stake it holds collectively to 25.5 percent from 31.9 percent, although they will keep 40 percent of the voting rights. UniCredit, meanwhile, will raise its stake in the brokerage to 10.3 percent from 5.2 percent, while French state-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) will trim its holding to 5.2 percent from 7.8 percent. Since Kepler’s management bought out the company in 2009, its revenue has jumped fivefold, reaching 252 million euros ($294 million) in 2017. It is expected to hit 270 million euros this year with a 40 million net profit, Quirin said. $1 = 0.8585 euros Reporting by Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sarah White/Sudip Kar-Gupta All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The new acquisition represents one percent but brings its holding in the bank to 49 percent and signposts Atlas Mara’s intent to maintain its presence in Nigeria and perhaps, also a bigger plan for the Nigerian economy, say analysts covering the banking industry. The financial services company said it was pleased “that it has agreed to acquire an additional 280,956,166 shares of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, approximately a 1.0% shareholding in UBN, following which its combined direct and indirect shareholding in UBN will increase to 49.0% from 48.0%. The company will issue 2,360,032 ordinary shares as consideration for the UBN shares acquired,” it said in a statement. It also said it had made applications for the new shares to be admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange, noting that “admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the new shares are expected to commence, at 8:00 am BST on 27 June 2018.” The new shares are expected to rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares. “Following admission of the new shares, the company will have 174,618,767 ordinary shares in issue, of which 1,545,764 shares are in treasury and 3,298,298 shares are held in escrow as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Finance Bank Zambia Limited, as disclosed to the market on 1 July 2016. Atlas Mara hereby confirms that the total number of voting rights in Atlas Mara is 169,774,705. This figure should be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the company under the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules,” the statement concluded.

1016437,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Course Schedule How to follow Rider Timings Elite men Steve Cummings, winner of both the road race and time trial at the National Road Championships in 2017, will return as he looks to defend his title in Northumberland on Thursday. Five-time national time trial champion, Alex Dowsett will start as another favourite in the elite men’s time trial this week. The Katusha-Alpecin rider will be looking to improve on recent good form in time trials during the Giro d’Italia and Tour of Slovenia. 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné winner Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), who is fine form will be looking to cause an upset and add another British champion jersey to his collection before taking on the Tour de France in July. An intense challenge will most certainly come from last year’s bronze medallist James Gullen (JLT Condor) and 2018 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Harry Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg). Cummings’ Team Dimension Data team mate and four-time under 23 National Time Trial champions Scott Davies will also compete in the elite men’s category for the first time. Start list Elite women Hannah Barnes (Canyon SRAM Racing) who finished second in last years’ time trial and Dani Rowe MBE (WaowDeals Pro Cycling) who secured the best British rider in the Women’s Tour earlier this month are two notable early favourites to win the national champions jersey. Two-time national time trial champion Hayley Simmonds (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) will return to challenge for her third title. Last year’s winner in the elite women’s time trial Claire Rose (Cervélo-Bigla Pro Cycling) and third placed Katie Archibald (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) are both notable absentees from this year’s start list, both currently recovering from injury. Anna Christian (Trek-Drops) the 22-year-old will be looking to have a big impact against her older competitors, using her gold medal in the under-23 championship from last year as motivation. Multiple Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey will also ride the 28.6km course in Northumberland alongside her Storey Racing team mates Neah Evans and Melissa Lowther. Start list Under-23 men Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling) and Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), second and third placed in 2017 respectively will dreaming of wearing the national jersey come Thursday with the exclusion of Scott Davies (Team Dimension Data). Four-time winner Davies has had a stronghold on the jersey in the under-23 time trial championship for the last four years consecutively, and this year steps up to compete in the elite men’s competition. Having recently being promoted to the Great Britain Cycling Team Podium Programme, Ethan Hayter will be looking to impress alongside his 100% ME team mates Matthew Bostock and Joe Holt. Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins) winner of this year’s Rutland - Melton Cicle Classic is another one to watch alongside team mate and one of cyclists most promising talents, Thomas Pidcock. Start list The women and under-23 men will complete two laps of the course, while the elite men will race three. This year’s event will both start and finish at the 17th-century historic country mansion and Grade II-listed Kirkley Hall, near Ponteland. The men and women will ride the same P-shaped, course, with the senior men completing three laps and the women and under-23 men completing two. The course starts in the grounds of Kirkley Hall before heading north past Kirkley Cycles, Shilvington and up to the Gubeon where it turns right towards Tranwell. It then heads south over Saltwick Hill and down to Twizzell to complete the lap.

1016437,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The riders will compete for the elite men’s, women’s and under-23 coveted national champions’ jersey. The 2018 women’s road race will be contested by a number of household names and on-form elite riders, including Dani Rowe, Dame Sarah Storey and Elinor Barker to name a few. Dani Rowe has been in fine form this season, finishing third in the Commonwealth Games road race and following up that performance with an overall third place in the OVO Energy Women’s Tour. Fellow Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker will ride for Wiggle High5 in Northumberland this weekend. Storey comes into the National Championships having recently tasted victory in the North East after winning stage one of the Tour of the Reservoir this past weekend. Storey will race both the TT and the road race for Storey Racing in a packed weekend of competition. Also competing in both events will be 2016 national champion Hannah Barnes (CANYON // SRAM RACING), who will be one of the favourites for this year’s title. She edged out her sister Alice in 2016, also racing this year and looking to improve on two runner-up finishes. Whatever the outcome of this year’s women’s road race, a new national champion will be crowned - with the 2017 champion Lizzie Deignan absent due to the upcoming birth of her first child. Another notable absentee is Olympic and world gold medallist Katie Archibald, who is injured and unable to race. Rider List The finale of the National Road Championships sees two-time champion Steve Cummings attempt to defend his title in a star-studded men’s road race. Cummings will have to fend off a host of challenges, not least from previous winners Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Adam Blythe – whom have all triumphed at National Road Championships in recent years. Other high-profile contenders include Team Sky star Geraint Thomas and the previous national champion and sprint ace Mark Cavendish. Thomas will be riding high on the back of his victory in the 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné and the Welshman will lead a strong Sky cohort into the weekends action. Cavendish was recently in action in the Tour de Yorkshire after a lengthy injury lay-off, but the Team Dimension Data rider is a perennial contender at the Nationals, with one victory and two second place finishes to his name already. One of cycling’s most exciting prospects, Tom Pidcock, who secured a win in the second round of the Spring Cup Series, leads an exclusively under-23 line-up for Team Wiggins. Elsewhere in the under-23 category, Team Wiggins’ Gabriel Cullaigh and Charlie Tanfield of Canyon Eisberg are tipped to be ones to watch. Rider List The road races will both start and finish in the picturesque village of Stamfordham, situated around 20km west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The women’s race will be in the morning over 106km – consisting of three laps of the long route (see map above), with the hotly contested men’s race due to place over a total distance of 185km in the afternoon – consisting of two short loops and four long loops. Spectators are invited to watch the action unfold in what promises to be a spectacular weekend of cycling and festival fun. Admission is free for spectators and there’s something for everyone to enjoy thanks to an eclectic mix of food and drink (cash only), music, amusement rides, HSBC UK Go-Ride and a bicycle stunt team.

1028440,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"June 26, 2018 Colby College has been awarded a $600,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the Colby Museum’s Lunder Institute for American Art and its inaugural programming. The award will add depth to the institute’s programs, which have already made an impact on Colby students and faculty, Waterville school children, and visiting artists. In 2014 the Mellon Foundation generously supported the Colby Museum’s academic programming, and this new grant will further expand opportunities for student and faculty research and scholarship in all disciplines. “As Colby continues to build on its strengths in the arts and humanities, we are grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s enduring commitment to these disciplines, said President David A. Greene. “We have already begun to see the ways in which the Lunder Institute is becoming the premier place for the study of American art, and this grant will be critical to the next phase of the institute’s development.” The Mellon grant will support four key areas: advancing American art scholarship and artistic practice through multidisciplinary, multi-genre residencies and convenings; engaging students and faculty by creating teaching and research opportunities with visiting artists and scholars that reach across the curriculum; sharing and archiving scholarly and artistic projects through exhibitions and publications; and increasing local and global collaborative opportunities that engage with the artistic and scholarly initiatives of the Lunder Institute in partnership with Colby students and faculty. In its first full academic year, the institute played host to two renowned artists who worked closely with Colby students, faculty, and members of the local community. In the fall semester, Theaster Gates worked with Colby students in an American studies class on urban renewal projects and met with community partners and residents. Richard Blanco, inaugural poet for President Obama’s second inauguration, spent the spring semester on campus, most notably teaching a course titled “Teach This Poem” in which Colby students learned to be poetry ambassadors for local school children. Blanco also conducted workshops for area schoolteachers. The future holds even more, says Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “As we continue to launch the Lunder Institute, this grant will significantly expand our ability to bring artists and scholars to Colby while making the programs of the Lunder Institute accessible to Colby students and faculty and our broader communities,” she said. “We are honored and grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s support.” The institute recently named four outstanding individuals to key leadership positions. Lee Glazer will serve as founding director of the institute, bringing experience as curator of American art for the Smithsonian Institution’s Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and expertise in the art of James McNeill Whistler, Romare Bearden, and others. Joining Glazer are Gates, the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives, and Tanya Sheehan, the distinguished scholar and director of research. Sheehan is currently Colby’s William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art. Most recently, the institute has brought on Daisy Desrosiers, an arts leader from Montréal, as program director. “The Mellon Foundation grant signals the importance of arts programming and will support the work of the institute’s creative and intellectual individuals,” said Glazer, who arrives at Colby in September. “This grant will enhance all of our work, from our cross-disciplinary collaborations to our scholarly symposiums to our community projects.” About the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Founded in 1969, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation endeavors to strengthen, promote, and, where necessary, defend the contributions of the humanities and the arts to human flourishing and to the well-being of diverse and democratic societies by supporting exemplary institutions of higher education and culture as they renew and provide access to an invaluable heritage of ambitious, path-breaking work. Additional information is available at mellon.org. Lunder Institute for American Art Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the museum’s program, the Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby museum and partner institutions around the world. To advance critical and creative research in American art and related fields, the institute hosts a residential program for scholars and artists on campus and in downtown Waterville. Residencies are offered to graduate students, scholars, curators, and emerging and internationally renowned artists who may develop new site-specific works on campus and in the community.

(Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) Officials from the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s Mankato office said Monday the Highway 99 bridge at St. Peter remained opened but may have to close later in the week due to the rising river. (Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) The Minnesota River is rising, has forced the closure of three valley roadways. Minnesota Department of Transportation officials closed Hwy. 19 east of Henderson Saturday evening, then on Sunday issued the closure of Hwy. 93 south of Henderson, which celebrated its annual Sauerkraut Days over the weekend. Late Monday night, MnDOT Public Affairs Cooordinator Anne Wolff issued an email announcing the closing of Highway 93 from U.S. Highway 169 to Le Sueur due to flooding and the rising Minnesota River. Wolff had reported Monday morning that while Hwy. 93 from U.S. Hwy. 169 to Le Sueur remained open, its “closure (is) anticipated later today or early tomorrow (Tuesday).” And it did. Wolff also said department maintenance engineers continue to monitor “the potential closure near St. Peter” of Hwy. 99 east. Heavy rains in south central Minnesota on Sunday and Monday resulted in another one-foot increase in projected crest levels, according to MnDOT officials and “extended the expected duration of high water on the Minnesota River,” according to Wolff. The Minnesota River remains the District 7 MnDOT office’s “primary area of current impact,” Wolff reported. But it’s not the only southern Minnesota area recently impacted by heavy rains and rising waters. In the city of Blue Earth, MnDOT officials closed U.S. Hwy. 169 on Sunday afternoon after three to six inches of rain fell in about a one-hour period. That roadway, Wolff reported, later reopened after waters receded. MnDOT officials also had reduced lanes due to flooding on Hwy. 30 east of Mapleton and on Hwy. 4 by Sherburn on Friday. The Sherburn roadway closed on Saturday morning; approximately six inches of water remains on the highway on Monday, with water still rising, “and it could be awhile until water recedes,” Wolff said. MnDOT officials were monitoring the Minnesota River late last week and were suggesting that Hwys. 19 and 93 near Henderson were the most likely to close due to anticipated flooding. Originally, MnDOT said the rising river was expected to close Hwy. 93 into Le Sueur on Sunday. That closure occurred late Monday night. The eastern portion of Seven Mile Creek Park on Hwy. 169 in Nicollet County is also closed. Log jams carried and caused by the swift-moving current still potentially may cause problems at bridges in St. Peter, Le Sueur and Henderson, according to MnDOT officials. Visitors to Henderson’s Sauerkraut Days were as early as Friday were being encouraged to enter the community from the west on Hwy. 19. Regular travelers were also able to access the city from the north on Sibley County Road 6, commonly referred to as the Scenic Byway Road. Henderson chamber representatives suggested that the news of potential road closures might have held down attendance a bit, but it was the steady rains which more likely kept some away.

1108635,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"Scientists may now be able to predict whether carrying a specific genetic variant increases a person's risk for disease using gene editing and stem cell technologies, according to new research in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation. For the first time, the study demonstrates the unique potential of combining stem cell-based disease modeling (induced pluripotent stem cells) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology as a personalized risk-assessment platform for determining the disease-causing ability of a yet undescribed genetic variant, known as a variant of uncertain significance, or VUS. Numerous genetic variations are identified as related to a medical condition, but it is uncertain if they actually lead to disease, Joseph C. Wu, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and Simon Stertzer, professor in the Department of Medicine, Cardiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said. ""Random genetic testing will create a lot of stress for a healthy individual who may be getting echocardiograms, MRIs or medications that they may not need,"" Wu said. ""Results from this study will help improve the interpretation and diagnostic accuracy of gene variants, especially in the era of personalized medicine and precision health. The goal is to optimize the decision making of clinicians in their choices of therapy by providing a much clearer result for the variant of uncertain significance carriers."" Researchers studied genetic variants associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle thickens. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and young athletes. The reseachers harvested DNA from 54 healthy or symptom-free individuals without heart disease, then they sequenced their DNA using a custom DNA panel of 135 cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease genes associated with sudden cardiac death. The sequence results uncovered 592 unique genetic variants, with 78 percent of genetic variants being classified as benign, likely benign, or a variant of uncertain significance. However, 17 genetic variants were annotated as likely pathogenic or disease-causing. One individual who had multigenerational family members carrying a variation in gene MYL3, which is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was chosen in this study. After collecting the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the cells were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs and genome edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to engineer cells with the same genetics such as isogenic iPSC lines. Comprehensive analysis was next performed on the engineered cell lines to determine the MYL3 variant could lead to disease. Traditionally, treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy depends on whether a patient has symptoms and the severity of those symptoms. People who have silent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without symptoms are not treated. For those with symptoms, physicians may recommend lifestyle changes such as adopting a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress and incorporating exercise while treating underlying illnesses that can make the condition worse. They may also prescribe medications for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, typically reserving surgery for more severe cases. ""Given the diversity of the human genome, no one of us is identical to another. It is difficult to determine whether a genetic variant is meaningful or not. As a result, we risk treating patients with medications or more for a variant that, in the end, is benign,"" Joseph Hill, chief of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said. ""This study combined two new powerful technologies, induced pluripotent stem cells and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, to model a patient's heart in a dish and to test whether those heart cells manifested signs of disease. This approach heralds a new era of in vitro disease modeling and drug testing as pivotal elements of precision medicine."" View the discussion thread.

1008941,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Overseer in the News,"Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art Lee Glazer wrestled with the decision to leave her home in Washington, D.C., and the security of a curatorial job with the Smithsonian Institution to move to Waterville and become the founding director of the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby. Glazer grew up in Washington, raised her family there, and made her mark as a Whistler specialist and curator of American art at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Taking the Lunder Institute job—launching a research center for American art at an undergraduate liberal arts college in northern New England—is in some ways a bold move. Typically these centers are nestled in big research universities with large populations of graduate students. Ultimately, Glazer decided to trade her life in the nation’s capital for Mayflower Hill because she shares President David A. Greene’s vision for the institute and his commitment to the arts. “It’s so encouraging and unusual that David Greene is putting the arts and creative endeavors at the heart of his vision for Colby,” Glazer said. “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, his investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” As they discussed the institute, Greene told Glazer to think of it as a mash-up between the experimental mid-century North Carolina arts school Black Mountain College and the Aspen Institute, a contemporary humanities-driven think tank, where new ideas are nurtured by cutting-edge scholarship. Established with a gift by Paula and Peter Lunder ’56, the institute is designed for scholarship, creativity, dialogue, and mentorship among the College’s many communities. Glazer will set the Lunder Institute’s scholarly and creative direction, working with artists, faculty, and students, as well as the curatorial and educational teams of the Colby College Museum of Art. She also will collaborate with the institute’s first director of artist initiatives, Theaster Gates, recently appointed to a three-year term. “I love Theaster’s work, and I am excited to see what this relationship is going to look like.” “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, [David Greene’s] investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” —Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art The institute will actively participate in Colby’s ongoing revitalization of Waterville, an aspect of the job that particularly excites Glazer. “We see the institute as one of the many institutions driving the creative revitalization of Waterville and the region generally, and doing so in a way that does not disrespect the history of the community and the people who live there and have roots in the community,” she said. Glazer’s background includes some history in Maine. For about 15 years, she and her family have spent a summer week or two at a cabin on Attean Pond near Jackman. They usually stay at a hotel in Waterville the night before heading into camp, and their trips have often included stops at Colby. “We have this abiding affection for the great beauty of the state of Maine,” she said. Glazer has worked at Freer|Sackler 11 years and curated almost 20 exhibitions. A Whistler scholar, she was drawn to the Lunder position in part by the Colby museum’s deep Whistler collection. The Lunder Collection of James McNeill Whistler includes more than 300 etchings and lithographs, as well as oils, watercolors, and pastels and more than 150 books, journals, and photographs. Glazer is eager to explore exhibitions that compare changes in Whistler’s London to changes in Waterville today—and perhaps the changes experienced on the south side of Chicago, where Gates makes community-based work. “Whistler witnessed an incredible transformation and gentrification of certain parts of London in the late 19th century,” she said. “Maybe we can bring in scholars to research the changes in Victorian London and draw parallels to the south side of Chicago and the changes happening in Waterville today. As I started thinking about those possibilities, that’s what catalyzed for me, in concrete terms, the kinds of things the institute can do and the ways in which we can bridge the gaps of time and place.” Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the Museum’s program, The Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby Museum and partner institutions around the world.

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:23 pm Pictured from left to right are Steve Williams -A Flight, Phyllis Parrent- B Flight, and Warner Dyke - C Flight.

Pictured is Joe Evans, who was the D Flight winner in the Laidback Gold tournament. There were 22 golfers who competed in the Laidback Golf Tours sixth tournament of its 2018 season today at Plantation Golf Club. Even though they found the greens very slow due to recent rainfall amounts seven players turned in rounds in the seventies while carding twenty-six birdies. In their 2017 outing held here there were only three scores in the seventies and twenty-one birdies made. As in previous years the tournament was followed by a super meal furnished by Annette Mink of Plantation Golf Club. While there were no repeat winners from last year’s event here; Steve Williams made it two tournaments in a row with his win in A Flight today. Williams who won last week at Stoney Creek in a playoff used five birdies to hold off last years winner Steve Cummings by a single stroke. Williams claimed his second win in three starts this season with a daily low gross score of 72. Cummings won here last year with his score of 73 but claimed second today. Phyllis Parrent kept her season going in the right direction as she claimed her third win in four starts in the B Flight. Parrent carded two birdies on her way to finish at 74 for the top spot. Bob Foyle had one birdie but once again came up just a little short as he finished with a 78. Foyle was tied for first last tournament only to lose b a stroke on the playoff. Warner Dyke from Forest has only made two appearances this season but captured his first Tour victory with a score of 82 in the C Flight. Neither Dyke nor second place finisher Jimmy Watlington were able to card any birdies. They started the day with Dyke recording a bogey while Watlington started his round with a double bogey. Watlington finished with an 84. The D Flight used net scores to determine their winner, but Joe Evans would have got his first win in two season starts even if it had been determined by gross score. Evans carded a birdie on his way to his best finish of the season at 89 or net 61. Kenny Powell had two birdies and finished with a score of 92; but Dan Curtin claimed the flight’s second place spot with a score of 94 or net 68. The Tours next outing will be the first MAJOR of the season. Double points are awarded at Majors toward the Season Points Championship. It is scheduled for a 10 a.m. shotgun start Tuesday June 26 at Olde Mill Golf Resort in Laurel Fork, VA (Groundhog Mountain). Entry fee is $70 with registration request by June 19th with entry cutoff at noon June 23. Entry can be made at golftripman@yahoo.com or by calling Kenny Powell 434-792-3728.

1106452,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Published: June 12, 2018 2:32 p.m. ET By Earlier this year, Kai-Fu Lee, founder of VC giant Sinovation Ventures, said that the rise of the machines will lead to widening inequality as lower-level jobs get swallowed up in numbers well beyond the grimmest of forecasts. Don’t look to the banking industry for a counterpoint. In a series of interviews marking the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis, the Financial Times took the pulse of execs from several leading banks and found many of them are girding for imminent — and substantial — job losses. Jamie Forese, president of Citigroup’s C, -0.67% institutional clients group, said 10,000 of the bank’s 20,000 tech and operational roles are “most fertile for machine processing.” He suggested they could be gone within five years. What kind of jobs are at risk exactly? Barclays investment boss Tim Throsby put it another way when asked about what the future will look like: Throsby explained that machines will take over “lower-value tasks” and a smaller number of employees will be making more money. Forese’s comments are reminiscent of those from Deutsche Bank’s DB, -0.31% John Cryan, who previously said half the German bank’s workers could be replaced by robots. The FT calculated that if those numbers were true for the broader banking industry, the potential job losses would outpace the ones we saw from 2007 to 2017, when almost 60,000 jobs were cut from eight of the world’s top 10 investment banks.

1053951,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"MIAMI, June 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) today announced it has completed enrollment of 110 subjects in a Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. OPK88003 is a once weekly injectable oxyntomodulin medicine with GLP-1 and glucagon dual agonist activity. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction of HbA1c levels over a 30-week period; weight loss and improvement of blood lipid profiles are secondary endpoints. Based on preclinical and Phase 2 data, the use of the dual agonist, OPK88003, once-weekly with an optimized dosing regimen, could more effectively improve glucose control, increase weight loss and improve the lipid profile in type 2 diabetics compared with the currently available GLP-1 medicines. ""We are pleased to announce complete enrollment in the Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 two months after we initiated the study. Our confidence in this compound is supported by the earlier Phase 2 data, and it is our hope that the outcome of the current study along with our existing body of data will prepare us for a pivotal Phase 3 program,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We believe the dual agonist activity of OPK88003 may better control glucose and improve long term cardiovascular outcomes in the growing population of type 2 diabetics worldwide."" According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), approximately 30 million people in the U.S. have type 2 diabetes and 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed each year. The ADA estimates the annual cost of care for diabetic patients to be $327 billion, including direct medical costs and reduced productivity1. _________________________ 1 http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/?loc=superfooter About OPK88003OPK88003 was previously evaluated in a blinded Phase 2 clinical trial of 420 patients with type 2 diabetes for 12 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for an additional 12 weeks. The study showed that OPK88003 reduced HbA1c levels by approximately 1.4% and resulted in statistically superior weight loss compared with the comparator, a weekly exenatide. Further, OPK88003 treatment resulted in a favorable decrease in triglycerides and cholesterol versus the weekly exenatide. About OPKO Health, Inc.

The sentence was delivered by the appeals court in Paris. After a 32 year career including 20 years at the head of the anti-gang brigade of Lyon, Neyret was a legend at the time of his fall. He was accused of having provided confidential information to members of the Lyon community in exchange for benefits, gifts and cash. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, including 18 months suspended, as well as a permanent ban from the police force. The prosecutor general may still decide to appeal the sentence. About 12,000 electricity customers in Valbonne experienced cuts to their power supplies this morning. The disruptions to the supply were the result of a demonstration being staged by employees of energy company Enedis at an electricity sub-station. The protest was against changes in salary levels, terms of employment and proposed redundancies. Latest figures show that 19 people have been killed on the roads of the Alpes Maritimes since the beginning of the year. Of those, eleven were riding a motorbike or scooter. Strike action by France’s rail network the SNCF is continuing today with 1 out of 2 regional trains operating and 3 out of 5 TGV’s running. Unions have called for a “massive” participation ahead of the government’s plans to implement the reforms on Thursday. Eric Ciotti, MP for the Alpes Maritimes, has said that France should not take in the 629 migrants who are currently adrift in the Mediterranean on the boat Aquarius. Speaking on French television this morning, M. Ciotti said that no French port should accept the boat and that it should return to the Libyan coast. The Spanish government announced yesterday that it would accept the boat to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, a decision M. Ciotti described as a mistake. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron has today accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the ship dock in Italy. A doctor from Menton has been appointed head of the non-governmental organization Médecins du Monde. Philippe de Botton has been involved with the organization since 1989. BUSINESS In the UK, there’s been a larger than expected rise in the number of people in work. There were 32.39 million people in work in the February-to-April period. That was an increase of 146,000 over the previous quarter, and 440,000 more than in the same period last year. In the United States, inflation rose slightly in May. The US Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index increased 0.2%. In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 2.8%, the biggest advance since February 2012. The head of Citigroup's investment bank has suggested that the bank could dispense with up to half of its 20,000 technology and operations staff in the next five years due to automation. In an interview with the Financial Times, James Forese said that the 20,000 posts at Citi were ""most fertile for machine processing"". SPORT FOOTBALL…Real Madrid have appointed Spain manager Julen Lopetegui as their new head coach on a three-year deal. He previously managed Porto for two years, before taking over at the Spanish national team in July 2016. Former England boss Sam Allardyce says he is ""jealous"" of Gareth Southgate and believes it should be him leading the national team at the World Cup.

While most of its rivals had delivered bumper profits in 2007, Citi had already seen its earnings collapse to $3.6 billion (€3 billion) from $21.5 billion (€18.2 billion) after its subprime bets went badly wrong. Yet, a decade on from the crisis that threatened such devastation, Citi’s investment bank chief James Forese can say without irony: ""I don’t think there is much question that we’ve been a winner since the crisis. Even from the [high] of the 2005/06 period to today . . . our franchise is much stronger today than it was back then."" Already have an account? Sign in here.

1096862,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The ongoing evolution of fixed income markets has shaken up the desired skill set of the fixed income trader. Key themes discussed over the past couple days at the WBR Fixed Income Leaders Summit include automation, data, and artificial intelligence. Much has changed over the past several years, and more change is ahead, so traders cannot be set in their ways. Supurna VedBrat, BlackRock “It is important that today’s traders have the mindset that can change easily,” said Supurna VedBrat, Global Head of Trading at BlackRock, at a Friday morning keynote interview. “Agility is important. Forward thinking is important. Innovative DNA. And having the savvy to be able to use technology to advance business processes.” VedBrat cited working well with others as a requirement, as fixed income trading is increasingly a collaborative endeavour, both in terms of working with portfolio managers internally, and interfacing with multiple external constituencies to source liquidity. In a market where data has proliferated and trading desks have yet to get their arms fully around another key skill for a trader is the ability to “understand the story of what the data is telling us,” VedBrat said. Regarding automated execution, VedBrat said the framework is to leverage data to make decisions on where to route a trade, based on acceptable price parameters. “We want to allow data to simplify and make executon more efficient,” she said. “Automation is not replacing human intelligence — it is making human decision-making smarter and faster.” BlackRock is open to using more all-to-all, or open, trading if that’s where the other side of the trade can be found. “We need to be able to reach liquidity regardless of where it is,” said VedBrat, who added that the distinction between buy side and sell side is not as important in this context, as any market participant can provide liquidity. With all all-to-all trading, “we have seen success in couple different markets” she said. “Assets are sitting with the buy side, so the buy side is in a pretty good position to be able to provide liquidity. The buy side provides liquidity as a price maker when ready to declare a price at which they’re willing to exchange risk.” In introductory remarks for the keynote interview, MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey cited four major trends the platform operator is seeing: (1) a proliferation of data, (2) substantial technology investment to automate processes, (3) a transformation of the odd-lot market, and (4) increasing adoption of all-to-all trading.

The Federal Statistical Office figures alarmed economists, who hoped for a 0.8 per cent rise. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics said: ‘This makes for a horrible start to the second quarter.’ OIL SLOWDOWN Oil production in Venezuela is 25m barrels behind schedule as the country teeters on the edge of collapse. State firm PDVSA said it may be forced to declare it cannot meet obligations, as 80 tankers float unfilled in ports. PENSION WORRY Half of workers due to retire this year are expected to carry on working past state pension age instead, according to research by Prudential. More than a quarter of those planning to stay on hope to go part-time. Around 8 per cent cannot afford to quit. PAYMENT DEAL Payments firm Paysafe has struck a deal for its cards to be used in Google’s online shop. The Isle of Man business’s prepaid cards, designed for people who do not want to use online banking or buy with credit, can be used at the Google Play store. AFRICA PROFIT An investment firm founded by disgraced ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond has seen profit rise. Atlas Mara, which takes stakes in African banks, made £19.4million profit in the first three months of 2018, which is up from £7million a year earlier. SAVINGS SURGE Savers pumped £931million into the stock market in April as the Isa deadline loomed. The total cash pile looked after rose 3 per cent to £1.2trillion, according to The Investment Association. There is typically a stampede to shelter cash from the taxman in Isa accounts in early April, before the new tax year. CHINA TIE-UP Global miner Rio Tinto has set up a joint venture with Chinese firm Minmetals to look for minerals in China. Rio said: ‘Our complementary strengths in exploration put us in the best possible position to find metals and minerals essential to human progress.’ CONTRACT WIN Oil services firm Petrofac has won a £48million two-year contract extension to maintain Eni UK’s development in north Wales.

It was the highest fundraising total ever for the event. The Breakfast, held at the iconic Cipriani 42nd Street in New York, honored Leon G. Cooperman, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, Inc., and Damon Runyon Board of Directors member, for his longstanding commitment to investing in new generations of researchers. ""Our Annual Breakfast is always a special time for us at Damon Runyon, as we honor and recognize those who continue to fuel the success of our organization from both a research and business advisory standpoint,"" said Lorraine Egan, President and CEO of Damon Runyon. ""Not only was this year's event record-breaking in terms of fundraising, it also gave us an opportunity to recognize an individual who is integral to supporting our mission of finding and funding exceptional scientists who will be the driving force to end all suffering from cancer."" Since joining the Damon Runyon board in 1996, Cooperman – known as Lee – has managed the Foundation's Investments Committee, helping to grow its endowment by 500 percent, to over $100 million. In 2014, he and fellow board member Michael Gordon pledged to jointly fund Damon Runyon's Physician-Scientist Training Award program for its first three years. The program supports and encourages outstanding recent medical school graduates to pursue cancer research careers by providing them with the opportunity for a protected research-training experience under the mentorship of a qualified and gifted mentor. In addition, the Foundation will retire up to $100,000 in medical school debt still owed by an award recipient. Cooperman spoke with great fondness about his 26-year relationship with the organization, noting how the Foundation continues to evolve year-over-year in providing grants to the most brilliant, early career scientists. ""Winston Churchill said it best, 'We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.' My goal has always been to improve the world and leave it a better place than when I came into it, which is why I initially got involved with Damon Runyon over 20 years ago. They fuel the vision of researchers across the country, by providing the funding and support they urgently need to discover radical ways to prevent, diagnose and cure all forms of cancer,"" said Cooperman. Kenneth G. Langone, Founder and CEO of Invemed Associates LLC, introduced Cooperman, his longtime friend. Also attending the event were Nobel laureate Harold Varmus, MD, Shelly Lazarus, former CEO of Ogilvy, and Mario Gabelli, Founder of GAMCO. At this year's event, guests heard research updates from Melody Smith, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who is focused on improving outcomes for bone marrow transplants, and Kristopher R. Bosse, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who is pursuing a new targeted therapy for pediatric neuroblastoma. ""As a physician-scientist myself, I can truly appreciate everything this foundation does for these scientists, especially physician-scientists, who are a dying breed,"" said William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD, Professor of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Damon Runyon Board Member and Vice Chair of the Foundation's Scientific Programs, and keynote speaker. Egan also announced that the Foundation has named John Ferrarone, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine, the ""Lee Cooperman Physician-Scientist of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"" in Cooperman's honor. Dr. Ferrarone works under the mentorship of Dr. Varmus. His research focuses on developing new, more effective targeted therapies for lung cancers.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian. Thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our first-quarter results. MongoDB began fiscal 2019 with strong financial and operational performance, which reflects our market momentum and all the drivers behind our growth. To quickly summarize the first-quarter results, we generate revenue $48.2 million, a 49% year-over-year increase, which is above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 53% year over year. We ended the quarter with over 6,600 customers, up 83% compared to a year ago. We saw strong growth across all major regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia. And Atlas is now 14% of revenue. Our position as the leading modern general-purpose data platform get stronger each quarter with customers, partners, and the larger ecosystem, putting us in great position to continue generating strong top-line growth. Digital transformation has become one of the most important IT initiatives for all companies in all industries. While these digital initiatives hold the promise of a more nimble enterprise that can respond quickly to changing market conditions and provide a better experience for its customers, executing on these initiatives is far easier said than done. In my meetings with senior executives around the world, it's clear that companies are highly motivated to use modern technologies to transform their businesses to create a competitive advantage. In the first quarter alone, I had more than 20 meetings with the C-level executives at large global organizations across many industries to discuss how MongoDB can be a partner in their transformation process. The scope and frequency of these senior-level conversations are far different than the types of conversations we had even 18 months ago. Previously, there were typically exploratory conversations to learn more about the company and the technology and what projects they could start with MongoDB. Now these conversations are focused on how to use MongoDB for some of the most important digital initiatives that their businesses are undertaking. Moreover, many of these executives rarely meet with any vendors at all, reflecting one, the importance of what we do and the impact we can have on their business; and two, our credibility as a strategic partner. Turning to our first-quarter results in more detail. We saw a healthy mix of new logo wins and strong upsell activity, both of which include the customers' migrating workloads from legacy databases to MongoDB. Our performance in the first quarter exemplified the power of our land, expand and expand model and our multiple vectors of growth. During the first quarter, we grew our six-figure customer count by 47% compared to the same period a year ago and added a number of new enterprise customers, including Anadarko Petroleum, AppDirect, Extraordinary Systems, Hawaiian Airlines, and New Balance Athletics. We also expanded our relationship with customers such as Guidewire Software, Highspot, Mediaocean, NeoReach, PEMCO, state of New York, and Urban Outfitters. These customers are just the tip of the iceberg for us. Our opportunity is massive and global. We're closing deals in every corner of the world with highly sophisticated businesses, in some cases, in areas where we have no or only limited sales coverage today. This truly speaks to the size of our market opportunity and the broad appeal of our platform. It also demonstrates the attractive returns we are generating on our investments and underscores the number of additional high ROI opportunities we see ahead of us to invest across product, sales and marketing. Examples of our wins include a large European online electronics retailer, which built a single-view application of MongoDB Atlas to improve its customer experience, quickly identify fraudulent activities and comply with GDPR privacy regulations. Multiple wins in China, including Volkswagen China, which built a new energy vehicle management platform on MongoDB; and a leading airline that's using MongoDB to support a block-chain-based application for its revamped rewards program; one of Italy's largest energy companies, Eni gas e luce, which chose MongoDB to modernize its content management platform; wins with two of the largest financial institutions in Australia building important applications for online payments as Australia pushes aggressively toward a cashless society; a large deal with a Latin American bank that chose MongoDB for over a dozen applications, including a loyalty application, a customer service application, offloading and mission-critical application from the mainframe and other use cases across different business units; and a deal with one of the largest media companies in the Middle East, which is modernizing its legacy infrastructure and building a highly sophisticated platform to share exclusive content with its customers. While we monetize existing demand of our platform with these customers, we also continue to plant seeds around the world to further drive adoption. One way we do this is by hosting a worldwide tour of customer events. For example, we hosted seven of our top local events with thousands of developers in Bangalore, Munich, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney and Tel Aviv. We also hosted joint events with our cloud partners in London, Milan, Mumbai, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney and Tel Aviv. At all these events, we were able to get in front of tens of thousands of developers, database administrators and executives to increase awareness of MongoDB and showcase the power of our platform. In addition to seeing strong global demand for our platform, we're also seeing customers adopt MongoDB for a wide variety of cutting-edge use cases. A great example is Koinex, a cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform based in India. Koinex provides real-time trading of a rapidly growing number of cryptocurrencies. They're using MongoDB Atlas to focus on scaling the trading capacity by 50 times while minimizing the use of DevOps ops personnel. Another important win was with a large automotive manufacturing company that is working on object detection for autonomous cars. The company created a machine learning application to ingest and process large amounts of unstructured data. They chose MongoDB because of our abilities to easily support a large variety of data from cameras and sensors and to scale out the dataset as it rapidly grows. Third, we expanded our relationship with U.K.'s biggest public service department, the Department for Works and Pensions or DWP, which is similar to the Social Security Administration in the United States. A number of new services are being built on MongoDB from benefit delivery platforms to a service that helps people obtain the status of their pension payments. DWP is essentially using MongoDB to better serve the citizens of the United Kingdom. We also had an exciting win with New Balance, who's using MongoDB for real-time analytics related to managing their raw materials, specifically around costing, planning and procurement decisions. We also see -- we also continue to see tremendous customer interest in Atlas. In the first quarter, Atlas represented 14% of revenue, versus 4% a year ago and 11% last quarter. A fast-growing percentage of this business is coming through our direct-sales efforts, though self-serve is still the majority of Atlas sales. Atlas is a key part of our run anywhere strategy, and its success among enterprise customers makes it clear that Atlas is not only great for small- and medium-sized businesses but is also compelling solution for the largest organizations in the world. We anticipate field sales of Atlas will continue to increase as we introduce Enterprise Advanced features and more into Atlas starting later this year. We also continue to see growth of our Atlas business with partners. Two of our largest Atlas deals in Q1 closed through the AWS Marketplace. The ability for customers to buy Atlas through their preferred cloud partner makes it easy to do business with us, reduces sales cycle times and accelerates the growth of our business. Speaking of partners, our strong momentum is driving partners to further incorporate our platform into their technologies and go-to-market initiatives. In fact, our new business sourced from partners has more than doubled over the past year. Furthermore, we signed an exciting new ISV relationship with IBM as part of its private cloud initiative. With this deal, IBM will activate thousands of global sales reps who will be incentivized to resell MongoDB as part of IBM's ICP or IBM Cloud Private and Analytics Platform for enterprises. This deepens our partnership with IBM and will greatly expand our reach into new markets and opportunities where IBM has an influential presence. Innovation is the core to our DNA and to our success. We're continuing to invest in our platform and have a robust product road map that will make it even easier for customers to work with their data. In three weeks, we'll be hosting our annual user conference, MongoDB World, in New York City. The highlight of MongoDB World will be the formal introduction of MongoDB 4.0, including multi-document ACID transactions. While ACID is not required for many applications, its announcement has already led many companies to evaluate MongoDB, including those organizations who haven't looked at MongoDB recently and those who have never used MongoDB before. Initial customer reaction to MongoDB 4.0 has been very positive. The features in this new release are helping our sales team land meetings with customers and playing an important part in elevating our strategic importance among prospects. We plan to make a number of other exciting product announcements in MongoDB World that we believe will energize the customers and further expand the adoption of MongoDB in the developer community. We welcome all of you listening to the call to attend MongoDB World right here in New York City on June 27. So in summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We're executing across the business and believe our strengthened product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities position us well to continue driving best-in-class revenue growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review the financials Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our first-quarter performance. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Total revenue in the quarter was $48.2 million, up 49% year over year. The strong performance of the business was broad-based during the quarter with healthy new logo and upsell activity among enterprise customers as well as continued rapid adoption of Atlas. Atlas represented 14% of revenue during the quarter, up 4% in the first year -- first quarter last year. We continue to see strong global demand for our offerings. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 900 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 6,600, which is up from over 3,600 in the year-ago period and over 5,700 at the end of last quarter. Of our total customer count, over 1,550 are direct customers, which compares to over 1,450 at the end of the prior quarter and over 1,300 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven, in large part, by Atlas, which had over 4,400 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 3,400 at the end of the fourth quarter. The growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects both new customers to MongoDB as well as existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers. Our net AR expansion rate in the first quarter again remained above 120%. We ended the quarter with 394 customers with at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue and annualized MRR, which is up from 354 in the fourth quarter and 268 in the year-ago period. Driving expanded adoption and spend among existing customers is a key component of our growth strategy and has been a consistent area of success. Even among our largest customers today, we believe MongoDB represents a small fraction of their total database spend, which represents a large and attractive growth opportunity for us over time. Moving down the P&L. I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $35.0 million, representing a gross margin of 72.6% and consistent with the year-ago period. We are pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter, particularly in light of Atlas' growth. Atlas includes the underlying infrastructure, and our success in reducing the infrastructure costs related to Atlas has resulted in improved Atlas gross margins. We still anticipate Atlas will be a modest headwind to gross margin overall, but we are tracking well relative to our original expectations. Our operating loss was $21.7 million, or a negative 45% operating margin for the first quarter, comparing to a negative 47% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the first quarter was $21.6 million, or $0.43 per share based on 50.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $271.5 million in cash, cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $8 million. After taking into consideration approximately $400,000 in capital expenditures, free cash flow was negative $8.4 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the low point in the year for cash flow due to seasonally lower collections, and the second quarter is usually our heaviest investment in marketing investments like MongoDB World. In addition, we expect to see increased capital expenditures starting this quarter related to our New York City office move. Short-term deferred revenue was $119.9 million, up 45% year over year, while total deferred revenue of $141.8 million was up 47% year over year. We believe longer-term trends in deferred revenue are directionally correlated to the underlying momentum of our business. That said, as Atlas continues to become a larger portion of our business, it is important to appreciate that it is a usage-based model and does not generate meaningfully deferred revenue. Also, as a reminder, Atlas is often billed monthly in arrears versus the annual and advanced billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. Lastly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to the timing of events that may occur. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Beginning with the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51 million to $52 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $23.5 million to $23 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.45 per share based on 51.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2019, we are raising our revenue outlook to $217 million to $220 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $84 million to $82 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.62 per share based on 51.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our increased revenue guidance reflects strong underlying trends in the business and given the high ROI investment landscape we see, we have maintained our full-year outlook for non-GAAP loss from operations. In closing, we got off to a strong start in fiscal 2019, and we're excited for what's to come in the rest of the year. We're executing well on our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to drive strong growth and improving profitability over the long term. With that, we'd like to open up to your questions. Operator? Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Dev, congrats on a great start to the year. And, Dev, first question on the IBM deal. Can you give us a little bit more insight here? Like, historically, we have seen smaller software companies do deals with these large vendors. And on the one hand, on paper, they look good. Often, there is not that in reality coming through. Can you talk what's the incentive structure? How does it work for you guys? Why is it exciting for the two of you? Thank you. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes.Thanks, Raimo. What I think IBM have seen, and they're the ones who actually first approached us, was that they're seeing, frankly, MongoDB being adopted everywhere in their customer base, and they're seeing specific demand from their customers to -- for MongoDB. And they wanted to use MongoDB for their private cloud initiative and use some of the proprietary features. What's interesting about this transaction is that their salespeople actually are incentivized through quota relief to sell MongoDB. So this is not just one of those Barney announcements. There's real motivation by IBM to activate the 7,000-plus salespeople around the world to resell MongoDB, and they see a big opportunity in front of them. Why it's attractive to us is that even though we're a fast-growing company, we only have a certain amount of reach, and we're very attracted by the opportunity to expand our reach through their presence in these markets and accounts and where they have a lot of influence, where they can embed MongoDB more quickly than, say, we would try to do ourselves. So we're very excited about this relationship, and we think it will pay dividends in the future. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. And then another follow-up. On Atlas, obviously the growth, in our calculations, I think is like 400%, so that's really, really healthy. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving in terms of direct [Audio skip] commented on some direct [Inaudible] deals [Inaudible]? How do you see that evolving over time, and then once the enterprise features you kind of talked about, how will that change, then, the dynamic in the second half of the year? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Right. So if you remember, we launched Atlas a little less than two years ago, and it's only about this time last year that we really started getting our sales teams really focused on selling Atlas directly. And I think we're seeing the returns in that investment starting to pay off. Obviously, as part of our run anywhere strategy, we're giving customers choice about not only where they want to run MongoDB but how they want to consume MongoDB. And we're starting to see a lot of large customers want and like the optionality of basically procuring MongoDB as a service through Atlas. And that's definitely driving a big part of the growth. We're really excited about the traction we're seeing not just here in North America but frankly, all around the world and not just with small customers, with some of the largest companies and frankly, some very arguably industries that are probably more -- have reputation to be more slow moving who are aggressively moving to the cloud and see Atlas as a very attractive alternative. It also speaks to the fact that when people use MongoDB, in some ways, they future-proof their applications because they can start on-premise, go to the cloud, manage it themselves or consume it as a service and have it delivered on AWS, on Azure or on GCP. So it gives them real optionality. I would tell you that Atlas is the only Database-as-a-Service offering that's available in 54 regions around the world by virtue of us being able to run Atlas across the three largest cloud providers in the world. No other provider can say that. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, perfect. And maybe if I can squeeze in one more question for Michael. Like, if I look -- like, at the moment, your revenue is kind of running faster than we had modeled, but you kind of also keep investing. Like, how flexible -- like, as you said, on the call, you kind of are kind of playing -- being very dynamic with the investments given the high ROI. But like, how does it work for you? Like how does the planning work for you, whether cost allocation or the investment decisions? How does it work for you that you can kind of react so quickly? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So in general, given the market opportunity that we're going after, there are shorter lead time investments and longer lead time investments that we can make. And so obviously, in the planning process, it's a mix of doing both of those. We obviously saw very first -- very strong first-quarter performance, and we've been able to invest. Well, the two main areas that we will invest as we see incremental opportunities will be on the sales and marketing side and the R&D side. Both of those obviously have somewhat ramp times but the engineering ramp time for return to value is longer given product cycles. But those are really the two main areas that we look to and we look to reinvest in with continued strength of the business. And as long as we see high rates of return for both of those, we will continue to do that within the context of showing the continuing operating leverage that we're showing overall as a company. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We'll move next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent, guys. Very nice quarter and thank you for taking the question. I think after Raimo asked seven questions, we should all get at least three. I think that's only fair. Furthering on sort of the Atlas conversation. Could you talk to us a little bit on how you're seeing kind of those use cases develop? What kind of use cases are you seeing going toward Atlas versus what traditionally would be on the EA -- like an EA customer would be doing? And in the cases where you have sort of an existing EA customer expand to Atlas, maybe talk to us a little about sort of the use case that drives that as well because it seems like there's been a significant overlap, at least 100 customers, that went from EA to Atlas as well. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So great question, Keith. I mean, I would say you should think about -- again, we launched Atlas less than two years ago, so you can see -- as you can imagine, a lot of the early customers were doing a lot of dev test workloads, doing a lot of early prototyping work on Atlas. It's easy to get started with. They didn't have to procure any hardware. They didn't have to worry about getting their internal teams to support the infrastructure. As the comfort with Atlas has grown, you're starting to see people move to -- move more production and mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And we've seen that -- we saw that in our inside sales channel earlier, but now we're even seeing that in our direct sales force. And we're seeing a number of large deals move to Atlas. And so it speaks to, one, their comfort and familiarity with Atlas. Two, we've continued to expand the envelope of Atlas coverage. As I mentioned, we're now in 54 regions around the world. Three, we've added more and more features. We've made it easier. We built tools and content to make it easy for people to quickly migrate their on-prem installation to Atlas with minimal kind of effort. And so all those things are really helping customers to move workloads to Atlas. We've also introduced or plan to introduce a bunch of, what I call, enterprise features, things around LDAP, security, auditing and so forth, that will continue to encourage customers to be more comfortable in moving mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And to your point, about EA customers moving to Atlas, you should think about the fact that they might be different workloads. It might be that there -- have certain set of workloads on-premise but other workloads, they think, are a better fit or they're more -- they want to move more quickly to Atlas. In fact, you've seen many situations where sometimes a large enterprise may see some unexpected demand in a particular product or service offering and the internal teams can't keep up with that demand, and then they'll quickly choose to move to Atlas because of the elastic nature of that service. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. And perhaps just my one follow-up for Michael. With sort of the increase in Atlas and sort of the conversation you're talking about, how a lot of that is billed in arrears or sort of billed on a consumption basis. The rebound that we saw in current subscription billings from last quarter and into this quarter, they're probably more predicated on sort of EA strength versus Atlas. The Atlas strength that we saw in the quarter was sort of just more so just at the income statement. Is that the correct way to view it? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think, in general, I mean, we saw strength across the board. There are different cash flow and deferred revenue aspects to each of them, which is correct. And just for everyone -- so everyone's on the same page, the self-serve Atlas is the majority of Atlas today as opposed to Atlas sold through the sales force. Self-serve Atlas bills monthly in arrears, and so it is a very different dynamic. But we benefit, obviously, from the incremental cash flow of that as well, so that's sort of additive to the story. But we've got multiple engines of growth both on the Enterprise Advanced side as well as on the Atlas side. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent. Great quarter. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Keith. Operator We'll move next to Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev, Atlas revenue per customer has continued to expand at a really healthy clip here sequentially over the last few quarters. And given your commentary just before to Keith around the enterprise features for being additive going forward, should we assume that most of that growth thus far has been existing customers expanding implementations, and then, over time, there's opportunity for even more lift as they add these enterprise features? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. Actually, Brad, I would say it's actually both. We're seeing, obviously, strong expansion of existing customers, but we're also seeing newer customers start bigger on Atlas. And so I think that's again a function of the fact that those tend to be more mission-critical workloads versus dev test or early prototypes. And people now are starting to view Atlas as a very, very viable platform to run mission-critical applications. And the one thing I should also point out is that one of MongoDB's strength is the distributed nature of our database platform. And a lot of those features and those distributed capabilities are actually even better exposed in Atlas in terms of placing workloads closer to users, working around GDPR or other privacy regulations in particular countries. That really shows the power of MongoDB. And so we're actually seeing customers realize that with Atlas, they actually do more things on MongoDB than they could in their own data centers. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Brad, maybe just from like a math or sort of breaking down like the piece parts, the simplest way, I think, to think about it is the self-serve customers are exhibiting very strong underlying cohort behavior, so there's very good expansion in the self-serve customer base. But also, we're seeing an increasing percentage of the Atlas customers are sales sold, and those customers have a higher price point or a higher ASP. So the combination of those two things lead to generally increasing average revenue per Atlas customer if that helps. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Sure, sure. And then one real quick follow-up on that last point. The two big deals you talked about being sold on the AWS Marketplace, were those sold by the AWS sales force or by you guys or by self-service, we'll say? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer It was definitely sold by us, Brad, but I would tell you that the AWS sales team really worked with us to make sure those transactions happened. Obviously, it's early days, but it was a really great sign of partnering in the field. And we're really excited about what the future may hold there. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Operator Next, we'll move to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions. I wanted to start out first with just the kind of comments from you, Dev, on kind of about the competitive environment. In particular, Satya Nadella on their conference call commented about Cosmos and how quickly that's gone from zero to $100 million in annualized revenue. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see them in the market, where there might be overlap. Or are you complementary? And then I had two quick follow-ups. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So we basically -- one, I would say that we feel very comfortable about our competitive positioning. We have talked to customers who tried Cosmos, and frankly, the feedback we've heard has not been that positive. They're trying to do some sophisticated things, and many customers have said that -- they have said like they tried to make Cosmos work because they were already on Azure and have realized that just couldn't meet their needs, so they came to MongoDB. We've had some large ISV relationships who have strategic partnerships with Microsoft, who had every incentive to try to make Cosmos work, and it didn't work for them. Now there's no question being a cloud provider and just being in the flip screen of all the deals going -- or all the workloads moving to the cloud that they are definitely getting business, but when it comes to head to head, we're feeling very comfortable about our positioning. And we feel very excited about the future. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK, great. And are there any areas where you could be complementary to what they're doing or not really? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think, no. With a database -- I mean, typically, a database is pretty much an architectural decision, so I think where we see the complementary nature is less about the database and more around the ancillary infrastructure, where we can help customers consume more kind of compute and storage services and other services that the cloud prior may offer. And so we're seeing that not only with Microsoft, but we're seeing that with the other partners as well, which is why they're very motivated to work with us. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. And then just two quick follow-ups. You had really strong international results this quarter. I was wondering if you could share what drove the strength there. And then just a follow-up. I think Raimo might have asked earlier a little bit about the -- if you could give us an idea of the EA features in Atlas in better driving adoption and what customers are asking for in particular for EA in Atlas, that would be great. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, sure. So the international growth is really driven by the fact that we've been investing with teams in EMEA and Asia for the last couple of years, and we're really starting to see the results of that -- those investments, both in terms of just the size of deals we're doing, the strategic nature of those deals and the relationship that we're building. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. And I would tell you that we're still -- we still have wide swaths of EMEA and Asia that we don't have a lot of people in. So there's lots of opportunity to continue to expand our reach. But it's really a function of putting people in market, having good leaders in place who can directly manage them and bring a real focus to that market, and we see good things happening. Candidly, one of the -- the question that was asked earlier with Michael -- for Michael about investments, we constantly get asked, hey, should we put people in the Middle East, should we expand more quickly into Latin Americas. And so it's just a function of how large this market is. And obviously, we want to be disciplined about how we run the business, but there's -- we are not market constrained. There's a massive market out there. And then in terms of EA features, we've introduced and we'll continue to introduce a bunch of commercial features in Atlas around security, auditing, the ability to use our BI connector, which allows people to run reports right off of Atlas. Those are all proprietary features that are now available on Atlas, and you'll see that the number of those kind of features grow over time. So that's just, again, expanding and offering more capabilities on Atlas that gets people comfortable at putting mission-critical workloads on that platform. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you so much. Operator We'll move next to Richard Davis with Canaccord. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thanks. So maybe we'll do some product questions. So you guys have -- my understanding is you have a really good kind of aggregation framework, which is, as we all know, kind of the dirty little secret in data. What's -- the hard part is kind of getting everything lined up, so you can actually query it, stuff like that. Can you kind of talk about how this differentiates Mongo from other firms? And then the ancillary question is -- and I think, the answer is 99% chance is no. But is there any overlap with you kind of aggregation framework and things that are offered by companies like Alteryx and Talend? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So just for everyone else's benefit, what an aggregation framework is, is in layman terms, is just the ability to process and analyze data inside the database. And most NoSQL databases do not have this capability. It's one of the things that really distinguishes MongoDB from other more modern databases. Relational databases have this capability, but relational databases suffer from the problem of being an architecture that was built 40 years ago. And so they have trouble scaling and having resiliency in their platform. So what MongoDB does is gives you all the benefits of relational database with the power to scale, the performance and the flexibility of a modern database, which is why it makes such an attractive platform for developers. And so that's essentially what the aggregation framework does, and it's a very attractive part of our value proposition to our -- to those developers and customers who are using MongoDB. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. And then you already got 85 questions on Atlas, but I'll ask one anyway. So I think I saw that you lowered the price, is that MongoDB Atlas cost center is I think deployed on AWS Mumbai. Is that right by like 10% to 15%? Is that right? And so can you maybe talk about the logic and expected payoff from that decision? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And so what we've seen is actually a little bit of a price war going on between AWS and Google in that marketplace. And so as a beneficiary of being a basically a customer of AWS and as they started reducing prices in that market, we were able to pass on those savings to those customers. We think, obviously, that market is also more price sensitive than, say, other markets just because of the cost of labor is it that much cheaper. And we feel like India is a massive market for us. It's one of the highest download sites of any region in the world. And we're very excited about the opportunity there, and we believe that those price decreases will pay off in a big way. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thank you very much. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator And next, we have Jack Andrews with Needham. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the catalyst that enabled you to have the 20-plus conversations with C-level executives. I mean, is that related to the fact that we keep hearing some of these digital transformations are not going so well? Or just how did you really get an opportunity to have those types of conversations? Was it through direct sales? Partners? If you could shed some light on that, would be helpful. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, absolutely. So I would say a couple things. I would say that with regards to a lot of these digital transformation efforts, obviously, everyone has been talking about digital transformation for a while, but what people find is that it's far easier said than done. In fact, one of the blockers to basically getting to where people want to go is the fact that they have trouble using their data. The data is either trapped in silos. It's hard to use. There's a lot of duplicative data and so forth. And so people are realizing that they don't have a way to really manage their data. Their ability to be successful is going to be limited. Second, I would say is that we, as a company, have fundamentally changed a lot over the last few years. Obviously, we went public last October. That was a real signal to customers that we are now a really viable and strategic partner to companies. The maturity of the product has increased dramatically, especially now with the announcement of ACID transaction support. That perked up a lot of people's ears about the fact that, wow, they could use MongoDB for virtually any use case. And I would also say the maturity and the efficacy of our go-to-market efforts, these meetings didn't just happen by themselves because our sales teams are now being much more strategic on how they engage with customers. We're trying to go higher earlier in the sales cycle, and that's yielding these kinds of meetings. And so I would tell you that these -- the quality of these meetings have been outstanding, and it's really a sign of, one, how important this is to all these customers; and two, our credibility as a potential partner to them in their efforts. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst And then just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that people are in the evaluation process of MongoDB 4.0 right now. Could you just talk about maybe just qualitatively the level of interest you're seeing for this particular release of your product versus maybe some other releases? And how optimistic are you of a potential uplift, if you will, from this product? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say the interest has been extremely high. It's probably been the most requested feature for a number of years. So when we announced it in February, there was a huge amount of receptivity, positive receptivity to that announcement. That also generated a bunch of new engagements with the customers and prospects, and frankly, it's allowing us to be more strategic. The beta version of the software is available for people to use and test. The feedback has been very positive, and we expect to GA it in the near future. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We move next to Brian White with Monness, Crespi. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Yes. On the IBM relationship, how should we think about that ramping in fiscal '19? And IBM has their own cloud, so I'm wondering if you're going to have a partnership with their cloud as well. And will they be selling Atlas? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say that we are quite optimistic about the IBM relationship. We feel like it's a real relationship. It's not, again, one of these Barney announcements. And as I said -- and the way it's real is that their salespeople are now incentivized to sell Atlas to their customers. We're already seeing interest in -- I'm sorry, MongoDB -- we're already seeing interest in the field, and there's already a bunch of engagements happening in a bunch of different regions. And so I'll defer to Michael in terms of how we think we want to -- how we think it will show up in -- Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Look, I think it'll take time. The agreement has some time horizon for them to work through the commitment, so it won't be an immediate impact and will take time for them to ramp the global sales force. But we should see the benefit of it over time. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst And just as a follow-up, 5G commercial network starting to come online this year. And so I'm wondering, what does 5G mean to MongoDB? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think one of the things about -- one of the trends that we see very clearly is the rise of mobile applications. And MongoDB has been well suited for a long time for people to build mobile apps. One, it's a very -- mobile apps tend to have a very high rate of change because people are constantly adding new features, fixing bugs, and so they need a platform that can enable them to have high developer productivity. Obviously, with certain apps, you can have thousands, if not, millions of users, and so you want a platform that could scale. And with the distributed capabilities, you also want to have fast or low latency as we provide access. And so MongoDB is well designed for those kind of use cases. And as the pipes get bigger, it's 5G today, it could be something else in the future, that only plays to our strength because it will encourage people to build higher performance, more content rich, more streaming content, video and so forth that has more -- requires more bandwidth, and that plays well to MongoDB as people think about building those kinds of applications. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator And everyone, that concludes our question-and-answer session at this time. For closing remarks, I'd like to turn it back over to Dev Ittycharia. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, we're really pleased about the quarter. I think we're thrilled about the fact that MongoDB is increasingly being viewed as a strategic vendor by customers everywhere. There's clearly strong demand for MongoDB all around the world, and the breadth of use case continues to grow. We're really excited about the partner ecosystem growing as evidenced by the IBM relationship and the fact that our partner business is really healthy. And obviously, Atlas continues to grow very, very quickly. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our MongoDB World Conference on June 27, and so we encourage all of you to visit us here in New York City. Thank you.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"TSB branch in London: Paul Pester appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken and where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts. Photograph: Neil Hall Has the embattled chief executive of TSB found time to attend an emergency media-training course since his disastrous appearance at Westminster last month? We’ll find out on Wednesday when Paul Pester is grilled by MPs for the second time in just over a month on the calamitous IT failure at the challenger bank earlier this year. Pester’s first appearance at the treasury select committee on May 2nd is widely regarded as a master class in how not to handle questions from angry parliamentarians. Indeed, many observers deemed his performance even worse than that of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, when he informed astonished committee members back in 2011 that the time for “remorse and apology” for bankers was over. The main problem with the TSB boss was that he appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken, where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts and where nobody had missed out on house, holiday or car purchases because they could not access their cash. But the committee had examples of all the above and gave a graphic real-time demonstration of the scale of the chaos when two staff members attempted – unsuccessfully – to access their TBS accounts even as Pester sat there claiming things were running smoothly. His response: “It’s nice to see we’ve got so many TSB customers in the room. Thanks for banking with us” has to go down as one of the most ill-judged attempts at humour from a boss whose job is clearly on the line. Media training or not, there will be little opportunity for levity at Wednesday’s session. Last time, Pester was unable to say when the problems would be fixed, nor was he able to give any guidance on how many businesses had been affected, or how large the bank’s compensation bill might be. He’s not going to get away with that. More than six weeks on, many TSB customers say they are still locked out of their accounts and report long waits to get through to helplines. Customers logging in to the bank’s website are still being greeted with the message “We’re working to put things right” along with a helpline number – and a warning that lines are busier than usual. Fraudsters are using the cover of the chaos to target TSB account holders, with numerous incidences of bogus texts, emails and telephone calls. Stressed TSB employees are feeling the impact too, with reports of a large number of defections to other banks. There’s been no information yet about how many customers have closed their accounts. Pester will clearly be anticipating a rough ride but he was given a taste of just how tough his grilling will be in the form of an exchange of letters between Nicky Morgan and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. In the letters, released on Wednesday morning, FCA head Andrew Bailey – who will also be attending the session – takes the unusual step of publicly criticising the TSB boss for his over-optimistic spin on the botched IT job. He also suggests that Pester had more detail on the extent of the systems failure that he could, and should, have shared with the committee in May. Morgan, meanwhile, has piled on the pressure by saying she remains “deeply concerned” about the “quality and accuracy” of the evidence provided to the committee by Pester. The TSB boss may have taken some comfort on Tuesday when Tesco Bank was hit by its own IT glitch, leaving customers unable to access their accounts online or via mobile phone. They were still able to use their cards, however, and normal service was restored within five hours. A systems failure at Visa last Friday also caused widespread disruption in the UK – where it processes a third of all spending – and across Europe as customers were unable to use their cards to pay for transactions. Morgan has written to Visa Europe boss Charlotte Hogg, demanding to know when the company first became aware of the failure, how many cards were affected, and whether customers will be compensated. If she’s not satisfied with the answers, Morgan says she’ll be calling Hogg, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, to appear before the committee too. The credit card company has said the meltdown was triggered by a hardware failure but has given no detail. The joke doing the rounds in the City is that Visa made the mistake of calling in Mr Pester to advise on IT. Fiona Walsh is business editor of theguardian.com Subscribe.

Private Equity By Jon Shazar (MLB Shop) April was not a good month for Mark Walter. His Los Angeles Dodgers, which came oh so close to giving him his first World Series title in November, sputtered out of the gate with a record even worse than that of their hated rivals in San Francisco. (Things have not gotten much better since.) The SEC’s probe into Guggenheim Partners’ relationship with Bob Diamond grew into a look at Walter’s home-buying practices, including an $85 million pad in Malibu he personally co-owns and a house in Pacific Palisades that his lady friend—who is not his special lady, according to Guggenheim—has been living in. And to top it all off, said lady friend, on-leave Guggenheim global head of internal distribution Alexandra Court, has left to do her own thing. Ms. Court, who went on sabbatical in June 2017, departed in April, according to her LinkedIn profile…. Ms. Court’s personal website said she is “now focused on her own entrepreneurial and social impact interests, as well as advising businesses on growth strategies and implementation plans….” She also had a personal relationship with Guggenheim Chief Executive Mark Walter, according to people familiar with the matter. Guggenheim’s board reviewed the relationship and took no action, these people said. “If there were a relationship, the prospect of a nonbusiness relationship would have been fully and promptly disclosed to the appropriate parties at Guggenheim in accordance with established processes and procedures, which then would have been fully implemented, to avoid improper influence or favor,” a Guggenheim spokesman said last year.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Barclays would be delighted to get access to Standard Chartered's $56 billion in Asian deposits.(AFP) Is a major banking deal brewing in the City of London? The grapevine contends that Barclays chairman John McFarlane is under pressure from activist shareholder Edward Bramson's Sherborne fund, which has accumulated a 5.4 per cent stake in the 3-century old former Quaker High Street bank that Bob Diamond morphed in the early 2000s into Britain's only bulge bracket global investment bank Bramson wants Barclays to shrink or even sell Barclays Capital, its investment banking crown jewel, to release $40 billion in dedicated capital to the unit. This is anathema to Jes Staley, the bank's American, ex J.P. Morgan Master of the Universe CEO. McFarlane and Staley would prefer to blunt Bramson's activist thrust by making a takeover bid for Standard Chartered, a bank that never recovered from disastrous lending spree to Indian steel oligarchs and colossal mismanagement by its senior executives in London, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Gulf under former CEO Peter Sands, ultimately ousted by pressure from Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund that is its largest shareholder. StanChart has not really recovered since Sands's ouster. Revenues have fallen 20 per cent since 2014 while overhead is still bloated. CEO Bill Winters, another J.P. Morgan alumnus has been unable to boost the bank's return on equity above its cost of capital or deliver a credible growth strategy. Barclays would be delighted to get access to StanChart's $56 billion in Asian deposits and its franchises in some of the hottest banking markets in the Pacific Rim. Yet a $90 billion merger would necessitate a stock swap that might not be palatable to Temasek or other StanChart shareholders since Barclays shares trade well below tangible book value due to its pathetic ROE, multiple legal swords of Damocles and history of boardroom palace coups and CEO regicide. StanChart's culture is unique in UK finance and there is no real regional overlap with Barclays, now that it has decided to exit Africa and the Middle East to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays shareholders would be hugely diluted by an offer for StanChart at a time when they desperately want management to boost dividends and profits, not engage in self-serving deal making. It is also doubtful if a takeover bid from a bank that faces US Justice Department and FCA charges over the 2008 emergency capital raising scheme, whose four former top executives face criminal charges in the case, whose celebrity CEO Bob Diamond was grilled in the House of Commons and fired by the Bank of England's diktat after the LIBOR manipulation scandal would send Stan Chart shareholders into paroxysms of delight. Zero plus zero still equals zero. A failed bid for StanChart would mean the axe for McFarlane, Staley and possibly the corporate and investment banking franchises. This is an irony since Staley survived the whistleblower scandal with a mere £640,000 fine from regulators and settled the US mortgage misselling scandal for $2 billion, not the feared $5 billion with Justice. The Crown Court also dropped the Serious Fraud Office (SFO's) criminal case against Barclays, removing a threat to its UK banking license, though Justice, SEC and FCA probes into the 2008 fund raising in the Gulf remain live. None of this makes me sanguine about the odds of a Barclays cash and share bid for Standard Chartered Bank. Size matters in global banking, yet a ""Godzilla strategy"" alone will not solve the myriad problems faced by Britain's two historic but troubled money center banks. I do not believe these banks will merge in the proximate future. There is no evidence that either bank has engaged advisors, lawyers, white knights or political allies or creditor syndicates for an imminent deal. Yet Edward Bramson's Sherborne can well goose Barclays share price once it unveils its restructuring (shrinking?) blueprint. Standard Chartered remains they juiciest takeover bait in international banking, a Cinderella waiting from a kiss from a fairy tale prince names Jamie, not Jes. A blowout May payroll number and the formation of a new Italian government in Rome means the bear market in US Treasury debt resumes with a vengeance. A 3.8 per cent unemployment rate and 0.3 per cent average hourly earnings means the Powell Fed has reached the limits of its dual mandate. This means a certain interest rate hike at the June FOMC, the September FOMC and possibly even the December FOMC.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Ruth Sunderland for the Mail on Sunday Published: 16:26 EST, 26 May 2018 | Updated: 06:30 EST, 27 May 2018 10 View comments Do we really need a big British investment bank? I ask the question because Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, apparently believes we do – and he thinks that the City regulators are of the same mind. One of the many battles Staley has been fighting is against activist investor Edward Bramson, who wants Barclays to scale back its investment banking arm. Staley, a Wall Streeter imported to Canary Wharf from JP Morgan, is determined to hold on to it. Not only that, but he is also said to believe the regulators will back him, on the basis it would be bad for the country to lose our only remaining home-grown investment bank. Ruth Sunderland says generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank Since the Big Bang opened up the Square Mile to overseas players in 1986, the investment banking scene has been dominated by the big boys from the US: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley et al. It’s rather like Wimbledon –lovely when the top players happen to be British, but not essential. The main thing is that Britain plays host, not the nationality of the participants. There is a respectable argument that the UK needs an investment bank of its own to look after its interest when underwriting Government debt issues. But generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank, which provides straightforward banking services to individuals and firms, from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank. The bank has suffered almost from a split-personality, with the workaday UK operation on one side and the casino on the other. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays The conflict between the two is reflected in the way the bank has swung to-and-fro in the selection of its chief executives: investment banker Staley follows Antony Jenkins from the retail side, who in turn came as an antidote to Bob Diamond. But there is a larger point at stake. The financial crisis revealed how taxpayers could end up having to foot the bill for the antics of casino banks. For much of the 20th Century, this was not an issue because of post-Depression era rules brought in during the 1930s that meant investment banking and the humdrum high street variety had to be kept separate. That legislation was repealed in the late 1990s, and many observers see it as a major factor in the crisis. As a consequence, we now have ‘ring-fencing’ where large operators such as Barclays are allowed to own investment and retail banks but have to quarantine them off from one another. The history of ‘ring-fences’ and ‘Chinese Walls’, however, is that they are not fool-proof and can erode over time. Barclays has been struggling for years to overcome a toxic culture where it historically, and recently, has been at odds with regulators. Relations came close to breaking down totally in the Bob Diamond era and Staley had his own run-in, when he was recently censured for attempting to expose a whistleblower. The bank has been dogged by a crisis era loan of $3 billion it made to Qatari investors, when it carried out an £11.8 billion emergency fund-raising in 2008 to avoid a UK Government bail-out. Charges by the Serious Fraud Office related to that loan have been thrown out by a court but former senior managers are still on the hook. Staley’s view on the investment bank has been at odds with the previously expressed opinion of the chairman, who has said he thought it best to shrink it. In any event, the notion that Barclays wants to save its investment bank for the good of the nation, rather than its own highly bonused employees, invites scepticism. The City has oodles of investment banking expertise, which is great for larger companies. Small and medium firms, however, have far too often been exploited and maltreated by their lenders. It may not be as exciting, or as lucrative, but what we really do need is a properly functioning business bank.

SANTA FE, N.M. — In 1921, the New York Times named Taos the “Provincetown of the Desert,” comparing the small, high desert town in New Mexico to a long-established art colony on Cape Cod, Mass. The Times report was recognition of Taos’ own up-and-coming status in the art world, spurred by the Taos Society of Artists. The 12-person collective, which included painters who had moved in from the Midwest and East Coast, like Joseph Henry Sharp, Ernest Blumenschein and E.I. Couse, existed from 1915 to 1927. Most of the members became famous for their paintings of New Mexico landscapes, and the Pueblo people who lived in and around Taos. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “It preserved a record of a time and of the peoples in that time, principally in northern New Mexico,” said Carl Jones, president of the Couse Foundation, an organization named after the art society’s first president that operates the Couse-Sharp Historic Site in downtown Taos. The society “helped preserve customs, traditions, on canvas, that would’ve been lost a long time ago,” Jones said. The existing site includes studios of both Couse and Sharp. For the past several years, the foundation has been in talks about a central location for archival and research materials about all the Taos collective’s members. A recent grant of $600,000 has pushed the plan closer toward its goal of a 2021 opening. The Lunder Foundation, a Portland, Maine, organization started by Dexter Shoe Co. founder Peter Lunder and his wife, Paula, awarded the grant earlier this month. Jones wouldn’t say how much the total project will cost, but noted that a public fundraising campaign is on the horizon. The facility will be named The Lunder Research Center. “This is an opportunity to do something significant for the first time with Western art,” said Kevin Gillis, the Lunder Foundation’s president. He said most of the organization’s grants are given on the East Coast, despite the Lunder couple’s affinity for Western art. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “Peter and Paula think what Couse is doing is very worthwhile,” Gillis said. The Couse Foundation in Taos, which is planning an archival and research facility for materials related to the Taos Society of Artists, recently received a $600,000 grant to further the project. (SOURCE: The Couse Foundation) The grant, Jones said, will go toward repurposing a building next to the existing historic site. With 4,800 square feet of usable space, the research center will have a storage room for items like original documents; a smaller storage space for Native American artifacts collected by the Taos artists; a research library with literature on the society and the histories of New Mexico, Taos, and native peoples; a conservation space dedicated to the preservation of decades-old materials, and administrative offices for the Couse Foundation. Jones said he expects the facility to attract Western art professors, authors, graduate students and other scholars specifically studying the Taos Society artists and their work. The research center building has housed the Mission Gallery, whose owner is retiring. Parts of the Mission building are remnants of Sharp’s home, according to Jones. The center’s collection will include documents, articles, photos, artifacts and artworks relating to or previously belonging to almost all 12 society members, including Couse, Sharp, Blumenschein, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, Julius Rolshoven, E. Martin Hennings and W. Herbert Dunton. Jones said that as the center establishes itself, he hopes to attract items specifically relating to other society members who didn’t leave as much behind. For Couse alone, the collection includes 10,000 photographic negatives and 5,000 photo prints, all relating to his artwork. Also in the center will be more than 30 Couse sketchbooks, paintings, personal letters and records of who purchased his paintings, and about 30 pairs of moccasins and other pieces of Native American clothing he collected. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Notre Dame connection “It’s going to be the most extensive, highly specialized archive on any group of artists,” said Dean Porter, a Taos Society scholar and retired director of the University of Notre Dame’s Snite Museum of Art. The main gallery and reception area of the research center will be named after Porter. He and several Taos Society experts from across the county have donated or promised the project various items. Porter is the author of several articles and books about Ufer and Higgins, whose work he discovered in the 1970s as part of Norte Dame’s museum collection. He also studied and wrote about the entire society as a co-author of the 1999 book “Taos Artists and their Patrons: 1898-1950.” He’s promised the center an estimated 20 boxes of materials, including interviews he conducted with close acquaintances and relatives of the Taos artists, like Oscar Berninghaus’ daughter and Higgins’ caretaker, as well as books, research papers and news articles. “Every article ever written on the Taos Society of Artists I have copies of,” Porter said during a recent phone interview from his home in Granger, Ind. He wishes something like the research center had existed when he started his work on the society more than 40 years ago. There’s a new generation of Taos Society scholars coming up nationwide who will benefit from access to the center collection, he said. Personal items like letters and notes will provide an inside look at the artists’ lives and thoughts. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Porter recalled a time when there wasn’t much focus on documents and papers relating to the Taos Society artists. He recalled a trip to New Mexico in 1975 when he visited Higgins’ first wife, Sara Parsons, during which time she handed him five paper grocery bags full of his letters, notes and receipts. “That was the archives,” he said with a laugh. The project is designed to bring materials like that back home, said Jones. He said there’s a risk they could end up donated and scattered among colleges and universities across the country where they might never see the light of day. “It would’ve been a real loss to the state of New Mexico or the town,” he said. “This is where they were created and this is where they came from.” Advertisement Copyright © 2018 Albuquerque Journal | Albuquerque, N.M. $10/mo Subscribe Other Offers Already a subscriber?

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Beecher Tuttle 25 May 2018 Following a lengthy restructuring process, Barclays is still under a great deal of pressure – as is the bank’s chief executive, Jes Staley. Meanwhile, the man who once held Staley’s post, controversial former CEO Bob Diamond, is quietly thriving. Barclays’ struggling investment banking division hasn’t reversed course as quickly as many had hoped, despite an aggressive growth strategy championed by Staley. The slow progress led activist investor Edward Bramson last week to call on Barclays to take a knife to the investment bank, stripping it of virtually all trading functions. Now, Barclays is said to be mulling a merger with fellow British bank Standard Chartered as a potential attempt to thwart Bramson’s demands. While the details of the rumor are murky, what’s clear is that Staley has his hands full. Diamond, who resigned amid the Libor controversy in 2012, appears to be enjoying more success while tangentially dipping his toes back into investment banking. London stockbroker Panmure Gordon, owned by Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital, is building an advisory and equity capital markets business, according to Financial News. The firm plans to double its headcount in London in the “medium term” after bringing on an M&A head back in January. Future hires will include managing director-level bankers as well as juniors. While Diamond doesn’t personally run Panmure Gordon, his fingerprints were likely all over the move. At the time of the takeover, Panmure’s then-CEO Patric Johnson said the firm would not become ""Barclays 2.0. It is not Bob Diamond coming back in and saying he is going to be chief executive.” Just one month later, Diamond’s firm replaced Johnson with a familiar face: former Barclays executive Ian Axe, who hinted at expanding the investment bank at the time of his hire. No matter how direct Dimon’s role, the former investment banker has to be smiling just a bit. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank just got kicked when it was already down. Literally hours after announcing plans to cut at least 7,000 jobs globally, Deutsche Bank acknowledged a Bloomberg report that it mistakenly transferred nearly $25 billion to Macquarie back in 2014 due to a human error. The blunder wouldn’t be as newsworthy if Deutsche Bank didn’t do something similar in March of this year, when it transferred 28 billion euros to its own Eurex account when it meant to transfer 28 billion yen. That’s a difference of $32.7 billion. When it rains, it pours. Meanwhile: Former Goldman Sachs CEO and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine isn’t exactly crushing it with his new hedge fund. He’s raised just around $20 million so far. (Fox Business) President Trump has signed a bill that will roll back some Dodd-Frank mandates that put restrictions on smaller community banks with less than $250 billion in assets. The bigger news may be that the bill won’t offer any exemptions for bulge-bracket banks. (Reuters) Bank of England Governor Mark Carney believes the mechanisms are now in place to remove and punish “rolling bad apples” within banking. Carney is in the camp that believes individual bankers should face similar punishments aimed at banks. (Bloomberg) Merrill Lynch brokers are reportedly up-in-arms over a new compensation program that punishes advisors who don’t meet certain cross-selling targets. Some claim the plan is being implemented retroactively, equating to a clawback.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe, reports that Zambian multi-millionaire entrepreneur Rajan Mahtani has lost ownership of Zambezi Portland Cement, a leading cement manufacturer in the southern African country, as the High Court of Zambia awarded full ownership of the company to the Ventriglia family of Italy on Monday. The resolution follows a 10-year court battle between the Ventriglia family and Rajan Mahtani, a Zambian businessman of Indian origin. Mahtani had always claimed that he owned a 58% controlling stake in the business as payment for organizing financing for the Ventriglia family years ago, but the Ventriglia family insisted that he had no claim to the stake, asserting full ownership of the company. The Ventriglia family is one of the wealthiest and most powerful business families in Zambia today. In 1957, the patriarch of the family, Antonio Ventriglia along with his wife and children arrived Zambia from Italy. They established a Terazzo company, Ital Terazzo, which eventually became very successful. In an effort to diversify their investments in Zambia, the family decided to venture into cement manufacturing, establishing the Zambezi Portland Cement Company. The family approached Rajan Mahtani, a popular financier and business mogul who was a family friend to the Ventriglias, and asked him to help arrange financing for the new cement company. Mahtani, who was the Chairman and controlling shareholder of Finance Bank, Zambia, used his influence to syndicate a $100 million loan from the European Development Fund and the Kenya’s PTA Bank. In return, the Ventriglia family orally agreed to sell a 49% stake in the cement company to Rajan Mahtani’s investment vehicle, Finsbury Investments, for a discounted price of $60 million – an amount Mahtani never paid. The Ventriglia family soon needed additional financing in order to increase the cement plant’s capacity and Mahtani was on hand to help arrange an additional loan, in return for an additional 9% stake in the company for a discounted price. Even though Mahtani never paid for the shares he orally agreed to buy, he allegedly fraudulently procured his company secretaries to alter the register of Members and filed with Zambia’s Registrar of Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA) a fake photocopy of share transfer certificates indicating that he was a member and shareholder in Zambezi Portland Cement. The Ventriglia family has insisted that they never transferred the shares to Mahtani’s company. On Monday, the court ruled that Mahtani had indeed falsified share transfer certificates in the company, and as such did not own any shares in Zambezi Portland Cement. “Mahtani has been unable to produce the original signed copies of the share transfer certificates because they simply do not exist and he never paid for the shares. As such, complete ownership of the company firmly rests with the Antonio Ventriglia family,” a spokesperson of Zambezi Portland Cement confirmed to this reporter via email. Rajan Mahtani, 70, is one of Zambia’s most successful, yet controversial businessmen. He was previously the controlling shareholder and chairman of Zambia’s Finance Bank before it was acquired by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara in 2015. In Zambian businessman Chisanga Puta-Chekwe’s acclaimed book, Cobra In The Boat: Michael Sata’s Zambia, he claims that Mahtani brokered a controversial deal whereby the Zambian Government sold off the state-owned Konkola Copper Mines Plc, one of Africa’s largest integrated copper producers (and a company easily worth hundreds of millions of dollars), to Vedanta resources controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, for only $25 million, a tiny fraction of its real value. Rajan Mahtani did not respond to an email requesting for comment at the time of publishing this story. Source:Forbes This story is older than three days, the judgement has even been appealed against. The news now is about the appeal. Poor chap. Instead of enjoying his retirement, he is always being stressed by court issues. This man has been a crook all along period! This is how these crooks like Mahtani used to grab businesses…you go to his bank for assistance he sees an opportunity takeover your business.. alot of people have not been so lucky. Only in Zambia can a vile crook like Mahtani can still walk the streets freely. You are the one who is behind the case is over, no such thing as appeal, Rajan has been a shade character for a long time. An Indian wants to do an Italian job on Italians Mahtani is not a poor chap. He is a crook. Stole from Late Puta’s family (Mr. Puta was a shareholder and director of Finance Bank) Stole from Late Wadood’s family (Mr. Wadood was Managing Director of Finance Bank) Stole from Mr. Savior Konie (Mr. Konie was Managing Director of Professional Insurance) Stole from Mr. Fearon (Mr. Fearon was Managing Director of Finance Building Society). As for Zambezi Portland Cement, Money Launderer Mahtani’s partner in crime, Mr. Barkat Ali issued a fake letter that Rajan had brought in 5 million US dollars as capital and got a loan approved on that basis from his corrupt friend Michael Gondwe (then President of PTA Bank). Rajan is a money launderer. He steals tax from the UK, Canada, Zambia through his sister Schultz and girl friend Craven… Mathani is a gazetted crook. This Mahtani guy is greedy. People are blaming HH for having sold KCM for 25m. But it appears this guy was all behind the undervaluation. Because he was Ba Satas friend kaili so the PF spin doctors will always prefer HH mentioned in the sale of mines. It is good when such revelations happen hopefully some people see that selling a mine was not like vending imbalala by the roadside…..But the whole idea is so easy to sale to the gullible and simple minds of most voters that HH sold all the mines. Unfortunately it is a “Good” political strategy from the PF though. It is up to the UPND and HH to “unspin” it. But i dont expect supposedly educated people to believe this …please leave it to the uneducated gullible HH was not involved in the later sale of KCM. I don’t like HH but I wouldn’t allow people to falsely accuse him. HH was involved with Anglo-American the first buyers of the company. It’s if anything Levy Mwanawasa who should take the blame. KCM Plc saga was: The late Levy Patrick Mwanawasa msrip-HH-Rajah Mahtan. This thug sold KCM in exchange for $50,000,000 commission for himself and another $25,000,000 for Maureen Mwanawasa. Typical Indian this Mahtani. They want to own things without spending anything. How many times is he going to ‘lose’ ownership? Next story please Justice has been served. Mahtani’s list of controversies go back when he swindled the Zambian people through that Carrington maize deal and used Nawakwi and M’membe to divert the blame on FTJ. Who can forget writing off a $4m loan for Mutembo Nchito in exchange for a Nolle Prosequi after a court had bonafide evidence that he forge a judge’s signature?? Mahtani is a hardcore white collar crook whose luck has run out after manipulating previous presidencies to his advantage. Waloba ilyauma. Justice for the Ventrigllias and congrats!! The chap should spend his retirement in a Zambian Jail. That’s what he been sowing all these years. Mahtani’s crookedness goes back to the time he swindled the late Humphrey Mulemba who had entrusted him with ill-gotten wealth from the late Tiny Rowland. Sounds like good history. Would you like to share more on this story @Duda And when he is in trouble he jumped on a plane to UK …using his British passport. The man is vile and evil…there is nothing inspirational about his richies he is a sick petty little crook..am surprised he is still alive after so people he has crossed. Well, thief stealing from thief is not theft. Tiny Rowland? That name is familar what business did he own?? @8.4 jay jay he owned Lonhro group of companies. A crook. I think he even wrote a book about how he stole wealth from Africans. You can google the man. Thanks …I have just read about him on Wikipedia…apparently in 1996 President Nelson Mandela awarded Rowland the Order of Good Hope, the highest South African honour..really laughable. He stole from late Nyambe, the then Vice Chairman of Finance Bank. Cement is too expensive in Zambia. It’s not easy to build in Zambia. Zambian are so useless and lazy that even news happening under their noses they have to read without shame in Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe. This Mahtani is a big crook …there he is taking things to court based on oral agreement…these are the people involved in selling KCM for a song to his Indian friend Anil. *Zambian media…. The perennial doomsayer …Come see what your friends are doing here in Zed…i was there dude…always berating Zambia from the diaspora…when i cam back home, was shocked to see how young people were moving forward with businesses, savings, property etc… Dont be led on by social media sir…. Who’s berating who? Have you read what I have written ..always the same fooools posting comments and changing their silly names? So it was a Zambian of Indian origin who crooked the people of Zambia to sell the mine to his fellow Indian for a song and not the Tonga man from bweengwa.No wonder Some one said lies have no legs to stand on. In addition, it was Mathani who took J&W investment to State House in February 2004 and took Baluba Mine away from First Quantum. That move shaped the future of Luanshya town! Zambians must apologise to HH for falsely accusing him of the sale of KCM to Indians for a song. HH, I Chitapankwa Allepo Trump do tender in an apology for falsely accusing you on the deal. On behalf of all those who did not read, I say I am sorry. The only issue I have got with UPND now is the adoption of Charmaine. If he is found to have forged docs, let him be caged or deported to Kashmir. We are tired of chinese, Lebanese & Indian crooks hiding behind legal technicalities while abating rampant corruption When he is about to be caged he jumps on a plane to UK…its from the likes of this guy I first heard of the term dual citizenship…then bribes top leaders in Zambia whilst there; as he can not stand UK he longs staying in Zambia where he is treated like a God. Falsified legal documents? How about some jail time? He would never see the inside of a jail…he has too many secrets; this crook used to fund a lot of political campaigns!! The KCM sale was another of LPM’s frauds, apart from the Zesco deals. Rajan won’t let go without a fight. If both parties weren’t greedy, there wasn’t going to be all this, what’s wrong with these ba Zimandola? Those Italian mafia are supposed to be Mahtani’s employees because without him there wasn’t going to be Zambezi Portland nor Ital Terrazzo. KK is too old to reconcile them, maybe Tom Mtine, he’s another Zimandola Ayatalloh Terrazzo started off as a small company when no one sold tiles especially marble tiles or roofing tiles in Zambia give credit where its due…Rajan was using his bank to find out weakness in your business and using that against you …this *****t has breached every banking law there is and he is still around because he is connected like a gun merchant. …before the Chinese money arrived Rajan was the go to guy for laundering money!! KK gave up on Mahtani a long time ago. If it wasn’t for Rajan ‘s Mum, KK would have jailed him for a good number of years and deported him to the UK. The relationship between the Ventriglia family and Mahtani family is a business relationship. It centers on Zambezi Portland Cement Company. It is unlikely that the Mahtani family deserves to go away empty handed. Leave company shares alone. Focus on the loan facilitation process. Estimate the value of the facilitation process. What are the service charges for the loan? What is the average level of service charges in the financial sector? The Mahtani family needed to work with reliable lawyers when dealing with huge sums of money. But fees here seem a reasonable proposition for the Mahtani family to be paid to them by the Ventriglia family. The Itanian family owes Mahtani, $8.7Bn in facilitation and interests, a claim reads in part. But, how can facilitation fee be 8000% more than actual loan obtained??? Serves him right. First the Guptas are chased with their tails between their tun Nchafu. Now Mathani is about to face the new Africa. Kikiki I am loving this. No connections in the current govt. That’s what happens. Ati Banker. Worse than the neighbourhood shylock who appeared like owning the gleamy cars parked in yard. Now the mojo is gone. The Venitians just want their blood. Mahtani should do with palty return on his flesh sold to Bob and Co. Comments are closed. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"It might be little more than a month since the founder’s defenestration at media giant WPP but Sir Martin Sorrell was prominent last night on the main “boulevard” at the Chelsea Flower Show’s exclusive gala for the titans of corporate Britain. Was the diminutive multimillionaire, last spotted at the Royal Wedding, hunting clients for a new venture? “I don’t have to hunt for clients,” laughed the adman, who apparently has “many things” planned for the future. Sorrell was earlier spotted deep in a huddle with Goldman Sachs chieftain Richard Gnodde. Spy doubts they were discussing the dahlias. Talk of financing his new venture perhaps? Don’t be misled by the brainiac reputation of Adair Turner, former Financial Services Authority chairman and serial think-tanker. He was the only bigwig brave enough to take the plunge down the showpiece 40ft treehouse slide, to hearty cheers from all. Spy wondered if he’d be leaping for the top job at the Bank of England when Mark Carney’s term ends next year. He went for it last time, but alas, not now. “I don’t think they’d give it to me,” he admits. Turner was mingling by the well-populated stand of sponsors M&G Investments where City luminaries such as BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and Korn Ferry headhunting supremo Oliver Pawle also lurked, as former PM David Cameron and wife Samantha wandered by. The City’s finest have clearly been hitting the gym in the past year. Keen gardener Stephen Hester, chief executive of RSA, had shed a few pounds. He said he was still “emotionally attached” to his old shop RBS, and will be soon be lunching with his successor there, Ross McEwan. Ryvita only, by the looks of it. Sainsbury high-up John Rogers, still Spy’s favourite to be chief executive Mike Coupe’s successor, was also a shadow of his former self — in weight terms at least. The once-portly grocer was barely unrecognisable in his svelte new guise, all helped by spending several days a week in a flat above a Sainsbury’s in Argos’ home town of Milton Keynes where, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do but go to the gym. Coupe was sprightly as ever, fresh from news of his £14 billion pop at Asda. Mrs C was clearly keen on examining the gardens but Mike — who kept his singing voice to himself for a change — said he was confident of success: “You have to have a degree of confidence or you wouldn’t be doing it,” he says. Spy also spotted him in conversation with Marks & Spencer boss Steve Rowe. After Argos as well, surely he couldn’t make it a hat trick? Another grocery goliath, Tesco’s Dave Lewis, was looking Teutonic in five o’clock shadow and white-framed square specs. He and wife Helena were hunting accoutrements for their small garden in west London. Spy wondered if he was much of a crooner like Coupe. Lewis sympathised with his arch-rival: “As someone who does very similar things before TV interviews, I feel for him,” he sighed. Lewis said the Booker takeover’s blooming marvellous, but poured weedkiller on talk that the cash and carry group’s boss Charlie Wilson was angling for his job. “He’ll have to put up with me for a while yet.” More shy of the rowing machine was a stout Digby Jones, whose beloved Aston Villa are in with a chance of promotion back to the big time. But Jones seemed more preoccupied by the concern over Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street. Another gym-dodger is Serco chief executive Rupert Soames. Unlike brother Nicholas, Rupert was not at the Royal Wedding. But he was ebullient as ever, delighted that the fabled “shitometer” gauge on his desk has not gone off for a while due to the lack of crises at the once-accident prone services giant. Wife Milly was pleased about that, too, but not as delighted as she was to show off Rupert’s proud wearing of the Serco logo embroidered on the breast of his shirt, somewhat like a security guard. “I’m jolly proud of it,” said the stout boss, “but not of the man-boob underneath.” Elsewhere Spy ran into another busy dealmaker in GVC boss Kenny Alexander, up to his neck in getting to grips with Ladbrokes Coral following a £3.2 billion takeover. Both Alexander — a Scot who spent last Saturday’s wedding watching the racing and the rugby instead — and William Hill boss Philip Bowcock were breathless after a “rollercoaster” week for the sector which saw the US betting market opened up but FOBT stakes slashed. Bowcock, a proud Stoke fan, had the misfortune of seeing his team relegated but the only consolation was that the Potters have been the biggest winners for the bookie this season due to unfortunate punters betting on an upturn in form. Felicity Kendall has been causing sap to rise since Spy was a seedling. And the fragrant Good Life star still works her magic in her seventies. Guy Hands was left grinning ear to ear after she helped out at his Terra Firma-sponsored Prince’s Trust garden by Charles Williams, a chum of Hands from Oxford. “She spent a good hour and a half there with us, and looked absolutely marvellous!” he beamed. Lloyds chief Antonio Horta-Osorio was strolling with wife Ana looking for inspiration for their garden in Lisbon. AHO recalled: “I came here for my first time in 2008, one year into the financial crisis, and our host gave a speech I’ll never forget. It went: ‘Last year, we had many bankers at our party here at Chelsea. This year it is marvellous to see so many of you back again as gardeners.’” Enterprise Inns boss Simon Townsend — strong as an oak — was dishing out bone-crushing handshakes with gusto. Well he might: trading at pubs over the weekend was rather excellent by all accounts. “They came in for the wedding in the morning, then stayed all day for the FA Cup in the evening. Marvellous!” he guffawed. Bob Diamond was adding some American glitz to the affair, chatting to anyone who could handle the dazzle effect of his supernaturally white gnashers. It takes more than a few boring lawyers to kill off dealmaker Amanda Staveley’s cheer. She and partner Mehrdad Ghodoussi had just heard the news that the courts had thrown out the Serious Fraud Office’s charges against Barclays over its emergency fundraising from Qatar in the 2008 financial crisis. Staveley is suing the bank for fees she claims her PCP Capital Partners is owed for brokering the deal. Yesterday’s decision was irrelevant, she beamed: “I look forward to my day in court.” The couple still say they’re looking at football club deals despite reports that talks with Mike Ashley to buy Newcastle United appear to have faded. “We’re not talking about Magpies,” she said, cryptically. Back at the nosebag tent of Spy’s hosts Standard Aberdeen, trencher-man Martin Gilbert was in fine form, holding forth with chums Lynton Crosby, Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross and Rory Bremner among others. It was old pal Andrew Neil’s birthday, and a giant cake was produced for the shy, retiring, broadcasting tiger. “I’d like to thank Chelsea for putting this wonderful show on for my birthday,” said the great man. And with that, he blew out the candles on another Chelsea power show. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here. Are you sure you want to submit this vote?

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"80,000,000 ERC-20 tokens will be made available through token sale offering (TSO). Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--iCash has launched its Proof of Trust (‘PoT’) protocol and initial token sale offering (TSO). The PoT protocol creates the ability to add an assurance and validation layer to blockchain transactions and is designed to increase trust and confidence in the system, paving the way for institutional adoption. The attraction of blockchain is that information is stored in an immutable ledger, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. However, there have been very few solutions to the challenge of validating the trustworthiness of data entered onto the blockchain. iCash’s solution is a PoT protocol that allows for processes to assure and insure the validity of smart contract inputs and outcomes. Commenting on the launch, CEO and Founder Will McDonough, said “Industries are being transformed as they conduct business on the blockchain via smart contracts. Developing checks and balances for validation of those transactions has been a problem for blockchain users and large corporations, until now.” “While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of Proof of Trust provides distributed trust and assurance for data input to the blockchain. The future belongs to innovators, and iCash’s underlying technology aims to institutionalize the blockchain, and protect those who transact from being victims of incorrect or nefarious data inputs on the blockchain.” PoT can be applied to any live verifiable event involving a smart contract in sectors such as: trading in commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies, sports and wider asset management activities. iCash, through its protocol, enables the filtration and appeal of smart contract outcomes at scale and across ledgers. Fast, incorruptible appeal and settlement are achieved via a community of delegates, which validates and audits the trustworthiness of data inputs and outcomes. iCash uses a reputational algorithm designed to track and rank the trustworthiness of its delegates over time and only the most trustworthy delegates are able to validate data inputs, and thus earn iCash. PoT increases the scalability of smart contract input verification and execution on the blockchain. The iCash technology team is currently focused on the Ethereum, EOS, and NEO blockchains, but are also developing the platform to work across all blockchains. The opportunity set for iCash’s implementation is global, and the firm has to date secured 70 patents in 100 countries. iCash’s management team has a successful record of building businesses in emerging technology and institutional finance. Its leadership includes CEO Will McDonough, who previously led the $825 million IPO for Atlas Mara on the London Stock Exchange with co-founder and former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, as well as CIO Magnus Sigurdsson, who developed asset allocation strategies for a $7 billion portfolio at TIFF, the not-for-profit organisation, and global macro at 55 Institutional. The Company’s President Jonathan Malveaux is a JD/MBA with 25 years of experience in Asia working internationally for Panasonic, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. The Company’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer previously served as Risk Management Officer at the $75 billion State of Massachusetts Pensions Reserve Investment Board (MA PRIM). iCash’s Chief Economist Max Fraad-Wolff was also among the first Wall Street analysts to value LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and AliBaba. NOTES TO EDITORS About iCash iCash is a revolutionary company dedicated to bringing trust to the blockchain. iCash’s Proof of Trust protocol assures the validity of Smart Contract settlements. Blockchain ensures that information is immutably stored without a central authority, but not enough attention is paid to the negative impact when an input to the blockchain is not trustworthy. iCash introduces the Proof of Trust (PoT) protocol as a multi-platform protocol that enables real-world inputs to be validated by decentralized participants in settling Smart Contracts. While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of PoT provides distributed trust for data input. PoT uses a reputational algorithm and known participants to provide real-world validation without sacrificing technical efficiency. With this, interactions and events can be trusted & verified before being entered into the blockchain. iCash is made up of executives, academics and entrepreneurs with hundreds of years of experience in public and private companies—with hundreds of billions in market cap including: BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Electronic Arts, General Electric, State of Massachusetts Pension Fund, Uber, and more. The world-class leadership team with over 70 patents and trademarks across 100 countries position iCash to be a truly global token protocol. The company’s team is led by founder and CEO, Will McDonough who has built and scaled multiple public and private companies, managed the private capital of the Partners of Goldman Sachs, and later co-founded London Stock Exchange listed Atlas Mara, alongside former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond. McDonough is also a founding member of the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development, an organization that supports the United Nations’ ability to integrate blockchain technologies in meeting Sustainable Development Goals.

Ahead of her wedding to photographer Francesco Carrozzini, son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, she and pals including Glee star Dianna Agron and former Barclays boss Bob Diamond’s daughter, Nell, headed for Mexico. As well as going fishing and watching the Royal Wedding, they were given matching Juicy Couture tracksuits — though as this snap shows, Bee, who works in theatre production, seemed happier in a bikini.

Zoe, who has two children with Brendan, apparently read him the riot act after he was photographed a fortnight ago getting intimate outside a London club with Jenna-Lee James, a 41-year-old backing dancer. ‘I was innocent,’ he protested. ‘Being a dancer I’m just a tactile person.

After more than 20 years of working with Arnold, Ocean Spray is looking to shake up its agency roster. SelectResources International is running the review. Arnold—which Ocean Spray credited five years ago with keeping its cranberry grower-owner advertisements ""fresh""—is not believed to be defending the account. ""We are extremely proud of our 20-plus-year relationship with Arnold and all the work we have done together to build the Ocean Spray brand,"" a spokeswoman wrote in an email to Ad Age. ""As we work to expand our portfolio and cause disruption in the food and beverage space, we feel it is important for us to look at our business differently, both internally, as well as how we work with agency partners. We look forward to expanding our roster of agencies to help fuel the next chapter of the brand's success."" In February, the Lakeville-Middleboro, Massachusetts-based company announced President and CEO Randy Papadellis would be leaving after 18 years at the company. At the time, Ocean Spray named Bobby Chacko, who had been serving as a senior vp and chief growth officer since 2017, as president and chief operating officer. A month later, the company said its board of directors had unanimously elected Chacko as its CEO. He also still holds the president role. Arnold has seen some changes itself recently. In late April, Ad Age reported, the agency's CEO Pam Hamlin and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Scott Feyler were planning to depart the agency. Ocean Spray has been on a mission to prove the health benefits of its products. It announced last year it would invest more than $10 million the following five years to research the antimicrobial benefits of cranberries, and the role any benefits might play in combating antimicrobial resistance. Its Ocean Spray Cranberry Health Institute was set to launch this year. Ocean Spray Cranberries also petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to be able to use health claim language pertaining to the ""consumption of cranberry products and reduced risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women"" in September. But outside researchers have questioned those claims. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. spent $21.8 million in measured media in the U.S. in 2017, according to Kantar Media.

1015016,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Edit your personal details Change your password Activist investor Edward Bramson is reportedly agitating for British bank Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) to jettison large chunks of its investment bank business. According to the Reuters news agency, Bramson, who took a 5% stake in Barclays in February via his Sherborne Investors investment vehicle, has been pressing for Barclays’ management to slim down the investment banking arm to those parts that directly serve corporate clients. According to Reuters’ sources, that would mean the culling of the cash equities, currency and fixed income trading desks. Barclays has struggled to rebuild its reputation since its most prominent scandal in 2012, when it paid a £290mln fine to the US and UK authorities for rigging Libor, which measures the rate at which banks can borrow from one another. More recently, chief executive Jes Staley somehow managed to keep his job despite being fined £642,430 for trying to identify a whistle-blower at the bank. Staley joined Barclays from US hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, so he will be no stranger to the tactics of activist investors. He replaced Antony Jenkins, a veteran of the retail banking arm of Barclays, who was appointed to clear up the reputational damage sustained during the wheeling & dealing tenure of his predecessor, Bob Diamond. Here's the detail on activist investor Ed Bramson's plan to shake-up Barclays https://t.co/PmqIfJYERV Staley has generally shifted the emphasis back towards investment banking and it is thought that he would be resistant to Bramson’s proposals. Some shareholders told Reuters they believed Bramson might be underestimating the challenge of stripping out the investment bank’s underperforming units without hurting stronger parts. “I am pretty sure returns in Cash Equities are fairly rubbish but it’s very hard to do ECM (equity capital markets business) and some M&A activities without it,” one of Sherborne’s own major investors told the news agency. “I think the Markets bit of Barclays CIB is more profitable than he thinks it is, if anything it is the Commercial Bank that is the laggard,” he added. Shares in Barclays were down 0.3% at 208.4p in a flat market. Barclays is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services, with an extensive international presence in Europe, the USA, Africa and Asia....

1053951,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Returns as of 11/19/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/19/2018 If you're looking for stocks that have made tremendous comebacks in 2018, Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK) and Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) definitely fit the bill. Opko stock was down nearly 20% this year before roaring back. Myriad Genetics saw its share price plunge close to 40% earlier in 2018, but a strong rebound has the stock price close to where it began the year. Which of these two comeback stories is the better choice for investors now? Here's how Opko Health and Myriad Genetics stack up. Image source: Getty Images. Opko Health's Q1 results are a great place to start in determining why investors might want to consider the stock. After a painfully slow launch, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug Rayaldee began to enjoy some decent momentum. Total prescriptions for Rayaldee soared 730% year over year and jumped 38% higher than 2017 Q4. Some analysts think that Rayaldee could reach peak annual sales in the ballpark of $700 million. There's a long way to go to hit that mark, but for the first time in quite a while, there's reason for some optimism about the drug. The biggest source of revenue for Opko, though, is BioReference Labs (BRL). BRL is the third-largest clinical laboratory in the U.S. It focuses on genetic testing. In addition, BRL's sales team markets Opko's 4Kscore prostate cancer test. The business hasn't performed all that well in recent quarters. However, Opko put a new management team in place and thinks that BRL's revenue will improve in 2018. Opko could have several new products on the way. The company hopes to get a green light soon from the FDA for marketing the Claros point-of-care prostate cancer test. A phase 3 clinical study is in progress evaluating human growth hormone product hGH-CTP in treating growth hormone-deficient children. The company also has several phase 2 pipeline candidates, including an experimental drug targeting treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as type 2 diabetes and obesity drug OPK88003. One other reason many investors like Opko is the company's CEO, Phillip Frost. Frost is a billionaire with a long track record of success in the pharmaceutical industry. He has remained enthusiastic about Opko's prospects despite challenges through the years and has invested heavily in the company. Looking at Myriad Genetics' latest quarterly results also highlights the key arguments for the stock. Myriad topped expectations in fiscal Q3 thanks to surprisingly strong volume for its hereditary cancer testing. But the molecular diagnostics company has expanded into additional higher-growth areas, especially personalized medicine. Myriad's most promising personalized medicine product is GeneSight, a genetic test that helps determine which antidepressant is best-suited for a particular patient. Myriad thinks that the global market size for this diagnostic test could be close to $10 billion. The company recently reported results from a large study that showed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were 50% more likely to achieve remission and 30% more likely to respond to treatment when GeneSight was used to determine the appropriate medication. The company also won FDA approval earlier this year for BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic for Lynparza in breast cancer patients. AstraZeneca and Merck co-market Lynparza for treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. BRACAnalysis CDx could be a significant source of growth for Myriad. Lynparza could eventually win approval for treating prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other indications. If AstraZeneca and Merck pick up more approved indications for the drug, Myriad stands to benefit. Don't write off Myriad's hereditary cancer business, either. The company launched a new product last year that could help gain market share. RiskScore helps predict the risk that a woman will develop breast cancer. The test uses clinical risk factors and genetic markers. Both Opko Health and Myriad Genetics are enjoying nice rebounds and could have room to grow. I think, though, that Myriad is the better pick. In my view, the decision comes down to financial health. Opko continues to lose money, while Myriad is profitable. But while I think Myriad is the better choice, I don't see either of these stocks as great ones to buy right now. Myriad's shares currently trade at 26 times expected earnings. That steep valuation might be warranted if the company delivers on its potential. My preference, however, is to stay on the sidelines until there's more evidence that Myriad will be able to do so.

1016437,11/19/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The Yukon government aims to undercut the illegal marijuana market in the territory, setting the price for pot at $8 a gram, which officials say is cheaper than marijuana sold illegally. ""Our plan is to try to compete [with] or eliminate the illicit market, so the $8 a gram puts a value option in there,"" said Steve Cummings, the director of operations for the Yukon Liquor Corporation. The average price per gram for non-medical marijuana is $9.52 in Yukon, about $2 higher than the national average of $7.43, Statistics Canada reports. The store will temporarily be on Industrial Road in a building currently under a Yukon government lease. Cummings said the exact opening date of the store is still unknown, but the liquor corporation is looking at Sept. 1 as a tentative date. The federal law hasn't been passed by Parliament yet, but it's expected to happen this summer. Cummings said the store over time will add higher-priced premium pot. ""There should be a wide selection whereas perhaps on your corner dealer right now is not as good a selection,"" he said. He said another advantage over buying black market pot is that the product in the government store will be tested for unsafe additives. Cummings said the goal is to eventually close the store when regulations are in place to let the private sector take over retail sales. ""We are opening up as a kind of a primary showcase store, to kind of show what the private sector should look like,"" he said. The store will sell cannabis and oils. Cummings said edibles won't be available until they're legalized by the federal government. That won't happen until next year at the earliest. He said the liquor corporation still hasn't decided whether to sell accessories like bud grinders and pipes. Cummings said the store also has a duty to educate the public about the potential health and other risks associated with marijuana use. ""Yes, we're opening up the retail operations, but with our dual mandate, we're not promoting the sale of cannabis, we are facilitating it,"" he said The liquor corporation has looked at the experience of other jurisdictions where pot is sold in retail stores including Vancouver and Skagway, Alaska, said Cummings. But there's still a sense of history being made in Yukon. ""It is all brand new, we don't know what's going to happen here, and I mean it is such a huge change. ""It's a brand new product out there, you don't have a lot of new product introductions like this as monumental as what we're seeing here,"" he said. The $8 per gram does not include taxes. An example provide by the federal finance department says an $8 gram would cost $9 plus GST. The liquor corporation says an adult can buy up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent, per transaction. Equivalents are 150 grams fresh cannabis or 30 cannabis plant seeds. The most that can be possessed in public is 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent. A police officer can issue a ticket or lay a criminal charge if a person is caught with more than that. The corporation says there is no limit on how much cannabis can be kept at home, but there can be no more than 4 plants in a home. It says adults are responsible for keeping children safe from the plants and their products. The liquor corporation also announced Thursday that it made a deal with Ottawa-based Canopy Growth Corporation to supply marijuana to the store, its second agreement with a supplier. It will purchase product from local growers, once any are licensed by the federal government. There aren't any licensed producers in Yukon yet. The corporation says it can sign on as many suppliers as it wants depending on demand. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for Room To Read) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Room to Read, a global non-profit that believes World Change Starts with Educated Children®, held its annual New York Gala last night at SECOND with honorees Samantha Barry, Editor-in-Chief of Glamour, and Jamie Forese, President of Citigroup. Grammy Award winner Ashanti was in attendance as well as performed. The evening brought New York’s elite business and philanthropic communities together with the media industry to raise $3 million, which will support 60,000 children on Room to Read’s programs in literacy and girls’ education, it was announced last night by Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read’s CEO. The emcee for the evening was Sara Eisen, CNBC anchor, and event chairs were Scott Kapnick, Sabine and Richard Chalmers, and Marc Seidner. Other notable guests included Dilshad Vadsaria, actress and Room to Read ambassador, and Kimberly Vandenberg, Olympic medalist and Room to Read ambassador. Barry, on behalf of Glamour and The Girl Project, was presented with the Superhero Award for Glamour’s commitment to world change through empowering women and girls. Glamour’s philanthropic initiative, The Girl Project, aims to unleash the vast economic and social power of girls through education. Through a $200,000 grant from The Caterpillar Foundation, The Girl Project is supporting Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. Barry joined Glamour in January 2018 to oversee all content development, production and consumer experiences for Glamour’s digital, social, video and print platforms. “I am so honored to receive the Superhero Award and to have the opportunity to continue Glamour’s legacy of enabling progress via the education of young women,” said Barry. “Our mission aligns with Room to Read’s efforts to promote change, and it is truly a privilege to be working alongside them in helping to educate youth and create a better world.” Forese, on behalf of Citi, was presented with the Champion Award for Citi’s transformational impact on literacy and girls’ education. Citi’s e for Education campaign, a global initiative which has raised over $22 million for education-focused non-profits, has invested $3.1 million in Room to Read’s programs since 2013. Forese is President of Citigroup and Chief Executive Officer of the Institutional Clients Group. “We are incredibly proud of our partnership with Room to Read,” said Forese. “Together, we share in the goal of enabling progress and helping to eliminate generational poverty. We are grateful for their tireless work and commitment in helping to ensure that children have access to quality education.” Speakers at the event included Neema Mwita, a young woman from Tanzania who, through her personal story, demonstrated the change that is possible through education. Mwita was one of only two girls in her village primary school class, out of 100 students, who continued to secondary school. She pursued her education and obtained a university degree in law, defying barriers such as early marriage and pregnancy that exist for women in communities where Room to Read implements its programs. Mwita is now employed by Room to Read as a social mobilizer, mentoring and advocating for a cohort of girls enrolled in Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. “Room to Read is changing the game for children around the world, and tonight we recognize Citi and Glamour for their meaningful and impactful contributions to further our vision of a world in which all children can pursue a quality education and reach their full potential,” said Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read CEO. Red carpet photos are available here. Photos from inside the event are available here. About Room to Read Founded in 2000 on the belief that World Change Starts with Educated Children®, Room to Read’s innovative model focuses on deep, systemic transformation within schools in low-income countries during two time periods that are most critical in a child’s schooling: early primary school for literacy acquisition and secondary school for girls’ education. We work in collaboration with local communities, partner organizations and governments to develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school children and ensure girls can complete secondary school with the skills necessary to negotiate key life decisions. Room to Read has benefited 12.4 million children across more than 20,000 communities in 15 countries and aims to reach 15 million children by 2020. Learn more at www.roomtoread.org.

I’ve just suggested to him that if he’d fired Bob Diamond two decades ago the whole history of the global financial crisis might have been different. After a microsecond of thought, Taylor breaks into a smile. “I like to think the financial system didn’t hang on a binary choice of mine in 1998 – that would really be solipsism in the highest degree!” he chuckles. Fair enough. But the Apprentice-style fire-or-not-fire decision scenario was real enough. Taylor himself described it in an article for the Financial Times a few years ago. Taylor was the chief executive of the Quaker-founded British bank Barclays. And Bob Diamond’s investment banking division had blown up due to an unexpected sovereign default in Russia, forcing the group to register a large loss. What made it worse was that tight trading limits for Russian debt set by the bank’s board had been deliberately bypassed by Diamond’s traders. The ambitious American banker, humbled, was offering his resignation. Taylor turned it down believing that Diamond was too important to lose. Diamond, of course, went on to drive Barclays into the very heart of the global credit storm that unleashed disaster on the world and the UK economy in 2008. And he became one of the public villains of the crisis thanks to his spectacularly ill-judged suggestion before the Treasury Select Committee in 2011 that the “period of remorse” from bankers “needs to be over”. “Looking back on it I think I made the wrong call,” Taylor tells me, sitting in his rather spartan office on the upper floors of the Bank of England’s City of London headquarters. “But it was more about Barclays than the financial world as a whole.” Tieless, glasses nestling in his blazer pocket, wearing comfortable slacks, 66-year-old Taylor resembles a country solicitor more than a former City titan or the influential regulator he is now, as an external member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The only hint of financial services about him is a faint pinstripe on that dark blue blazer. I’d wanted to interview Taylor for some time, and not only for his juicy insider knowledge on Barclays. He’s also been at the heart of some of the major post-financial crisis reforms and institutions. He served on the Independent Commission on Banking (better known as the Vickers Commission, after its chair, Sir John Vickers) which was set up by George Osborne to decide whether or not to split up investment and retail banking in the wake of the crash. And since 2013 he has been a member of the FPC, which is charged with sniffing out financial crises, like a Bloodhound, before they happen and orders the inflation of banks’ capital buffers when they seem to be getting too relaxed about risk. Taylor’s time with the commission is drawing to an end. He has informed the Treasury he will step down no later than June 2019. So it seems a reasonable time for him to reflect a little in public, not just on his time on the FPC but on the decade since the crisis. The first question is, how much has really changed in our financial system over the last 10 years? Taylor’s answer is unequivocal, trenchant even. “I don’t know whether to laugh or be irritated by it but one of the things I’ve found about a lot of the writing about the tenth anniversary of the crisis is that lots of them basically said ‘nothing’s changed’. But actually almost everything has changed,” he says. “The industry has changed profoundly. The relationship of regulatory supervisors to industry has changed profoundly. The incentives have changed. The rules on pay have changed. The rules about liquidity in banking have changed. I think there’s been an extraordinary policy response. And I think there’s been some cultural change. Those who wrote it’s all the same, I don’t know where they’re looking. They don’t see the world that I see.” I decide this is not a good time to divulge that I myself recently wrote an essay lamenting the timidity of the reform effort. We move on. Lots of banks have been fined huge sums by regulators over various scandals, from interest rate rigging to insurance mis-selling. Plenty of bosses have departed under a black cloud. But virtually none of the top bankers during the crisis whose institutions foundered and incubated gross misconduct – not even Fred Goodwin of the Royal Bank of Scotland – have been struck off from the Financial Conduct Authority’s “approved persons” list. Inclusion on it is needed to work in the industry. Doesn’t that, I suggest, represent a gross failure of nerve by regulators, a blow to genuine accountability? Taylor’s not having it. “I think on the whole that the people at the top of institutions that went wrong in the financial crisis, they lost their jobs, they lost a lot of money, they lost their reputations. I think the idea that they didn’t suffer is a strange one. Imagine what it’s like to be in their shoes – it’s not great actually,” he says. “I don’t think having the FCA write something on your tombstone is necessarily the be all and end all.” A new book on Barclays’ roller coaster history by the writer Philip Augar relates that when Taylor was in charge he wanted to split off the troublesome investment banking division. Indeed, he resigned after failing to win the support of the board for his radical restructuring plans. The Vickers Commission was asked to look into that very question, not just for Barclays but the entire UK banking sector. Yet Vickers stopped short of recommending a clean break and proposed a somewhat complicated “ringfence” of banks’ retail arms instead. Why didn’t Vickers go the whole hog? Wasn’t this a missed opportunity, especially from Taylor’s perspective? “I’ve done lots of work for government. If you’re on one of those committees, the ideal space to get to is somewhere where there’s an overhang on a Venn diagram and where what you think is a proper solution is something that government and parliament is going to accept,” explains Taylor. So did he think that a full split proposal might not be welcomed by the government and risked being rejected? “I was certainly conscious of it,” he says. “Finding a resolution to something does just mean recommending something. Recommending an ideal solution which government then does not enact is useless. Equally, finding an inadequate solution the government enacts is useless too.” But he’s adamant that ringfencing, finally due to come in next year, is an acceptable solution to the problem of banks funding their casino trading habits with ordinary depositors’ savings. “I remember when we reported it in September 2011 and said we wanted these things to be done by the beginning of 2019, a lot of people laughed and said, ‘This is for the long grass and it’s never going to happen’. And you know what? It’s three months away and it’s happened,” he says. Born 8 June 1952 in Burnley, Lancashire 1965-1969: Eton College 1970-1974: Balliol College Oxford, reading Oriental Studies (Chinese) 1974-1982: Reuters and Financial Times 1982-1993: Courtaulds (textiles company) 1994‐1998: Barclays chief executive 2000‐present: non‐executive director of RTL Group 2010‐11: member of Independent Commission on Banking 2013-present: external member of Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee 2015-present: director at CiBO Technologies Yet, on the subject of Vickers, there’s been an unusually public disagreement between the Bank of England and Sir John on the question of banks’ capital requirements. The FPC has mandated UK banks to have a capital buffer [shareholders’ equity to absorb potential losses] of at least 4 per cent of total assets. But Sir John, essentially, thinks that’s too low – and a floor beneath what the Vickers Committee itself proposed. What does Taylor think of the concerns of his old chair? “John has been vocal about the systemic risk buffer. I’m comfortable that where we’ve got to, we’ve got a system with about as much equity as Vickers proposed, and arrived at in a slightly different way, and with an awful lot more debt that is convertible into equity,” he says. “Would I prefer in an ideal world for some of that debt to be equity? Yes I would. But I think we’re in the right place.” I point out that even Mervyn King, who was the Bank’s Governor when Taylor joined the FPC in 2013, is now saying that banks should have substantially more capital than the regulatory minimum. “Mervyn’s a friend and I’ve known him a very long time. He was Governor of the Bank for 10 years and deputy governor for five and chief economist before that and he didn’t actually do it in those 20 years,” says Taylor, slightly mischievously. “If you’re a macroprudential regulator your default setting is to fall asleep worrying about the banking system and to think a little bit more capital would be nice. And the next time you think maybe a little more. We don’t want more capital to make supervisors sleep better – we want more capital to have the appropriate amount of resilience in the system.” Often central bankers and regulators are surprisingly gregarious in person but automatons when they write anything down. With Taylor it’s almost the other way around. As an interviewee he’s rather hesitant, diffident even. Our talk is punctuated by long pauses for thought. At a couple of points he asks, almost plaintively, “Don’t you think?” Rather disappointingly, he refuses to talk at any length about Barclays, where activist investor Edward Bramson is now pressing the bank to get out of investment banking, just as he urged all those years ago. Yet a supremely self-confident intelligence shines out of Taylor’s speeches for the FPC, which are crowded with erudite and witty historical references to imperial China and the French revolution. Their substance is usually the magisterial brushing aside of the latest anti-regulation fallacy propagated by the financial lobby. And there have been some Exocet newspaper articles. Along with the one that lifted the lid on the history of Bob Diamond at Barclays was a particularly memorable broadside in 2009 which castigated his former banking colleagues for paying massive bonuses to staff out of illusory paper profits during the bubble. His mordant conclusion: “The system was brought down not because risk management was deficient (though it was), nor because greed was rampant (though it was), but because bankers could not count.” Perhaps that unusual self-confidence with the pen reflects his origins in journalism, and his editing of the Lex investment column for the Financial Times in the early 1980s. Before I leave, I suggest to Taylor that it’s inconceivable that anyone today could progress from journalism to senior banker to regulator in the way that he did. “It was inconceivable then!” he laughs. “I had a very strange career. But I think people ought to change sector. One of the problems I found towards the end of my business career was I was dealing with people who knew everything about a rather narrow area. You want people like that – [but] you don’t want everyone to be like that. Because otherwise it’s quite hard to see where connections are made.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

1015016,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Ye Jianming is a 41-year-old Chinese oil tycoon who went on a spending spree, picking up some of the spendiest real estate in New York City. He spent $83 million and had plans to buy $80 million more but he disappeared in early 2018. Ye had ties to the intelligence unit of the People's Liberation Army according to sources close to him. The properties he bought or expressed interest in included a penthouse he purchased from a top Wall Street banker, and a townhouse that formerly belonged to a billionaire friend of Donald Trump. In May 2017, Ye spent $50.55 million to buy former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond's penthouse at 15 Central Park West. The 5,278 square foot apartment has four bedrooms, a library, and an eat in kitchen. In June 2017, he dropped nearly $33 million on a 4,028 square foot apartment on the 86th floor at 432 Park Avenue. The unit was then put up for rent for $80,000 a month. ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images Ye paid cash for both of these properties. Last December, Ye entered into a contract to buy an $80 million townhouse owned by the NHL's Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola at 12 East 69thStreet. Viola was briefly the nominee for Secretary of the Army. The 20,000 square foot townhouse has its own movie theater. The deal would have set the record for the most expensive townhouse ever sold in New York City at the time, but the deal fell apart in early 2018 at about the same time as Ye went missing. Ye is not the first high profile, wealthy, Chinese person to go missing. Actress Fan Bingbing has been missing since last summer. Casino tycoon Yang Zhuhui went missing in August. Zhou Chengjian, a Chinese billionaire with a net worth of $1.4 billion, went missing on January 6, 2016. Club Med owner Guo Guangchang went missing on December 10, 2015. Ye is reportedly under investigation in China. Ye is the chairman of Shanghai based CEFC China Energy, which has been expanding abroad aggressively in the past several years. It acquired $9 billion worth of shares in Russia's Rosneft energy giant, more than $1 billion in investments in energy companies in the Czech Republic, and more deals in Abu Dhabi, Romania, and Singapore. Ye's company has also purchased pricey real estate in Shanghai. With Ye's whereabouts unknown, his empire is under threat. CEFC has been selling off assets and canceling deals. In November 2017, a former Hong Kong official named Patrick Ho, who was one of Ye's top contacts in the Chinese government was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on allegations of bribing African leaders through a charity that was funded by Ye's CEFC. Ye wasn't named in the indictment. Ho is challenging the charges against him. On news of his disappearance, shares in companies tied to CEFC China Energy plunged on the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen stock exchanges and wiped out $630 million in market value in one hour. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved"

LBG returns to Bryan Park 0 comments The Laidback Golf Tour returned to the Rees Jones designed layout at Bryan Park Players Course today to compete in their final Major of the season. Last year their outing here was marred by cold misty rain and 40 degree temperatures. On Tuesday, Oct. 30, the weather was much better with sunshine and near 70 degree temperature. However, the scores were nearly the same. Last season the course gave up only one round in the 70’s and 16 birdies to the field of 23; while this time the yield was two rounds in the 70s with 13 birdies and one eagle. The course which has hosted the U.S. Amateur in the past is quite a challenge especially the high fluffy rough which devours stray shots. It’s beauty, condition, and hospitable staff make it the perfect venue for a Major event. Fran Hensley continued her solid play as she captured her fifth win of the season and second in a row with a birdie free round of 78. Mike Reynolds who lost to Hensley in their last outing in a play-off trailed by three strokes with two holes to go today. Reynolds beat Hensley by a stroke on each of the last two holes to pull within one at 79 for second place. It was Hensley’s second of the five wins coming without having to go to a play-off to determine the winner. A brand new member Tony Santoro claimed the A Flights third place prize with his round of 80. Tom Simmons who lost in a play-off here last season came out on top of the B Flight today with his 87 finish. It was Simmons second win of the season. Last season’s winner Jim White came up a stroke short today as he tied for second place with David Wilson at 88. White claimed the prize money by a match of back nine totals. Mike Pritchett, playing in only his second tournament of the season led the C Flight with his score of 88. It was Pritchett’s first win as he finished third in his previous outing. The Tours current points leader Randy McCann finished second with a 91. Glenn Hudson walked away from the field today in the D Flight as he picked up his second win of the season with a solid round of 89. Hudson had missed the last eight tournaments due to back and leg pain and shot 108 in his last outing. His solid play and wise decision making came back for him today as he avoided the usual high number holes. Curtis Smith finished second for the fifth time this season with his 98 finish. The Tour will next play at Danville Golf Club Monday Nov. 12 in their last event of the season in which they earn points toward season championship. The tournament will shotgun start at 10am. Entry fee for Tour members is $65 with registration request by Nov. 5 or no later than noon Saturday Nov. 10.

Clearly, it was much more, but to the uninitiated, it was a head-scratching buy. And while big money is busy being exchanged at the actual Art Basel Miami Beach exhibition inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, that doesn't mean this whole Basel-dazzle is reserved solely for the 1%. In fact, Riviera South Beach reports, it is one of the best times for bargain hunters to find not only affordable artwork by someone who may, indeed, become the next Basquiat, but for free events and priceless people watching. The real underground, hipster action takes place where the energy is more electric than the expense account flush, at boutique hotels where burgeoning street artists, sculpturists, performance artists and those who fancy themselves as an amalgam of all of them convene to cocktail, network and show off their talents. Among those hotels is the Riviera South Beach, a contemporary, multi-building, chic stay with modern, colorful rooms - some with truly over the top, must-see decor, rooftop and courtyard pools, Insta-worthy art walls, and buzzy cocktail and Cuban cuisine canteen, Mas Cuba, an oft-Instagrammed artsy outpost of funky, re-purposed art and fab fare. Nearby is the Catalina Hotel, a high energy South Beach landmark with a distinctly retro-mod vibe - think Austin Powers meets South Beach, with two pools, two restaurants, three bars, and ultra-modern rooms. The adjacent Maxine's Bistro & Bar is open 24-hours serving farm fresh food, potent cocktails, and a perfect perch from which to people-watch. Some may consider the Tradewinds, an off the beaten path apartment hotel with full kitchen and stunning, sunny courtyard pool. An ideal address for Art Basel, Tradewinds is uber close to the Convention Center. There are several free must-sees during Art Basel. The first is a live performance piece by Mexican conceptual artist Abraham Cruzvillegas, whose debut performance piece, ""Autoreconstruccion: To insist, to Insist, to Insist,"" will take place twice a day in the Miami Beach Convention Center's brand-new ballroom and features dancer and choreographer Barbara Foulkes attached by a strap to the artist's scrap metal assemblage while musicians do their thing. Another must-see freebie is The Faena Festival running December 3 - 9 at the 3000 block of Collins Avenue, with a slew of public art, performance artists, exhibitions and all sorts of social-media-worthy opportunities to enlighten the masses. This year's theme is ""This is not America,"" which, according to Zoe Luke, curator of Faena Art, ""Addresses America as a concept more than a place, a contested and powerful idea that is greater than the waters and borders that frame it."" The fair has spread beyond Miami Beach thanks to the emergence of Wynwood as the arts district. Here, the streets (and walls) are plastered with art by renowned graffiti artists. An absolute to-do is the free Basel House at the old RC Cola Plant, 550 NW 24th St., where a collection of culture is housed all in one space, from music and vendors to new age art installations, late night DJs, mural tours, live painting, food trucks, and pretty much anything else, running December 7 - 9. Delving a little deeper, but not into people's pockets, is the free exhibition at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum featuring artist Hank Willis Thomas and his nonprofit For Freedoms project, and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collecting handwritten and typed messages from the incarcerated. Further exploration will undoubtedly turn up a slew of other opportunities to be immersed in the arts. Miami Beach circa Art Basel is a dazzling, dizzying, fascinating experience that can be enjoyed by people of all levels of appreciations of art, and most importantly, of all budgets. As the locals like to say, Basel Tov!

1028440,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"November 2, 2018 Torkwase Dyson, a painter whose explorations of visibility, environment, science, and migration have particular resonance at this moment in history, is the fall 2018 visiting artist at the Lunder Institute for American Art. She is also showing a new body of site-specific work in the exhibition Nautical Dusk, on view through Jan. 6, 2019, at the Colby College Museum of Art. During her Lunder Institute tenure, Dyson will lead a series of dialogues, performances, and lectures, including a public convening on Nov. 7 that will highlight her collaborations with Colby students and faculty. The artist Torkwase Dyson with installation Nautical Dusk, 2018. Photo by Gabe Souza courtesy of the Colby Museum of Art. “We are so fortunate to welcome Torkwase Dyson to campus and to benefit from her thoroughly interdisciplinary, inquisitive approach to her work,” said Lee Glazer, director of the Lunder Institute. “She has developed a distinctive language of geometric abstraction through a wide-ranging investigation of space, architecture, history, and scientific discourse, and we are looking forward to the many interactions she will have with our community.” At the invitation of the Museum, the New Jersey-based artist consulted archival materials related to Samuel Osborne (c. 1833–1904) in Colby’s Miller Library. Osborne was born into slavery and migrated from Virginia to Maine in 1865. He worked for the College for more than 30 years, and in 2017 Colby President David A. Greene renamed the presidential residence “Osborne House.” “A notable aspect of Dyson’s practice is embedded in the many ways of considering mobility, space, and geographic conditions through the language of abstraction,” said Daisy Desrosiers, director of programs at the Lunder Institute. “The possibilities of encounters through the institute have provided, for the artist, a space to question how we position ourselves in regards to archival material and how we respond to it as part of an ongoing process of observation.” As a Lunder Institute visiting artist, Dyson is investigating materials in Miller Library’s Special Collections, engaging with Colby faculty and students, and developing new collaborative projects. “I extrapolate from those things to ask phenomenological questions around geography, proximity, transference, clarity, seeing, belonging,” said Dyson. This hybrid platform, which combines research with ongoing reflection and conversation, provides time for the artist to explore intersections with scholars from multiple disciplines. Dyson is on campus from Oct. 31 through Nov. 7, when she will record a series of dialogues with Colby faculty from several different departments, including astronomy and creative writing. A suite of programs in the Museum lobby from 1:30 to 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, organized by the Lunder Institute, will include poetry by Colby students and performances by invited guests, including Dyson’s collaborator, artist Zachary Fabri, and visually scored by Andres L. Hernandez. Dyson, Fabri, and Hernandez comprise the performance collective F/H/D. The afternoon will conclude with an open conversation with the artist, in which Dyson will reflect on Nautical Dusk and the subsequent encounters and discoveries it has generated. In Nautical Dusk, Dyson’s geometric forms are infused with metaphorical associations found in obituaries of Osborne. Written by unnamed white authors, these texts raise questions about authorship, transmission, and self-determination. Curated by Diana Tuite, Katz Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Nautical Dusk features sculptures and paintings that explore these subjects. Dusk, a monumental ramp that visitors are welcome to engage with in a variety of ways, occupies half of the gallery. In 2017-18, its inaugural year, the Lunder Institute hosted artist Theaster Gates and poet Richard Blanco as its first visiting artists. About Torkwase Dyson Torkwase Dyson was born in Chicago, Ill., and spent her developmental years between North Carolina and Mississippi. Traversing these regions helped develop a fundamental dialectic of architecture/infrastructure, geography, and Black spatial liberation. During her years at Tougaloo College, where she majored in sociology and double minored in social work and fine art, she began to examine the poetics of Black history and environmental justice. Over the next 10 years, Dyson traveled to locally and globally strategize with communities of color on ways to attain resource equality. During this time she earned her bachelor’s in fine arts in painting from Virginia Commonwealth University and her master’s in fine arts in painting from Yale School of Art. In 2016 Dyson designed and built Studio South Zero (SSZ), a solar-powered mobile studio where the context of nomadicity became the framework for learning and making art about the environment. It was traveling with SSZ that inspired her experimental project the Wynter-Wells Drawing School for Environmental Liberation, where she explores contemporary theorizations of form, space, architecture, and the infrastructure of extraction economies. Though working through multiple mediums, Dyson describes herself as a painter who uses distilled geometric abstraction to create an idiosyncratic language that is both diagrammatic and expressive. The works are deconstructions of natural and built environments that consider how individuals negotiate and negate various types of systems and spatial order. Dyson’s work has been exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Drawing Center, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran College of Art and Design, Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education, and the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Dyson has been awarded the Nancy Graves Grant for Visual Artists, Visiting Artist grant to the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, the Culture Push Fellowship for Utopian Practices, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center Fellowship, and the FSP/Jerome Fellowship. Dyson’s work has also been supported by Lower Manhattan Cultural Center, the Laundromat Projects, the Green Festival of New York, the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, the Mural Arts Program of Philadelphia, The Kitchen, and the Rebuild Foundation. In 2016 Dyson was elected to the board of the Architecture League of New York as vice president of visual arts and is currently visiting critic at Yale School of Art. She is represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago and Davidson Contemporary in New York. About the Lunder Institute for American Art The Lunder Institute for American Art, established in 2017 through the generosity of Peter and Paula Lunder, supports innovative research, critical inquiry, and creative production aimed at expanding the boundaries of American art and its interpretive communities. Uniquely positioned within an academic museum on a liberal arts campus in Central Maine, the Lunder Institute offers opportunities for visiting artists and scholars to reflect, convene, and work with the Colby community across disciplinary boundaries to ask challenging questions, test new ideas, and produce work that is original, illuminating, and generative."

1016437,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"MUFG Americas has a new chief information and operations officer. MUFG said Wednesday that it has hired Christopher Higgins for the role. Higgins will report to Steve Cummings, president and CEO, and serve on the company’s executive committee. He starts on Dec. 10. Higgins most recently served as chief information officer at U.S. Bancorp, where he was in charge of enterprise architecture, application development and testing, among other responsibilities. He joined the $464.6 billion-asset Minneapolis company in 2012 from Bank of America, where he worked for 18 years in information management. In a press release, Cummings praised Higgins as “an ideal fit” for MUFG Americas, the U.S. division of the global banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Tokyo. “His technical expertise and proven track record in leading forward-looking technology and operations initiatives that are customer-focused will be an enormous asset to our team as we evolve our business model,” Cummings said. In his new role, Higgins will replace Chris Perretta, who plans to leave the company by the end of 2018, according to a spokesman. Perretta joined MUFG in April 2016. The announcement comes as MUFG looks to embark on a U.S. expansion, at a time when its parent company is facing a stagnant economy at home. MUFG Union Bank, its $123.8 billion-asset banking unit, has just over 350 branches, mostly along the West Coast, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp."
1015016,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 | Updated: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 1 View comments Patisserie Valerie chairman Luke Johnson's has a noted aversion to the press Patisserie Valerie wasn't allowing journalists to attend today's emergency meeting until a U-turn late yesterday evening. This was the result of a 'misunderstanding', we are assured, rather than chairman Luke Johnson's noted aversion to the press. Journalists in the embattled entrepreneur's company are about as welcome as Sir Philip Green at a #MeToo gathering, which is odd. Until recently, Johnson penned a jaunty newspaper column which took frequent pot-shots at other businesses. Several of his close family, including father Paul and brother Daniel, are also prominent proponents of our trade. Theresa May is right not to back knee-jerk demands for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood. David Cameron came to regret bowing to the mob over ex-Royal Bank of Scotland chief Fred Goodwin's defrocking. Green's ill-deserved gong, awarded by Tony Blair needless to say, serves as a future reminder of how impressionable prime ministers can become spellbound by flashy billionaires. It's best left in place pour encourager les autres. Bob Diamond is to be welcomed as keynote speaker at the Financial Times's US banking forum in New York next week. Since being ousted from Barclays six years ago, Bob, 67, refuses to hide his light under a bushel. His African investment vehicle Atlas Mara is showing steady growth, while last year's acquisition of brokers Panmure Gordon gives him a foothold once more in London. 'There are no second acts in American lives,' F Scott Fitzgerald opined. But then he never met beaming Bob Diamond. Former investment banker Ian Blackford, now the SNP's ample Westminster chief, humbly referred to himself as a 'simple crofter' in the Commons while attacking Philip Hammond's budget. The Conservatives' Greg Hands retorted: 'I had a career in the City and I don't recall him being a simple crofter at that time. 'Maybe that was his codename on his Bloomberg terminal as he was buying and selling financial assets.' Blackford squirmed like a constipated Dowager. The enduring success of British noodle chain Wagamama, which is being bought by The Restaurant Group for £559million, continues to baffle the Japanese. Out east, Wagamama translates as 'spoiled brat'. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"We may be a month away from Art Basel Miami Beach, the contemporary-art mess of tented art fairs and celebrity-studded parties, but big events are already beckoning from every pocket of Greater Miami. So if you’re booking travel plans for December or — more impressive — you’re making a day-by-day schedule, you’re in luck: We have the early word on Art Basel week’s five buzziest gatherings. But first, the obvious: The granddaddy art fair Art Basel Miami Beach returns Dec. 6-9 to the Miami Beach Convention Center (1901 Convention Center Drive) with 268 galleries from 34 countries. Some 20-odd satellite art fairs will also be competing for your Basel bucks. Last year, a Kanye West bounce house visited Wynwood. A pop-up Museum of Ice Cream with environmentally unfriendly sprinkles lured South Florida’s candy fiends, including this reporter. But this year belongs to British street-art rascal Banksy and interactive art tech. Here are the Art Basel events vying to become your new favorite Instagram obsessions. Opens Nov. 15 at 736 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; $17-$24; Artechouse.com Billing itself as a “digital art immersion” exhibit, Artechouse (pronounced “art-tech-house”) is like a holodeck from “Star Trek.” Visitors can touch, draw on and move around art elements inside 10 interactive rooms covered in dancing digital projections. This 15,000-square-foot permanent art space will open to the public Nov. 15, two weeks ahead of Art Basel, with the exhibit “XYZT Abstract Landscapes” by French digital artists Adrien M and Claire B. Their installations include “Kinetic Sand,” in which users push grains of sand on a touchscreen; and “Field of Vectors,” digital “grass” that visitors can manipulate with their feet. Through Dec. 9 at Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; free; Frost.FIU.edu Here’s the most glaring statistic buried amid the many incarceration letters, poems, essays and notes wallpapering the Frost’s art gallery: 2.2 million people sit in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500 percent increase since the late 1970s, according to the nonprofit advocacy center the Sentencing Project. The letters come from artist Hank Willis Thomas (and his nonprofit For Freedoms project) and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collected hundreds of inmates’ handwritten and typed messages on display. Opens Dec. 1 at Magic City Studios, 6301 NE Fourth Ave., Miami; $35.99-$49.99; BanksyExhibit.com Loyal followers of Banksy’s shenanigans will remember his stance on charging fans to see his art. (He flat out refuses, which is why his stenciled-graffiti works are all on public walls.) So it should come as no surprise that this touring show of 80 Banksy paintings, sculptures, screen prints and early-career photographs wasn’t exactly authorized by the British icon. The globetrotting exhibit instead comes from Steve Lazarides, the elusive street artist’s former agent, who tapped private collectors to loan out their Banksy originals. Miss it during Art Basel week? You’ll have time: The show will close Feb. 28. Dec. 5-9 at Art Miami, 1 Miami Herald Plaza, NE 14th St., Miami; $35-$275; 305-517-7977 or ArtMiami.com Forget leaping into pools full of multicolored plastic sprinkles at the Museum of Ice Cream: Artist Peter Anton has been building towering odes to chocolate and candy for years. During Art Basel 2012, Anton debuted “Sugar and Gomorrah,” a theme park-style attraction allowing visitors to ride a roller coaster through a maze of sugary sculptures, nude models and the faux ruins of a destroyed city. Anton’s newest palate-teasing monument to sweets is “Choco Tower,” a 10-foot-tall stack of five chocolate bonbons, with two chocolates half eaten. The 1,000-pound sculpture will appear in the Galerie von Braunbehrens’ booth at Art Miami. 8 p.m. Dec. 7-8 at Adrienne Arsht Center, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; $42.52-$213.72; 305-949-6722 or ArshtCenter.org A ballet starring prima ballerina Diana Vishneva that will premiere during Art Basel week, “Sleeping Beauty Dreams” is a dance-meets-art twist on the classic fairy tale. The production will feature ballet dancers onstage performing alongside digital avatars to a soundtrack from Dutch electronica composers Noisia. pvalys@southflorida.com or 954-356-4364"

1020357,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Become a supportervia PressPatron Lake Hayes is a small lake in the Wakatipu Basin in Central Otago, in New Zealand's South Island. It is located close to the towns of Arrowtown and Queenstown. Photo: Bernard Spragg David Williams is Newsroom's South Island correspondent and investigative writer. environment Otago’s regional council stands accused of rubberstamping non-notified water consents for a new hotel planned near Queenstown without adequately considering the effects on a nearby scenic lake. David Williams reports. After years of being lobbied to increase its efforts in Queenstown, last year the Otago Regional Council got the message. It stood accused of dragging its feet on multiple issues, including public transport, wilding pine control and water monitoring, while squirrelling money away for a new Dunedin headquarters. There was fighting talk about creating a unitary authority. The pressure told and the floodgates of ratepayer money opened. The council agreed to re-open a council office in Queenstown and subsidise public transport in the Wakatipu Basin. Cash was splashed on water, too, with $100,000 for research on lake snow and a promise to work with communities on lake restoration work, including Lake Hayes, near Arrowtown, one of the country’s most photographed lakes. This year, the council announced a decade-long plan to spend millions more on water monitoring, including installing a buoy at Lake Hayes. That delighted the Friends of Lake Hayes Society, a group that has been pushing for a buoy for years. But problems persist. Over the previous year, algal blooms caused the lake to be closed to swimmers and elevated E.coli levels were discovered. In June last year, dead trout were found in Mill Creek, Lake Hayes’ main tributary. In August, the Otago Regional Council’s technical committee discussed three possible ways – flushing, capping and destratification, according to the Otago Daily Times – to improve Lake Hayes. Now, there’s concern the momentum towards an environmental clean-up will be lost, or reversed, because of a large hotel planned on the banks of Mill Creek. Quiet consideration As regional councillors were publicly discussing ways to clean up the lake, the council’s staff were quietly considering consents for a proposed 380-room hotel, next to Arrowtown’s Millbrook Resort, in an area known as Waterfall Park. Developer Winton Group – through subsidiary Waterfall Park Developments Ltd – dubs Waterfall Park a forgotten treasure, home to a 30-metre waterfall that’s out of public view. The company wants to build a four-plus-star hotel on the site in four blocks. The complex will also feature two restaurants, a bar, conference centre, wedding chapel and wellness centre. Heritage buildings at the adjacent Ayrburn Farm, settled by Scotsman William Paterson in 1862, will be restored and repurposed. (Waterfall Park Development Ltd has asked the council to re-zone a parcel of land next to the planned hotel so it can build up to 200 houses. Other Winton Group projects in Queenstown include Bridesdale Farm, a subdivision fast-tracked by the local council, and the high-end Lake’s Edge subdivision, adjoining the Hilton Queenstown Resort & Spa complex.) Last month, the regional council approved various work to be done on Mill Creek. The consents weren’t publicly notified because the council assessed the effects of the work as minor. Council chief executive Sarah Gardner is quick to point out that the Department of Conservation (DOC) – which has statutory responsibilities for native aquatic species – gave written, unconditional approval to the consents. (This reliance on DOC as an environmental backstop mirrors another controversial consent approval, for the extension of a Queenstown skifield, that is now subject to a judicial review.) Fish and Game and iwi demanded conditions, including undertaking the work outside of fish spawning. The work approved at Waterfall Park includes widening, deepening and re-shaping the creek, creating ponds through a series of boulder weirs. Flood-protection walls will be built, as well as building seven bridges and two culverts. Winton Group, a company associated with Chris and Michaela Meehan, plans sediment and erosion controls and will temporarily divert the creek during widening work. Revegetation and ecological work is also planned. (Winton Group couldn’t be reached for comment.) The regional council’s own analysis shows Mill Creek and Lake Hayes already exceed some limits or targets for water quality, such as phosphate, turbidity and total nitrogen. For other contaminants, such as nitrate and E.coli, there’s little or no headroom for the water bodies to take more. If Lake Hayes’ poor state is to be reversed, contaminants from within its catchment, which starts on the slopes of Coronet Peak, need to be reduced. The main culprit for adding nitrates and phosphorus to the lake is Mill Creek. Increasing development, population growth and land-use intensification won’t help – especially as stormwater from Waterfall Park’s hotel complex will flow into the creek and, eventually, Lake Hayes. “We believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” – Andrew Davis Friends of Lake Hayes Society committee member Andrew Davis, who works for a global investment management firm, accuses the regional council of being cavalier by granting non-notified consents in a sensitive environment. Speaking personally and not on behalf of the committee, he says: “Lake Hayes is one the region’s most precious resources, we need our regulators to start affording the lake the protection it rightly deserves.” Davis points to problems earlier this year with stormwater runoff at Wanaka subdivisions Northlake (another Winton Group development) and Hikuwai as a sign that new developments are struggling to prevent sediment run-off. The district’s chief engineer, Ulrich Glasner, told the Otago Daily Times in May the performance of some stormwater infrastructure, particularly in new developments, did not meet the council’s expectations. Davis tells Newsroom: “With the current Waterfall Park development we believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” Council boss Gardner says the effects of the Waterfall Park proposal were assessed as minimal. “It is correct that if sediment enters Mill Creek, the receiving water body will be Lake Hayes.” Public notification of consents isn’t mandatory, she says, and the effects on the Friends of Lake Hayes “from the specific activities considered” were assessed to be less than minor. As the effects of the applications were considered “minimal”, Gardner says further assessment of the impact on Lake Hayes wasn’t required. She adds: “We have not assessed the effects of all activities that may be undertaken in the development.” Increased pollution in Lake Hayes could lead to more frequent closures for recreational activities and increase the cost of restoration efforts, which already seem likely to run into the millions of dollars. Inevitably, the clean-up costs will largely fall on the local community. Friends of Lake Hayes has made a submission to Queenstown’s district council, which is considering Winton Group’s resource consent for the hotel development. Regional councils deal with environmental-based consents, such as those affecting air and water, while district councils manage land-based subdivisions and developments. Waterfall Park Developments originally lodged consents jointly to both councils, asking them to be publicly notified and heard together. The regional council (ORC) “staff recommending report”, written on August 30, notes, however: “On advice from the original job manager, the two consent processes were unbundled as it was considered that the ORC consents could be processed on a non-notified basis.” To the district council, the society challenges the developer’s claims that the in-stream work, stretching for hundreds of metres of Mill Creek, will have a less than minor effect on the immediate environment and downstream. (The actual channel works extend for about 135m.) During construction, the submission says, there’ll be increased sediment and nutrient discharges into Lake Hayes. “We are of the view that in spite of all the assurances provided by the applicant there is a significant risk that designs and structures may not perform to design when tested by the very powerful and unpredictable natural forces that are applied during high-intensity rainfall events.” (An ecological peer review, by 4Sight Consulting, says with appropriate controls, and if best practice is followed, sediment discharges from construction work “can be expected to be minimised”.) Vulnerable fish Some of those most affected by the Mill Creek works are native galaxiid fish, koaro, that live in Lake Hayes but spawn in Mill Creek. Slowing the water flow and creating pleasing-looking pools will help trout – something Fish and Game endorses. But the koaro, classified as “at-risk, declining”, prefers fast-flowing riffles. The developer’s ecological expert said the potential effects on native fish are considered to be minor. DOC’s Wakatipu operations manager Geoff Owen tells Newsroom the department’s approval was given on the basis that the works would improve the outlook for koaro in the long term. That would be done through native riparian plantings, culverts allowing for fish passage, weed control and a condition to avoid works in the stream during the koaro spawning period. “DOC believes the application as it stands would result in habitat that would be better for native fish,” Owen says. However, an ecological peer review of the hotel proposal provided to regional and district councils seems to contradict that view. The 4Sight Consulting report, completed in August, says while the works are unlikely to have a significant effect on koaro, the loss of preferred habitats “have not been adequately considered by the application”. “The installation of three of the six proposed aesthetic weirs will ... result in the loss of areas of preferred instream habitat for the ‘at risk’ koaro and may impact potential spawning habitats. The weirs will result in additional habitat for brown trout, a predator of koaro.” To offset the habitat loss, the 4Sight report says a riparian planting plan should consider enhancing the remaining habitats preferred by the fish. (Regional council boss Gardner says the “localised impacts” of habitat loss will be mitigated and monitored by consent conditions. Some koaro habitat will be enhanced and protected through activities like riparian planting.) Newsroom asked the department to comment on this apparent contradiction but no reply was received by publication deadline. In August, Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage introduced an amendment bill to Parliament aimed at better protecting indigenous freshwater fish, most of which are found nowhere else in the world. Acknowledged problems with protecting threatened, endangered and vulnerable fish species include water management by regional councils and council enforcement over habitat destruction.

Numerous scientific studies conclude that keys to healthy aging include keeping one’s mind active, social engagement and feeling useful. Osher made those three attributes a requirement for financial support to create Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes across the entire United States. OLLI at Granite State College has been a part of healthy aging for thousands of New Hampshire seniors since its inception in 2004 thanks, in large part to Bernard Osher. Osher, born and raised in Biddeford, Maine, founded the Bernard Osher Foundation in 1977 to support four particular interests – post-secondary scholarships, integrative medicine programs, arts and educational organizations and lifelong learning institutes for “seasoned adults.” Offering grants to colleges and universities to support creation of Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the Osher Foundation’s guidelines outline 17 topic areas for the courses offered. This guarantees mental stimulation and assures there will be something of interest for all adult learners. Guidelines also call for significant volunteer support from the membership. While this does keep costs reasonable, the primary motivation for this requirement is to engage the senior population which may suffer from post-retirement “what am I going to do with my life now?” syndrome. Volunteers are responsible for the curriculum, for planning and executing all events, for teaching classes and for supporting the administration of the program overall. The importance of their work is easy to define: no volunteers means no OLLI. Social engagement is evident at any OLLI class or function as strangers come together to pursue a common interest and find the joy of interacting with like-minded peers. What does that mean – are all OLLI members of the same faith ... or political persuasion ... or economic background? Oh my, no! The shared experiences of OLLI members come from: ■being raised in the ’40s and ’50s with Lassie, the Beaver, the Andersons and Howdy Doody; ■living through the ’60s, perhaps as a full-fledged hippie, a member of the armed services or a civil rights activist; ■raising families and building careers through the ’70s and ’80s, and ultimately; ■retiring or planning for it in the new millennium. And the wide variety of personal experiences while navigating those common periods contribute to the richness of the dialog as OLLI members share where they’ve come from and how they live this next chapter of their lives. In OLLI, social engagement is not synonymous with party-going. It is all about that sharing – sometimes it’s the quiet collegial activity of planning a program or editing a catalog, sometimes it’s a small group getting together for coffee and talking about the most interesting souvenir they collected while traveling. Sometimes it’s meeting face to face over a Scrabble board instead of the more impersonal Words with Friends computer game. And for the party animals, well, yes, there are also parties!

1015016,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 17:00 EST, 24 October 2018 | Updated: 17:01 EST, 24 October 2018 1 View comments When Vittorio Colao stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was treated like an all-conquering hero. But investors keeping an eye on the vanishing Vodafone share price and shrinking stock market value might be asking different questions of his successor Nick Read. In recent days, the shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1 billion, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100. n recent days, Vodafone's shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1bn, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100 It is hard to remember that Vodafone was Britain's flagship tech group and a pioneer in the fast-growing telecoms and data markets in the Japan and the United States. Both stakes have been discarded. The shareholding in Verizon Wireless was sold for a phenomenal £100 billion. In effect, the empire built by the excellent Sir Chris Gent was dismembered, leaving behind a group which is a shadow of its former self. A strategy of expanding into emerging markets, such as India, has proved disappointing because of intense competition. It is hard to think that digging deeper into low-growth Europe, by acquiring Liberty Global's networks, can ever pay off. Getting a good deal from America's 'cable cowboy' John Malone was never going to happen. Colao and his predecessor Arun Sarin were under constant pressure from shareholders to de-clutter and release value from the Verizon Wireless stakes. But assets were relinquished in advanced Western economies just at the moment that the smartphone and data revolution took off. Alex Brummer says when Vittorio Colao (pictured) stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was 'treated like an all-conquering hero' In 2006, Vodafone sold its Japanese offshoot to tech investor Softbank for £8.9 billion. A decade on and Softbank is on the verge of sponsoring Japan's biggest ever initial public offering in a deal for the former Vodafone unit expected to raise up to £20billion. Being a minority holder in Verizon Wireless was never a comfortable place to be. Sarin did well to avoid a quick sale and create the value which Colao cashed in. But it was a latecomer to data. The value which might have been created by hanging on or maintaining a smaller stake in Verizon was sacrificed for immediate cash. Shareholders (including this writer) received a cash bonus. But there are serious questions to be asked as to how a high-growth entity allowed itself to become a sub-performing utility. Staley resistance The Vodafone experience suggests that Jes Staley is right to resist the attentions of corporate vampire Edward Bramson's assault on Barclays' investment banking. It is easy to show that the returns on its credit cards is far superior to that from M&A. But it is a meaningless comparison. Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era. Brummer says: 'Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era' Lingering costs of the past are still there, the latest being a £1.4 billion fine from the US Department of Justice for the mis-selling of mortgage securities. It seems only yesterday that a very senior Barclays executive was explaining to me that its portfolio of sub-prime mortgages were a higher grade than those of other banks. Barclays deserves credit for defending the performance of the investment bank rather than giving in to bullies. A much better performance in equity trading drove the investment bank performance in the third quarter when Barclays was the third-biggest player in global debt markets and involved in major M&A such as the high-profile Michael Kors acquisition of Versace. As the UK heads towards Brexit the importance of Britain maintaining a strong presence in American-dominated investment banking is enormously important. Bramson is better at taking on the weak. Hidden treasure Should there be any doubt about the importance of Barclays and financial services to the UK economy, it is worth looking at new data today from the industry's advocacy group CityUK. It shows the UK to be the world's leading exporter of financial services in 2017 with a surplus of £68 billionn – that's equal to the next three contenders combined. Small wonder that French president Emmanuel Macron wants a share of the after-Brexit business. Best of luck with that. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

1022024,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"October 24, 2018 Programs supported by gift will create pipeline for the next generation of scientific leaders Colby College has received a major contribution to support programs that will prepare the next generation of innovators in the sciences through funded experiences at renowned partner institutions on the leading edge of discovery. The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Cresci Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. Rick McVey Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products, and continued robust Open Trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth, and reached a record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million, was up 6% compared to Q3 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million, and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12%, including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson yards. We expect to move in to our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes both saw rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatilities fell, and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads, and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions has been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong, and position the company well for future growth. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter, and was up 58% to a year record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion, also up 58%. Open Trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price-makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through Open Trading, and over 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transactions costs through Open Trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our product and geographic diversification. Our U.S. high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior, leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year, and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam, and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are underway to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22%, with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on the system, representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Tony DeLise Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year. A slight increase in estimated market share accounts for the uplift in trading volume as U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated U.S. high-grade market share is up one percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets, and U.S. high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains was the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volume, 27% growth in high-yield volume, and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. The 11% increase in trading volume resulted in 5% uplift in commissions. New data contracts accounted for the $800,000 increase in information services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and we customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter, and 21.6% year-to-date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range, and now expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years of maturity and higher yields caused a reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, U.S. high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially, and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade size bucket. Our Other Credit category's fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. So percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter, and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and tradeshow spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses was 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. Our full-year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30th were $446 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $15 million, and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $178 million. Based on these results, our Board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Rick McVey Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth in estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum; including high-yield, emerging markets, and Open Trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months provided a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Hey, good morning, guys. Rick McVey Good morning, Patrick. Tony DeLise Morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market forum was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps from the efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Rick McVey Sure. I think this is a continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead Axess in the system and identity offsetting interest in that trade, they could do so with any trade size and have the opportunity to work up trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols in newly issued bonds that would introduce faster means of execution for highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trade sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking to add around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period-end employee count, and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter-to-quarter, so should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual give what the volume environment looked like during the quarter? Tony DeLise Yes, so Patrick, two things in there on the headcount, and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefit. On the headcount, we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have start days [ph] in the fourth quarter, so we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit we don't know what will happen with attrition, but we are sitting on 15 additional add. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was just a slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits. It was around a $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower. The cash bonus accrual is formulaic; it is tied to operating performance. And quarter-to-quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you should see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes Q2 to Q3, you saw pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Rich Repetto Yes, good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony. Rick McVey Good morning, Rich. Rich Repetto And congrats on the uptick in the Open Trading percentage, I guess the first question is on Open Trading. And it seems like quarter-to-quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in there, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield. The others went up by like a percent or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter, from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove that big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in Open Trading? Rick McVey Yes, a couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of Open Trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that Open Trading is providing the highest value in less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield, that we've just seen better take-up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way and reduce transactions costs and in a less liquid market, like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Rich Repetto Thanks, Rick. A follow-up on Open Trading is, I would assume the ETFs -- well, just some comments on auto ex [ph] as well, just the trend there. If Open Trading pick up I assume the auto ex and the drivers -- one of the drives is ETFs, that you would see auto ex also increasing? Rick McVey Yes, I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right at auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you all know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on, to low-touch, and now even moving into no-touch, where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they're able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfection willing to auto-execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade. It's really about do the price responses come back to meet the clients' preset expectations. And if they do they're willing to auto-execute those trades. Rich Repetto Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q, and I think these are from your comments that July and August were a different story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think, even more volatility in October. And you may have covered this, but if you did I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October. But can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility, like September, October. Rick McVey Well, October, if you look at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield, very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months. And September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall. But we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October, and the product mix will drive the fee capture. Rich Repetto Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick McVey Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto ex, but maybe more so on the Composite+ product, really just want to updated thoughts on the future of Composite+ and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facility some of these auto ex functionalities being built into the buy side, but are there also other revenue generating opportunities for Composite+ as well? Rick McVey Sure, happy to take that one. No, we're really pleased to see both dealer, investor, clients embracing Composite Price Plus, which is a real-time mid-market now in about 20,000 global securities. So, incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products; it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that, and the client take-up around Composite Price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto-execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients the more they can use auto execution, so it does tie in to the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking streaming price protocols, and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices or RFQ as we are looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Rick McVey Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices, and so the technology here. It's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And to date, institutional investors have stuck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up, I do think it's possible that streaming prices especially to more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency. And when the market is ready to go in that direction then we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler Hey, guys. Good morning. Rick McVey Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler I want to go back to a question earlier on high yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high yield open trading has really accelerated in the last couple of quarters. I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters; previously, it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETF, I just want to understand is are the ETF market makers what has driven the vast majority that acceleration or there are other factors? Rick McVey There are other factors as a key ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high yield trading overall and open trading adoptions specifically from one only investment managers. And a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high yield trading environment which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in funds flow. So I think it's a combination of adoption by not only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler Okay, yes, make sense, Rick. And then on the some of the discussions around new functionality trend that you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process, when should we expect to actually see you roll out that functionality and talk about kind of the discussions the consulting you are doing with the buy side trading desks as you work on those developments? Tony DeLise Yes, there is no set timetable like anything that we do. We are out talking to both dealer and investor clients to see if we could add value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we are at mid-stream on those conversations. And depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around a faster, more active protocol for new issue trading, we will be ready to roll it out. So there is no set timetable, but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open. Chris Allen Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we have been seeing lately in September, October, I'm wondering if there is any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets in Eurobonds? Obviously, Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in periods and you know, it's has been a little bit flatter. And looking at September to the summer period, so any commentary there would be helpful? Rick McVey So Chris, you are looking for some comments on October or for the third quarter? Chris Shutler Yes, just in terms of I mean you kind of noted that things picked up in the back-half of September continuing into October, something like more of those comments are more focused on high grade and high yield. So just wondering how the other buckets are trending as well? Rick McVey You saw from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets in Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think that one thing that points to -- this is more particularly for the emerging market than Eurobonds right now, market volumes are still struggling. So even we gave some commentary that October market volumes for U.S. investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one it's while healthier than the third quarter, you are not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Tony DeLise On the last one, Chris, euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from tracks and others sources, euros look to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for U.S. high grade and U.S. yield. Chris Allen Got it, and just from an overall perspective you are seeing changes in client behavior at all? Or it's just the environment has got a little bit better and trading activities are kind of picking up? Just trying to think about this could be treated like we saw on the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming and participating maybe a little bit quieter in these periods? Rick McVey I would separate the two but the clearly the broad based gains that we are seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products this is shaping up to be one of our strongest years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual for fact it's being driven more by EM, high yield and euros this year than it is in high grade, but even high grade up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively, the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we have ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trading behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment. And we obviously can't control that. It ebbs and flows with various factors. And it hit the trough for the year in July and August and then September and October we are seeing it rebound. It looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So, I would separate those two factors. Tony DeLise Hey, you know, jumping again on this particular point, but look these are longer term trends across all the products where we have more client engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading at the bigger piece across all of our core products. Open trading is the bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products. That's up hundred clients just in the past year. So it's just the network and the engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen Makes sense. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell Hey, thanks. So we have kind of stable pricing in high grade. And Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So appreciate the update here on October volumes, but are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten? And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightened duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter or next year? Tony DeLise Yes. So, Jeremy, it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We have been -- and the thing that we look at more is around years of maturity and where absolute yields are. But we are not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just be investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four product is very consistent with the third quarter. And as Rick, pointed before that you may see a mix of multiple products. So one product rolling faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture, but the individual product level notes no change. Jeremy Campbell Got it, thanks, and then just setting back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted about 150 bips of year-over-year expansion on -- in high-grade market share. I guess kind of going forward, you know, what types of shares gains should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the outside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Tony DeLise You know, it's a little bit of both, I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility that would be helpful to our share gains and as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where when new issues are extremely active there is a slice of trace that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of. So the new issue market has that impact, but we're playing a long game. We take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be five or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit and these are very large markets. We have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell Got it. And then one quick one; and I apologize if I missed this, but Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year is going to be 21 to 22, any sense of what we should expect into '19? Tony DeLise Yes, sure Jeremy, so we hadn't completed the budget process yet for 2019, so we're not prepared at least today to give you definitive range, but that said I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you look to 2018, and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate would be right around 24%. That's really the jumping off point for 2019. But the difficult part is -- it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this that sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefits there would be around $2 million. So jumping off point -- and again, budget's not complete, jumping off point 24%, rolling some excess tax benefits. So, to be something less than 24%, but when we get to this January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that -- I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses. You talked about some headcount that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we looked at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months. Tony DeLise Sure, Daniel, I study on the expenses, I mean, this is -- we are still investing for the future. We are -- you know, we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There's some regulatory related spend as well -- and just on the tax rate, you know, we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January, but you know, again thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9% and then if you look longer term the past five years, the compound annual growth rate has also been about 9% and we're going to continue -- we had plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion in our infrastructure. I suggest taking history into account and at least -- from modeling out sort of early models on 2019, will give more color in January, but that 9% that's where we've been and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Dan Fannon Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million and I appreciate the commentary on October and you know, the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here in -- for the last several quarters, but I guess, as we think about a higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Tony DeLise Dan, if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate node activity matters, but if you take those all aside and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yes, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture and I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every one percentage point, change in yield across the yield curve -- you know, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So again if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture, but there are -- there's so many things that influence fee capture around, years of maturity, trade size, dealer mix. There's just a lot that goes into the mix on U.S. high-grade. Dan Fannon Got it, thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Rich Repetto Yes, thanks, guys, my question has been asked and answered, thank you. Tony DeLise Thank you. Operator Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call over back to Mr. Rick McVey. End of Q&A Rick McVey Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This does conclude today's program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
1096862,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Third Quarter Financial Highlights* *All comparisons versus third quarter 2017. NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc.

""Product diversification is evident in the results with a record 9.2% estimated high-yield market share, 22% year-on-year increase in emerging market trading volume and a 28% increase in Eurobond volumes. We are encouraged by the improvement in market conditions for credit trading that we started to see in September.""

Operating income was $46.4 million, compared to $46.6 million for the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of 0.5%. Operating margin was 45.8%, compared to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $38.6 million, or $1.02 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $34.1 million, or $0.90 per share, for the third quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the third quarter of 2018 increased 4.9% to $90.5 million, compared to $86.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees were $66.0 million on total trading volume of $385.5 billion for the third quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $65.9 million on total trading volume of $346.8 billion for the third quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.5% for the third quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.2% for the third quarter of 2017. All other revenue increased 17.4% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, principally due to higher information services revenue of $0.8 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.8 million. Total expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased 12.4% to $55.0 million, compared to $48.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $1.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.6 million, marketing and advertising expenses of $0.9 million, technology and communication costs of $0.8 million and employee compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, mainly due to an increase in headcount. Occupancy costs in the third quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.9 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.04. Other income increased to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 due to a $0.7 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 19.3%, compared to 27.7% for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $0.4 million reduction to the provisional tax charge recorded in 2017 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The third quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $3.8 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on November 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,500 shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.1 million. Balance Sheet Data As of September 30, 2018, total assets were $646.1 million and included $446.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2018 was $578.6 million. Guidance for 2018 The Company is updating its full year 2018 overall effective tax rate guidance to a range of 21.0% to 22.0%, down from the previous guidance of 23.0% to 25.0%. The reduction is primarily due to excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that were exercised during 2018. The Company expects that full year 2018 expenses will be near the low-end of the $220.0 million to $232.0 million guidance range. The expense guidance includes duplicate occupancy costs of approximately $7.0 million for the Company’s new corporate offices in New York during the build-out phase. The Company also expects that full year 2018 capital expenditures will be near the high-end of the $43.0 million to $50.0 million guidance range. The capital expenditure guidance includes approximately $26.0 million of buildout costs for the new corporate offices.

MarketAxess Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MKTX)Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOct. 24, 2018, 10:00 a.m. ET Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. David Cresci -- Investor Relations Manager Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2018 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products and continued robust open trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3, 2017. Our estimated US high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth and reached the record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million was up 6% compared to Q3, 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12% including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson Yards. We expect to move into our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes, both saw a rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatility fell and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall, trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions have been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong and position the company well for future growth . Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter and was up 58% to a near record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion also up 58%. Open trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 open trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through open trading and over a 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transaction costs for open trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a US high-grade transaction through open trading protocols. Importantly, open trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our products and geographic diversification. Our US high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are under way to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22% with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on this system representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rick . Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. US high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, a slight increase in estimated market share accounted for the uplift in trading volume as US high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated US high-grade market share is up 1 percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes or other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets in US high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains were the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volumes, 27% growth in high yield volume and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated US high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated US high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. A 11% increase in trading volume resulted in a 5% uplift in commissions. New data contract accounted for the $800,000 increase in Information Services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and new customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter and 21.6% year to date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range and now expect the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years to maturity and higher yields caused the reduction in our US high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, US high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in these trade size bucket. Our other credit category fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. The percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and trade show spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses were 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure. Our full year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30 were $446 million compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we had a quarterly cash dividend of $16 million and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-months free cash flow was a record $178 million. Based on these results, our board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth and estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum, including high yield, emerging markets and open trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months, provides a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Hey, good morning guys. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Patrick. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market form was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps, some the -- efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I think this is the continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead access in the system and identify offsetting interest in that trade. They can do so with any trade size and have the opportunity work on trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols, in newly issued bonds that we would introduce faster means of execution for a highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trades sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking at around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period end employee count and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter to quarter. So, should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual given what the volume might look like during the quarter? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Patrick, two things in there on the headcount and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefits. And the headcount we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of -- at the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have to start take in the fourth quarter. So we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit, we don't know what's going to -- what will happen with the attrition but we are sitting on 15 additional adds. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was as the slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits, it was around $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower, the cash bonus accrual is the formula getting tied to operating performance and quarter to quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you can see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes, Q2 to Q3, you saw a pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at the -- look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Yeah, good morning, Rick, good morning, Tony. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Rich. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And congrats on the uptick in the open trading percentage. I guess the first question is on open trading and it seems like quarter to quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in here, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield, the others very -- went up by like a 1% or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in open trading? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of open trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that open trading is providing the highest value and less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield that we've just seen better take up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way to reduce transaction costs in a less liquid market like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is, we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in the high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading, you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And just a fallow up here, thanks, Rick. A follow up open trading is, I would assume the ETFs just some comments on auto-ex as well, just the trend there. If open tradings pickup, I assume the auto-ex and the drivers, one of the drivers of ETFs that you would see auto-ex also increasing? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right about auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you well know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on to low-touch and now even moving into no-touch. Where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they are able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfectly willing to auto execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy-side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade, it's really about do the price responses comeback to meet the clients' preset expectations and as they do, they're willing to auto execute those trades. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q and I think these are from your comments that the July and August were a different tale story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think even more volatility in October, and you may have covered this, but if you did, I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October, but can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility like September, October? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, well, October if you looked at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield look very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months and September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall, but we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October and the product mix will really drive the fee capture. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto-ex, but maybe more so on the composite plus product. Really just want to get updated thoughts on the future of composite plus and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facilitate some of these auto-ex functionalities been built into the buy-side. But are there also other revenue generating opportunities for composite plus as well? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Happy to take that one. We're really pleased to see both dealer and investor clients embracing composite price plus, which is a real-time mid market now on about 20,000 global credit securities. So incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products, it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that. And the client take up around composite price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients, the more they can use auto execution. So, it does tie into the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking about streaming price protocols and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and your views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices versus RFQ as you're looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices. So the technology series, it's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And today institutional investors have struck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up. I do think it's possible that streaming prices, especially at the more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency when the market is ready to go in that direction and we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Hey guys, good morning. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst I wanted to go back to a question earlier on high-yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high-yield open trading is really accelerated in last couple of quarters, I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters, previously it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETFs, so I just want to understand is -- are the ETF market makers, what has driven the vast majority of that acceleration or are there other factors? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There are other factors, I think ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy-side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high-yield trading overall and open trading adoption specifically from long-only investment managers. And, a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high-yield trading environment, which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high-yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in fund flows. So I think it's a combination of adoption by long-only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay, it makes sense, Rick. And then on the -- assume the discussion around new functionality agenda, you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process. When should we expect to actually see you rollout that functionality? And just talk about kind of the discussions, the consulting you're doing with the buy-side trading desks as you work on those developments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, there is no set timetable like anything that we do, we're out talking to both dealer, investor clients to see if we could add more value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we're in midstream on those conversations and depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around faster, more active protocol for newly issued training, we'll be ready to roll it out. So there's no set timetable but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open . Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Morning guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we've been seeing lately on September-October. Just (ph) any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets and Eurobonds, obviously Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in recent periods and EM has been a little bit flatter looking at September to the summer period. So any commentary there would be helpful. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Chris, you're looking for some comments on October or what's the third quarter? Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Yeah, just in terms of when you kind of noted the things picked up in the back half of September, continuing to October, but it sounds like more of those comments are more focused on high-grade and invest in -- high yield. Just wondering how the other buckets are trading as well. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You saw it from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets and Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down, we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think the one thing that I would point to and this is more particular from emerging markets and Eurobonds right now. Market volumes are still struggling. So even -- we gave some commentary that October market volumes for US investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one while it's healthier than the third quarter, you're not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Actually, on the last one, Chris, Euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from traction other sources Euros looked to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for US high-grade and US high-yield. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Got it. I guess just from an overall perspective, you're seeing changes in client behavior or it's just the environments got a little bit better and trade activities kind of picking up. I'm just trying to think about this could be a period like we saw in the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming in, new participants have maybe have been little bit quieter on these periods? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd separate the two, but clearly the broad based gains that we're seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products, this is shaping up to be one of our strongest year ever -- years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual of the fact that it's being driven more by EM, high-yield and Euros this year than it is in high-grade, but even high-grade is up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we've ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trade behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment that we obviously can't control that, it ebbs and flows with various factors. And if it hits the trough for the year in July and August, and September, and October, we would see a rebound, it looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So I would separate those two factors. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer I hate to keep on jump again on this particular point. But -- look, these are longer-term trends across all the products where we have more clients engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading, the bigger piece across all of our core products, open trading to bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients, and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products, that's up the 100 clients just in the past year. So just see the network and engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Thanks guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks. So we've kind of stable pricing in high-grade, and Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So, appreciate the update here on October volumes. But are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten. And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightening duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter and next year? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jeremy, you know it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We've been -- and the thing that we look at more as around years to maturity and what absolute yields are, we're not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just the investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four products is very consistent with the third quarter. And Rick pointed out before that you may see a mix among the products or one product growing faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture but the individual product level, no change. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it, thanks. Let me just stepping back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted at about 150 bps of year-over-year expansion in high-grade market share. I guess on a go-forward, what types of share gains, would we -- should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the upside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's a little bit above, which I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility, that would be helpful to our share gains. And as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where new issues are extremely active. There is a slice of TRACE that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of, so the new issued market has that impact. But you know we're playing the long game, we take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be in 5 or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit. And these are very large markets, we have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. And then just one quick one, and apologies if I missed this. But Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year going to be 21% to 22%. Any sense of what we should expect into '19? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Jeremy. We haven't completed the budget process yet for 2019. So we're not prepared at least today to give you a definitive range. But that said, I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you looked at 2018 and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate will be right around 24%. So that's really been jumping-off point for 2019. But the difficult part is it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this, sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefit, there would be around $2 million. So jumping-off point, and again, but it's not complete jumping-off point 24% roll into an excess tax benefit. So it would be something less than 24%. But when we get to the January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that, I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you can give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses, you talked about some head count that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we look at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure, Daniel. I'll tell you on the expense, I mean, this is, we are still investing for the future. We are -- we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There is some regulatory related spend as well. And as I just said on the tax rate that we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January. But again, thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9%. And then if you look longer-term, the past five years, the compound annual growth rates also been about 9%. And we're going to continue. We have plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion, in our infrastructure. I'd suggest taking history into account at least for modeling out sort of early models on 2019, we'll give you more color in January. But that 9%, that's where we've been, and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million, and I appreciate the commentary on October. And the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here for the last several quarters. But I guess, as we think about higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration of having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Dan, if we were just -- if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate note activity matters. But, if you take those all side and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yeah, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture. I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every 1 percentage point change in yield across the yield curve, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So you again, if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture. But there are -- that is costing us so many things and influence fee capture around years to maturity, trade size, dealer mix, there's just a lot that goes into the mix on US high-grade. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from a Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Yeah, thanks guys. My question has been asked and answered. Thank you. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Richard. Operator Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call over back to Mr. Rick McVey.

1022025,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Alumna/us in the News,"October 24, 2018 Programs supported by gift will create pipeline for the next generation of scientific leaders Colby College has received a major contribution to support programs that will prepare the next generation of innovators in the sciences through funded experiences at renowned partner institutions on the leading edge of discovery. The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad."

Cultural carpetbaggers claim Miami ""lacked culture"" before the galleries came along, but true Miamians know that this city has always been the melting-est of melting pots, with music and flavors from the Caribbean, Latin America, and many other places blending to create our own, unique culture.

To that end, CultureFest 305, the museum's free day festival of music, dance, food, and art, will include performances by the Delou Africa Dance Ensemble, reggae band Jahfe, a martial arts presentation by Master Xiaoming Lu, and much more. 2 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at HistoryMiami Museum, 101 W.

Ween, the enigmatic alt-rock band that shape-shifted its way through genres in the '90s and early '00s, has a cult following for good reason. It's not only because members Gene and Dean Ween were ""sprouted from the demon-god Boognish,"" but also because they produced a song or album for every taste. The two childhood pals formed their act in 1984 and recorded nine studio albums with expanded membership. Though Gene Ween left the group to deal with his substance-use disorder, the duo recently reunited in 2015 and is on tour.

In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost with a lawsuit accusing him of stock fraud. According to the SEC, Frost and his co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of stocks and then exited with millions, leaving other investors with virtually worthless shares. After the charges were announced in the national media, stock prices for Frost's company, Opko Health, plummeted. Now Frost is being sued by six Opko shareholders who lost money because of the alleged pump-and-dump scheme. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Florida, New Jersey, and New York, are brought by plaintiffs Charles Steinberg, Jason Kerznowski, Michael Brennan, Paul Camhi, Andy Yu, and a sports agency called Adsport that's run by CEO Gary Knudson. Frost, the namesake of Miami's Frost Museum of Science and Frost Art Museum, has not yet responded to the complaints in court. A spokesman for the octogenarian did not return a call from New Times Wednesday, but in an earlier statement, Frost denied the SEC's allegations. ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity... I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name,"" wrote Frost, who has not been criminally charged with any wrongdoing. In the six new lawsuits against Frost, shareholders accuse him of intentionally making false or misleading statements about the finances and operations of Opko. Attorneys for the shareholders argue that as CEO of Opko, Frost knew or should have known about the alleged activity spelled out in the SEC's claim. You have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in! Most of the suits contain similar language and allegations, but one of the cases filed last week in Miami federal court, by New York resident Andy Yu, goes into greater detail about the way Frost financially benefited from Opko. According to Yu's complaint, Frost rented his own office space to Opko for $81,000 per month beginning in January 2014 and then hiked it up to $86,000 per month in 2018. If the claim is true, Frost made about $4.45 million acting as landlord for his own company. The lawsuit also says Frost billed Opko a total of $659,000 for use of his private plane in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. ""As the company’s highest officer and as chairman of the board, he conducted little, if any, oversight of the company’s engagement in the scheme to make false and misleading statements, consciously disregarded his duties to monitor such controls over reporting and engagement in the scheme, and consciously disregarded his duties to protect corporate assets,"" the complaint alleges. Yu's attorney, Walter Mathews, did not return a call from New Times Wednesday. As of now, no court hearings have been scheduled.

Panmure Gordon’s parent company, Panmure Gordon Group, made profits after tax of £2.3m in 2017, more than double the £1.1m 2016 profits of the pre-takeover group. The firm made net revenues of £14.9m in the year ending in December, according to its latest company accounts. Read more: Will fortune favour brave Bob Diamond's Panmure takeover? However, the bank’s figures were boosted by a £4.1m one-off accounting gain as the parent company took over Panmure’s old assets in what it deemed as ‘bargain purchase.’ Panmure made a statutory operating loss of £2.6m in 2017, compared to an operating profit of £1.6m in 2016, after absorbing £3.3m in acquisition fees and spending £1.2m in new investment. Underlying operating profit was £1.9m. Diamond, who lost his role as Barclays boss following the Libor rate-rigging scandal, banded together with the investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family to buy Panmure last year. The firm, which can trace its roots back to 1876, sustained heavy losses of £16.7m in 2015, prompting a wave of changes at the top and opening the way for the takeover. Ian Axe, Panmure chief executive, said 2017 performance was “stable”, but added the firm had “started to transform both our infrastructure and seed the growth of new businesses and diversification for the coming years”. The firm has expanded into mergers and acquisitions advisory and private capital, alongside more traditional broking activities. The firm’s headcount has risen to 130 people. The group’s UK subsidiary, Panmure Gordon (UK), reported a loss for the year in separate accounts, although this was accounted for mainly by one-off acquisition costs, such as legal and financial advisers, of £2.5m after the takeover. The group’s measure of underlying profit in the UK business after tax was £1.6m. Read more: You probably won't know of this adviser on the Panmure Gordon takeover deal The firm said it made “significant investment” during 2017, mainly in regard to adjusting to compliance and regulation changes brought under Mifid 2, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Barrington analyst Michael Petusky maintained a Buy rating on Opko Health (NASDAQ: OPK) today and set a price target of $7. The company’s shares opened today at $3.49. Petusky said: “We know that management received several questions regarding the recent news that the SEC has launched an investigation into the trading of certain low‐priced securities, and that CEO and Chairman Dr. Phil Frost and OPKO were among the investors whose activities are now under SEC review. The general thrust of the investigation seems to involve allegations of “pump and dump” stock trading. We simply do not have enough information to make any kind of high conviction call on the ultimate outcome of this investigation, but we can say that both Dr. Frost and OPKO have a long history of making investments in smaller companies. In the case of OPKO (and to the best of our knowledge), not a dollar of investment that the company has made in any of the trading activity being examined by the SEC has ever been monetized. Regarding Dr.” According to TipRanks.com, Petusky is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 14.2% and a 59.2% success rate. Petusky covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Anika Therapeutics Inc, Varian Medical Systems, and DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. The word on The Street in general, suggests a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating for Opko Health with a $10.50 average price target.

1015016,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 16:51 EST, 4 October 2018 | Updated: 16:51 EST, 4 October 2018 View comments Sir David Garrard, quit the Labour party in March over the ongoing anti-Semitism Property developer Sir David Garrard, who donated £2million to Labour before the 2015 general election, quit the party in March over the ongoing anti-Semitism row. Garrard, 79, also expressed regret for his largesse. Yet in the past few weeks he has given deputy leader Tom Watson's office £15,000. My Westminster source explains: 'There's no better way to irritate Jeremy Corbyn than by giving money to Watson.' Santander's incoming boss, suave Italiano Andrea Orcel, has been described as a determined alpha male who likes to get what he wants. Although the ex-UBS banker, 55, will hold the title of chief executive, overall in charge at the bank remains its redoubtable executive chairman Ana Botin, 58, whose family control Santander. Wonder how that's going to play out? An erstwhile colleague mischievously smirks: 'Pass the popcorn'. Competitors in this weekend's Alfred Dunhill Golf Championship at St Andrews include ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond, Richemont chairman Johann Rupert and Aberdeen Standard chief Martin Gilbert. Accomplished players all, who should more than hold their own in tackling the world's most famous golf course. Unlike my colleague Piers Morgan, who judging by some of his practice shots yesterday looks likely to be keeping the greenkeepers busy. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH's billionaire patriarch Bernard Arnault has appointed his cherubic son Frederic, 23, as digital director of watchmaker Tag Heuer. Father-of-five Monsieur Arnault's youngest son Jean, 19, now remains the only member of his offspring yet to enter the family business. Perhaps Bernard, 69, should send him to Celine to keep an eye on the fashion label's waifish creative chief, Hedi Slimane. His debut collection was universally panned this week. Fulham Football club's fabulously moustachioed owner Shahid Khan's has a floating gin palace Kismet, which was comfortably the biggest vessel on display at the recent Monaco Yacht Show. The 312-ft monster has eight bedrooms, a 28-man crew and is available for charter at £1million a week. Is anyone daft enough to pay that much? Sighs my Monaco mole: 'Well, Beyonce and Jay Z certainly were this summer.' Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

1014074,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Michael Jordan, worth $1.7 billion, is one of more than 200 American billionaires to not make the Forbes 400.2017 Getty Images A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be. This year, a record 204 billionaires weren’t wealthy enough to crack the exclusive Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. The cutoff to the make the list was higher than ever: $2.1 billion, up $100 million from last year. The list of those not quite rich enough includes people who have appeared on The Forbes 400 in years past, like private-equity giants Bruce Karsh and Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital (now worth $2 billion each); Under Armour founder Kevin Plank ($1.9 billion) and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman ($1.8 billion), who Forbes recently learned has given away $1.5 billion. Others who fell short were new billionaires from a variety of industries, many of whom have the potential to rise in the ranks and make the cut in the coming years. GitHub’s cofounder Chris Wanstrath, worth $1.4 billion, sold out in exchange for the lucrative currency of Microsoft shares. In June, Microsoft announced it would purchase the software-development platform for $7.5 billion in stock, and Wanstrath, GitHub’s largest shareholder, received an estimated $1.4 billion. As part of the deal he stepped down as CEO of the company that he founded in 2008 to become a fellow at Microsoft. Even closer to the $2.1 billion minimum is Tim Sweeney, the founder of blockbuster video game Fortnite Battle Royale, who’s worth an estimated $1.8 billion. The game has attracted at least 125 million players and over $1 billion in estimated in-game sales (the game is free to play, but players can buy various extras and add-ons). Forbes calculates that Sweeney owns roughly 16% of Epic Games, the game developer he founded in 1991 while studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland. Jim Kavanaugh, a former pro soccer player who played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, went on to cofound IT provider World Wide Technology six years later at age 27. Back then, he found himself driving 500 PCs to Omaha just to fill an order. The grit paid off: He’s now worth $2 billion, based on his 38% stake in the $10.4 billion (sales) company. It’s not only the tech sector that produced billion-dollar Americans this year. Anastasia Soare, who emigrated from Romania in 1989, expanded her L.A. eyebrow salon—clients include Kim Kardashian and Cindy Crawford—into an international makeup phenomenon and a $1 billion fortune. Her Anastasia Beverly Hills brand is sold in more than 1,500 stores and had sales of $200 million last year. With nearly 18 million Instagram followers and a number of celebrities touting her products, Soare, 60, has built a low-cost marketing machine. Jimmy John Liautaud, worth $1.7 billion, made his fortune thanks to his eponymous sandwich chain, which he founded in 1983 at age 19. Although he sold a minority stake to private-equity investor Weston Presidio over a decade ago and Roark Capital bought a majority stake in 2017, Liautaud still owns an estimated 35% of the company and serves as its chairman. A poor student who graduated near the bottom of his high school class, he started the business using a $25,000 loan from his father, an Army veteran. Jimmy John’s now has nearly 3,000 locations. Former NBA star Michael Jordan may have stepped off the court, but he is still in the game of making money. Worth $1.7 billion, Jordan's playing salary during career totaled $90 million, but he has earned another $1.4 billion (pretax) from corporate partners including Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck. In 2010 he used some of those earnings to purchase a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets. The team is now worth $1.05 billion, and he owns 90%. Here is the complete list of the ten-figure net worth individuals who didn’t make The Forbes 400 list this year, as well as their source of wealth: $2 billion Jim Kavanaugh, IT provider $2 billion Valentin Gapontsev, lasers $2 billion Herbert Allen, investment banking $2 billion Paul Foster, oil refining $2 billion Manuel Moroun, transportation $2 billion Stanley Hubbard, DirecTV $2 billion Jeffrey Gundlach, investments $2 billion Charles Zegar, Bloomberg LP $2 billion Jennifer Pritzker, hotels and investments $2 billion Henry Laufer, hedge funds $2 billion Brian Sheth, investments $2 billion Lee Thomas, private equity $2 billion Bruce Karsh, private equity $2 billion Howard Marks, private equity $2 billion Robert Duggan, pharmaceuticals $2 billion Stewart Horejsi, Berkshire Hathaway $2 billion David Booth, mutual funds $2 billion Rodney Sacks, energy drinks $2 billion Amy Wyss, medical equipment $2 billion Julio Mario Santo Domingo, beer $2 billion Linda Pritzker, hotels and investments $2 billion David Murdock, Dole and real estate $2 billion John Tyson, food processing $2 billion Jeffrey Lorberbaum, flooring $1.9 billion William Stone, software $1.9 billion Kevin Plank, Under Armour $1.9 billion Catherine Lozick, valve manufacturing $1.9 billion Christopher Cline, coal $1.9 billion Aneel Bhusri, business software $1.9 billion Jim Justice, coal $1.8 billion Tor Peterson, online media $1.8 billion William Lauder, Estée Lauder $1.8 billion Tim Sweeney, video games $1.8 billion Ron Burkle, supermarkets and investments $1.8 billion David Lichtenstein, real estate $1.8 billion William Koch, oil and investments $1.8 billion Jonathan Nelson, private equity $1.8 billion Carol Jenkins Barnett, Publix supermarkets $1.8 billion Charles Munger, Berkshire Hathaway $1.8 billion Nicholas Berggruen, investments $1.8 billion Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn $1.8 billion William Berkley, insurance $1.8 billion Henry Swieca, hedge funds $1.8 billion Marc Lasry, hedge funds $1.8 billion Craig McCaw, telecom $1.8 billion Roger Penske, cars $1.8 billion Evan Williams, Twitter $1.8 billion Gary Michelson, medical patents $1.8 billion Bill Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Ted Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Susan Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Bill Haslam, truck stops $1.8 billion James France, Nascar/racing $1.8 billion Brian Roberts, Comcast $1.7 billion Miguel McKelvey, WeWork $1.7 billion Mario Gabelli, money management $1.7 billion Jimmy Liautaud, sandwich chain $1.7 billion Michael Jordan, Charlotte Hornets and endorsements $1.7 billion Timothy Headington, oil & gas and investments $1.7 billion Anne Gittinger, Nordstrom department stores $1.6 James Hamilton, investments $1.6 billion Christopher Goldsbury, salsa $1.6 billion Stephen Winn, real estate services $1.6 billion Bharat Desai, IT consultants $1.6 billion Nelson Peltz, investments $1.6 billion Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook $1.6 billion George Joseph, insurance $1.6 billion Thomas Steyer, hedge funds $1.6 billion Kieu Hoang, medical products $1.6 billion Craig Newmark, Craigslist $1.6 billion Robert Fisher, Gap $1.6 billion Louis Bacon, hedge funds $1.6 billion Francis O.

1108635,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"Interview with interventional cardiology pioneer Simon Stertzer, M.D. Simon Stertzer, M.D., is one of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s and 1980s. He performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States in 1978. One of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s was Simon Stertzer, M.D. In this article he shares his views on the current direction and next steps in cardiovascular biomedical technology. On March 1, 1978, Stertzer in New York, and Richard Myler, M.D., in San Francisco, each performed the first two coronary angioplasty balloon procedures in the United States.[1] This was just six months after the world's first angioplasty was performed by Andreas Gruntzig in Zurich, Switzerland. Gruntzig presented his first angioplasty cases at the American Heart Association (AHA) in Novemeber 1977, and found some enthusiasm among early American supporters for this new, non-surgical intervention. Stertzer pushed the limit of the early dilation balloons in his first case, treating a complex lesion in an older patient, which even Gruntzig shyed away from. His first cases, along with Gruntzig's and Myler's, were combined into the first-ever interventional cardiology multi-center study, which they presented at AHA in 1980. Stertzer was also involved in the first live case courses to teach early adopter cardiologists how to perform angioplasty procedures. Stertzer was director of the catheterization laboratory at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York from 1971 to 1983. He served as the director of medical research and director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the San Francisco Heart Institute in Daly City, Calif., from 1983 to 1993, working with the institute’s director, the late Myler. In 1993, Stertzer was recruited to Stanford University’s School of Medicine, as professor of medicine. In 1984, Stertzer was a founder of the interventional device company Arterial Vascular Engineering (AVE). It was purchased in 1998 by Medtronic to form its interventional division. He was also involved with Quanam Medical Corp., founded in 1994, which developed polymer-coated stents used for drug delivery in coronary angioplasty. That company was acquired by Boston Scientific in 2001. Today, Stertzer is professor emeritus at Stanford University School of Medicine and is a co-founder of BioCardia, which was created in 1999. He serves as chairman of the board. The clinical-stage regenerative biotechnology company is developing technology for the direct injection of stem cells and agents into the heart muscle, as well as personalized screenings to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intramyocardial injection of therapeutic agents. Its main focus is in treatments of heart failure. Question: Just how big of a problem is heart disease in the U.S.? Answer: According to American Heart Association statistics, cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is listed as the underlying cause of death in about 836,546 deaths in the United States. This breaks down to about 2,300 Americans dying of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of one death every 38 seconds. Currently, about 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke.[2] Question: Based on your career treating patients with cardiovascular disease, what are the biggest risk factors that contribute to the development of heart disease? Answer: The biggest risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of physical activity, obesity, poor diet, and critically, genetic and family history. Question: The latest statistics show that heart failure is on the rise due to advances in healthcare innovation and people surviving prior heart attacks. How can both lifestyle changes and advanced new treatments prevent future heart failure in heart attack survivors?Answer: Meticulous attention to blood pressure, diet, physical activity, and blood lipid treatments can all delay or decrease the numbers of increasing heart failure in post-heart attack victims. Cell therapy may also hold promise for decreasing or ameliorating heart failure in this population. Question: You performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States. What have been some of the most successful innovations used to treat heart disease? Answer: After the initial introduction of coronary angioplasty into Europe and the U.S., in 1978, we have seen an explosion of subsequent technology such as: stents (including drug-eluting stents), improvements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, percutaneous valve replacements without open chest surgery, and now, the beginning of stem cell introduction directly into the heart muscle to affect the course and symptoms of heart failure. Question: There have been numerous examples of healthcare innovations enabling people to better monitor their health. A great example is the new Fitbit Charge 3 that tracks sleep apnea, which has been linked to heart disease. What are your thoughts on these types of devices as a means of tracking overall health and protecting against heart disease?Answer: The diagnosis of sleep apnea, a significant risk factor for heart disease and arrhythmia (like atrial fibrillation), has traditionally been by sleeping partner observation or by spending a night in a specialized hospital setting requiring an overnight stay. This is a costly and highly disruptive process to diagnose sleep apnea. Thus, to the extent that we can obviate an overnight stay and still make accurate diagnoses of sleep apnea, these out-of-hospital aids could be excellent. Question: When you look ahead to the future of medicine, where do you see the most innovation taking place? Answer: When it comes to the future of medicine, we will continue to see a combination of both devices and biopharmaceuticals paving the way for the improvements in disease treatment. Finding the keys to cellular metastatic behavior (the spread of cancer) will drastically change the outlook for cancer sufferers, and hopefully eradicate early death rates. Devices will continue to aid orthopedic and neurological conditions, while biochemistry and artificial intelligence will continue to alter the course of many other chronic and fatal diseases. Question: BioCardia is pioneering new advancements in the treatment of cardiovascular disease through the use of stem cells. How is BioCardia changing the way heart failure is treated? Answer: Up until the present era, common varieties of heart failure have been treated with a variety of medications, exercise and activity restrictions, salt restriction, diuretics and various hormonal therapies designed to improve cardiac function. Although these therapies relieve many of the symptoms of heart failure, they do not fundamentally improve the heart muscle itself. BioCardia is in a pivotal trial administering certain types of blood cells directly into the heart muscle from the outside of the body, using a specialized catheter system invented at the company laboratories in San Carlos, Calif. These cells are the first generation of a future line of cells, gene products and other biologicals, the administration of which will change the course of heart failure and other diseases in the near future, in my opinion. The future of this therapy will improve cardiac function and may even regenerate heart muscle in the coming years. Not only do we expect cell therapy to eventually regenerate diseased tissue, but we already are seeing replacements of heart valves using catheter procedures from the outside of the body, as well as improved pacemakers and implantable devices (in selected patients) designed to decrease the incidence of sudden death. Question: Tell us more about the recent Phase III trial for BioCardia’s CardiAMP heart failure treatment. What is CardiAMP, and what do the results show?Answer: The investigational CardiAMP therapy uses the patient's own (autologous) bone marrow cells to potentially stimulate the body's natural healing response through a minimally-invasive, catheter-based procedure. The results are highly promising. In a recent Viewpoint paper, the authors acknowledge that although the varying properties and potency of bone marrow-derived stem cells across patients are recognized, little focus has been put on the regenerative capacity of the patients themselves in determining outcomes.[3] They point out that the pivotal CardiAMP-HF Trial is the first to incorporate a cell potency analysis and score in the screening criteria. BioCardia was highlighted as an example of personalized medicine, with promising results from the first 10 or so-called roll-in cases.

1031786,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Colby Friend in the News,"Mainly cloudy. High 14F. Winds light and variable.. Partly cloudy skies. Low 1F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 8:44 am FAIRBANKS — The fall Guys Read program is in its 13th year, and “Leon: Protector of the Playground,” is one of the featured books. Leon Magnificent’s world has many watered-down super heroes and villains. Leon’s superpower, for instance, is common sense, though he gets to wear a cape. Gertrude Stein, who once commented that “everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense,” would have liked Leon. If you’re ripe enough, keeping the senses sharp is reason to join UAF’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Philanthropist Bernard Osher’s foundation supports university “programs targeted toward more mature students not necessarily well served by standard continuing education curricula,” according to OsherFoundation.org, because “the interest of many older adults, especially those who have retired, is learning for the joy of learning, without examinations or grades.” UAF’s one of 122 universities offering OLLI classes, but only elders 50 and older can participate. It’s inexpensive and stimulatingly fun. I’m a volunteer OLLI instructor. This fall’s class is about word histories, which is why recent columns have leaned that way. A lifelong interest in word origins has produced a personal library of relevant books, but I’m no expert. I’m boning up to have a fighting chance of not embarrassing myself, and that’s how I met Mrs. Byrne. Josefa Heifetz Byrne was a concert pianist and the daughter of “legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz,” who in 1958 married Robert Byrne, a civil engineer, leading expert on pool and billiards and author of important books on the latter subjects. In fact, Byrne coined an obscure term, “squirt” for a particular sort of misplayed shot wherein the cue ball “squirts” off to the side. He and Josefa divorced in 1976, two years after he edited and wrote the forward to “Mrs. Byrne’s Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words.” Claiming that “every entry in this book, even the most ludicrous, has been accepted as a formal or legitimate English word by at least one major dictionary,” Byrne added that his wife “managed to assemble the six thousand weirdest words in the English language. Nobody asked her to do it because nobody thought such a thing was possible. In fact I asked her not to do it. Completed, the book stands as one of the most peculiar feats of compulsive lexicography.” Examples include “quasihemidemisemiquaver” (a 128th note), “quadrigomist” (“someone with four husbands or four wives at the same time”), and “quop” (“to throb”). If there aren’t enough strange words already, now the Oxford English Dictionary has asked teens to tweet them their latest catchy slang expressions. “Inside the OED: Can the World’s Biggest Dictionary Survive the Internet?,” a NYTimes.com article by Andrew Dickson, is a fascinating look at the greatest English dictionary’s inner workings. It also provides a good thumbnail description of how “the mother of all English language dictionaries” evolved, and how it continues to thrive as internet hyper-connectivity and communication speeds is causing new words to sprout and spread exponentially. The Third Edition of the OED is underway, “a goliath project that involves overhauling every entry (many of which haven’t been touched since the late-Victorian era) and adding … missing words, as well as making the dictionary into a fully digital resource.” It’s a glacial process; 2000 was the original completion date, and presently they’re “about 48 percent” along. “Go,” for example, took about 12 months to fully update and revise, but then “the revised entry for ‘go’ traces 537 separate senses over 1,000 years.” “Well,” as Michael Proffitt, the current chief editor, put it, “we have to get things right.” “Bare” is one of the new crop of slang. It means “many or much; a lot of,” as in OED’s #YouthSlangAppeal: “We could do with some help. Bare help.” Then there’s “woke,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “Aware of the injustice of the social system in which one lives.” Perhaps youngsters will someday woke to the plight of elders being overwhelmed with new terms. Until then, we oldsters should employ common sense and circumvallate (“surround with or as if with a rampart”) ourselves with venerable, crusty expressions of yore, and show them a thing or three.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com. https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-lawyer-at-the-center-of-sec-pump-and-dump-case-1538675403 In a stock fraud suit filed last month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators allege that billionaire drug entrepreneur Phillip Frost and his company Opko Health participated in pump-and-dump schemes organized by investor Barry Honig. The complaint in Manhattan’s federal district court says that Honig and his associates bought stock in three small companies, controlled the firms’ managements, and planted promotional articles about them before unloading their shares. The schemers reaped more than $27 million, the SEC charges, before leaving public investors with virtually worthless stock. Unmentioned in the SEC’s case is how all three public companies in the alleged swindles used the same securities law firm and the same stock transfer agency. SEC filings over the past decade show that nearly two dozen public companies backed by Honig, or other defendants in last month’s SEC complaint, used securities lawyer Harvey Kesner, a 61-year old partner at the leading small-cap law firm Sichenzia Ross Ference, until he retired from the firm just before the SEC action. Those companies also happened to use Equity Stock Transfer, a New York outfit that SEC registrations show was financed and controlled by Kesner. A prominent Honig-backed firm that Kesner represented was Riot Blockchain (ticker: RIOT), whose shares rose tenfold in last year’s cryptocurrency surge, to $46, before falling back to a recent $3.40. Riot wasn’t named in the SEC’s case, but its chief executive, John O’Rourke, was. He has resigned and said he’ll fight the civil charges that he colluded in Honig’s alleged swindles. Following the SEC charges, Frost stepped down as chairman from the brokerage firm he controls, Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services (LTS). The 81-year-old Frost and Opko (OPK) deny the wrongdoings alleged in the SEC’s action. Honig has made no public statement. He did not respond to Barron’s requests for comment. One defendant, John H. Ford, quickly settled the SEC’s charges, without admitting or denying allegations that he took undisclosed payments to tout a couple of the stocks on the website SeekingAlpha.com. Securities lawyers and transfer agents are essential gatekeepers under federal regulations meant to protect the investing public. But one of the three companies featured in the SEC’s New York case, the tiny biotech firm MabVax Therapeutics Holdings (MBVX), says that Honig forced it to hire Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross firm as a condition of his financing, according to a little-noted malpractice case that MabVax filed in a San Diego state court after the SEC case became public. The MabVax suit contends that Kesner and his law firm advanced the interests of Honig at the expense of MabVax, deceiving the company and committing malpractice that led to its delisting from Nasdaq. Although MabVax had retained Kesner’s law firm “to keep the company safe,” says the biotech’s complaint, Kesner’s firm instead “put MabVax in harm’s way.” Neither Kesner nor Equity Stock Transfer responded to Barron’s requests for comment or in court filings. Kesner’s former firm strongly denies that it wronged its client MabVax. “There are very serious misstatements and misleading facts alleged in the complaint, as well as errors in law,” says Mark Anesh, a malpractice specialist from the firm Lewis Brisbois, who will represent Sichenzia Ross’ lawyers in the California case, but not Kesner. “The firm intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, and in the end we fully expect that the claims contained therein will be found to be completely and utterly without merit.” Kesner was a rainmaker at many of the firms where he worked. Before Sichenzia Ross Ference Kesner—as the New York firm was known until Kesner’s August departure—he’d been with the Dallas firm Haynes and Boone until the firm terminated him in 2009. In a lawsuit that was quickly settled, Kesner demanded $15 million from the Dallas firm and alleged that its partners defamed him by telling others “Harvey is dirty” and “had relationships with clients that the firm did not wish to associate with.” A Haynes and Boone spokesman said, “Mr. Kesner left the firm in March of 2009. We resolved our disputes at that time and have had no further contact with him.” After arriving at Sichenzia Ross in 2009, Kesner helped build the firm into one of the busiest securities law practices in America’s small-cap stock market. The firm’s website has been intermittently offline lately while it scrubs mentions of Kesner, but it had featured many tombstone announcements of deals that SEC filings show were bankrolled by Honig, Frost, and their investing associates. Sichenzia Ross’ website said that it “consistently ranked at the top of national league table rankings for issuer, investor and placement-agent legal counsel.” In MabVax’s California complaint against the law firm, the biotech says that Honig and his associates forced MabVax to hire Kesner as part of a 2015 financing. The complaint says that Kesner later said that he worked on at least five deals a year for Honig’s investment group. MabVax said it had found 22 other companies backed by Honig’s group where “Sichenzia and Kesner have been inserted as counsel.” MabVax claims that the advice it got from Kesner was secretly designed to serve clients such as Honig. In 2015, MabVax alleges that Kesner tipped Honig off to a potential legal issue that weakened his control over the company. Honig repaired his position and then forced MabVax to issue $10 million worth of securities—for free—to Honig and his investment associates, who secretly included Kesner. The company also says that Kesner’s law firm inserted legal language in Honig’s deals so that the investors could deny that they were acting as a controlling group. But doubts about the legitimacy of Kesner’s techniques have since forced MabVax to disclaim four years worth of its previous SEC filings, alleges the company, and caused its Nasdaq delisting. Sichenzia Ross’ outside counsel in the MabVax case, Anesh, would not comment on any details alleged by MabVax. As for MabVax, it declined to comment through its outside attorney, Joel Fleming of Block & Leviton. A key player in the world of small-cap finance is a company’s stock transfer agent, which can allow the sale of unregistered shares and convert warrants or preferred shares into common stock. In the SEC action against Honig and his associates, the agency says the group used “false attorney opinion letters” to get a transfer agent to remove restrictions from Honig’s share certificates, so that Honig could sell the unregistered stock. The transfer agent for the public companies involved in the SEC case—and more than another dozen funded by Honig—was Equity Stock Transfer. Equity Stock Transfer’s initial SEC registration in 2011 says that it was funded by one of Kesner’s limited-liability companies and managed by Avital Even-Shoshan, a partner who just left Sichenzia Ross and one of the defendants in MabVax’s case. Other SEC filings said that the transfer agency’s “control persons” included Kesner, his wife Renee, and an employee of Kesner’s law firms, Mohit Bhansali. In its March 2018 registration with the SEC, the transfer agency said that it still owed money to Kesner and that its ownership was divided between Bhansali and an Atlanta management consultant named Michael Beeghley. Both Bhansali and Beeghley have served as directors of Honig-backed companies, including Riot Blockchain and PolarityTE (PTE), a Salt Lake City biotech startup whose $18 shares value the unprofitable company at about $400 million. “Stock transfer agents are the gatekeepers of securities,” says Bhansali in an online video interview linked on the transfer agency’s website. “Security for securities, that’s what we do!” Neither Equity Stock Transfer, Bhansali, nor Beeghley responded to Barron’s questions about the transfer agency. Riot Blockchain’s interim Chief Executive Chris Ensey says his company no longer uses Kesner as its securities lawyer or Equity Stock Transfer as its transfer agent. PolarityTE still uses the transfer agent, but stopped using Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross law firm in the spring of 2018. Unlike MabVax, PolarityTE’s managers say they were satisfied with Kesner’s legal advice. “We were never forced to use Mr. Kesner,” says PolarityTE Chief Operating Officer Edward Swanson.

A play-off was also necessary to determine the B Flight as Tom Simmons and David Wilson both finished regulation play tied at 82. Simmons won the play-off as he two putted while Wilson took three putts. It was Simmons first win of the season. Wayne Ferrell claimed third place in the flight at 85.

Terms of Service Thursday, November 8, 2018 Join Our Newsletter Join Our Newsletter | Get the App Class Action By Jenie Mallari-Torres | Oct 2, 2018 NEWARK, N.J. (Legal Newsline) – A clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Georgia is alleged to have deceived the investing public and engaged in a scheme to inflate the prices of securities. Anthony Pepe filed a complaint individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated on Sept. 20 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Cocrystal Pharma Inc., formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Director Phillip Frost; et al. alleging violation of federal securities laws. According to the complaint, the plaintiff is suing on behalf of class members who purchased Cocrystal and/or BioZone securities from Sept. 23, 2013, to Sept. 7, 2018. The suit states on Sept. 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a press release that announced Frost was named in a complaint over allegations of fraudulent schemes. The suit states after this announcement, Cocrystal shares fell more than 15.5 percent and damaged investors. The plaintiff holds Cocrystal Pharma Inc., et al. responsible because the defendants allegedly employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs request a trial by jury and seek judgment against defendants, damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, expert fees and other costs, and further relief as the court may deem just.

1020357,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Four Bend City Council candidates sparred over growth, transportation and housing at a debate Monday. The Central Oregon Association of Realtors hosted a joint debate with Position 5 candidates Gena Goodman-Campbell and Andrew Davis and Position 6 candidates Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick. Victor Johnson, who’s running for Position 5, and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, who’s running for Position 6, did not attend the debate. Boozell is in jail through December for failing to pay child support; Johnson did not respond to an invitation, said Tyler Neese, the association’s government affairs director. The association’s political action committee has given $30,000 to Davis and $10,000 to McCormick, according to campaign finance records filed with the Oregon Secretary of State. Growth Davis and McCormick both said the city should focus on quickly annexing land in its urban growth boundary, the line around Bend that limits where it can grow. A land shortage means Bend can’t build homes or attract high-paying jobs quickly enough, said Davis, Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life. The city also needs to start planning for its next UGB expansion immediately, he said. “If we can build homes quickly enough, we can help costs from scaling out of control,” he said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, said she agreed Bend should be building more homes quickly to address the city’s housing crisis, but she said Bend should be careful about sprawling. The city’s last urban growth boundary expansions took two tries and several years to be approved because it tried to expand too far, she said. “I really don’t think we can afford more sprawl, especially when we have trouble maintaining the roads and infrastructure we have now,” she said. Smart growth includes focusing development in the center of the city, where roads and other infrastructure already exist, Goodman-Campbell said. Affordable housing Davis and Goodman-Campbell said they wanted to see developers in Bend building more varieties of housing, including duplexes and townhomes. The focus should be on homes for people making the median income of $64,000 or below, Goodman-Campbell said, because Bend has a shortage of thousands of homes for people making that amount but a surplus of homes for people with higher incomes. McCormick, a stay-at-home mother whose family owns the Pine Tavern, said the city should focus on annexing land in the UGB rather than trying city policies like rent control or inclusionary zoning, which requires affordable housing in developments. Developers work with fine margins and requiring them to construct affordable housing will mean they move to other cities, she said “There is a price to be paid for putting in low-income housing,” McCormick said. Bend and other cities have learned from past failures and now build subsidized housing so it fits in with neighborhoods, said Campbell, a current city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop in downtown Bend. She said she wished she could get all Bend residents who are concerned about affordable housing projects on a bus tour to look at the projects the city’s already completed. “I think most of our citizens would be surprised to find out they are already living near affordable housing,” she said. “We’ve done a remarkable job of making those types of housing fit into neighborhoods.” Transportation State law requires Bend to reduce how many miles vehicles travel, and there are several ways to do that, Goodman-Campbell said. One way is by making sure Bend residents have access to amenities like grocery stores in their neighborhoods, so they’re able to safely walk, bike or drive a short distance instead of driving across town, she said. “If their car breaks down, a lot of people don’t have ways to get around town,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell both talked about how advances in street-light technology can help traffic. Smart traffic signals and route-finding apps that advise drivers to take less congested routes help create capacity without widening streets, Campbell said. McCormick and Davis, meanwhile, said they supported a pilot program near Oregon State University-Cascades that will test subsidizing ride-hailing services in place of a bus route that was canceled this summer because of low ridership. Subsidizing ride-hailing rides is better for the city’s budget and the environment than operating buses, McCormick said, but she said Campbell would disagree because “she’s part of the protest with the bus union people.” Campbell, along with Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel, joined city bus drivers when they rallied for higher wages last month. “I’m really excited about having Uber subsidized in place of our bus system,” McCormick said. Campbell, who voted against the pilot program, said she doesn’t want the city to work with companies like Uber and Lyft because their rating system allows for discrimination. “Subsidizing Uber with tax money? No, thank you,” she said. Sewer Campbell and Goodman-Campbell agreed that the city as a whole and the hundreds of homeowners who will have to connect to Bend’s sewer lines should split the costs of connection. A current suggestion from a city committee made up mostly of people who live in a southeast Bend neighborhood near a new city sewer line would cap the connection costs for homeowners at $25,000, instead of the $100,000 or more some homeowners would have to pay without city intervention. The committee’s suggestion also would create financing options that would spread the cost over years and create a safety net for people who can’t afford to connect. A fee of $25,000 is still too much, Davis said. “To someone who is retired and drawing on Social Security, that number might as well be $1 million,” he said. He said the city should keep looking at financing options and make sure everyone contributes to the cost. McCormick, meanwhile, said its the city’s responsibility to take care of its residents and homeowners shouldn’t have to pay $25,000. “The city needs to get back to the drawing board,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin."

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The SEC charges against Ladenburg Thalmann’s primary shareholder will not affect access to capital for its 4,300-advisor independent broker-dealer network, CEO Dick Lampen says. Phillip Frost retired from the Miami-based firm’s board on Sept. 20, two weeks after the SEC accused him of involvement with a $27 million pump-and-dump scheme. In addition to the network of five IBDs, Ladenburg’s subsidiaries also include its 139-year old investment bank, an asset management unit, an insurance brokerage and a trust division. The company’s various entities hold $250 million in cash with a book value above $390 million, Lampen noted in a statement. Ladenburg is “very pleased about how well-positioned our company is today for continued industry leadership,” he said, noting it also has $600 million “in permanent capital and long-term investment-grade notes” raised in the past five years. “With access to significant capital resources,” Lampen added, “Ladenburg will continue to explore opportunities for growth, including growth through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunities present themselves.” Frost controls about 35% of the company, according to Barrington Research Associates, the sole analysts currently listed as covering the stock. He owns about 3.1 million shares directly and 67.7 million shares indirectly through two entities where he’s the trustee, an SEC Form 4 filing shows. Frost exercised options to purchase nearly $1 million worth of Ladenburg’s stock on Sept. 24, according to the filing. In a separate transaction, he had forfeited 45,000 shares in connection with his retirement from his role as chairman. In the second transaction four days later, Frost exercised his options and held the stock rather than selling the 600,000 shares valued at $948,000, or $1.58 per share. The options, which the company granted him in 2008, would have expired on Oct. 30. The SEC charged one of the stock-owning entities in which Frost is a trustee, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, in the pump-and-dump case. The other, Frost Nevada Investments Trust, is an affiliate of Frost Gamma, according to the firm’s $40 million credit agreement with Frost Gamma. In a civil case filed earlier this month in the Southern District of New York, the regulator charged Frost, nine other people and 10 entities with selling penny stocks at artificially inflated prices. Retail investors wound up holding “virtually worthless” stock, the SEC says. The billionaire dermatologist’s fortune, which stems from his legendary career as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, helped Ladenburg acquire its five IBDs between 2007 and 2015. Frost has largely taken “a passive role” with the IBDs, though, says recruiter Jon Henschen. Henschen sees the SEC case against Frost as much different from the accounting scandal which plunged former Cetera Financial Group parent RCS Capital into bankruptcy protection in 2016. “It has nothing to do with Ladenburg,” Henschen says. “They’re basically putting up a Chinese wall to shield them, whatever does transpire there. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s not going to involve Ladenburg.” Barrington analyst Alexander Paris reiterated the research firm’s “outperform” rating for Ladenburg’s stock in a Sept. 21 note following the announcement of Frost’s retirement. Paris set a 12-month price target of $4.75 per share, or roughly an 95% increase over its current value of $2.44. Paris noted that Frost had expressed confidence in Ladenburg’s outlook even as he stepped down, which “suggests to us that he has no current plans to sell or reduce” his stake in the firm. The analysts “can attest to his long-term and successful approach to investing,” Paris wrote. The sell-off following word of the SEC charges against Frost left the value of Ladenburg's shares at 60% of its projected 2018 revenue, according to Paris, who describes the price of the firm’s stock as a discount on the ratio of 1.3-times-revenue for shares in its “closest proxy,” LPL Financial. “We expect continued growth going forward, as Ladenburg leverages its significant scale and capitalizes on further consolidation opportunities,” Paris wrote."

The case, Pepe v. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. f/k/a BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, No. 2:18-cv-14091 was filed on September 20, 2018. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the company and certain of its officers were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate Cocrystal's stock price; (2) this illicit scheme would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (3) the Company failed to abide by SEC disclosure regulations; and (4) as a result, the Company's statements about Cocrystal's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, on September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Phillip Frost, one of the Company's directors and shareholders, and others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, Phillip Frost allegedly participated in at least two unlawful pump-and-dump schemes involving various microcap companies. After the lawsuit was announced, Cocrystal's share price fell from $3.74 per share on September 6, 2018, to a closing price of $3.16 on September 11, 2018—a $0.58 or a 15.51% drop.

Sep 28, 2018 @ 2:10 pm By Bruce Kelly With the Securities and Exchange Commission cracking down on penny stocks, Merrill Lynch recently told its clients and financial advisers that it is putting restrictions on the purchase and sale of a large swath of low-priced securities. ""To ensure we are complying with SEC regulations and protecting the interests of our clients, we recently made changes to our policy regarding low-priced securities,"" a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, wrote in an email. As a result, certain transactions may be subject to restrictions, trading prohibitions or other limitations."" According to a source familiar with the moves, as of July, clients were no longer able to buy penny stocks through Merrill Lynch, and by the end of September, will no longer be able to sell them through the brokerage. The stocks will still be able to be transferred to a different account at another broker-dealer. After Merrill informed its clients it was not allowing the sale of the securities and gave advisers and clients to the end of the month to complete the trades, advisers raised concerns about closing down clients' positions, according to the source, who asked not to be named. The changes in Merrill Lynch's stance come as the SEC continues to warn investors about penny stock trading and the risks of market manipulation and higher volatility. The SEC on Friday said it had settled charges against clearing firm COR Clearing for failing to report suspicious sales of penny stock shares totaling millions of dollars. As part of the settlement, COR has agreed to exit a key penny stock clearing business by significantly limiting the sale of penny stocks deposited at COR, which was fined $800,000 and neither admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Earlier this month, Dr. Phillip Frost, the largest shareholder of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., was charged with fraud by the SEC for his involvement in a pump-and-dump, penny stock scheme. At the time, Dr. Frost was the non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann. He resigned from that position days after the SEC's filed its complaint. The new restrictions at Merrill do not affect securities listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, the source said, but apply only to those on the over-the-counter market, which is also known as the Pink Sheets. ""Other firms are saying we don't want these securities,"" the source said. Two years ago, UBS Financial Services created a similar policy regarding so-called high-risk stocks, including penny stocks. According to Merrill Lynch, a low-priced security is generally defined as having one or all of the following traits: securities that trade over-the-counter, or OTC, at or below $5 per share and have a market capitalization of less than or equal to $300 million; securities labeled as ""Caveat Emptor"" by the OTC Markets Group; and OTC securities that have limited or no financial disclosure information available. ""Caveat Emptor,"" Latin for ""let the buyer beware,"" is a designation generally used to inform investors that there may be reason to exercise additional care and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security, according to Merrill Lynch. After September 30, Merrill Lynch clients who want to sell existing positions will face additional compliance reviews that could slow down the transactions. Regulators have increasingly made their views of penny stocks known. The SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis published a white paper in 2016 highlighting the risks of investing in over-the-counter markets. The majority of investors lose money in the trades, and losses worsened for stocks that were the subject of promotional campaigns and those that had weaker disclosures, the SEC said. CNBC first reported the changes in penny stock policy at Merrill Friday morning.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"What do you see when you look at this image? Tomás R. Guilarte asks his 8-year-old daughter Sofia this very question, curious about her young mind’s interpretation of this and several other pictures. They are all images of brain cells in culture he has brought home from work. Guilarte is dean of Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work and an expert in the fields of neuroscience and neurotoxicology. He is also a professor of environmental health sciences and cognitive neuroscience and imaging. Sofia tells him she sees a green octopus with bright blue eyes (upper left corner). He shows her a couple more, which Sofia says remind her of: 1) a galaxy, spreading itself infinitely 2) an orchid, due to its long curving stem, and 3) the roots of a tree, veining deep into the ground. 1) “A galaxy” 2) “An orchid” 3) “The roots of a tree.” Guilarte prepared the same activity for an attentive audience at “Beauty and the Brain: Connecting Art to Science,” as part of the Mixtape Mondays lecture series at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum. Mixtape Mondays features FIU faculty across disciplines, welcoming them to present their innovative research and studies in relation to art and the museum’s collection. Guilarte shared his research on the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants – such as heavy metals – on neurological and mental health. Presented with the colorful images of the cells, the room-filled audience gave similarly imaginative answers. Some said the “orchid” looked like a “chicken with a very long neck,” and the “roots” were reminiscent of the aerial view of a cityscape with its twinkling “lights,” which are actually synapses. Guilarte was excited to integrate art into the lecture, easing the understanding of these concepts by connecting notions that are seemingly unrelated. “I’m very visual. I see pictures, and just like the ones I showed, I begin to see shapes, animals and objects,” he said. “Providing an idea of the shapes and colors living within the organization and structure of the brain is a great way to communicate these ideas and connect art to science.” Tomás R. Guilarte This exercise, like any puzzle, is an excellent workout for the brain, one that Guilarte says promotes neuroplasticity (the creation of new neural connections) and neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells). And other studies also agree, proving that regularly practicing art enhances brain connectivity. But keeping our brains healthy is a difficult task when considering the cluster of harmful compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis. “We live in a soup of chemicals, we have to minimize our exposure and properly feed our brains,” said Guilarte. Because our brain’s susceptibility to injury from exposure to environmental pollutants is remarkably high, it is vital to prevent the loss of neurons and promote the growth of new ones. “As we age, neurons die, and many neurodegenerative diseases – like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s – are principally diseases of aging,” said Guilarte. “But we are beginning to understand how these pollutants can initiate and/or accelerate the disease.” Though the traditional route of adopting a balanced diet and exercise regimen along with not smoking is still highly recommended, Guilarte emphasized the somewhat unconventional yet impactful role of art – both its consumption and creation – in the birth of new neurons and their integration into brain circuits that can enhance learning and memory. “And though genetics matter, it appears art is exceptional for our minds and our longevity,” he said. So, the next time you stop by a museum, keep a few things in mind about art: it improves brain function, brain wave patterns, fine-motor skills, creativity, and our social and emotional development. It may now help us lead healthier lives too. Mixtape Mondays is hosted once a month at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum. For the museum’s event calendar, click here.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The two most prominent pharma companies on the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) and Opko Health, were largely responsible for the declines in the Tel Aviv 35 Index in the past three sessions. Teva fell 4.5% today, making it a 10% drop in three days, and bringing the company's market cap down to NIS 85 billion. Opko Health fell 6.5% today, for a 17% drop over the three days. Its market cap is now at NIS 7.9 billion. Perrigo, the third largest pharma stock on the Tel Aviv 35 list, remained fairly flat over the same period. RELATED ARTICLES IBI sees annual sales of $1.6-2.4 billion for Teva migraine drug FDA approves Teva migraine drug Analysts see growth on Teva's horizon Still too soon to talk about Teva's recovery document.write(ad_handler.google_div(article_banner_object)) The falls in Teva are attributed to two possible causes. The leading factor is apparently the recommendation by a panel of the European Medicines Agency to approve Eli Lilly's migraine treatment. Eli Lilly's drug works in a similar way to Teva's migraine drug, which was recently approved for sale and which is considered one of the two great hopes for the future of the company's innovative business, alongside its drug for Tourette syndrome. The migraine prevention market has started to become very crowded, and the race to the top is close. The first drug in the category, from Novartis and Amgen, was approved in May, and was given a low market penetration price. Teva's product was approved for sale in the US two weeks ago, and not enough time has passed to assess the difference in the pace of market adoption of the two products. Eli Lilly's product should be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the next month or two, and the positive recommendation by the European panel raises the probability of it being approved in the US. A fourth product by a smaller company called Alder has passed a Phase III clinical trial but there is still no target date for a response by the FDA. Against the background of the approval of its migraine product two weeks ago, Teva's share price rose 12% within a few days, but it has now subsided to the level it was at before the approval. This is a frequent occurrence for pharma companies that receive a drug approval that was expected: the initial enthusiasm passes, anyone who was only waiting for the event exits the stock, while those looking to the longer term start to take into account not just the glad tidings of the approval but also the challenges of the marketplace, which in this particular case are considerable. A competitor to Copaxone? The second factor possibly contributing to the weakness in Teva is the report by a new contender in the multiple sclerosis treatment market, TG Therapeutics, of good results in a Phase II trial for its product. The results look very promising, although the trial was carried out on just 22 patients, and it will be some time before the product reaches the market, if at all. It may be that by that time Teva's dependence on multiple sclerosis (with its flagship original drug Copaxone) will substantially reduce, but still, TG Therapeutics looks like an interesting potential competitor. As for Opko, the company is still under the cloud of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe of Opko CEO Phillip Frost and of the company itself on suspicion of share price manipulation. The affair broke on September 7, and since then the company's market cap has dipped 35%. It recovered slightly on September 14 when Frost publicly rejected the accusations against him and spoke out against the SEC for not having requested his response before revealing the investigation. The correction was short-lived, however, and investors now await legal developments. Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on September 27, 2018 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2018 The two most prominent pharma companies on the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) and Opko Health, were largely responsible for the declines in the Tel Aviv 35 Index in the past three sessions. Teva fell 4.5% today, making it a 10% drop in three days, and bringing the company's market cap down to NIS 85 billion. Opko Health fell 6.5% today, for a 17% drop over the three days. Its market cap is now at NIS 7.9 billion. Perrigo, the third largest pharma stock on the Tel Aviv 35 list, remained fairly flat over the same period. The falls in Teva are attributed to two possible causes. The leading factor is apparently the recommendation by a panel of the European Medicines Agency to approve Eli Lilly's migraine treatment. Eli Lilly's drug works in a similar way to Teva's migraine drug, which was recently approved for sale and which is considered one of the two great hopes for the future of the company's innovative business, alongside its drug for Tourette syndrome. The migraine prevention market has started to become very crowded, and the race to the top is close. The first drug in the category, from Novartis and Amgen, was approved in May, and was given a low market penetration price. Teva's product was approved for sale in the US two weeks ago, and not enough time has passed to assess the difference in the pace of market adoption of the two products. Eli Lilly's product should be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the next month or two, and the positive recommendation by the European panel raises the probability of it being approved in the US. A fourth product by a smaller company called Alder has passed a Phase III clinical trial but there is still no target date for a response by the FDA. Against the background of the approval of its migraine product two weeks ago, Teva's share price rose 12% within a few days, but it has now subsided to the level it was at before the approval. This is a frequent occurrence for pharma companies that receive a drug approval that was expected: the initial enthusiasm passes, anyone who was only waiting for the event exits the stock, while those looking to the longer term start to take into account not just the glad tidings of the approval but also the challenges of the marketplace, which in this particular case are considerable. A competitor to Copaxone? The second factor possibly contributing to the weakness in Teva is the report by a new contender in the multiple sclerosis treatment market, TG Therapeutics, of good results in a Phase II trial for its product. The results look very promising, although the trial was carried out on just 22 patients, and it will be some time before the product reaches the market, if at all. It may be that by that time Teva's dependence on multiple sclerosis (with its flagship original drug Copaxone) will substantially reduce, but still, TG Therapeutics looks like an interesting potential competitor. As for Opko, the company is still under the cloud of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe of Opko CEO Phillip Frost and of the company itself on suspicion of share price manipulation. The affair broke on September 7, and since then the company's market cap has dipped 35%. It recovered slightly on September 14 when Frost publicly rejected the accusations against him and spoke out against the SEC for not having requested his response before revealing the investigation. The correction was short-lived, however, and investors now await legal developments.

1015016,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 18:26 EST, 25 September 2018 | Updated: 18:26 EST, 25 September 2018 View comments Office politics: Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein Ructions at Goldman Sachs where outgoing chief executive Lloyd Blankfein’s new office irritates some of the bank’s New York staff. It’s claimed the palatial berth, where bearded Lloyd will roost during his new advisory role, is costing upwards of £350,000. Goldman insists the figure is less than £75,000 but either way it’s at odds with a recent expenses crackdown. One banker moans he had a claim rejected for a piece of fruit. Not a desperately happy ship, by all accounts. Barclays boss Jes Staley met with the Duke of York this week at Buckingham Palace, an opportunity no doubt for Jes to garner Andrew’s extensive business insight. The pair have a mutual friend in former investment banker and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who lobbied unsuccessfully for Jes to be made Barclays’s chief back in 2012 after Bob Diamond got canned. The job instead went to Antony Jenkins, dismissed by Epstein, not entirely groundlessly, as ‘an internal dweeb’. In-the-pink hedgie Crispin Odey remains scornful of David Cameron’s premiership, telling Financial News: ‘Once you met David, you realised he was going to do absolutely nothing. He was so unbrave.’ Will Dave bother to retaliate in his long overdue memoirs? They’re now rivalling the 55-year wait for Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, albeit without the anticipation. Debenhams’s retail chief Steven Cook yesterday appeared alongside his new menswear head Andrew Lepp, who warned journalists to expect an improvement at the ailing department store’s shelves in the coming months. Cook interjected: ‘Months? Month! Or you’re fired.’ He was joking of course. Or least we must assume. Outré Mr Cook has a shaved head, a Rasputin beard and that menacing look of a man who delights in strangling poultry. Comcast boss Brian Roberts is rumoured to be dropping by Sky’s headquarters today following his £30billion acquisition of the broadcaster. Certain pinko outlets have claimed the sprawling, West London estate is known as ‘Skyberia’. Oddly, nobody I know ever calls it that.

1053951,11/13/2018,,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Papa John’s International, Inc. (“OPKO” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: OPK) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, and index under 18-cv-23924, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons other than Defendants who purchased or otherwise acquired OPKO securities between September 26, 2013 and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are a shareholder who purchased OPKO securities between September 26, 2013, and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until November 13, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class.

Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here to join this class action] OPKO purports to be a healthcare company that engages in the diagnostics and pharmaceuticals business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) OPKO and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Phillip Frost (“Frost”), were participants in a “pump-and-dump” scheme designed, in part, to artificially inflate the price of various stocks, allowing Defendant Frost, among others, to reap millions of dollars in unlawful profits; and (ii) as a result, OPKO’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On September 7, 2018, the SEC issued a press release entitled “SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes”. The press release stated, in part, that the SEC had “charged a group of 10 individuals and 10 associated entities for their participation in long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock.” The press release named both OPKO and Frost as defendants. Following this news, OPKO’s stock price fell $1.01 per share, or more than 18%, before NASDAQ halted the trading of OPKO stock on September 7, 2018, at 2:34 p.m. EDT at $4.58 per share.

Sep 21, 2018 @ 9:54 am By Bruce Kelly Dr. Phillip Frost, who was charged this month with fraud, said Thursday evening that he was retiring as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. Dr. Frost and nine other individuals were charged Sept. 7 in a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit with participating in ""long running schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock,"" according to the SEC's complaint. Dr. Frost is the largest shareholder in Ladenburg Thalman, controlling about 36% of the broker-dealer's shares Along with his role at Ladenburg Thalmann, Dr. Frost is a well-known biotech investor in South Florida. Since March 2007, he has served as chairman of the board and CEO of OPKO Health Inc., a multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company, according to Ladenburg Thalmann's annual proxy statement. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network, which are home to 4,300 independent contractor brokers and financial advisers. Richard Lampen, Ladenburg Thalmann's CEO and president, will replace Dr. Frost as chairman. Adam Malamed, the firm's executive vice president and chief operating officer, will join the firm's board of directors. ""I have decided to retire from the Ladenburg board and will concentrate my efforts on OPKO Health and my philanthropic interests,"" Dr. Frost said in a statement, making no mention of the SEC's fraud charges. ""As a long-term shareholder, I am confident in Ladenburg's outlook and look forward to its continued growth and success."" ""Ladenburg would not be where it is today without [Dr. Frost's] many contributions, and his presence in the boardroom will be sorely missed,"" Mr. Lampen said. Some had been calling for Dr. Frost to resign, saying that the reputational risk he created for Ladenburg would only increase the longer he stayed with the firm. The SEC's complaint describes in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off what the SEC called ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges.
