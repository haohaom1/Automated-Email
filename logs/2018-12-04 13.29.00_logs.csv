Michael,Gordon,765,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article209626854.html,"By Michael Gordon April 26, 2018 10:09 AM Citing a technicality, the U.S. Department of Education has quickly closed an investigation into whether an N.C. college discriminated against a former student in part because she is white. Last month, the department's Office of Civil Rights announced that it was opening a probe of the student's assertions that she had been mistreated by Lees-McRae College on the basis of her sex and race. Her complaint to the OCR was filed in November. Less than three weeks later, the same office wrote to Lees-McRae President Barry Buxton that the investigation had been dismissed. The reason: The allegation of sex discrimination already is included in a lawsuit the former student filed against the Banner Elk school in March. The OCR told Buxton that it dropped the racial-discrimination part of the probe because while the allegation is not included in the lawsuit, it could have been.

Nonetheless, the former student's attorney said federal officials are bypassing a chance to fix a significant problem at Lees-McRae. ""The civil suit will address the wrongs done to our client,"" Durham lawyer Kerry Sutton told the Observer. ""By failing to proceed with their investigation, OCR has lost an opportunity to address the systemic problems in the Lees McRae Title IX process. That's unfortunate for the rest of the Lees-McRae community."" Raleigh attorney Katie Hartzog, who represents Lees-McRae, said the college should not have been investigated in the first place. ""This is a dispute between two students,"" she said. ""The college is confident it ... continues to afford both students a fair opportunity to be heard."" The legal fight arose from a 2017 sexual harassment complaint the former student filed against three of her peers. The accused students were either African-American or Latino and included a member of a prominent varsity sports team. After a hearing last year, a campus misconduct committee ruled that the male students did not violate the school's sexual harassment policies. Sutton says the decision drove her client off campus and led to a suicide attempt. In the federal lawsuit she filed last year, the former student claims the college's acted out of ""an improper fear"" that her allegations would spur a racial controversy across the 1,000-student campus, which is 120 miles northwest of Charlotte. She accused the school of violating its own Title IX hearing rules to accommodate the family and supporters of the varsity athlete, who is African American. After the female student appealed, the committee's ruling was overturned and a new hearing ordered. It has not been rescheduled. The Associated Press December 04, 2018 01:09 PM The National Republican Congressional Committee says it was hit with a ""cyber intrusion"" during the 2018 midterm campaign, and the breach has been reported to the FBI. #ReadLocal For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.
