John,O'Neil,1356,https://www.journaltribune.com/articles/front-page/judge-denies-old-orchard-beach-murderers-request-for-reduced-sentence/,"Today’s E-Edition | | Full Forecast By egotthelf@journaltribune.com | on August 07, 2018 Derek Poulin is led in the court room at York County Superior Court in this July 10 file photo. LIZ GOTTHELF/Journal Tribune ALFRED – A judge has denied convicted murderer Derek Poulin’s request for a reduced sentence. Derek Poulin, 29, is serving a life sentence for murder and a concurrent 30-year sentence for arson. At the age of 23, Poulin murdered his 61-year-old grandmother, Patricia Noel, by beating her with a golf club and stabbing her about 70 times in her Old Orchard Beach home. Poulin then set fire to the house where he and his father also lived. Poulin was described by prosecutors at his 2015 trial in York County Superior Court as an unemployed young man more interested in playing video games than a getting a job. In 2016, Poulin unsuccessfully tried to have the case appealed by the Maine Supreme Court, arguing that he had not had a fair trial in 2015. More recently, Poulin attempted to get York County Superior Court Justice John O’Neil to reconsider the sentence he gave to him in 2015. Poulin appeared at the court in Alfred on July 10, represented by attorney Chris Nielsen, for an oral hearing with Justice O’Neil. The punishment in Maine for murder is 25 years to life in prison. Nielsen argued the life sentence Poulin received was “cruel and unusual punishment,” as the court failed to consider Poulin’s young age and his mental health, as well as his lack of any prior criminal history. Nielsen said at the time of the crime, Poulin was only 23, and his brain was still developing. Nielsen said if Poulin was given a lesser sentence, he could leave prison and show that he had matured and become a better person. In court documents dated Aug. 1, O’Neil denied Poulin’s request, stating that his original 2015 decision did not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The life sentence given to Poulin was appropriate, he said. “This was a brutal murder involving multiple weapons and was perpetrated upon someone who loved the defendant and had provided him with a place to live,” wrote O’Neil. The series of “cold and calculating” actions after the murder, including burning Noel’s body and the attempt to destroy the crime scene by setting the house on fire showed Poulin’s lack of remorse, wrote O’Neil. — Staff Writer Liz Gotthelf can be contacted at 282-1535, ext. 325 or egotthelf@journaltribune.com.

Andrew,Davis,1354,https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/the-fugitive-harrison-ford-25-years-later/566729/,"The Harrison Ford–starring thriller represents the best of a genre that has faded: the character-driven action movie for adults. This movie was not supposed to be good. Here’s the plot: A middle-aged cardiovascular surgeon’s wife is killed by a one-armed man, and said surgeon is sent to death row. But his bus crashes on the way to prison, then a train crashes into the bus crash, then Dr. Richard Kimble escapes to go on the run with five U.S. marshals on his heels. This is literally the opening 20 minutes of The Fugitive. Not even the actors themselves were convinced The Fugitive was going to be good. Harrison Ford thought it would be his Hudson Hawk, Bruce Willis’s $51 million flop from 1991. Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the lead marshal, thought The Fugitive marked the end of his career. But then this action thriller, the one that was written off as quickly by its stars as its hero is by the law, became the third-highest-grossing film of 1993. And then it was nominated for seven (seven!) Oscars—including Best Picture. And then it actually won one of those Oscars (well, Jones did). Perhaps even more surprising is that this piece of $70 million popcorn amusement from the ’90s is still a cultural touchstone 25 years later, largely because action movies like it are so rare now. A year before The Fugitive arrived, its director, Andrew Davis, didn’t think much of the genre. “The basic underpinnings don’t have any soul or value,” he told The New York Times. “They’re totally incredible so you don’t believe them. They’re dumb stories.” He himself had worked with Steven Seagal twice and Chuck Norris once, two icons of black-belted brawn that sparred with Hollywood for a spell, until they were knocked out by the metastasizing blockbuster industry. As Ty Burr wrote in his 2013 book on fame, Gods Like Us, “To protect that opening weekend and the larger investment, the [movie] business needed stars to be inclusive rather than divisive.” This, he notes, was “one reason why there was a gradual move away from the bulging ’80s cartoons like Stallone and Schwarzenegger toward more believable Everyman action heroes like Bruce Willis in the Die Hard films.” And, though Burr does not name him as an example, like Ford in The Fugitive. The writer points to Ford as the first modern-star brand: “the action figure with attitude.” Whether as the rumpled and roguish Han Solo or the hunky scholar Indiana Jones, Ford had imbued the genre with sardonic sexiness. And by the early ’90s, he had appeared in no fewer than two thrillers—Presumed Innocent (1990) and Frantic (1988, as another Dr. Richard)—about men mixed up in crimes they were racing to solve. It was this man who eventually handpicked Davis to adapt the ’60s TV series The Fugitive after seeing his work in Under Siege, a film that prompted the Times to identify Davis as the “Director Who Blends Action With a Bit of Art.” “Does this guy ever quit?” one of the marshals asks toward the end of The Fugitive, and the answer is no—both for Dr. Richard Kimble and for Davis. For two hours and 10 minutes, this film does not relent. Not even for a cup of coffee (that scene was cut), not even for some shopping (cut), not even for romance (also cut). There is no hanging out here. Everything rushes. If it isn’t the actors, then it’s the camera with a Where’s Waldo? view of Chicago, the hometown of both Kimble and Davis; if it isn’t the camera, then it’s the swelling orchestral music. And the urgency is a good thing because every pause introduces a new threat—a passing cop, a skeptical doctor, a nosy guard. Even the exposition speeds by. The instigating murder itself, presented in slo-mo monochrome over the opening credits, unravels in concert with Kimble’s interrogation and his conviction, a simultaneous chronology that compresses time. As Matt Zoller Seitz wrote of The Fugitive on rogerebert.com last year, “The multilayered, at times prismatic way that it delivers information feels like an evolutionary leap forward for thrillers.” The Fugitive’s success relies as much on plausibility as it does on velocity. Despite the soaring set pieces, the film somehow manages to remain grounded in a kind of palpable reality. “It is just so nice to watch a movie about normal smart people instead of insane super geniuses,” The Washington Post’s Alyssa Rosenberg tweeted in 2016. And though the characters’ antics could scarcely qualify as “normal,” significant portions of the film’s budget were spent on bypassing CGI in favor of creating real sets—like for the train crash ($1.5 million) and the dam jump ($2 million). Ford also insisted on performing his own stunts despite having a double and being 51. That is him flying through the air as if to jump from a train (on ropes, but still), that is him standing on the edge of North Carolina’s Cheoah Dam (a rope attached to his leg, but still), that is him limping through much of the film because he tore a ligament and refused to treat it. And that is him acting the hell out of everything in between. “It’s the moments between actions that I think are really important,” Ford says on The Fugitive’s 20th-anniversary disc. With so little dialogue, the actor essentially resorts to silent-film acting, which is only buoyed by his hangdog handsomeness. “Rare among action heroes, Ford is believable both in control and in trouble, someone audiences can simultaneously look up to and worry about,” Kenneth Turan wrote in his 1993 Los Angeles Times review. Watch as Kimble, about a quarter of the way into the movie, painfully deliberates on the lip of that dam as U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Jones) points his gun at him, waiting for Kimble to surrender because, Gerard posits, there’s no way this guy would do “a Peter Pan.” Right before that, their positions are reversed when Kimble grabs Gerard’s gun in the confusion of the dam’s water-logged tunnels. Face to face with the marshal for the first time, the doctor points the pistol at his pursuer and proclaims, “I did not kill my wife!” Gerard, his hands up, half-kneeling in water, a look of bafflement on his face, responds: “I don’t care!” To this, Kimble issues a faint smile: Game on. While Kimble speaks through his actions, the man chasing him has all the best lines. Gerard was supposed to be a solo Javert-esque force, but Davis gave him an entourage to accentuate his leadership, and the result is some of the best banter in any contemporary action film. Jones, a Texan who graduated from Harvard with an English degree, had worked twice before with Davis, who knew Jones did a lot of rewriting and improvising. The cast—which was ethnically diverse because the director wanted to reflect the demographics of his birthplace—established their characters alongside Jones, coming up with dialogue on the fly. The four marshals include Jones’s right-hand man Cosmo, played by Joe Pantoliano, whom Davis told he cast because he needed “somebody who’s gonna have the stones to banter with Tommy Lee Jones.” Cosmo and the others highlight Gerard’s humanity and tenacity while also gift wrapping the film’s exposition in wit. One of the movie’s more frequently quoted lines, which Jones conjured the morning of the shoot, has him telling a marshal who claims he is “thinking”: “Well, think me up a cup of coffee and a chocolate donut with some of those little sprinkles on top, while you’re thinking.” Gerard and Kimble’s symmetrical relationship is enunciated by the film’s six editors (all of whom were nominated for Oscars). Each chase scene cuts back and forth between the two characters. Even when the pursuit lets up and Kimble is contacting old friends and crisscrossing Chicago to find out why his wife was killed, Gerard’s investigation parallels his. As the film progresses, Gerard’s affinity for Kimble grows, too. “What makes their relationship fresh is that it is constantly evolving,” Gene Siskel observed in his Chicago Tribune review. Twenty minutes before the end of the movie, a neat flip occurs in which Kimble goes from being followed to being the leader. He directs Gerard to one of the men responsible for his wife’s death—Dr. Charles Nichols, Kimble’s colleague who actually wanted him dead in order to cover up a failed drug trial. Another flip takes place in the climactic showdown where Kimble confronts Nichols: Kimble saves Gerard’s life, despite believing that Gerard is intent on taking his. In the end, the marshal escorts Kimble out of the building as his protector. Though The Fugitive established Chicago as the place to shoot, it’s perhaps more notable for being the best of a genre that no longer really exists: the character-driven Hollywood action movie for adults. As Davis told Mandatory in 2013, the industry has gotten to a point such that if a film “doesn’t have tons of eye candy where a 22-year-old in some other country can just enjoy watching it, then [it] hardly get[s] made.” This is the world of tentpoles and franchises and event cinema, a world in which everything must bow to the demands of accessibility. While “old-man action” movies like Taken and The Equalizer could be considered descendants of The Fugitive, they lack its character development. Those thrillers that are character driven—say, No Country for Old Men or Hell or High Water—are less popcorn, more art. The Fugitive acts as a placeholder for a time when adults could be entertained by action heroes without being condescended to (see Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, The Firm, Patriot Games), which is why many viewers who saw the movie as kids in the ’90s, and who are adults now, wield it as a nostalgic marker of taste. In 2015, the same year a Fugitive sequel was announced, the comedian John Mulaney released a special called The Comeback Kid in which he digressed mid-joke into an explanation of the original film’s plot. “Why does Kimble confront Nichols?” he asks. “Well, I know we all know this, but … ” And then he goes on to rehash it anyway because The Fugitive is the kind of movie that can be rehashed voraciously over and over and over again. Siskel watched it twice before reviewing it in 1993 and already wanted to see it again; Seitz saw it 10 times in the theater upon its release; and I have replayed it upwards of 30 times over the years. What I once believed to be a guilt-ridden affinity for a mindless puff of Hollywood excess, I now understand as an appreciation for a kind of modern-day moveable feast. As Gerard’s relationship with Kimble transformed, so too has mine. I thought I didn’t care, but I do. We want to hear what you think about this article.

Andrew,Davis,1354,http://www.kxxv.com/story/38826355/korean-war-veterans-honored-in-lubbock-on-purple-heart-day,"National Purple Heart day honors those who have been wounded or killed while fighting for America's freedom. On Tuesday though, Lubbock took a slightly different focus; reminding us as well about the 'forgotten war' and then men who remember everything. ""To our Korean war veteran who has endured the hardship of war and carry with them the horrors of the costs of freedom, whose commitment to the war against communist aggression endured that its evil traits never took root, freedom is not free,"" Benny Guerrero, Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said during the tribute. In history class, many are taught that the Korean War is the 'forgotten war'. Guerrero says, ""We mourn the loss of life, we mourn when our fallen, but our soldier truly dies when he's forgotten, and our job is to not allow you to forget."" Purple Heart Day is a day of observance that commemorates the creation of the Purple Heart Medal in 1782. It's awarded to those who were wounded or killed while serving in the U.S. military. Tuesday morning, attendees gathered at Lubbock Area Veterans War Memorial at 82nd and Nashville at 7:55 am to pay tribute to those who served. This year's ceremony is also special because of the recent homecoming from North Korea. 55 fallen soldiers returned to U.S. soil from North Korea for the first time in decades. These fallen Americans, as well as all Korean War Veterans were honored. The ceremony also payed tribute to Medal of Honor Hero, Lt. Colonel George Davis, who was killed in Korea. His body was never found. His grave marker is located at the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Davis is one of 431 Texans from the Korean War who were classified as Missing In Action. His son, Chuck, will be representing the Davis family. Chuck's mother was seven months pregnant with him when Davis was killed. She never remarried. Information on George Andrew Davis Jr. provided by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Chapter 0900: George Andrew Davis Jr. (December 1, 1920 – February 10, 1952) was a highly decorated fighter pilot and flying ace of the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, and later of the United States Air Force during the Korean War. Davis rose to the rank of major, and was promoted posthumously to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in ""MiG Alley"" during the latter war. He was the only flying ace of the United States to be killed in action in Korea. Born in Dublin, Texas, Davis joined the United States Army Air Corps in early 1942. He was sent to the Pacific Theatre after pilot training and flew in the New Guinea and Philippine campaigns, scoring seven victories over Japanese aircraft. He quickly gained a reputation as a skilled pilot and accurate gunner whose ""daredevil"" flying style contrasted with his reserved personality. Davis did not see action in Korea until late 1951. In spite of this, he achieved considerable success flying the F-86 Sabre fighter jet, quickly rising to become the war's ace of aces and downing fourteen North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet aircraft before his death in February 1952. During his final combat mission in northwest Korea, Davis surprised and attacked twelve Chinese MiG-15 fighter jets about to attack friendly aircraft in ""MiG Alley"", downing two of the MiG-15's before he was shot down and killed. Davis is the fourth-highest US scoring ace of the Korean War with a total of 21 victories. He is one of seven US military pilots to become an ace in two wars, and one of 31 US pilots to be credited with more than 20 victories. Copyright 2018 KCBD. All rights reserved.

Andrew,Davis,1354,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/arts-theater/article/Toby-Kamps-leaves-Blaffer-Art-Museum-for-job-in-13136117.php,"Blaffer Art Museum director Toby Kamps has resigned less than a year into the University of Houston job to work with one of the world’s leading commercial art galleries. He plans to leave Houston in September to become the director of external projects at London’s White Cube gallery in October. Kamps praised the Blaffer’s “extraordinary record and potential” and said the university’s Kathrine G. McGovern College of the Arts is a “great thing,” but he is the second director to exit the institution since it was incorporated into the college a few years ago. The job also included teaching. His predecessor, Claudia Schmuckli, held the job seven years before leaving to become a curator at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 2016. The Blaffer was rudderless for nearly a year. Kamps’ move takes him out of the non-profit world where he has worked for nearly 30 years. He’s been a major presence in the Houston museum scene for about a decade, including seven years as a curator at the Menil Collection and several before that as a curator at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston. He came to Houston after stints at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and the Maine College of Art’s Institute of Contemporary Art in Portland. But he also has wet his feet in the art market, overseeing the Frieze art fair’s “Spotlight” section in New York and London since 2016. Kamps will lead White Cube’s artist relations work, looking for exhibition opportunities in the public sphere around the world, as well as recruiting new talent. That work dovetails with “old, old interests” that have intrigued him since he wrote his honors thesis decades ago, he said. The gallery’s stable includes leading artists such as Anselm Kiefer, Theaster Gates, Mona Hatoum, Robert Irwin, Georg Baselitz and Doris Salcedo. According to ArtNews, White Cube is expanding globally, recently adding a New York office to its London and Hong Kong operations. “The offer came out of the blue, and things happened very quickly. It was a difficult decision but a fantastic opportunity that makes sense for me and my family,” Kamps said. He and his wife, Ina Kamps, have an infant son, Felix, who is not quite five months old. ArtNews adds Kamps to a wave of museum directors leaving the non-profit world. White Cube nabbed Eric Shiner from Pittsburth’s Andy Warhol Museum to lead its New York Office. Directors and curators from Paris’ Centre Pompidoux and the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland have also recently resigned to join for-profit companies. Andrew Davis, dean of the McGovern College, said he was thrilled for Kamps, who was instrumental in pointing the Blaffer’s programming in “interesting, compelling new directions that engaged not only with the current contemporary art scene but also with current issues facing our society and our world.” Davis said the college will conduct a national search for its next director. Kamps’ first shows for the Blaffer are up through Saturday, including a mesmerizing film trilogy by Anton Vidokle.

Michael,Gordon,1353,https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-b15d80ac-3cd8-4f83-8020-132031bb6103.html,"Good Tuesday morning. It's Election Day in Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Michigan and Washington state. Live results all evening on Axios.com. Situational awareness: ""Cars and trucks with electronic driver assist systems may not see stopped vehicles and could even steer you into a crash if you're not paying attention, an insurance industry group warns,"" per AP Auto Writer Tom Krisher. A new study from Morning Consult finds that for most major companies, there is no upside in discussing the president, Axios media expert Sara Fischer reports: Why it matters: Brands that stay true to their corporate values in messaging face less reputational risk than those that react directly to being called out by President Trump or his tweets. According to the study, only 30% of people will have a more favorable view of a company if it issues a positive statement about Trump. At the same time, only 32% will have a more favorable impression if it issues a negative statement. The big dilemma for brands is that they're being pulled in two directions when it comes to political and issue messaging: The solution: Brand experts tell Axios that there's a clear way to navigate the Trump trap — or being pulled into a politically-charged conversation with the president: Focus on long-term corporate values in response to being called out. What you think of Trump on immigration — is what you think of Trump. In our new poll, Axios' Stef Kight writes, rural voters are Trump's iron wall of defense: They give him rock-solid backing on his overall immigration policy, as well as his signature issue — his proposed border wall. The bottom line: Three months out from midterms, more than half of voters disapprove of Trump's immigration policies, support DACA and oppose building a border wall along the southwest border. The announced departure of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, one of the world’s most prominent corporate leaders, is ""a stark reminder that the absence of women at the very top of corporate America remains a problem,"" the N.Y. Times' Julie Creswell reports on A1: Legacy: Nooyi moved toward more nutritious products and limiting environmental impact — values she called “Performance with Purpose.” Female CEOs in S&P 500 ... Of 339 CEOs who have held the top job at an S&P 500 company for at least two years, only 16 — 5 % — were women, per AP. These remain after Nooyi's departure: ""The Mendocino Complex fire is now the largest wildfire in modern California history, scorching more than 283,000 acres and frustrating firefighters as it continues to leap across natural and man-made barriers in Lake County,"" north of Sacramento, per the L.A. Times: A handful of candidates with ties to the technology industry are on the midterm election ballots this year, Axios' Kia Kokalitcheva and Kim Hart write: The 2016 election seems to have shaken the broader tech industry into a political awakening, with tech company employees becoming more politically active, and some even forming organizations to put their skills to work, like Tech for Campaigns. Here are three of tech-rooted candidates, all of whom cited the 2016 election when we asked why they ran: Reality check: While these candidates can confidently sell the importance of STEM education, tech jobs and broadband access, they often lack experience dealing with constituents' other priorities. ""The U.S. moved to reimpose punishing sanctions on Iran and threatened even-tougher measures for later this year as the Trump administration sought to increase pressure on the Tehran regime to negotiate or step aside,"" the Wall Street Journal's Michael Gordon writes: ""Hours after Monday’s announcement, European officials registered their opposition to the new sanctions"": Trump tweets: ""The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!"" P.S. N.Y. Times Qu0te of the Day ... Amir Sherafari, who sells fruit and vegetables in Tehran, describing the atmosphere of economic anxiety as Iranians prepare for the renewal of U.S. penalties: ""Rick Gates — the star witness against President Trump’s former campaign chairman — admitted in federal court ... that he committed a host of crimes with his former boss, and confessed to stealing from him and others,"" per the WashPost's Rachel Weiner, Matt Zapotosky, Ann Marimow and Devlin Barrett: Why it matters: ""Manafort’s trial in Alexandria, Va., is the first to arise out of the Mueller probe and marks a major public test of that investigation’s credibility."" In the upcoming N.Y. Times Magazine, Mark Leibovich notes that when House Speaker Paul Ryan announced in April that he wouldn't seek re-election, he was ""ending a 20-year run in Congress that, for most of it, seemed to be on a straight-up trajectory"": Leibo was there when Ryan got a call from President Trump. ""The president saw me on 'Fox & Friends,'"" Ryan said after stepping out. ""He said he thought I looked good. ... That happens to me a lot,” Ryan added, referring to his post-TV attaboy. Ryan to Leibo: Worthy of your time. ""Paul D. Laxalt, a United States senator and close friend of Ronald Reagan’s whose insights aided his presidential campaigns and presidency, died Monday in McLean, Va. He was 96,"" the great Adam Clymer writes for the N.Y. Times: Reno Gazette Journal's Siobhan McAndrew: ""Laxalt and Reagan ... teamed up in 1976 when Reagan ran as an insurgent candidate against Republican President Gerald Ford. Laxalt chaired the campaign."" ""In the year since the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville [anniversary is Sunday], about 75 Confederate memorials have been renamed or removed from public places across the nation, according to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group,"" per USA Today's Rick Hampson: ""But today, the law center's list of public Confederate memorials — monuments, place names, symbols, holidays — is 237 entries longer, at 1,740, than in 2016.""

Michael,Gordon,1353,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/07/gold-coast-titans-v-penrith-panthers-round-22-preview/,"MATCH PREVIEW It's a massive week for Penrith following the departure of coach Anthony Griffin, with Cameron Ciraldo taking over for his first game as caretaker coach this week. You can look at the Panthers' uncanny knack for stealing games at the death two ways - they are premiership pretenders who will get smoked if they play like that in the finals, or they have unshakeable faith in each other and can never be counted out. Whatever the case, the Panthers need to start sparing a thought for their fans who are sick of biting their fingernails almost every week. Last week's comeback win over the Raiders was Penrith's 13th of the season and put them right back in the top four frame. This is a game they have to win if they are serious about clinching a home final. The Titans hammered the Warriors a fortnight ago but didn't back it up last week against the Eels. However, they've shown they are capable of matching it with top eight teams and can never be underestimated. Round 22 - Round 22 - Saturday 11 Aug Home Team Titans Away Team Panthers Venue: Cbus Super Stadium Match broadcasters: Key match-up: Garth Brennan might be in his rookie season but he will go into Saturday's clash with an edge in experience over newly-named Panthers coach Ciraldo. Brennan has to come up with an effective game plan and get his players to stick to it for 80 minutes rather than 40 or 50. Ciraldo will no doubt be a little nervous but should be relishing the opportunity to take over a finals-bound team less than a month out from September. For the Titans to win: After a poor effort against the Eels last week, the Titans need to find some mental toughness and staying power. If the forwards can get over the top of their Penrith counterparts un upset is certainly not out of the question. For the Panthers to win: Quite often a coaching change coincides with a victory, but the Panthers sacked Griffin after wins in their past two games, though both were come-from-behind heart-stoppers. They need to tighten up defensively after conceding 55 points in both those wins. Titans Stat Attack: Michael Gordon isn't a young pup anymore but he remains one of the game's best ""backer-uppers"". Gordon leads the NRL with 554 support play runs - 74 more than his nearest rival James Tedesco. On the negative side, halfback Ash Taylor is the equal leader in errors (33) with Gareth Widdop. Panthers Stat Attack: James Maloney knows he has a reputation for missing tackles, but imagine if he ends up with double the amount of misses of any other player in the competition when the regular season wraps up in four weeks. Maloney has 137 missed tackles in 2018, while Ben Hunt is the next worst offender with 88. And another thing: Trent Merrin will be hoping to be back in favour now that Griffin has exited, especially as it will be his 200th NRL game. Merrin has been used off the bench lately but there's plenty of people at Panther-land who believe he should be starting and playing more minutes than he has been. It'll be interesting to see how Merrin is used by Ciraldo. Round 22 - Round 22 - Saturday 11 Aug Home Team Titans Away Team Panthers Venue:Cbus Super Stadium 6 1 2 3 19 4 5 21 6 7 8 16 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 17 19 Titans: Kane Elgey is finally back in first grade, promoted from the reserves to a starting five-eighth role. AJ Brimson shifts to fullback, with Michael Gordon out of the side. Brenko Lee is also out, replaced in the centres by Brendan Elliot. Keegan Hipgrave returns in the second row, pushing Will Matthews to the bench. Jai Whitbread was dropped an hour before kick-off. Panthers: Reagan Campbell-Gillard is back in the starting line-up, but on the downside the Panthers have lost James Tamou. Moses Leota will start at prop alongside RCG, with Jack Hetherington on the bench. Kaide Ellis and Christian Crichton were the last players cut an hour before kick-off. Head-to-head: Played 17; Panthers 11 wins, Titans 6 winsPrevious result: Panthers won 35-12 at Panthers Stadium in round 6Points per game: Titans 19; Panthers 22.5Points conceded per game: Titans 24.6; Panthers 18.7Televised: Live on Fox League Petero Civoniceva's prediction: It has been a massive week at Penrith but I don't think the change of coach will disrupt the team. They know they have to start building momentum for the finals and this is a crucial clash with just four games to play. If anything the drama will galvanise the players and they'll come out firing.

Smith gives a couple great reasons why it was worth “painting his way up” to this event: Frank Montibeller, President of the NWR, reports that the group, based out of Helena, MT, currently has 38 members. Artists were invited to paint for the Quick-Draw event from as early as 7 a.m. to noon anywhere on the beautiful grounds of the Brinton. Residents, tourists, and others came up to view, to visit, and to vie for finished favorites. Tod Windsor, Marketing Director for the Brinton, shared what made this third year’s event even more appealing: Steve Cummings, Auctioneer from Sheridan County, announced to bidders that this year 25% of the proceeds from each sold item would go to the Brinton. Cummings auctioned about 35 items after guests had about 30 minutes to find their favorites. Have a news tip? Use our anonymous form to let us know.

Phillip,Frost,1351,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180807005413/en/Ladenburg-Reports-Quarter-2018-Financial-Results,"Highlights: MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL, LTSF) today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very pleased with our robust second quarter 2018 results with continued strong growth in client assets as well as revenues and profitability. Solid execution by our management team, together with stable equity markets and the increasing interest rate environment, contributed to our strong performance. Our focus remains on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.” Richard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All segments of our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter, with revenues of $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from the prior year period, and a 96.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $25.8 million. The continued growth of our nationwide network of approximately 4,300 independent financial advisors reflects our successful recruiting efforts of talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $168.0 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $75.2 billion, up 13.6% and 18.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to further drive margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.” Adoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (""ASC 606""). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Tables 3 and 4). For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $27.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $31.3 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $3.9 million, and increase in net income per basic and diluted common share of $0.02. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $58.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $65.8 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $5.7 million, and decrease in net loss per basic and diluted common share of $0.03. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company's net income as reported is greater than the net income amounts without the adoption of ASC 606 due to the following: 1) the timing of revenue recognized for commissions on future renewals of insurance policies sold is accelerated, as these future commissions represent variable consideration and are required to be estimated, 2) certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer are now capitalized and have historically been recorded as a period expense, and 3) forgivable loans to independent financial advisors are now amortized over the expected useful lives of their relationship period with the Company's subsidiaries; previously these loans were amortized based on their legal terms. For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Second quarter 2018 revenues were $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from revenues of $311.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.7% to $180.4 million from $133.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity, mutual fund and fixed annuities/insurance products, and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased by 8.9% to $122.6 million from $134.6 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the second quarter of 2018 decreased by 9.0% to $11.7 million from $12.9 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to a decrease in capital raising revenue and strategic advisory services. Also, service fees revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.6% to $27.6 million from $20.3 million, primarily due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs. Net income attributable to the Company for the second quarter of 2018 was $9.3 million, as compared to net income attributable to the Company of $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $0.8 million or $0.00 per basic and diluted common share for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $6.6 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The second quarter 2018 results included $4.6 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.4 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $2.2 million of interest expense. The second quarter 2017 results included $0.1 million of income tax benefit, $8.7 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.7 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company had revenues of $687.1 million, a 14.2% increase from revenues of $601.8 million for the comparable 2017 period. Net income attributable to the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $14.8 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $2.3 million in the comparable 2017 period. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $2.3 million or ($0.01) per basic and diluted common share for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $18.2 million or ($0.09) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $6.7 million of income tax expense, $14.6 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.2 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $4.6 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $4.0 million of interest expense. The comparable 2017 results included $1.0 million of income tax benefit, $17.5 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $3.3 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $1.0 million of interest expense. Recurring Revenues For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.1% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment. EBITDA, as adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, an increase of 96.4% from $13.2 million in the comparable 2017 period. EBITDA, as adjusted, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $46.0 million, an increase of 122.8% from $20.6 million for the prior year period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment and our insurance brokerage segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue due in part to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Client Assets At June 30, 2018, total client assets under administration were $168.0 billion, a 13.6% increase from $147.9 billion at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.3 billion, including approximately $4.0 billion participating in our cash sweep programs. Stock Repurchases During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 489,591 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 472,215 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.47. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $59.5 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.15. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,392,170 shares under its current repurchase plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.

Phillip,Frost,1351,https://www.compelo.com/medical-devices/news/opko-health-completes-enrollment-in-phase-3-study-of-somatrogon-in-ghd-children/,"We use them to give you the best experience. If you continue using our website, we'll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on this website. Opko Health has completed recruitment of patients in its global phase 3 study of somatrogon (hGH-CTP) in growth hormone deficient children. Subscribe to our email newsletter The company has used multi-dose disposable pen to deliver an investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon. Somatrogon is a new molecular entity, which maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone and can be combined with a C-terminus peptide to expand its half-life. The study is a randomized, open-label and active-controlled study designed to assess a weekly injection of the investigational long-acting human growth hormone product in more than 30 countries. Opko Health recruited around 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD in the study. The patients were randomized1:1 into two arms, including once-weekly somatrogon and once-daily Genotropin. According to the company, the primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks and secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. In addition, the children completing this study are expected to be recruited in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will secure somatrogon. Somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety in a phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon. Opko also noted that the long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is proved the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. The company secured orphan drug designation in the US and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. Opko Health chairman and CEO Dr Phillip Frost said: “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” Opko entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize somatrogon. As per terms of the deal, Opko has taken responsibility for carrying out the clinical program, while Pfizer will involve in the registration and commercialization of the product.

John,O'Neil,1349,http://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20180806/sanford-man-gets-10-years-for-scaring-wells-woman-to-death,"ALFRED, Maine � A Sanford man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter in York County Superior Court Monday, following a 2015 burglary attempt believed to have caused a Wells woman�s fatal heart attack. Carlton L. Young, 26, was originally charged with felony murder in connection with the March 2015 burglary attempt in Wells, in addition to multiple counts of burglary and theft. Young initially pleaded not guilty, but changed that plea Monday after reaching a deal with prosecutors. His plea included the counts of burglary and theft. Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday, with Young�s trial set to get underway Tuesday. Authorities say 62-year-old Connie Loucks suffered a fatal cardiac event after Young and at least one other suspect attempted to enter her home on March 22, 2015. �This is an unimaginable tragedy for my family. Not a day goes by that we don�t think about how terrorized Connie felt that day,� her husband Brian Loucks said in court Monday, with his daughter by his side. �I think the defendant is a coward and a punk and I hope his soul rots in hell.� Young�s attorney Amy Fairfield spoke on behalf of her client saying he asked her Monday �if this would end it.� �The final straw was he said it�s been going on for 3� years and the family deserves some closure,� Fairfield said, adding Young is sorry for the family's loss and �for any part he may have had in it.� Justice John O�Neil told members of the Loucks family that his heart goes out to them. �It�s just an unimaginable tragedy,� he said. Of the case, O�Neil said, �a lot of it really has to do with a person consciously thinking when they are involved in a burglary should they have been aware that someone could die as a result of their actions, even though they might have had no intention at all of ever hurting anybody. When you break into somebody�s house it�s a terrifying experience for the people inside and even if you meant them no harm there are consequences to your actions and these are the consequences.� Police said Young and at least one other returned to Loucks� Wire Road home on March 22, 2015 after stealing jewelry the previous day when the home was unoccupied. Loucks called police to report she believed the burglars had returned. She reported they were banging on the door and windows. Nine minutes after Connie Loucks� call, her daughter called Wells police, according to a police affidavit, saying she had been on the phone with her mother who was talking about two men being at her house when the phone line went dead. Officers responded and observed Loucks on her couch. When she did not respond, they forced their way into the home. Police attempted to revive Loucks, but she did not respond. The state medical examiner�s office determined Loucks had died from heart disease. Young was one of four arrested in a string of York County burglaries in 2015. Brian Cerullo, 28, of Alfred, Cathy Carle, 25, of Sanford, and Marissa Vieira, 26, of Sanford faced burglary and theft-related charges and all entered guilty pleas and have been sentenced. Young was the only person charged in connection with Loucks� death. Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery. © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Bob,Diamond,1345,http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-6020335/ALEX-BRUMMER-Barclays-finally-bounces-wake-Bob-Diamond-John-Varley-eras.html,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 | Updated: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 3 View comments Of all Britain’s High Street banks Barclays is the most intriguing. It has been through regulatory hell and back as a result of the antics of former bosses Bob Diamond and John Varley, and the effort to steer clear of a UK Government bail-out. Its choice of a Gulf rescue a decade ago, involving Qatar, left a stain which is not yet erased. Under the stewardship of former JP Morgan banker Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank. It has been helped by the Lehman legacy, which gave it a strong client base in America, but has not received unqualified support from Whitehall which has preferred Goldman Sachs and US banks for share sales, such as the return of Royal Bank of Scotland to the public markets. Under the stewardship of Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank Latest results suggest that, in spite of having an arm tied behind its back, Barclays is picking up momentum. A strong quarter for equities in the US saw revenues rise 30 per cent, ahead of some Wall Street peers, and the investment bank’s profits were up 17 per cent. That may not be enough to send activist Ed Bramson, agitating for a break-up of the investment bank, scuttling back to his New York burrow. It is not very helpful for the City and financial services that one of the big backers of Bramson’s outfit Sherborne is Aviva Investors. Indeed, Aviva boss Mark Wilson, who maintains Chinese walls with the investment management arm, is understood to have had his ear bent on the subject. The underlying picture at Barclays is starting to look healthy, with pre-tax profits before various conduct and litigation matters up 20 per cent at £3.7billion in the first half and the bank’s capital base strengthening. But, like other UK financials, it is suffering a Brexit draft. Big fund managers by necessity steer clear of uncertainty. Nevertheless, years of regulatory chaos and management upheaval mean that Barclays has been a serial underperformer. That should be an investment opportunity but not just for renegade, short-term investors in search of sugar rush returns. Brexit bonus The reality about the City and Brexit is that it has little to fear but fear itself. The latest scare story about the migration of Deutsche Bank’s derivatives trading to Frankfurt has left UK competitor, the London Stock Exchange, unfazed. New LSE chief executive David Schwimmer notes that its London Clearing House offshoot saw a 34 per cent increase in client clearing of euro-swaps in the last six months and says that support continues to build. City exports hit a record level in 2017 at £59.6billion in 2017, a rise of £3.6billion on the previous year, says official data just published. And inward investment into UK financial technology was the highest among the major industrial countries in the first half of the year, outpacing the United States. The main downer for the City is uncertainty about a future deal in financial services. There were hints from Brussels this week that something around ‘equivalence’ may be possible if the issue of a tribunal to handle disputes can be resolved. The concern among insurers is that, unfavourable weather in Canada notwithstanding, the Square Mile could be putting itself at a disadvantage. Trump is deregulating Wall Street while the UK is over-regulating, making it more expensive and bureaucratic to work in the City. The UK has been good at exploiting tax and regulatory loopholes which is how the Eurodollar market, followed by US investment banks, arrived here. At times it seems that a legalistic Financial Conduct Authority is fighting battles of a decade ago rather than dealing with the opportunities of being the global financial centre. Onwards and upwards. High off the hog A wonderful insight from Stobart of the way that some directors of public companies regard corporate funds as a personal piggy bank. Former boss and significant shareholder Andrew Tinkler may be a brilliant entrepreneur but it came at a heavy price. As we disclose today, court papers show that Tinkler spent £1m on helicopter travel, £51,399 on a horsebox and bought a £50,000 Range Rover mainly for his daughter’s use. How gallant.

Bernard,Osher,1337,https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/lifelong-learning-program-offered-at-sierra-college-allows-seniors-a-seat-in-the-classroom/,"August 3, 2018 Sierra College's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute offers a wide variety of courses in film, art, science, health and wellness and many more. All are designed to keep bodies and minds active. Sierra College is one of only four community colleges nationwide to receive an endowment grant to start the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. The institute is a nationwide program associated with over 100 university and colleges including Santa Clara University, Chico State, UC Davis and UC Berkeley. ""OLLI is probably the greatest little known gem of a program in our educational system,"" said Stephanie Ortiz, dean of the western Nevada County Sierra College campus. OLLI offers low-cost, no-credit, no homework, short-term academic classes to primarily seniors over the age of 55. Ortiz noted that numerous studies show an active senior citizen is a healthier and happier person. Moreover, she feels that the program is a fantastic activity as it ""keeps the brain simulated and allows you to meet and interact with many interesting people."" Interested seniors are welcome to attend an informational open house from 1 to 3 p.m. on Tuesday in room N12-103 at the Sierra College campus in Grass Valley. Those interested can meet instructors, fellow students and sign-up for classes. There are no entrance requirements other than ""an interest in learning,"" said Ortiz. Classes are usually one to three weeks long, there are no homework assignments and cost around $20. An example of a class offered by the institute is a three-week-long summer class (three Mondays for two hours each) on Frank Baum's ""Wizard of Oz"" and its relationship with the Presidential Election of 1896. Courses for the fall include: Introduction to Astronomy, classes on film, California History, Cornish History, First Ladies of the US, Irish History through film, Writers during WWI, Writers of the Klondike, book clubs, Tai Chi and more. Classes are also available in Placer County, Program Coordinator Shari Smith said. ""We've been around for about 15 years and our student growth is over 20 percent per year,"" Smith said. Nevada County is one of the fastest areas of student growth, said Smith, who has steered the program for the past 10 years. This year the program will be offering over 90 classes along with three field trips. All of the classes in Nevada County are taught on the Sierra College campus in Grass Valley and students are provided a parking pass along with access to the Sierra College Library upon enrolling. Many of the instructors are retired teachers or current Sierra College faculty and the program is constantly looking for new and engaging teachers in a variety of academic areas. The Bernard Osher Foundation, based in San Francisco, established these centers due to the belief that learning is a lifelong activity. Ortiz said she loves having seniors on her campus as it provides a great diversity and shows younger students that learning is a life-long endeavor. ""It also promotes the concept that Sierra College is a community college for everyone in our community,"" says Ortiz. Access to the OLLI schedule can be found on the Sierra College website or by calling Program Coordinator Shari Smith at 916-781-6290.

Phillip,Frost,1336,http://www.ptcommunity.com/node/44511,"MIAMI, Aug. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) has completed enrollment in the Company’s global pivotal Phase 3 study in growth hormone deficient children, evaluating a single weekly injection of its investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon, delivered in a multi-dose disposable pen. The somatrogon Phase 3 trial is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study taking place in over 30 countries. This study enrolled approximately 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who were randomized 1:1 into two arms: once-weekly somatrogon vs once-daily Genotropin®. The primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Children completing this study may enroll in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will receive somatrogon. Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) is a new molecular entity that maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone, fused with a C-terminus peptide to extend its half-life. In a Phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon, somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety. The long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is confirmed in the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. Somatrogon has received Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” OPKO has a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the development and commercialization of somatrogon. Under the agreement, OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing the product. About OPKO Health, Inc.OPKO Health is a diversified healthcare company. In diagnostics, its BioReference Laboratories is the nation's third largest clinical laboratory; GeneDx is a rapidly growing genetic testing business; the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test is used to confirm an elevated PSA to help decide about next steps such as prostate biopsy; Claros® 1 is a point of care diagnostics platform with PSA and testosterone as the most advanced in development.

Michael,Gordon,1335,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article216046425.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com August 03, 2018 05:54 PM In the parlance of dogfighting, a “head dog” is one that attacks its opponent’s head. A “keep” describes the weeks of brutal strength and conditioning training a dog endures before it enters the ring. “Rubbing” is what dogfighters call the practice of putting a substance on a dog’s coat that can kill or disable an opponent. This week, a judge gave Brexton Lloyd a descriptive term of his own. For the next year, the N.C. resident will be what’s known as a federal inmate. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Lloyd of Moore County was sentenced Thursday to a year and a day in prison after he pleaded guilty to his role in a multistate dogfighting conspiracy. “Dogfighting isn’t entertainment, it’s organized crime,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew Martin of Greensboro after Lloyd’s punishment was handed down. According to prosecutors, Lloyd, 54, trained, sold, bred and fought dogs in a shadowy ring stretching from the North Carolina Sandhills north to New Jersey and as far west as New Mexico. In March 2017, federal agents raided Lloyd’s home in rural Eagle Springs, about 75 miles east of Charlotte. According to court documents, they found 13 dogs, most of them lugging oversized chains. Many bore scars and sores. Several had damaged or broken teeth. Nine were puppies. All the water in their bowls was frozen. Lloyd, who lived on an unpaved, dead-end road, kept his pit bulls in pens or chained to trees, the ground or in one case, a car axle. He chose names like Stripe, Jeremiah, Humpback and Rupert, and kept detailed records of their pedigrees and fighting results, documents say. The raid uncovered a harness, “spring poles” and other equipment used to improve a dog’s strength and endurance or to strengthen its jaws, documents say. Agents also found a cache of medical supplies, which dog fighters typically use to treat their animals’ injuries outside the scrutiny of a vet’s office. Lloyd’s laptop and other devices contained numerous images of pit bulls mating. There were other photos of a dog chained to a treadmill, a pit bull with gaping wounds to its chest and shoulders, and a three-minute video of an actual fight inside a four-sided pit. According to documents, federal investigators stumbled onto Lloyd while they were wiretapping a phone linked to a convicted New Jersey dog fighter named Anthony “Whiteboy” Gaines. Agents say they overheard conversations in which Lloyd took part or was frequently mentioned. On Oct. 23, 2015, Gaines and Lloyd held a three-way call with Jason “Jay” Love, another purported New Jersey dogfighter in which they discussed an upcoming midnight dog fight Lloyd had arranged in an undisclosed spot. “After the match it will be perfect,” Lloyd said, according to documents. “It will take me seven hours to get home, girlfriend go to work at six, she ain’t even got to see the dogs when I bring them back all banged up.” In August 2015, Lloyd went online to find a fight, which under the rules matches dogs of the same gender and weight, documents say. He texted Love: “...bud of mine to hunt a 36 f for 2-5K ... u kn of any?” Translation: Lloyd’s friend wanted to arrange a fight between two 36-pound females for a wager of between $2,000 and $5,000, prosecutors say. During their raid on Lloyd’s home, investigators seized all of his dogs. To date, more than 100 have been freed and medically treated under “Operation Grand Champion,” a multistate effort to combat dogfighting. In June 2016, Gaines was among nine people from five states charged with dogfighting crimes. Sixty-six dogs were freed. The Justice Department says federal agents found dog blood strewn throughout the basement of one of the defendant’s New Jersey homes. Another defendant admitted to the court that his dog had died in his car on the drive home after a fight. In March, Gaines was sentenced to 42 months in prison.

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 1:59 pm (From the left) Friends Michael Gordon Lee and Amy Vik with Ashland’s new street piano located on the east side of Otis Park in downtown Ashland. (From the left) Friends Michael Gordon Lee and Amy Vik with Ashland’s new street piano located on the east side of Otis Park in downtown Ashland. Michael Gordon Lee and Amy Vik are eager to hear beautiful music coming from the colorful spinet piano now residing on the east side of Otis Park in downtown Ashland. The instrument landed downtown after the duo led an effort that connected them with several supporters, starting with Ashland Parks and Recreation Director Sara Hudson. “She was all for the idea and started talking to other people,” said Lee. Lee and Vik began the effort in spring after Vik visited a Minnesota city last summer and saw how a piano there added to its character. Unbeknownst to Lee and Vik, Craig and Anita Haukaas from Haukaas Law Offices were also pursuing the idea of putting a piano somewhere in downtown Ashland. Hudson got all four moving in the same direction. “Sara heard wind of this and was like ‘Hey do you know anything about this? You two should talk,’” said Lee. After talking, the Haukaases threw in with Lee and Vik, agreeing to provide financial support to their project, something Lee said was a pretty amazing blessing. “Then they even went to the effort of writing a petition and going to local business owners like Jackson (Kysar) here at Burger Barn,” said Lee. With Hudson’s assistance and connections to people like Ashland Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mary McPhetridge, Ashland Mayor Deb Lewis and others, Lee and Vik were able to address some concerns. “(Hudson) was sort of the middle person of like, if somebody with the city had a concern about vandalism or about theft,” Lee said. Armed with a plan and the petition containing about a dozen signatures, Lee, Vik and Anita Haukaas presented the proposal to the Parks and Recreation Committee in June and received the official green light to go ahead. Several donors had already come forward when Lee and Vik had put the word out that they were seeking a piano. So under the guidance of local musician Tom Draughon, Lee and Vik selected a piano belonging to Dan Beirl. The story behind the piano is that Beirl had originally gotten it for his son and daughter when they were small. They took lessons, played it for a few years, grew up and left the nest, but there the piano still sat silently taking up space. Beirl saw giving up the piano as an opportunity to help someone else and clear some space in his house. Once they acquired Beirl’s piano, Lee and Vik moved it to Schraufnagel's Auto Glass where Lee works. There they gave it an artistic paint job after business hours. After a few weeks and plenty of paint, the piano was moved July 21 to its summertime home in Otis Park. Lee said they are working with Hudson to try and arrange for the piano to spend the winter months inside the Bretting Community Center so it will still be somewhere accessible that people can play it. There are some special considerations to keep in mind with a piano that will be spending roughly half its time outdoors, Draughon said. “One is getting rained on … water and pianos do not mix,” he said. The area’s unpredictable climate and sometimes drastic temperature changes are another. “If I had a recommendation it would be to eventually put it under some sort of permanent or semi permanent shelter to kind of shade it and also keep some of the moisture at bay,” Draughon said. Rain already has posed a threat to the piano when a recent rainstorm demonstrated to Lee that his efforts to waterproof the cover had not been adequate. He speculates that it was a combination of waterproofing spray not being quite as water-resistant as he had thought and that perhaps a cover wasn’t put on tight enough. “There were some flat spots where the water could sit and absorb it’s way through so our keys got a little wet and they absorbed a lot of water and weren’t really moving for about three or four days there, which was scary,” said Lee. He hopes a new cover prevents repeat performances. Draughon, who previously agreed to help with the piano’s tuning and maintenance as his way of contributing towards the project, had a chance to get under the lid of the piano for the first time on Tuesday. “I had to do a lot more than just tuning,” he said. “The actual wood on the keys had swollen from moisture and they were actually rubbing up against each other to the point that they would not work freely and one of them was actually broken.” Lee said organizers now are looking for a small battery-operated dehumidifier to go inside of the piano and help keep moisture problems down. The piano now sits waiting for an amateur Billy Joel, Elton John, Doctor John – or even Chopin - to have a seat at the keyboard and start making music. “It’s been a lot of fun just seeing people playing,” said Vik. “You’ll drive by and you just see a bunch of people sitting at it … people you wouldn’t even expect playing it and they just like sit there and they have fun.” “I think it’s a really cool idea and I’m really glad they’re doing it and I think the paint job that they did on it is just amazing, it’s really a very cool thing,” said Draughon. “I hope that we can keep it in working order and make it be something that people can derive a lot of enjoyment from.” Lee and Vik said they have received a lot of support and are planning a grand opening celebration at 7 p.m. Aug. 10 and are seeking people who play the piano and any other instruments to join in the fun. “Anybody, skill level regardless, who wants to come down here and play piano or guitar or banjo or sing a cappella, if you have a choir that you’re a part of, anybody, we just want to get anybody to come down here and make music,” said Lee. If all goes well, Lee hopes more concerts and other events could be held around the piano in the future.

The rookie NRL coach was left scratching his head after his side's 28-12 loss to the Eels at ANZ Stadium on Saturday night, when they led 8-6 midway through the first half. ""If we were a race horse there'd be a stewards' inquiry after last week's performance compared with this week,"" Brennan said. Two players – Michael Gordon and Jai Arrow – were held up over the line, Konrad Hurrell lost control of the ball in grounding, and two players – Phillip Sami and Ryan James - crossed before officials blew their whistles for forward passes. ""We can't sit here and blame the referees tonight. We were our own worst enemy,"" Brennan said. ""It probably wasn't our night tonight. Our most consistent goal kicker in the NRL missed three – unlike him… that probably summed up our night tonight,"" Brennan said of fullback Michael Gordon, who has potted 58 goals in his previous 19 games. ""They [Eels] ran harder, tackled harder and wanted it more. ""Until our guys realise that the NRL is a tough game and you have to turn up every week, we'll have that inconsistency. That's the most disappointing thing about it. ""Possibly in the second half we created enough chances but the damage was done in the first half."" James also agreed the attitude was lacking in the first half and he blamed himself. ""It was the way we started… for myself I let Tim Mannah run right over the top of me. It's probably the softest try I've ever been a part of,"" the skipper said. ""It was disappointing to do that after what we did last week when we played so well, completed well and stuck to the game plan. ""This week we didn’t seem to be able to do it. Nothing really fell into place."" There is no seven days to find some solutions as the Titans host top-eight side Penrith at Cbus Super Stadium next Saturday.

Steve,Cummings,1334,https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/motor-couldnt-see-winning-grand-tour-remembering-geraint-thomass-barloworld-days-389292,"The 2018 Tour de France winner showed promise in his early days, but no one expected him to contend for a Grand Tour Geraint Thomas at the 2008 Giro d'Italia (Sunada) Geraint Thomas‘s first professional years were with Barloworld – the team saw he had a motor, but never guessed a Grand Tour win was possible. The Welshman, winner of the 2018 Tour de France, rode with Barloworld for three seasons, from 2007 to 2009, before joining Team Sky. “He was the youngest rider when we took him to the 2007 Tour. And he arrived second last. We didn’t know then he was going to win the Tour,” former team manager Claudio Corti told Cycling Weekly. >>> How Geraint Thomas won the 2018 Tour de France “He was a big passista, a strong motor, but no one was considering him for the climbs. It was only later when you had Bradley Wiggins transform and win the Tour that you thought something was possible. He was a big boy back then, how could he win the Tour?” The Italian/South African team registered in Great Britain and provided the road racing needed for his track programme and a launch pad to Classics and eventually to Grand Tour success. Via the federation, Corti signed several Brits including Ben Swift, Steve Cummings and Thomas. And he also had Chris Froome, then racing as a Kenyan. “In the 2008 Giro d’Italia, Geraint finished the last day 12th in the time trial. That showed his motor and his ability to recover in a Grand Tour. He wanted to give it a go and he did well. There was something there. That was a sign,” added the Italian manager. Geraint Thomas on the stage 10 time trial of the 2008 Giro d’Italia (Sunada) “His big thing in those years was always preparing for the track. Making sacrifices for him was no big deal. “He was always doing his training, always wanting to test the different equipment, and if I needed a rider for a race, I could call him up and he’d be happy to do it. He was easy to get along with.” The 2009 Tirreno-Adriatico remains in Corti’s head. Thomas crashed in the time trial and stayed in the hospital afterwards. Corti was there with his wife. “We waited with him and didn’t want to leave him alone. He needed tests and stuff. I remember because my wife was there, one of the few times she was along and we just sat there alongside Geraint,” Corti said. “No one knew, but the potential there. The same with Froome, but I’m happy they went on to win the Tour.” South African Robert Hunter won his only Tour de France stage in the 2007 edition that started from London thanks to Thomas’s help. “He was good, had a huge amount of talent and a motor, but he was about 10 kilograms heavier then,” Hunter said. “He was strong on the flats, helping me out in the sprints, but no where near to where he should have been climbing if you think he’d go on and win the Tour. “I remember in one Tour stage, he was the first guy dropped and sucked it up until the last climb of the day, joining the gruppetto right at the base of the last climb. “Most people would have called it a day after riding 99 per cent on your own, but that showed a lot of character right there especially as a 21-year-old. That showed me his character.” Cycling Weekly magazine November 15 2018 issue, on sale from Thursday priced £3.25 Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

We hope to continue to fast track riders and give them opportunities to step up and succeed in the tough world of professional cycling.” Meanwhile, Mitchelton-Scott have taken on Esteban Chaves’ brother Brayan as a stagiaire for 2018, moving him up from their development team Mitchelton-BikeExchange. Chaves will ride with the team at the upcoming Tour of Utah, having ridden the U23 Giro d’Italia, the Giro del Belvedere and the Tour de Bretagne this season. “It’s an exciting period for Brayan, and the Tour of Utah will be a good opportunity for him to gain some valuable experience racing with professionals and form another part of his ongoing development,” said sports director Matt White. “Racing at altitude in Utah will be similar to where he grew up in Colombia and that should be an advantage for him. The experience of racing at another level will be good for Brayan and he should come out of it in good shape for the second half of the season with the U23’s.” Cycling Weekly magazine November 15 2018 issue, on sale from Thursday priced £3.25 Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

Steve,Cummings,1334,http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/5128/michael-valgren-signs-for-dimension-data-in-coup-for-team,"Sign up for our newsletter Secondary menu Sections Dimension Data have signed one-day specialist Michael Valgren from Astana on a two-year deal. The Dane switches teams in a move to bolster the South African team's Spring Classics roster. Dimension Data announced the signing of Valgren on Friday with the 26-year-old set to leave Astana after two seasons. The Dane's reputation as a Classics specialist was truly solidified this Spring with victories at both Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and the Amstel Gold Race. Valgren also took fourth at the Tour of Flanders and 19th at Liege-Bastogne-Liege. Beyond the Classics, Valgren has also proved a useful tool for Astana during stage races most notably helping compatriot and teammate Magnus Cort to his Stage 15 victory at the recent Tour de France. Dimension Data will be hoping that the addition of Valgren to their roster will represent a change in fortune. The 2018 season has been relatively disappointing with the team, registering just three victories. Marquee names such as Mark Cavendish and Edvald Boasson Hagen have been blighted with injury and illness, failing to chip in their usual number of victories throughout the season. A young rider, Valgren represents a change for Dimension Data. Historically the team has relied on older, experienced European riders like Cavendish and Steve Cummings to take victories while supporting young, African talent which is filtered through the team. This model had begun to alter slightly with the previous signatures of Australian duo Lachlan Morton and Ben O'Connor and has taken another step forward with the surprising signature of Valgren. Team principal Doug Ryder commented on the deal and how it could be regarded as a 'coup' for the team. 'Michael joining us is a huge coup for Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka,' Ryder said. 'He’s been one of the stand-out riders in 2018, with his victories early on in the year backed up by really strong performances at the Critérium du Dauphiné and at the Tour de France. 'Michael signing is another step in our journey to the top of the sport, in particular, gives a major boost to our Classics campaign, where he showed such good form earlier in the year.' Valgren explained his move, mentioning both the opportunities provided by the team and the wider mission of the Qhubeka charity. 'I’m extremely excited to be joining Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka,' the rider said. 'It’s a big opportunity for me to go to a team that’s keen on really building its Classics squad. 'I really look forward to working with the guys on the team and I see a big future there for myself. 'I’m also really proud to join the team because of what it stands for: its mission to distribute bicycles through the Qhubeka charity. It’s a super-cool mission and I’m really looking forward to being a part of that.'

Andrew,Davis,1332,http://okcfox.com/news/local/yukon-man-arrested-for-his-second-dui-complaint-of-2018,"by Austin Prickett Andrew Davis, 30, was arrested Aug. 2 in Oklahoma City on a complaint of driving under the influence. (Oklahoma County Jail) A Yukon man has been arrested for driving under the influence for the second time this year. The Oklahoma City Police Department reports that at 5:30 p.m. Aug. 2 an officer was called to a collision at the intersection of Anthony Avenue and Reno Avenue. Witnesses on scene stated a black truck, driven by 30-year-old Andrew Davis, had rear-ended a vehicle which caused the vehicle to strike a car in front of it. Officers made contact with Davis and noted that he was unsteady on his feet and slurring his speech. Davis then was asked to perform field sobriety tests before being arrested by the officer. While performing an inventory of the man's vehicle, officers found several empty beer cans in the back seat. Davis was arrested on complaints of driving under the influence of alcohol and failure to devote full time and attention. Davis is listed as an employee of the Yukon Fire Department. The City of Yukon would not comment on the man's employment status. Canadian County court records show that Davis was arrested in January for a misdemeanor count of aggravated driving under the influence of alcohol. He is due for a court appearance on the matter in September.

Andrew,Davis,1332,https://www.motorsport.com/grandam/news/montreal-stevenson-motorsports-race-report/302112/,"Risky Second Pit Stop Fuels A Win For Stevenson In Montreal In the Montreal 200 Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series presented by Crown Royal Cask No. 16 race at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal, Canada, at least one GT Team Manager made sure his car had enough gas to go the distance. A risky stop for additional fuel during the second caution period led to a late win as the No. 57 Stevenson Motorsports -- BryanMark Financial Pontiac GXP.R, driven by Andrew Davis and Robin Liddell, passed the leading Porsche on the main straight just a few hundred yards from the finish line as the German marque coasted to a stop out of gas. Liddell was aboard the Pontiac as it zoomed over the line first in class, after passing a number of cars that had gambled and lost on the game of fuel mileage. ""I feel great now."" Liddell commented at the post race press conference. ""I felt pretty crummy about 10 laps from the end because we started to wonder if we'd done the right thing. I've seen in races like this, when the time is a little different, a few oddities appear. When I drove through during the end lap, the number of cars that ran out of fuel was pretty amazing. People take gambles that perhaps they wouldn't normally take. You try to come up with different strategies to win. For some people that plays out and for others it doesn't. But at the same time, it gives you an opportunity to do a good job. ""I must say the team did an excellent job today."" Liddell continued, ""Mike (Johnson) did a great job with the strategy. The guys did a super job in the pit stops. Had it run yellow for long periods, we would have not had that position at the end. To win is outstanding. We're over the moon. Hopefully we'll keep fighting for the championship in the last couple of races."" Team Manager Mike Johnson relayed his concern that, perhaps the late stop for fuel was a mistake. ""I knew we would be short of fuel if the race went green, but when the No. 57 and No. 70 (SpeedSource Mazda) were the only cars to come down pit lane, I was worried. With 5 laps to go, I began apologizing to the team that I cost us a good finish, but as the first car came into the pits with three laps to go, I knew we had a chance. We got beat by late yellows at Barber after leading most of the race, and this weekend we won because there wasn't a late yellow and after having only led for about a half mile. It just goes to show that it's never over until it's over."" Andrew Davis had taken the Pontiac from third on the grid into the opening laps with a pair of pesky Porsches in front. He was able to stay in the front pack of cars throughout his stint before turning the GXP.R over to Liddell. ""I couldn't be more proud of the Stevenson Motorsports team for this thrilling victory."" Davis commented, ""We worked very hard trying to maximize our progress with the plentiful practice time that we had on Thursday afternoon. The car was working nicely at the end of practice, enabling us to put the No. 57 Pontiac GXP.R up near the front on the time sheets. Despite the progress made, the crew stayed up very late on Thursday night making changes to improve the car further. Heading into qualifying, I was confident that we had a car that was capable of starting up front. We were able to place the car on the inside of the second row for the start of the race, and so began one of the most exciting races that I have been a part of in quite some time."" When the Stevenson car pitted, the pit lane wasn't as busy as you might expect during a caution period. By coming in when they did to add fuel the team positioned themselves to literally run away from the race leaders in the end. ""Mike Johnson made the call during the race to bring us in during a mid race caution period for fuel. It seemed like the right call, but we were surprised to see that most of the front runners opted not to pit. I was quite worried with about five minutes remaining because it looked like those in front were not running out of fuel. However, the last two laps were simply amazing finding us on the top step of the podium!"" ""This was a big win for Stevenson Motorsports."" Davis continued, ""The celebration in the pits was out of control, we were jumping up and down like mad men on the pit lane. We were in complete disbelief of how the race came to us on the final straight."" As a result of the team's success in Canada, Davis has developed a taste for competition outside the United States. ""We seem to do really well when the Rolex Series races outside the United States, so hopefully they will add some more international races to the schedule in the future."" The Montreal 200 was the 11th race of the Rolex Series 2008 season for the GT class. It marked the ninth time the No. 57 Stevenson Motorsports -- BryanMark Financial Pontiac GXP.R has finished in the top ten. In seven of those races, Davis and Liddell have stood on the podium, with three wins. With this, the third win of the season, Stevenson teammates Robin Liddell and Andrew Davis strengthened their third place standings in the GT Driver's Championship by reducing the gap to second to just six points. And they are now just 16 points out of first. The Stevenson Team also remains in third place in the GT Team Championship standings. Liddell let the rest of the GT field know the Stevenson Team is out to get the top spot in the championships when he said, ""This victory now really opens up the championship -- bring on the fight!"" The Grand-Am GT class next moves to the brand new Thunderbolt Raceway located in the New Jersey Motorsports Park complex in Millville, New Jersey. The race date is Sunday, August 31st. The Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series presented by Crown Royal Cask No. 16 includes cars competing in two classes, Daytona Prototypes and GT. The #57 Stevenson Motorsports Pontiac GXP.R competes in the GT class against teams running cars from Porsche, Ferrari, Mazda as well as the Ford Mustang Cobra. -credit: www.stevensonmotorsports.com Montreal: Southard Motorsports race report Montreal: TRG race report

Of course there is a full-fledged opera house only a few blocks north in the shape of the Four Seasons Centre. On the other hand, the Canadian Opera Company mounts only six mainstage productions there each year and, notwithstanding the efforts of Opera Atelier and other smaller-scaled producers, a city Toronto’s size can surely absorb more. Witness what happens in San Francisco, home of one of the three largest opera companies on the continent. A smaller city than Toronto, it already boasts a longer opera season without the help of the building across the street. The building across the street happens to be Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, where the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra does provide help in the form of semi-staged operas under the direction of its resident maestro, Michael Tilson Thomas. Works by Beethoven, Britten, Rimsky-Korsakov and Wagner have come to its stage under Thomas’s direction, culminating this season in a powerful presentation of the dark and brooding original version of what is sometimes called the greatest of all Russian operas, Mussorgsky’s Boris Godunov. Employing a largely Russian cast, headed by Stanislav Trofimov in the title role, with specially designed scenic and lighting effects, this was still something less than the kind of grand-scale production usually to be found on the other side of the street. It was also something more. As Joshua Kosman daringly wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle, “No operatic orchestra, not even in the ‘Ring’ Cycle that is unfolding across Grove Street at San Francisco Opera, ever got the kind of love from a conductor as the Symphony gets from its music director in projects like this.” Some orchestral conductors are anxious to take advantage of such an opportunity. Peter Oundjian, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra’s recently departed music director, was not. Although an able conductor of large-scale works for voices and orchestra, opera is not his thing. It wasn’t Karel Ancerl’s thing or Jukka-Pekka Saraste’s, either, to mention two other former music directors. And it was Seiji Ozawa’s and Andrew Davis’s, to mention two others. Few opera companies boast orchestras to match the quality of a major symphony orchestra playing in a fine concert hall. Even in Wagner’s own Festspielhaus in Bayreuth I haven’t experienced a thrill comparable to sitting almost alone, hearing the Cleveland Orchestra under Christoph von Dohnanyi in Severance Hall, recording Das Rheingold. Dohnanyi’s successor, Franz Welser-Möst, has continued the Cleveland Orchestra’s tradition of concert opera. I wonder how many opera orchestras could match its recent performance of Strauss’s Elektra. As experienced symphonic musicians have pointed out, accompanying an opera enhances their flexibility and accompanying skills. The Toronto Symphony Orchestra’s principal cellist, Joseph Johnson, looks forward to his summers heading the cello section in the Santa Fe Opera Orchestra. So it’s good for players as well as the public to have opera included in the symphonic season. Indeed, the same orchestra often serves the symphonic and operatic seasons in Europe, most famously in Vienna. It doesn’t always work. North American symphony seasons tend to be longer than their European counterparts and when Vancouver attempted an amalgamated orchestra, finding complementary dates proved unmanageable. So on this side of the Atlantic we usually encounter two institutions with a potentially overlapping repertoire. (The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra became an active concert presence under James Levine in Carnegie Hall. It’s good for opera orchestras to broaden their repertoire exposure as well.) In his book Subscribe Now, the late Lyric Opera of Chicago publicist Danny Newman argued that subscribing develops our appetite because we wind up exposing ourselves to works we might otherwise ignore. Symphony subscribers deserve that benefit. Oundjian gave it to them where contemporary music is concerned. He did not really give it to them in the musically rich repertoire of opera. The challenge lies before his successor, whoever that might be. In the meantime, Sir Andrew Davis, the orchestra’s conductor laureate and current music director of Lyric Opera of Chicago, is returning part-time in a caretaker capacity as the search for a new music director continues. Several years ago I heard him conduct his first performances of Wagner’s Ring Cycle in Chicago, a highly rewarding experience. This coming season he will give us a taste of that Ring at Roy Thomson Hall with Act I of Die Walkure, Jan. 31 and Feb. 2. It may only be a taste, but a taste is surely the first step toward developing an appetite. William Littler is a Toronto-based music writer and a freelance contributor for the Star.

James,Crook,1330,https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/you-shouldnt-wee-jellyfish-sting-1860611,"A Compass Jellyfish, also known as a chrysaora hysoscella was spotted at the Mount Batten Breakwater A large jellyfish with a ""nasty sting"" has been spotted at the Mount Batten Breakwater. James Crook pictured the Compass Jellyfish which has been identified by the National Marine Aquarium's curator, James Wright. Mr Wright said that the type of jellyfish is ""quite common in our water in the spring and summer"" and that the Compass Jellyfish is most common in the UK, Ireland and Turkey. You have probably heard more than once that if you're stung by a jellyfish that you should wee on the sting to take the pain away and reduce swelling. Or perhaps you've seen it in the Friends episode where Monica gets stung and Chandler and Joey are both left traumatised by the incident. But here is why you should avoid the old wives tale of urinating on a sore. Weeing on a sting is not advised by the NHS as there is no scientific evidence that it helps with the pain. It might even make the pain worse - aggravating a jellyfish stingers into releasing more venom. Sometimes the sting can be treated with vinegar, but this is also advised against by the NHS. If you're stung you should seek help from a lifeguard or soak the area in warm water and rinse the affected area with seawater. Last month, RNLI Lifeguards issued an alert to the public to be aware of Weever fish and to know what to do if you get stung by one. The venomous fish have spines of their backs and gill covers and come into shallow water, burying themselves under the sand - and if stepped on, the spine of the fish may pierce the skin, discharging the venom. There have been over 50 Weever fish stings across Devon and Cornwall beach in the last month, reported to the RNLI Lifeguards. Whilst it doesn't cause lasting harm, the ""excruciating"" pain usually lasts for around two hours, and becomes red, inflamed and swells up. On the British Sea Fishing website , it says: ""There may also be extreme numbness and in extreme cases there can even be localised paralysis for a short period of time. ""Usually the pain begins to subside after a few hours, and should be gone within 12 to 24 hours. Further complications will emerge if the spines have broken off into the wound, as they may need to be removed before the pain will subside."" The NHS website says that if you are stung on a beach, you should seek assistance from one of the lifeguards, or ask someone with first aid training for help. The RNLI Lifeguards Facebook post reads: ""Recognise this little monster? ""Last week our lifeguards reported 26 Weever fish stings across our beaches! ""This one was dead when we found it but we wanted to show you how small these little guys are. ""If you do get stung, come and visit our Lifeguards who are well rehearsed in treating these stings with hot water and perhaps some of their own Weever stories!"" Weever fish stings are best treated with as hot water that the affected person can handle for at least 30 minutes, or use hot flannels or towels. It is also advised if the spine is stuck in your foot that you pull it out with tweezers or the edge of a bank card - but do not touch the spine with bare hands. Whilst most stings from sea creatures in Britain are not serious and can be treated by a first aider, there is the odd occassion when hospital treatment may be needed. If you get stung at the beach you should find a lifeguard or first aider and ask for help. If help isn't available, below is a list of things you should do and avoid doing. For more information on what to do if you're stung, go to the NHS website, here.

Michael,Gordon,1329,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/03/gold-coast-titans-snap-up-teenage-storm-prospect-kea-pere/,"TITANS Gold Coast, a club building an impressive squad for the future, have slipped under the guard of Melbourne and secured another teenager of raw talent to join the likes of AJ Brimson, Phillip Sami and Moeaki Fotuaika. Kea Pere, an 18-year-old who can play in the centres or on the wing, impressed earlier this year with Easts Tigers in the Intrust Super Cup after playing for Queensland under 18s in 2017. A former Ipswich State High student, he is in the Storm system after playing Holden Cup last year for them. However, the Titans have snared him from next season to join a backline that is developing good depth with Anthony Don, Dale Copley and Brenko Lee re-signing last month to add to 2018 newcomer Tyrone Peachey, plus Michael Gordon, Konrad Hurrell, Brimson, Sami and Ash Taylor. Titans coach Garth Brennan received a tip on Pere and then received a glowing recommendation from the club's former football manager Scott Sattler, who is an ISC commentator for Channel 9. ""He's a very good player and they're getting him at the right age,"" Sattler said. ""He's a very dynamic centre. He has a lot of speed but also very good evasive skills but can also play a real power game. The way the modern centre is going to go, he fits that mould perfectly. ""I know Melbourne were very keen to keep him so to get a player from the Storm system is an art within itself. He's a tremendous prospect. ""I first saw him play last year and was impressed with his raw ability and aggression. Then I saw him playing for Easts Tigers in the Intrust Super Cup this year and, while he was a boy playing against men, he wasn't out of his depth at all. ""There's so much development in him, they're getting a blank canvas that is built on natural ability."" The Titans may be out of the running for the finals but they have had success in developing young talent in the past three seasons – most from the south-east Queensland region. Brimson has been outstanding at age 19, Sami – who may be suited to centre as he develops – has held his own on the wing this season and 18-year-old Fotuaika, picked up from an open trial, has been a revelation up front. Max King debuted last year at 19 in the middle and has developed into a must-pick forward for Brennan, as has 21-year-old Keegan Hipgrave, who has just re-signed, with former Broncos Jai Whitbread, 20, having debuted in round 18 while 20-year-old Kiah Cooper has impressed at wing/centre for Tweed Heads in the ISC. Yet the Titans have lacked an attacking edge out wide, an explosive player who can regularly break the defensive line. While Peachey provides that capability, whichever position the NSW Origin rep plays in 2019, Pere could also develop into that missing link. Don and Gordon are the only squad members over 30, with Ryan James only 27, his best years are still ahead, along with Maroons duo Jarrod Wallace (27) and Jai Arrow (23).

Michael,Gordon,1329,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/03/tyrone-roberts-on-gold-coast-titans-radar-after-opting-against-corey-norman/,"TITANS Tyrone Roberts is Gold Coast's preferred option to boost their halves next year after coach Garth Brennan said the club had put a line through Corey Norman as a potential recruit. NRL.com revealed on Wednesday that Brennan and the Eels five-eighth had held informal talks on the Gold Coast in June. However, the club's half-owner and long-time saviour Darryl Kelly has said publicly Norman is not the right fit for a club that has had to work hard to repair a tarnished public image. And if the Eels were willing to foot a good chunk of Norman's salary cap in 2019, the Titans would struggle to make room to accommodate his lucrative contract in the remaining years of any contract. And Brennan is known to have a preference to bring Roberts back if the ducks can line up with the cap. Brennan is just one voice on the Titans' retention and recruitment committee which includes Kelly, head of football Phil Moss, football manager Anthony Laffranchi and Titans chief executive Graham Annesley. The committee has knocked any move for Norman squarely on the head. ""That's the committee's decision, I respect that decision and we move on,"" Brennan said. ""I understand where the club is and the situation. He's a talented player, there's no doubt about that, but I said when I came here it's always club first and if that is the decision the football recruitment committee has made we move on. ""We have some exciting young kids in the system. If the right a player comes along that's going to suit the Gold Coast Titans we will look at that."" It is understood the chances of Norman linking with the club also took a hit on Thursday when he said in an interview with Sky Sports' Big Sports Breakfast that he did not want to go to ""a rebuilding club"". The highest-paid recruit in Titans history - Eels veteran Jarryd Hayne - will partner Norman against them at ANZ Stadium on Saturday night. Hayne rarely hit top form during his 22-game Gold Coast stint and Kelly and the power-brokers are rightfully cautious of ensuring they have the right fit when they spend big dollars. And Brennan doesn't disagree with that attitude. ""It is so important that you make the right decision on who you bring into a club,"" he said. ""We've seen clubs in the past probably pull the wrong rein, recruit the wrong person and the effect it can have on the club. ""Darryl Kelly is a very respected man and very astute in what he does. He is doing a fantastic job leading this club and we respect the decisions he makes and we move on."" The wide belief is Brennan would prefer Roberts, who is playing in the English Super League, returning to the club where he impressed in 2016-17 but there is not enough in the cap to make him a high-range offer. And complicating what the Titans can do is that they are three players down on the 29 required to be in place in the top 30 squad by the end of March 2019. It leaves somewhat of a conundrum that they want to entertain a top-line signing but also have to find some bodies on minimum wage - or shed players, which is common in the NRL these days. The club will give no indication publicly on which players may be under pressure. High-priced squad members Bryce Cartwright, Leilani Latu, Konrad Hurrell have spent varying time in the Intrust Super Cup this season. Fullback Michael Gordon will be 35 in September but his form has been excellent and he wants to play on next season to complete his two-year deal.

Sunil,Thakor,1328,https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/guj-girl-died-due-to-mr-vaccine-complications-alleges-kin/1362139,"Palanpur, Aug 2 A 3-year-old girl died today after falling ill in Gujarat's Banaskantha district, with her family blaming her death on the Measles-Rubella vaccine which was administered to her. Officials dismissed claims that she died due to complications from the vaccine. They said that she was administered the MR vaccine along with over 30 children and none of the others fell ill. A MR vaccination drive for 1.6 crore children, aged between nine months and 15 years, is underway in the state since July 16 under the aegis of the Union government's National Health Mission (NHM). Asha Devda, the daughter of a farm labourer, had taken ill yesterday and was rushed to the government health centre in Danta town where she died today, said officials. The family alleged that the toddler died due to complications due to the MR vaccine, a Danta police official said, adding that an accidental death report was taken in this connection. Chief District Health Officer Arun Acharya said that Asha was administered the MR vaccine along with over 30 children at an Anganwadi in Danta on July 31. ""None of the children, apart from Asha, fell ill. Two of her elder brothers, who were administered the vaccine, are also fine. Her body had been sent to the Ahmedabad civil hospital for post-mortem,"" Acharya said. Her death is the fifth in the state since the drive began. A four-member Adverse Effect Following Immunisation (AEFI) Committee, headed by the Deputy Commissioner (Immunisation) of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, had on July 28 said these deaths were not connected to the vaccine.

Mr Sylvester will be out in the Dalton, East Herringthorpe and Thrybergh areas speak to residents in the hope of gaining more knowledge of the matters which affect residents. His aim is that by learning more, he will become a more effective campaigner for improvements in the area. He is an open critic of Rotherham Council and has already questioned the way the authority operates, highlighting the fact the some councillors are often absent from meetings, that senior councillors have allowances in excess of those paid to colleagues doing similar jobs in Sheffield and that the authority has relatively large numbers of representatives for the town’s population size. The street surgeries start this weekend and covering the whole area will be a time-consuming process. He said: “It will take forty weekends to cover all three villages with the aim of getting opinions and viewpoints from every road and street. “I try and hold Rotherham Council to account but do so from what is my point of view. “Everybody has a unique experience and viewpoint that I can learn from and when you consider the levels of deprivation locally these tend to be opinions that are not represented well at any level of politics.” In advance of his visits, gold coloured leaflets are being distributed with residents asked to display them in front windows the following Sunday if they have anything to say, so he will know to call. The first session takes place on Sunday, covering Herringthorpe Valley Road, Cawthorne Road and Cawthorne Close and each week the sessions will alternated between the three communities he is covering. “I regularly tell the council what they are doing wrong, which is easy. But hopefully with what local people can tell me they can hear what’s needed in some of our currently least listened to communities.” ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

Andrew,Davis,1320,https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/tiny-blue-crystals-show-evidence-sun-active-youth/,"Enter your email to join the Sky & Telescope email list and download your eBook! Scientists studying microscopic minerals found in a meteorite have discovered evidence of the feistiness of the toddler Sun. By observing young stars, scientists have long guessed that the Sun had been active in its youth. Now, crystals in a meteorite provide direct evidence of the Sun’s energetic past. Illustration of the early solar disk, with an inset image of a blue hibonite crystal, one of the first minerals to form in the Solar System.© Field Museum, University of Chicago, NASA, ESA, and E. Feild (STScl) The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a spinning disk of gas and dust that probably extended beyond the present-day solar system. The disk started at out temperatures higher than 1700K (1,500ºC or 2,700ºF), but then it cooled, allowing the gas to solidify. Some matter aggregated to form planets, but some remained clumped into smaller rocks. One fragment of such a rock was the Murchison meteorite, which landed in Murchison, Australia, on September 28, 1969. The meteorite has been a treasure trove for scientists since its discovery. Now Levke Kööp (University of Chicago) and colleagues have discovered that tiny blue hibonite crystals inside the meteorite paint a picture of the Sun’s beginnings. The results appear in Nature Astronomy. Using a mass spectrometer at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, the scientists reanalyzed the meteorite’s hibonite crystals, many of which are less than 100 microns across. Hibonite, a mineral made of calcium, aluminum, and oxygen, solidifies at about 1700K and formed early in the solar system’s history. But high-energy protons and helium nuclei emitted by the active young Sun fragmented some of the atoms making up the hibonite, turning them into smaller atoms such as neon and helium. These atoms remained trapped in the hibonite lattice for billions of years. Because neon and helium are inert gases, they don’t tend to interact with other atoms or molecules, so their quantity in the hibonite hasn’t changed since the Sun’s early days. When Kööp’s group used a laser beam to melt the hibonite grains, they released the trapped neon and helium and measured their quantities with the mass spectrometer. “We didn’t know how much neon and helium we would see,” says coauthor Andrew Davis (University of Chicago), but “the amount that we saw was surprisingly large.” Because the protons and helium nuclei coming from the young Sun were very high in energy, most of them would have passed right through the hibonite, explains coauthor Philipp Heck (Field Museum and University of Chicago). “The probability that they would hit [hibonite atoms] was very small,” says Heck. “But the flux was very high,” he adds, and this resulted in the unexpectedly large measurements for neon and helium. The Sun is still emitting high-energy particles, but at the current rate, it would take about 100 million years to create the amount of neon and helium that the group found. That means that the Sun was more active in its youth than it is today. Although scientists have long had hints about the Sun’s energetic beginnings, “this is the strongest line of evidence in meteorites of a very active early Sun,” says Davis. David Kring (Lunar and Planetary Institute) is also hopeful about the results. “The evidence seems compelling, but will need to be confirmed with additional analyses,” he says. “I love these types of moments when meteoriticists are able to use nature’s rocky debris to paint new pictures of our Solar System’s origins.” How they actually know that this noble-gas-signal inside the hibonites was not generated by the galactic cosmic background. That background is an isotropic proton flux of in the Gigaelectron energy range. You must be logged in to post a comment. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Bob,Diamond,1304,https://newtelegraphonline.com/2018/08/union-bank-expects-to-accelerate-lending/,"Published on By Union Bank Nigeria Plc, the Nigerian lender owned by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara Limited, expects to boost lending for the rest of this year after a N64 billion ($177-million) writedown in the first half caused its book to shrink. UBN’s loan book will probably expand 10-12 per cent this year by focusing on consumer goods, agriculture, agri-processing, services such as education and health, transportation, manufacturing and small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Oyinkan Adewale said on a conference call on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg News. It shrank 9 per cent in the first half compared to the end of 2017 because of the write offs. The Lagos-based company’s ratio of non-performing loans to total credit will improve to below 10 per cent for the full year from 10.8 per cent in the first half and 19.8 per cent at the end of 2017, she said. The real estate industry accounted for about 32 per cent of NPLs, the CFO said. Union Bank recorded a profit after tax of N11.5 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2018 as against N9.2 billion posted in 2017, representing a growth of 25 per cent. The lender in filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) also saw profit before tax up 23 per cent to N11.7 billion from N9.5 billion in H1 2017. Gross earnings grew by 16 per cent to N83.3 billion against N72.1 billion in H1 2017, driven by a 10 per cent increase in interest income and 37 per cent increase in non-interest income. Net interest income before impairment was up by 14 per cent to N34.4 billion from N30.1 billion in H1 2017) driven by an improvement in net interest margins from 7.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent on the back of lower cost of funds. Customer deposits grew by 3 per cent to N826.7 billion in contrast to N802.4 billion in Dec 2017; reflecting 66 per cent increase in foreign currency deposits and the optimization of our local currency deposit book towards low-cost deposits. Commenting on the results, Emeka Emuwa, CEO said: “In the first half of the year, we have continued to see positive results from our efficiency and productivity drive. Across all our business lines, we witnessed strong underlying performance, translating into improved earnings. We continue to focus on the recovery of non-performing loans. “With the resolution in Q2 2018 of the large real estate exposure which was impaired in December 2017, the Group NPL ratio is down to 10.8% from 14.9 per cent at 31 March 2018 and 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2017.

John,O'Neil,1297,http://www.clintonchronicle.com/sports/time-year-coaches,"Blue Hose Name Handshoe Women's Lacrosse Head Coach; update - Athletic Honors Presbyterian College and Athletic Director Danny Sterling has announced the addition of Jenna Handshoe as the new women’s lacrosse head coach. She started in August, becoming the fifth head coach in PC’s women’s lacrosse history. “We feel very fortunate to have one of our own returning to lead the women’s lacrosse program,” said Sterling. “Jenna (Handshoe) brings a wealth of knowledge and experiences that will help make our program successful on and off the field.” Handshoe returns to PC after spending the last five years at Tusculum University where she was the program’s first head coach. The 2015 South Atlantic Coach of the Year, Handshoe led the Pioneers to a 32-34 record during her tenure. She also saw her team make the SAC Tournament and earn IWLCA All-Academic team honors all four seasons. “I am thrilled to be returning to PC as the women’s lacrosse coach,” said Handshoe. “Thank you to President Staton and Danny (Sterling) for allowing me this opportunity. I look forward to helping the program continue to grow, develop and compete within the Big South Conference and Division I.” In their inaugural season, Handshoe coached the Pioneers to an overall record of 10-5 and a conference record of 5-3 to secure a third place finish in the SAC. She was named the SAC Coach of the Year and saw her offense ranked 23rd in the nation with 13.67 goals per game. Tusculum boasted four All-SAC honorees that season, and Handshoe had four players named to the Athletic Director’s Honor Roll. In 2016, Tusculum won a program-record 11 games and advanced to the SAC Tournament semifinal for the first time in program history. That team boasted two All-Conference picks, one All-Tournament team selection and a CoSIDA Academic All-District first team recipient. Then in 2017, the Pioneers went 5-12 against an extremely tough schedule that included four matches against nationally-ranked teams, two of which were ranked in the top-10. Tusculum battled to earn a spot in the SAC Tournament for the third consecutive year, saw three players earn All-SAC recognition and had four players earn IWLCA Academic Honor Roll honors. In 2018, the Pioneers again challenged themselves with a grueling non-conference schedule, facing three nationally ranked teams. The team won a program-record four consecutive SAC games and earned a spot in the conference tournament for the fourth time. Handshoe had two players named to All-SAC teams. Prior to her time at Tusculum, Handshoe was the head coach at Tennessee Wesleyan College for two seasons. During her time with the Bulldogs, Handshoe posted a 17-18 record and led TWC to the National Women's Lacrosse League tournament twice, where they finished fifth and fourth. While at Tennessee Wesleyan, Handshoe served on the National Women's Lacrosse League Membership committee and was the Appalachian Athletic Conference chair for the Coaches committee. Handshoe started her coaching career as a volunteer coach at Presbyterian College in 2011. Prior to that, Handshoe was a four-year starter at PC from 2007-2010. She earned second-team All-National Lacrosse Conference honors in 2010 and was an All-Tournament Team selection in 2009. Handshoe led PC in scoring her junior and senior seasons. In 2010, the Greenville, SC, native led the team in points (49), goals (36), free position goals (8), shots (70), and shots on goal (60). Her junior year, she paced the team with 28 goals and 20 assists for 48 points. During the shortened 2008 season, Handshoe scored 15 goals over four games. In 2007, she was nationally ranked in NCAA Division II for ground balls and caused turnovers. Her freshman year, Handshoe also was a member of the PC women's basketball team. In the summer of 2007, Handshoe played with USA Athletes International in Prague, Czech Republic, in the Prague Cup International Lacrosse Tournament where she helped the team finish second overall. Handshoe was a key player for J.L. Mann High School during her prep years and led the Patriots to the 2006 SCHSL State Championship. She was named the Tournament MVP and the South Carolina Defensive Player of the Year. Handshoe graduated from PC in May of 2010 with a bachelor's degree in history and minors in physical education and athletic coaching. She then graduated with honors from Tusculum in 2016 with a master's degree in education and a concentration in human resource development. Handshoe is currently enrolled the doctorate of business administration program with a concentration in sports management at Lincoln Memorial University where she has one year left of classes before focusing on her dissertation. Pollock Adds Miller, O'Neil to PC Baseball Staff Presbyterian College head baseball coach Elton Pollock has announced the additions of assistant coach Blake Miller and volunteer assistant coach John O’Neill to the program’s coaching staff. ""Blake Miller and John O'Neil will have an immediate and positive impact on our baseball program,"" Pollock said. ""Miller will take over as our pitching coach and assist with recruiting, while O'Neil will take over with as our infield coach and assist with our hitters. Each brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from prior coaching stints at the Division I level. I am extremely excited to have them joining our staff."" Miller comes to PC from Inspiration Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he was the post-graduate program’s head coach and director of player development since August 2017. While there, Miller oversaw all aspects of running the program including player development, recruiting, budgeting and games. Prior to his time at Inspiration Academy, Miller spent four seasons as the pitching coach at the United States Air Force Academy. In his tenure with the Falcons, he helped elevate their pitching staff to new heights and several new school records. The bullpen collected a program-record 381 strikeouts in 2015 and then 385 strikeouts in 2016. The team posted a program-best 4.54 ERA in 2015, its lowest since 1979. That season, the pitching staff also held opposing batters to a .265 average, the lowest since 1974. Miller helped the program improve its win total from 16 in 2013 to 30 in 2016. Miller saw three of his players drafted during his time at the Air Force Academy. Senior closer Ben Yokley struck out 45 batters in 34.0 innings in 2015 and was a 29th round draft pick of the St. Louis Cardinals. Yokley went on to pitch for the Johnson City Cardinals, in the Appalachian League (Class A), during the summer of 2015. Then in 2016, juniors Griffin Jax and Jacob DeVries were both drafted. Jax was coming off a 9-2 season where he posted a school-record 2.05 ERA and was a third round selection (93rd overall) of the Minnesota Twins. The Cleveland Indians took DeVries in the 38th round of the 2016 MLB Amateur Players Draft. Prior to his time with the Air Force, Miller spent two years as the pitching coach at Savannah State. He was a part of the program’s historic 2013 season that included winning the school’s first MEAC Championship and NCAA Regional bid. Along with defeating two top-25 teams that season, the Tigers improved their win total from 19 wins in 2012 to 33 wins in 2013 and lowered their team ERA from 6.15 to 4.93. During the 2013 season, pitcher Kyle McGowin, under the tutelage of Miller, established himself as one of the best pitchers in the nation. McGowin posted a 12-2 record with a 2.02 ERA. He led the MEAC and ranked third nationally with 135 strikeouts that season. McGowin became the first pitcher in school history to be named a Division I First Team All-American (NCBWA) and win the MEAC Pitcher of the Year award. He was a top-10 finalist for the National Pitcher of the Year award and top-30 finalist for the Golden Spikes Award. Following his junior season, McGowin became Savannah State’s first pitcher to be drafted. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected him in the fifth round (157th overall) in the 2013 MLB Amateur Players Draft. In addition to McGowin’s success, Miller had two pitchers named to the MEAC All-Conference Team and saw five members of his pitching staff earn MEAC Conference pitcher-of-the-week honors. In addition, pitcher Rex Davis was named MEAC Freshmen of the Year in 2012. Prior to coaching at Savannah State, Miller was the pitching coach at Emerald High School in Greenwood, 2008-10. While at Emerald, the pitching staff set school records for team ERA in 2009 and again in 2010. Two of Miller’s pitchers were named to the All-Region Team and three players went on to pitch at the collegiate level. Miller holds a bachelors degree in history from Coker College. He graduated in 2007 after playing four years of baseball for the Cobras. A relief pitcher, Miller’s career record was 6-2 and during the 2005 season he set the previous school record for most appearances in a season with 28. Miller’s coaching career began at Coker when he was a student assistant during the 2007 season. O’Neil comes to PC from the University of Tennessee at Martin where he spent one season as an assistant coach. He worked with all infield positions, base runners, assisted with team offense and coached third base while also overseeing team travel, field maintenance and scouting reports. Prior to his time with the Skyhawks, O’Neil previously served as the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a member of the Mid-Eastern Atlantic Conference, where he was responsible for managing all recruiting efforts and overseeing team offense and infielders during the 2017 season. He served as the Hawks’ interim head coach from January 2015 through August 2016, leading the program to their most non-conference wins (nine) in 2016 and most conference wins (14) in 2015. Under his guidance, the program also saw its most wins over a two-year span (32) in over two decades. Not just focused on the field, the Hawks earned consecutive Male Team Scholar Awards for having the department’s highest team GPA and saw 25 MEAC All-Academic honorees. O’Neil also oversaw the program’s improved fundraising campaigns, playing facility, player equipment and community service involvement. O’Neil served as an assistant coach at Maryland Eastern Shore from August 2011 until he assumed the role of interim coach. In 2012, he assisted the Hawks to the most conference wins in program history and a third place finish in the MEAC Tournament. During the summer of 2011, O’Neil coached the Middlesex Rays of the Atlantic Baseball Confederation Collegiate League. He oversaw the expansion team during their first season with the collegiate wooden bat league. During the 2010-11 baseball season, O’Neil served as the top assistant at the University of the Sciences, which is located in Philadelphia, Pa. He helped guide the NCAA Division-II team to its most conference wins, first conference tournament appearance, first conference tournament win, two First Team All-CACC players, a First Team All-Region infielder and two All-Academic honorees. From 2008-10, O’Neil was the lead assistant at Colby-Sawyer College, a NCAA Division-III program located in New London, NH. He assisted the team to a conference tournament appearance while coaching three All-CCC players, an All-Region selection and two All-Academic honorees. O’Neil played collegiately at Colby-Sawyers College from 2004-08, serving as the team’s starting catcher and designated hitter. At the prep level, he received state awards as an infielder at Burrillville High School in Rhode Island. O’Neil graduated in 2008 with a bachelors degree in Exercise and Sport Sciences with a focus on Sport Management. In 2010, he completed his masters in Sport and Recreation Management with a focus in Coaching from New England College. P.O.

Andrew,Davis,1295,http://www.siliconera.com/2018/07/31/valkyria-chronicles-4-gets-new-prologue-trailer-in-english-and-localization-talk-from-sega/,"By Sato . July 31, 2018 . 8:00am Valkyria Chronicles 4 is headed Westward this September and Sega put in a lot of localization work that includes full English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish subs as well as full English voicing. Sega of America associate PR manager Jonathon Stebel and associate localization producer and lead for Valkyria Chronicles 4, Andrew Davis, took to the PlayStation Blog to dive inside the direction of the game’s English voice-over sessions. First, here’s the new Prologue Trailer: Here are some highlights from the interview: On the English voice-over recording process: Jonathon Stebel, Associate PR Manager, Sega of America: About how long was the English VO recording process for the game? Andrew Davis, Associate Localization Producer: We spent about 10 weeks total in the studio, starting with the untimed lines – VO with no timing restrictions – and then moving on to the Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR), the scenes where we match voices to characters’ lip-flap. We also had some re-recordings to fine-tune parts of the localization we wanted to improve. We kept the exact same team members present throughout the recording process to ensure consistency in the VO’s direction. Jonathon Stebel: This prologue cutscene starts with a black screen while Claude, the game’s lead character, talks over it. Since you record to match lip flaps, is it kind of a nice break for the team when you have a scene like this without any animation? Andrew Davis: In most cases yes, it’s nice to not worry about matching animations. However, Claude’s Japanese VO for this opening scene had so many extended pauses that it took a lot of work to match the English script and VO to the Japanese even without animation to worry about. We also had to consider the length of the subtitles for each spoken phrase; each line needed to be short enough in subtitles to look presentable, but the audio needed to be as long and drawn out as possible to match the heavy, deflated tone in the scene. On turning a Japanese script into an English voice-over: Jonathon Stebel: So, from what I can tell, this is a pretty extensive process. How does a Japanese script turn into an English VO? Andrew Davis: In general, we’ll provide translations for the English voice director, then the director has to slightly alter the lines in order to match them to character lip flaps. If we just used a direct translation or our first pass at a localized script, we’d likely end up with a script that’s very difficult to match to character animations. We want this to look as natural as possible, so we’d rather avoid the old English-dubbing trope of character animations being completely mismatched to their English VO. On criteria used to cast English voice talent and matching Japanese counterparts: Jonathon Stebel: What criteria does the team use in casting English voice talent? Do the actors’ voices have to sound like their Japanese counterparts? Andrew Davis: We’ll do our best in matching English voice talent with their character. Sometimes that means the English and Japanese voices will sound very similar – Claude is a great example of that – but other times the English analogue to a Japanese voice or personality won’t sound exactly the same. For example, Raz’s Japanese voice actor has a kind of deep growl to his voice – he’s a delinquent with some swagger. Trying to match this effect exactly in English might have come across as a bit too affected or ‘tryhard’, so instead we kept close to the actor’s natural range while making him sound like an American delinquent; he uses more ‘naughty’ words and a more aggressive tone to support his attitude. For reference, the original Japanese doesn’t explicitly have the phrase ‘Sack up, Commander,’ but it fit both his English characterization and (just as important) the lip-flaps. Jonathon Stebel: Claude seems to have an interesting split in his personality; throughout this prologue cutscene he’s brimming with confidence and ability, but towards the end he whispers “We can do this” under his breath, almost like he needs to reassure himself. What was the direction here? Andrew Davis: That’s actually a huge part of Claude’s personality! This is Squad E’s first *real* engagement – they’ve been training for a while, but they haven’t been a part of an actual battle until now. You’ll learn throughout the story that Claude has had to train himself to speak with confidence to rally his squad. Potentially a minor spoiler: you learn very early on that, just a few years prior, he was a massive coward. We really wanted his tone and lines reflect his growth mixed with his uncertainty in this scene. Jonathon Stebel: This is something I’m morbidly curious about – how much method acting is done in the studio? Did you actually throw a pen at Raz’s voice actor to spur his surprised groan in this cutscene? Andrew Davis: No. (laugh) We don’t abuse our actors. Sometimes, though, they spontaneously do movement or poses to get into character. Voice actors have to be careful, though, because professional mics are super-sensitive and can even pick up clothing movement. Or stomach gurgles!

Get more at UChicago news delivered to your inbox. By Kate Golembiewski Jul 30, 2018 Our sun’s beginnings are a mystery. It burst into being 4.6 billion years ago, about 50 million years before the Earth formed. Since the sun is older than the Earth, it’s hard to find physical objects that were around in the sun’s earliest days that bear chemical records. But in a new study in Nature Astronomy by scientists with the University of Chicago, the Field Museum and ETH Zurich, ancient blue crystals trapped in meteorites reveal what the early sun was like. And apparently, it had a pretty rowdy start. “The sun was very active in its early life—it had more eruptions and gave off a more intense stream of charged particles. I think of my son: He’s three; he’s very active too,” said study co-author Philipp Heck, associate curator at the Field Museum and part-time associate professor at the University of Chicago. “Almost nothing in the solar system is old enough to really confirm the early sun’s activity, but these minerals from meteorites in the Field Museum’s collections are old enough. They’re probably the first minerals that formed in the solar system.” The study examined microscopic ice-blue crystals called hibonite. Their composition bears earmarks of nuclear reactions that only would have occurred if the early sun was spitting lots of energetic particles. “These crystals formed over 4.5 billion years ago and preserve a record of some of the first events that took place in our solar system,” said first author Levke Kööp, a UChicago postdoctoral scholar. “And even though they are so small—many are less than 100 microns across—they are able to retain highly volatile noble gases that were produced through irradiation from the young sun such a long time ago.” In its early days, before the planets formed, the solar system was made up of the sun and a massive disk of gas and dust spiraling around it. The region close to the sun was really hot—more than 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 degrees Celsius). For comparison, Venus, the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures high enough to melt lead, is a measly 872 degrees Fahrenheit. As the disk cooled down, the earliest minerals began to form—blue hibonite crystals. “The larger mineral grains from ancient meteorites are only a few times the diameter of a human hair. When we look at a pile of these grains under a microscope, the hibonite grains stand out as little light blue crystals—they’re quite beautiful,” said co-author Andrew Davis, professor of geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago. When the crystals were newly formed, the young sun continued to flare, shooting protons and other subatomic particles out into space. Some of these particles hit the blue hibonite crystals. When the protons struck the calcium and aluminum atoms in the crystals, the atoms split apart into smaller atoms—neon and helium—which remained trapped inside the crystals for billions of years. These crystals got incorporated into space rocks that eventually fell to Earth. Researchers have looked at meteorites for evidence of an early active sun before, scientists said, but the evidence remained ambiguous. “We were finally able to establish a clear record because we studied the right samples—hibonites, which are very hard to obtain because they are so rare in meteorites—with the right instrument,” said Kööp. This time, the team examined the crystals with a unique state-of-the-art mass spectrometer in Switzerland—a garage-sized machine that can determine objects’ chemical makeup. Attached to the mass spectrometer, a laser melted a tiny grain of hibonite crystal from a meteorite, releasing the helium and neon trapped inside so they could be detected. “We got a surprisingly large signal, clearly showing the presence of helium and neon—it was amazing,” said Kööp. The bits of helium and neon provide the first concrete evidence of the sun’s long-suspected early activity. “It’d be like if you only knew someone as a calm adult—you’d have reason to believe they were once an active child, but no proof. But if you could go up into their attic and find their old broken toys and books with the pages torn out, it’d be evidence that the person was once a high-energy toddler,” said Heck. Unlike other hints that the early sun was more active than it is today, there’s no other good explanation for the crystals’ makeup. “It’s always good to see a result that can be clearly interpreted,” said Heck. “The simpler an explanation is, the more confidence we have in it.” UChicago graduate student Jennika Greer was also an author on the paper, as well as ETH Zurich researchers Henner Busemann, Colin Maden, Matthias Meier and Rainer Wieler.

Few musicians have such charisma and presence as Lang Lang, who only recently returned to the concert hall after an arm injury. The star will be coming to Melbourne for the MSO gala at Hamer Hall on July 4, performing Mozart’s haunting C minor piano concerto. And a superstar from another realm, physicist and popular media scientist Brian Cox, will narrate a concert in November, A Symphonic Universe, which also features the fine English conductor Daniel Harding, a close friend of Cox. Professor Brian Cox. This will be the final season with the much-loved Sir Andrew Davis as chief conductor, though he will continue to perform with the orchestra as a guest in future years. Two more of the orchestra's popular film concerts bookend the season, starting with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in early February and ending with Star Wars: Return of the Jedi in November. The Chinese New Year concert, East Meets West, now in its seventh year, is again led by composer and conductor Tan Dun, who brings with him Hanggai, a troupe of “traditional-meets-rock” musicians from Mongolia who employ such instruments as the horse-hair fiddle and two-stringed lute. Violinist Viktoria MullovaCredit:Foto Puck Among the exciting soloists joining the orchestra are violinists Viktoria Mullova, playing Sibelius in August; Vadim Gluzman, playing Tchaikovsky in July; expatriate Australian Ray Chen, playing Mendelssohn in October; and Lu Siqing, playing Bruch’s first concerto in the MSO season opener in March. Davis concludes his half-decade pilgrimage through the Mahler symphonies with the 10th (completed by Deryck Cooke after the composer’s death), also in March, interspersed with readings from letters between Mahler and his wife, Alma. The MSO Chorus is called into action for two of the greatest Requiems, both dramatic and sublime, by Verdi (April) and Mozart (June), as well as for Handel’s Messiah, reorchestrated by Davis in his final concert on December 7 and 8. MSO's outgoing chief conductor Sir Andrew Davis.Credit:Peter Tarasiuk “My sole aim was to clothe the work with all the colours available from a modern orchestra,” Davis said, using such instruments as alto flute, oboe d’amore, harp, marimba and sleigh bells. “I’m very proud of it, and I’m extremely happy that it will be the last thing we do together [with me] as chief conductor.” The opera concert performance for 2019 is Engelbert Humperdinck’s charming Hansel and Gretel, conducted by Davis in late November with mezzo Elizabeth DeShong as Hansel and soprano Laura Wilde as Gretel. Other intriguing offerings include a double bill of Stravinsky ballets, the anarchic Rite of Spring and Persephone, a collaboration with dancers from the Australian Ballet School, plus a double clarinet concert in which the great British soloist Michael Collins plays the much-loved Mozart concerto, then conducts MSO composer in residence Paul Dean in his own new clarinet concerto.

The oncology segment is anticipated to witness the fastest growth. According to various sources, more than USD $38.0 Billion is currently spent by the healthcare industry towards preclinical and clinical development of oncology therapy products. Hence, it is anticipated to grow at a lucrative CAGR and contribute over USD $15.0 Billion towards the clinical trials market by 2025. Advances in new treatments have made cancer a hot investing theme over the past 18 months, helping to power fresh interest in biotechnology stocks. Active companies in the markets today include: Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX), OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK), Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG), Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR), BioTime, Inc. (NYSE: BTX). Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX) BREAKING NEWS: Moleculin Biotech, a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oncology drug candidates, all of which are based on license agreements with The University of Texas System on behalf of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, today announced enrollment has opened for a physician-sponsored clinical trial of WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma and brain metastases in adults. ""We have been eagerly awaiting the beginning of this physician sponsored clinical trial,"" commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and CEO of Moleculin. ""The trial, which is now listed on clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, is now open for enrollment. This is our first investigator initiated trial of WP1066 and an important milestone. Given the unique potential of WP1066, we expect more trials to follow."" The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that can be given to patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous brain tumors or melanoma that has spread to the brain. The safety of this drug will also be studied. WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. We believe that targeting this pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells.

Jane,Powers,1293,https://screenrant.com/doom-patrol-tv-show-cast-crazy-jane-diane-guerrero/,"Diane Guerrero joins the cast of DC Universe's Doom Patrol TV series in the role of Crazy Jane. Guerrero is most known for her portrayal of Maritza Ramos on the acclaimed Netflix series Orange is the New Black, but she has also appeared in several other TV shows over the years such as Superior Donuts and Jane the Virgin. The Doom Patrol series is set in the same universe as the upcoming Titans TV series, both of which will debut on the DC Universe streaming service. Guerrero joins a cast that also includes April Bowlby as Elastigirl. Jake Michaels and Dwain Murphy were set to play Robot Man and Negative Man, respectively, in Titans, but have not been confirmed to reprise their roles in Doom Patrol. Following the events of Titans, the show will air sometime in 2019, but no release date has been given yet. Related: Swamp Thing TV Series Not Set In Same Universe as Titans and Doom Patrol According to THR, Guerrero will play the super-powered wild card Crazy Jane. The character has 64 distinct personalities with a different superpower associated with each one. Based on character descriptions thus far, it appears that Crazy Jane will be the show’s equivalent to Harley Quinn, with her mental instability and abusive past being the major components to her characterization. Though several members of the Doom Patrol will make their debut in Titans, Guerrero’s Crazy Jane will debut in the Doom Patrol series. In the source material, Crazy Jane’s powers and multiple personalities manifested as a result of sexual abuse. How exactly the show will handle this subject is uncertain, but it can be expected not to pull any punches if it's set in the same gritty universe as Titans. It will also require a very nuanced performance, so Guerrero will definitely have some big shoes to fill. It will be interesting to see how she tackles a serious role as Crazy Jane given that most of her experience has involved comedic acting. Doom Patrol certainly seems to be rounding out its cast with proven talent. Aside from the latest addition of Guerrero, the show is also reportedly hoping to cast veteran TV actor Kelsey Grammer as The Chief/Dr. Niles Caulder (the Doom Patrol’s equivalent to Professor X). On the creative side, the Arrowverse helmer Greg Berlanti will oversee the project, along with Geoff Johns as a producer. Clearly, DC is betting big on the success of Titans and Doom Patrol, adding established actors to their upcoming shows. With a number of exciting projects in the pipeline, the DC Universe will, hopefully, deliver the content worthy of a monthly subscription. Source: THR Tags: doom patrol

Michael,Gordon,1290,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/multiple-market-risks-week-make-predictions-tough,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. The week ahead is packed with multiple market risks, and economists say predicting the risk bias in interest rates is much harder than usual. The first major offshore event is the Bank of Japan meeting today. Markets are speculating the Bank of Japan will alter policy as a result of structural challenges posing difficulties in implementing current policy objectives. ASB senior economist Mark Smith said any changes would be interpreted as a step towards less monetary policy accommodation by market participants, generating higher yields. The United States Federal Reserve would release the outcome of its meeting at 6am Thursday New Zealand time. Craigs Investment Partners broker Chris Timms said markets did not see it as a ``live meeting'' where rates would change. The one in September was seen as the likely big week for central bank meetings. ``Finally, and possibly most interestingly, the Bank of England decision is out on Thursday evening and markets see a good chance of the BOE raising its policy rate from the current 0.5%.'' In New Zealand, the key events include the ANZ July business confidence report today and the second-quarter employment data tomorrow. Residential building consents were also due today. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said a sizeable fall in the number of consents issued in June was expected. The level of issued consents was still expected to remain elevated, supported by continued high numbers of consents for medium density homes in Auckland. The May consents were affected by a large increase in the usual stable standalone homes category. Like most other economists, Mr Gordon expected unemployment to remain at 4.4% when Statistics New Zealand released the June quarter figures. The second quarter reporting season continues in the US. Mr Timms said it was another very busy week in terms of the global reporting season, as 160 S&P 500 companies were due to report. Some of the higher profile global companies scheduled to report included Apple, Caterpillar, Shire, Ecolab, Tesla, Cerner and Berkshire Hathaway. With more than half of the S&P 500 having now reported results, 77% had exceeded sales forecasts and 83% had beaten earnings expectations. The overall earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was 21.3%, which would be - if maintained - the second-highest since September 2010, he said. In New Zealand, Green Cross Health, Evolve education and Oceania Healthcare were all holding annual meetings. Pushpay would release its quarterly update. In Australia, Rio Tinto, Janus Henderson and ResMed were all due to report results.

Michael,Gordon,1290,http://www.espn.com.au/nrl/story/_/id/24223596/sami-shows-best-inconsistent-titans,"You have reached ESPN's Australian edition. Stay on current site or go to US version. Phillip Sami's moment of brilliance against the Warriors was a sign of what Gold Coast can produce but Gold Coast can't be satisfied with one impressive half of football, coach Garth Brennan says. Sami scored two of the Titans' five second-half tries as they steamrolled a New Zealand side trying to lock down eighth spot on the NRL ladder. His first produced one of the highlights of the year, latching on to a Michael Gordon pass to break right then left and leave Warriors fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck clutching at air. Brenko Lee also provided some razzle-dazzle with a neat step to set up a try and an intercept to score one of his own for a Titans side out of the finals hunt. And teenager AJ Brimson brushed off a heavy concussion last weekend to have his most involved game in Titans colours, dummying on the way to a try of his own. ""I think he tripped over, think he scared himself, Sami,"" Brennan said of the winger's magical footwork. ""That was class. Roger's a world-class fullback and he probably surprised himself how well he did it and he's the kid that's getting better each week."" It isn't the first time the Titans have impressed, though, with Brennan rating the win alongside their defeat of Brisbane earlier this year. He said the challenge now for the 12th-ranked team was to back it up. ""Don't be satisfied with today's performance,"" Brennan said. ""There's a massive upside. We've had some heartbreaking times and performances not where they need to be (this season). ""It's important we don't get too excited about it.""

Andrew,Davis,1288,http://www.gainesville.com/news/20180728/students-get-backpacks-glimpse-of-safety-training-at-back-to-school-rally,"Andrew Davis, a school resource deputy with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, gave an abbreviated training on the ALICE method Saturday at the 19th annual Stop the Violence/Back to School Rally held in the Santa Fe College gymnasium. Parents shouldn’t be alarmed if their children attending Alachua County Public Schools come home during the first week of school with stories of how they are being trained to respond to active shooter situations. Part of the first week of school, which begins Aug. 13, will be spent training students and employees of Alachua County Public Schools how to use the ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) method to respond to emergency situations, especially those involving active shooters, said Andrew Davis, a school resource deputy with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. Davis gave an abbreviated training on the ALICE method Saturday at the 19th annual Stop the Violence/Back to School Rally held in the Santa Fe College gymnasium. “Listen to the deputy because what he is about to say could save your life,” said the Rev. Karl Anderson, founder of People Against Violence Enterprises, or PAVE, who sponsors the event in partnership with Alachua County Public Schools, Meridian Behavioral Healthcare, various businesses and community organizations. Focusing on the counter aspect of the ALICE method, Davis said students and school employees will be trained on techniques they can use to mitigate active shooter situations. “We are going to teach your kids to fight back as a last resort,” Davis said, after throwing a small rubber ball into the stands to sort of demonstrate that throwing something at a shooter can distract them and give time for the shooter to be disarmed. Protecting school campuses, especially students, is something that school resource deputies and officers take very seriously in Alachua County, Davis said. In fact, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office Juvenile Relations Bureau was recently recognized as the Florida School Resource Officer Program of the Year by the Florida Association of School Resource Officers, and Gainesville Police Department received the honor last year, Davis said. The theme of the rally this year was “See Something, Say Something, Do Something,” to encourage students to speak up if they see or hear about suspicious activity, threats or other potential damaging safety issues. “I want you to be safe this school year,” said GPD Chief Tony Jones. “If you see something, say something.” Students should inform school resource officers and deputies about any suspicious activity, especially weapons on campus, Jones said. Besides the 2,500 backpacks filled with school supplies that were given away, families also received back-to-school information and had an opportunity to pick up school calendars, school supply lists, information about after-school, and free and reduced lunch programs, dress codes and more. Vendors were also on hand, including the Alachua County Council of Parent Teacher Associations (ACCPTA), Mike Powell and Associates, University of Florida Health, SIATech Charter High School, candidates for elected offices, several businesses and others. To encourage parents and others to join PTAs and get involved with the education of their children is why members of ACCPTA were at the rally, said Pamela Korithoski, president of the council. Educating parents and the community about local and state testing mandates and promoting the half cents sales tax that will be on the ballot in November to raise money for improving school facilities are two of the priorities ACCPTA is currently addressing, Korithoski said. Having a presence at the rally is a chance to help students and parents learn about opportunities available after graduating from high school, said Mike Powell, CEO and founder of Mike Powell and Associates, a Gainesville-based athletic, academic and scholarship consulting firm. “We want parents and kids to know what all of their options are after graduation, whether it's college, sports, going straight into the workforce or other things,” Powell said. “We always just want to give back to the community.” The rally is always a great way to start the school year, said Gunnar Paulson, School Board chair. “This lets us set the stage for stopping violence in schools,” Paulson said. “What could be more appropriate than talking about this right now.” The rally has been around so long that parents who attended it as children are now bringing their children to the rally. “I’m here because it’s important to teach our children about how to stop the violence in our schools and neighborhoods,” said Julianne Williams, 29, who was at the rally with her two children, Kelan Williams, 6, and 5-year-old Jaylen Williams, both of whom will be attending Lawton Chiles Elementary School this year. “I probably came here every year when I was in school to get backpacks, and now I’m bringing my children,” Williams said.

Michael,Gordon,1286,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/07/29/gold-coast-titans-notch-their-biggest-ever-win-over-the-warriors/,"MATCH REPORT Two brilliant second-half plays from Gold Coast centre Brenko Lee and the coming of age of AJ Brimson helped the Titans break their dreadful Warriors hoodoo at Cbus Super Stadium on Sunday. The Titans outscored the Warriors 28-0 in the second half to run out 36-12 winners – breaking a record that had seen them lose 14 of the previous 15 games against the New Zealand side. In the first six minutes of the second half, Lee, who celebrated a one-year contract extension with the Titans with his best performance of the season, set up a try for Anthony Don then scored himself from a 55-metre intercept to turn the game on its ear. And the 19-year-old Brimson, who moments earlier had pulled off try-saving tackles on Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Sam Lisone, virtually sunk the Warriors' spirit in the last 25 minutes with a long-range try and a brilliant catch and pass for a Philip Sami try – all part of his most decisive performance at five-eighth in his 10 NRL appearances. While Ash Taylor was again a mixed bag, doing some good quality things with the ball but coming up with some errors, Brimson took more control of the Titans' attack than he has in any other match while he was again faultless in defence. Round 20 - Round 20 - Sunday 29 Jul Home Team Titans Away Team Warriors Venue: Cbus Super Stadium Match broadcasters: The Warriors gave up any chance of a top-four finish and were disjointed and outplayed in the second half after leading 12-8 at the break. The Titans had the best possible start to the game as a rush of penalties and a line-drop out gave them 72 percent of the early possession. Off the back of all that ball, Konrad Hurrell crossed in the left corner in the sixth minute against his old club after a good shift through halves Taylor and Brimson. Michael Gordon's touchline conversion gave them a handy 6-0 lead but it lasted just five minutes when Shaun Johnson, who has so often been the Titans' nemesis, crossed too easily - after two right-foot steps - during the Warriors' first foray into Gold Coast territory. His conversion made it 6-6. After a Michael Gordon penalty goal gave the Titans back the lead, the Warriors scored again when Karl Lawton crashed over. The visitors led 12-8. It took just two and a half minutes of the season half for the Titans to gain the lead for a third time, through brilliant work by right centre Lee who beat Solomone Kata with a right foot step and broke through, giving Anthony Don an easy few metres to the try-line. Gordon converted from wide-out to make it 14-12. Lee was the hero a few minutes later when he snatched a pass from Jazz Tevaga near halfway and ran unopposed to the goalposts, with Gordon's conversion making it 20-12 and dramatic shift in the game had occurred in the first eight minutes of the season half. Brimson, soon after making two try-saving tackles on his own line, latched onto a break from dummy-half by Mitch Rein from inside Titans' territory and scored in the 62nd minute, Gordon's conversion making it 26-12. Phillip Sami bagged a late double, with the first of his tries featuring some fancy footwork. Titans coach Garth Brennan described the effort as the best 80-minute performance for some time, and an indication of what his young side is capable of achieving. ""They have shown some signs of that throughout the year at different parts of games but today I thought it was probably our most complete 80 minutes of the year,"" he said. ""I am really proud of the effort, especially the second half defensively. ""There is a massive upside for the Titans.

Kathleen,Reed,1283,https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/deadly-crossover-crash-worst-day-of-my-life-woman-tells-st-thomas-court,"ST. THOMAS - It was a deadly median crossover crash on Ontario's busiest highway, one of several behind a Southwestern Ontario push to install concrete safety barriers on the Highway 401 west of London. Mohamed Duale walks into the Elgin County administration building, which houses the provincial offenses court, on Friday morning. Duale was found guilty of failing to share the roadway in connection to the February 2017 death of truck driver Gary Lent. (LAURA BROADLEY, Times-Journal) ST. THOMAS – It was a deadly median crossover crash on Ontario’s busiest highway, one of several behind a Southwestern Ontario push to install concrete safety barriers on the Highway 401 west of London. For Kathleen Reed, Feb. 16, 2017, was the “worst day of my life,” she said in a St. Thomas court Friday as she read a victim impact statement about the fallout of the crash that killed her partner. Reed’s fiance, 66-year-old Gary Lent, was killed when the truck he was driving collided with another truck driven by Mohamed Duale that crossed the 401 median near Southwold. Justice of the Peace Anna Hampson found Duale guilty of failing to share the road, a minor infraction under Ontario’s Highway Traffic Act, while a charge of careless driving was withdrawn. Hampson accepted a joint Crown-defence recommendation and sentenced Duale, 63, to two years of probation and fined him $500. “This has not been an easy day for anyone,” Hampson said. “Gary was loved by many and respected by more,” Reed said. Highway conditions were bad that day, with snow and ice, Assistant Crown attorney Craig Sigurdson said a witness had told investigators. A grim-faced Duale looked pained as he tilted his head toward the Somali interpreter relaying what Reed was saying in his native language. Earlier, emotions ran high as Duale entered the courthouse with family members, with the group yelling at a reporter and one asking her if she felt threatened because they are Muslim. A police officer intervened. Duale’s day in court almost never came. A trial scheduled for mid-March was adjourned after Duale failed to return from a trip to his native Somalia. Duale’s father had a stroke and he stayed longer than expected to care for him, his lawyer, William Glover, said at the time. Reed described a relationship between her and Lent that blossomed when they met in 2015. She said he was a man with a big heart who loved animals, music and his job. “Gary was loved by many and respected by more,” Reed said through tears. “Gary had so much love to give. He was always there for me.” “I wear his ashes every day and every night,” Reed said Reed would often beg Lent not to go to work when the weather was bad, but he’d assure her he’d be fine. Reed said Lent’s death changed her. No longer happy and funny, she said her children not only lost their future stepfather, but their mother too. Lent’s niece, Gail Gritten Lewis, read her victim impact statement as well as those of Lent’s sisters, one of them her mother. Gritten-Lewis said Lent was more than an uncle, he was a friend and confidante. Even now, she said, she catches herself in moments when she thinks of calling him. “As a human being he was beautiful,” she said. Later, Gritten-Lewis said the sentence brings some closure but no satisfaction. “I’m not satisfied with the ways the laws operate,” she said. “I think there should have been a suspension of his driving privileges.” The crash prompted Reed to campaign for median barriers along the 401, something Gritten-Lewis respects. “She’s going to save future lives,” she said. Reed has been active in a Southwestern Ontario citizens’ campaign to get concrete median barriers installed on the nearly 120-km stretch of the 401 from London to Tilbury, which has no protection to stop vehicles headed one way from crossing the grass median and colliding into traffic going the other way. Reed planned to put up a memorial cross for Lent on the highway, but Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation rejected that, saying it could distract drivers. She moved from Etobicoke where she’d lived with Lent to London, closer to the court case, after he died. She joined the barriers push led by Alysson Storey, a Chatham woman whose London friend Sarah Payne and her young daughter Freya were killed Aug. 29, 2017, in a crossover crash near where Lent was killed. Later Friday, Reed said she’s more determined than ever to fight for concrete barriers. Premier Doug Ford has committed to installing the barriers, but the time line for the project under the new Progressive Conservative government remains unclear. The former Liberal government had planned to install wire cable barriers, but months before the June election appeared to blink – saying concrete barriers would come, but that it would take time. Calling the outcome of the Duale case disappointing, Storey said more lives will be lost unless something is done to build the barriers sooner than later. “I’d like to see them keep their promise,” she said of the Ford government and the barriers. Duale declined a request for comment. lbroadley@postmedia.com 365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com © 2018 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.

Best-known as a piano virtuoso and star teacher whose students included Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein was also a prolific composer. “Demon”, the most popular of his 20 operas, depicts a fallen angel, or demon, who falls desperately in love with a mortal princess named Tamara, and tries everything in his power to seduce her. Tamara’s struggle to resist him becomes a battle not only for her soul but for the fate of the earth itself. Also at Bard Summerscape this weekend, the Bard Spiegeltent features two living legends of entertainment. Tonight, the original mononymous pop star, Melanie - one of only three women to perform solo at the 1969 Woodstock Festival – revives the folk-pop sound of the late-1960s. Then on Saturday night, Broadway superstar Chita Rivera will be accompanied by her long-time trio in a cabaret program of selections from musicals including West Side Story, Sweet Charity, Chicago, Kiss of The Spider Woman; Bye, Bye, Birdie; and others.

Michael,Gordon,1282,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/07/28/tyrone-peacheys-compelling-audition-to-become-penrith-panthers-permanent-fullback/,"PANTHERS Tyrone Peachey wants to make fullback his permanent first grade position after badgering Anthony Griffin to give him the No.1 jersey and then starring in Penrith's stunning come-from-behind win over Manly. Peachey had only ever played a few games of juniors at the back before being named there earlier in the week, with regular custodian Dallin Watene-Zelezniak returning from a hamstring injury via the wing. He looked right at home throughout against the Sea Eagles even when they shot to a 24-6 lead, with Peachey finishing the game with a try assist, two line break assists, three tackle busts and 116 running metres. Tellingly he also safely defused a late Daly Cherry-Evans bomb as Manly looked to claw back their lead having spilled an earlier one. Peachey revealed he had been in Griffin's ear prior to team selection about being able to play 80 minutes at fullback, and now wants to stay there. ""I was geeing (Penrith's coaching staff) up and then Hook called me into the office and actually said I'm playing fullback and I had a massive smile on my face and I said 'about time',"" Peachey said of his latest positional switch. ""I'd love to (stay at fullback). Hopefully I didn't stuff up too much and we'll go through video on Monday, there will be a few things we can fix up position-wise, just work on and hopefully still be there next week."" Griffin would not be drawn on whether Peachey will remain in the No.1 next week against Canberra, but was impressed with his performance nonetheless. ""I thought he went alright,"" Griffin said.""(He) took a good ball at the end to win us the game. For his first go he was alright. Got to do a bit more work on him but I thought he did a great job."" While his uncle David was one of the most entertaining fullbacks of the 90s at Cronulla, Peachey drew on the advice and training work with Panthers assistants Cameron Ciraldo and Peter Wallace in the lead-up to his first outing at the back. Peachey is the first to admit his utility value is his biggest asset, with his ability to play in the forwards, halves and outside backs earning him a start for NSW in this year's series win, but less than half an hour's game time across the series. The 26-year-old is moving to the Gold Coast next season on a lucrative three-year deal, with a regular first grade starting position a big drawcard under former Panthers NSW Cup coach Garth Brennan. Fullback could well be on the cards for the future Titan given Michael Gordon is contracted but will be 35 next season, however Peachey was reluctant to discuss where he would be turning out in 2019. ""He's got his own team to worry about this year and I haven't thought about it too much,"" Peachey said. ""I want to finish strong this year for Penrith and try and finish on a good note. ""I love playing 80 minutes and I just love playing footy. But I know personally that my best position is probably that utility role because I can cover so many positions which is a bit of a burden. ""But I'm happy to be fullback at the moment and to come away with the win.""

But it’s hard to argue it isn’t one of the most fun. Surely, you’ve noticed there are waves on the West Coast this week. And no other place in all of California is as hot of a hotspot as Trestles when a south swell rolls through. Videographer Steve Cummings, aka Jacuzzi Surfer, has been doing his fair share of driving around Southern California this weekend in honor of the event, starting the week off with a Rob Machado sighting, then the obligatory visit to the Wedge, and now, of course, a day at Lowers. The crowds are as to be expected: thick. But there’s a method to the madness of all these people who fight and scrap for their pick of a Lowers gem at the peak of a swell. You see, getting just one of these waves can be fun enough to hold you over for quite a while. And that’s worth something. Find more from JacuzziSurfer on Youtube and on Instagram.

Bob,Diamond,1277,https://www.theindependent.co.zw/2018/07/27/interest-bearing-activities-boost-bancabc-revenues/,"BancABC Bank BancABC, the local unit of African Banking Corporation, is among the top banks that are generating the bulk of their revenue from interest-bearing activities, a survey of financial institutions operating in the country conducted by the Zimbabwe Independent has revealed. By Kuda Chideme In the year ended December 2017, the bank generated interest income of US$35 million to give it a non-interest-income-to-total-net-income ratio of 39%. The ratio signifies the extent to which a bank’s income is reliant on non-core activity earnings. For the purposes of ranking, the lower this ratio is, the better, even though an entity might be realising more income. Other banks’ ratios are relatively much higher. This type of income can be incidental in nature and, hence cannot be relied upon to continue flowing in. When the interest income is compared in relation to operating expenses, the bank is ranked 5th at 83%. This ratio reflects the ability of the entity to meet the operating expenses from the interest earned. Any figure below 100% means that the bank has to either earn some non-interest income to bridge the gap or face the losses that would be incurred. The bank is sitting on US$400 million worth of deposits, accounting for 4,6% of the industry’s US$8,6 billion. In terms of loans, BancABC has 5,34% of the total US$3,4 billion represented issued loans as at 31 December 2017. The bank reported more than US$50 million in deposit capture in Zimbabwe for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the back of a strong agency banking programme. The group said the agency banking programme continues to be a strong driver of customer growth and deposit capture. In line with the growth in use of plastic money in Zimbabwe due to cash shortages, BancABC also upgraded its digital platforms during the financial year. The programme included the re-introduction of mobile banking, as well as adding instant interbank transfers. The survey also showed that BancABC, at US$20 million, ranks third in terms of total non-performing loans (NPLs). These represent the loans that the borrower is not servicing; neither the interest nor the principal debt. They are not yet regarded as write-offs because of the possible fact that the collateral security could still be sufficient to recover the loan. In the full year, the bank reported an after-tax profit of US$5 million. BancABC has the second lowest return on assets (ROA) at 1,1 %. This is an indication of the return that an entity has made on the assets of the business. A positive ROA is the desired one and the higher the better. National Building Society (NBS) ranks last as it has a negative ROA of -1,2% and that is largely due to the fact that the financial institution is a new market entrant and still establishing the business. In terms of return on equity (ROE), BancABC is also lowly ranked at 6,23%, performing only better than NBS which is the only entity that has a negative ROE of -3,56%. This is a profitability ratio that reflects the return earned on the equity invested in the business, and a high and positive rate represents a good return, whilst a negative one means the erosion of equity. Out of the 18 banks, BancABC is among the institutions with the highest staff-cost-to-total-expenses ratio of 36,7 %. The ratio basically indicates the contribution to total expenses that human resources costs make. A service-based business would tend to have a higher ratio compared to a manufacturing concern. African Banking Corporation, the parent company of BancABC, was acquired by Atlas Mara, an investment group founded by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. It has operations in Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and a group services office in South Africa. BancABC has 23 branches in Zimbabwe.

Andrew,Davis,1276,https://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/lipinski-remembers-late-staffer-andrew-davis,"Andrew Walker Davis worked for two years in the office of Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski. (Courtesy Andrew Walker Davis’ family) Updated 5:22 p.m. | Andrew Walker Davis, former senior policy adviser for Rep. Daniel Lipinski, will be remembered Friday in a memorial service in West Hartford, Connecticut. Davis, 29, who died on Sunday after a two-year battle with cancer, worked for Lipinski for two years, most recently on transportation and infrastructure issues. He left the Hill in 2016 to work as an associate at the government relations firm, Chambers, Conlon and Hartwell. “Andrew was a great employee and a terrific guy who I very much enjoyed having on my staff. Very smart and analytical, he helped me achieve a number of legislative victories, especially on the FAST Act surface transportation bill,” Lipinski said in a statement. The Illinois Democrat added, “He worked hard, never shied from long hours or tough challenges, and he made it possible for me to be an effective legislator. He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man. I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” Davis was an avid Washington Nationals and New England Patriots fan and a politics buff. He could recite all the names of the presidents in chronological order and also was a fan of sports trivia, according to his obituary in the Hartford Courant. His family has asked those attending Friday’s memorial service to wear red, his favorite color, or Patriots colors. Davis was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and lived in Silver Spring, Maryland, with his wife Caitlin O’Donnell Davis and their three-year-old son, Alden Stone Davis. “Not only was Andrew a devoted staffer and colleague, he was also someone who I valued as a good friend. Despite whatever we might be working on, he kept a positive attitude, refreshing us all with his humor and wit, never short of a funny rejoinder about some Member’s floor comments,” Lipinski's chief of staff, Eric Lausten, said in a statement. Davis graduated from Union College and Georgetown Law School. Correction 5:22 p.m. | An earlier version of this story misstated the number of years Davis served on Lipinski’s staff.

The latest wrinkle, according to Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and an aide, is that Democrats want the bill’s tax title — currently part of the manager’s package being hotlined on the GOP side — to be folded into the substitute amendment instead. Ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) as recently as Wednesday told reporters that Democrats “didn’t want some monkey business coming around of trying to add taxes on it, but it looks like it’s clean.” Though procedurally either approach leads to the same outcome, Democrats seem to believe that including a clean tax title in the substitute will offer a degree of comfort that it’s inoculated from any extraneous tax amendments that could cause the legislation to implode. Story Continued Below Tl;dr: The bill’s not making it to the floor next week, in all likelihood. WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND: Happy Friday!

Recently named a federal driverless car proving ground, Michigan’s American Center for Mobility offers real world testing environments to validate self-driving systems. Learn how public-private ventures are helping Michigan create a safer world. Visit PlanetM.com ** JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME: Senators wrapped up the week by clearing a House-passed measure (H.R. 5729 (115)) that would prevent the Coast Guard from moving forward with a rule requiring biometric card readers for transportation worker IDs. The bill passed by unanimous consent. It would postpone implementation of the rule, currently set to go into effect on Aug. 23, until the Coast Guard submits a report to Congress showing the effectiveness of its Transportation Worker Identification Credential program as a whole. The service had proposed a three-year delay of the rule for some facilities, but industry groups have pressed for an extension for all facilities, given what they have referred to as years of unclear guidance from the Coast Guard. MONEY DOWN: Amtrak announced Thursday that it plans to spend $370 million over the next three years on a track laying system and other equipment to improve on-time performance for the Northeast Corridor. The investment also will include freight cars, five high-speed surfacing machines and heavy lift cranes for New York Penn Station. “More than 890,000 Amtrak customers and commuter passengers rely on the Northeast Corridor for transportation every weekday, and we are working to make their ride smoother and more reliable,” said Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. UP THE TRACKS: Rural-state senators lavished praise on their long-distance Amtrak services during a Thursday hearing on two rail-related nominees — former Trump aide Rick Dearborn to serve on Amtrak’s board of directors and Martin Oberman to become a Surface Transportation Board member. Many of them sought assurances from Dearborn (a former Senate staffer well liked by members) that those routes are crucial to Amtrak’s national network, which he gave without making many promises besides vowing to work with senators and their staffs. When asked by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) what he would do if he had to choose between lowering Amtrak’s operating losses or shutting down a long-distance line, Dearborn said: “I hope I’m never faced with that decision.” He added that he plans to focus on boosting ridership, which would spur revenue gains that he hopes would help Amtrak’s stewardship of its various services. Mark your calendars: The committee will consider both nominations at an Aug. 1 markup. For your files: A bipartisan coterie of senators wrote to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson Thursday concerned about the prospect of the railroad suspending service along its Southwest Chief route. They asked him to “uphold Amtrak's commitment to intercity rail service across the entire national network” and apply for grant funding recently made available by FRA for rail infrastructure upgrades. MEH: Rep. Bill Shuster's infrastructure plan is running into a familiar stumbling block: revenue. The Pennsylvania Republican, who isn’t running for reelection, has nothing to lose by getting behind a 15-cent gas tax hike, but other lawmakers oppose the move. Shuster’s playing the long game, though — 10 more years of gas tax, and then it disappears entirely to make way for a mileage fee. BACK TO BASICS: TSA needs to set clear goals for its basic training program for airport screeners, GAO said in a new report. The Transportation Security Officer training program offers a two-week intensive course for newly hired agents and private screeners to identify security threats. Though TSA has a model for evaluating its training, it “has not yet established specific program goals and performance measures to assess TSO Basic Training,” according to the report. Specifically, GAO said the agency needs to identify what the trainees are expected to achieve. TSA concurred and said it planned to collect more data from screeners to help it assess the potential impacts of the program. MILESTONE: FAA announced Thursday that it’s issued more than 100,000 Remote Pilot Certificates to commercial and recreational drone users — and that’s on top of the hundreds of thousands of “model aircraft” hobbyists who don’t have to comply with Part 107 certification requirements. MT MAILBAG: Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone (N.J.) and Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) sent a letter to NHTSA Thursday raising concerns about a recently released inspector general report that said the agency had been slow to react to consumer complaints about Takata airbags and ineffectively used its enforcement authorities to push for affected vehicles to be repaired as soon as possible. The lawmakers write that, “despite repeated calls now for NHTSA to open an investigation into the Kia and Hyundai fores, NHTSA has still failed to take meaningful action to keep drivers and passengers safe.” Also: The We Will Ride Coalition, a disability rights group, issued an open letter to automakers urging them to manufacture driverless vehicles that could accommodate wheelchair users and others with disabilities. “We worry that self-driving cars will fall short of the mobility promise they hold because we see no signs that auto manufacturers are developing a fully accessible passenger vehicle,” the group said. This day in history: Today marks one year since the Energy and Commerce Committee approved its driverless car bill (H.R. 3388 (115)) in a 54-0 vote. SHIFTING GEARS: Lynden Tennison will become Union Pacific’s executive vice and chief strategy officer on Aug. 1. Tennison has been with the railroad for 26 years and has served as senior vice president and chief information officer for more than a decade. And Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl has become the new chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority board of directors. She succeeds outgoing board chairman L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. MT INFLUENCE: Southwest Airlines hired Heideh Shahmoradi — former staff director of the Senate Transportation-HUD spending panel — to lobby on appropriations and reauthorizing the FAA. IN MEMORIAM: Andrew Davis, a former staffer for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), died this week following a lengthy battle with cancer. Davis, who was 29, served as Lipinski’s senior policy adviser on transportation and infrastructure for two years. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” (h/t POLITICO Huddle) THE AUTOBAHN: — ""Trump administration to freeze Obama-era fuel standards for cars, light trucks.""

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 2:57 pm A recent Maryville fundraiser for congressional candidate Tim Burchett included an invitation that contained the names of several Jimmy Matlock supporters and inferred each couple donated $1,000 to Burchett’s campaign. Burchett, who is mayor of Knox County, and East Tennessee tire magnate Matlock, who also represents District 21 in the Tennessee House of Representatives, are the leading Republican candidates in the Aug. 2 primary to choose a successor for longtime U.S. Rep. Jimmy Duncan, a Republican who is not seeking re-election. Matlock, who has Matlock Tire Service stores in Maryville, Knoxville, Lenoir City and Athens, said when he saw Burchett’s list of “Host Committee” members, he was stunned. “I was very disappointed when I saw the list. Many of these people are friends and customers of mine,” Matlock said. Burchett’s Chief of Staff Andrew Davis acknowledged that “miscommunication over the July 4 holiday” caused several names to be listed as Burchett supporters in error. Davis initially said Tuesday that “anyone on the host committee list gave us consent and said they wanted to be on the list.” He called back Tuesday to say there had been a mistake and that “all offended parties had been reached out to so we could apologize to them.” Davis declined to specify who the offended parties were. “It was an honest mistake,” he said. An operative close to Matlock’s campaign said the Matlock supporters wrongly listed on the fundraiser invitation were Maryville City Councilman Tommy Hunt and his wife, Carol; Joe Anderson, a liquor store owner, and his wife, Mary Jane; Laura and Lee Chambers, a principal at Grandview Cemetery; financial adviser Kevin Painter; pharmacy executive David Pesterfield; Tina and Darrell Tipton, a Realtor; and Ruth and Steve West, former Maryville mayor and automobile dealer. Steve West acknowledged he was mistakenly listed on the Burchett invitation but said it “was not a big deal.” Multiple calls to Joe Anderson and Painter were not returned. Darrell Tipton said he had not committed to any congressional candidate yet, but confirmed he should not have been on the list and has not donated to Burchett’s campaign. Lee Chambers said he had not given Burchett $1,000 to be on the list, but said his favored candidate is a “personal decision of mine” and wouldn’t comment further. Pesterfield said he was out of town during the event and refused further comment. Tommy Hunt, president of Calloway Oil Co., said he is an avid Matlock supporter and that, when called earlier this month and asked to be on the Burchett list, he declined through Nashville-based Kaegi Resources, a political fundraising firm that has worked with Republican politicians, including both Tennessee U.S. senators — Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander — and Gov. Bill Haslam. “I chalk this up to sloppy work from his (Burchett’s) staff,” Tommy Hunt said. “I said no, and yet my name showed up. I was disappointed because this was not Kaegi’s first rodeo. It was just a poor performance. “I have supported Tim during other races,” he added. “I’m friends with both Tim and Jimmy, but I’m just not supporting Tim in this race. And I think what happened reflects poorly on his campaign.” Shelbie Hurt, the Kaegi employee to whom RSVPs were to be directed for the McCord Farm fundraiser July 17 on Montvale Road, said staff members were trying to get the invitations out over the busy holiday weekend when a “miscommunication” occurred. She referred further questions to Burchett’s chief of staff, Davis.

Bernard,Osher,1275,http://dailytidings.com/news/top-stories/olli-builds-learning-and-social-connections,"Andy Atkinson / Daily TidingsThe Osher Lifelong Learning Institute’s (OLLI) open house drew a crowd at Southern Oregon University's Stevenson Union building. What to do after retirement? Sit around and watch TV, dine out or golf once a week with the same people? An affordable education program in the Rogue Valley offers an alternative: a wide array of classes ranging from “Contemporary Poetry” to “Food Preservation” for anyone who wants to continue their education and socialize along the way. An estimated 900 community members seemed interested in that alternative this week, strolling the halls of Stevenson Union at Southern Oregon University Wednesday during the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute’s 25th open house. The theme of this year’s event was “learning for life,” so local organizations such as SMART reading, Jackson County Library Services and local school districts had tables at the event, along with local organizations such as ScienceWorks Hands-On Museum, Ashland Independent Film Festival and AAUW of Ashland and Medford. There were also instructors available to describe all 139 courses. OLLI is a national organization with the motto of “Come for the classes … stay for the connections.” Their mission is to provide mental stimulation and social interaction for anyone who wants to continue their education, but tends to gear toward older adults. Anne Bellegia, OLLI’s community outreach volunteer, and Pauline Black, volunteer coordinator, note the program is almost entirely run by volunteers, of which there were 600 last year. Bellegia said there are 120 OLLI’s in the country but their only connection is the endowment fund they share. The fund covers a small portion of each institute’s operations, and the rest of the funds come from membership fees and fundraisers put on by volunteers throughout the year. “The awesome thing about the Bernard Osher Foundation is that they do not dictate how you run your institute,” Bellegia said. OLLI in the Rogue Valley has about 2,000 members, with a membership fee of $125 that covers the cost of as many courses as the member wishes to take. Bellegia said this OLLI branch has one of the lowest membership fees in the country. She said some require annual fees of up to $700 or a per-course fee. The Rogue Valley branch also offers scholarships to assist some in attending. “We don’t like to turn people away because they can’t afford it,” Bellegia said. “This is possible because our instructors are free and everything else is pretty much run by volunteers.” It’s a win-win for everyone. Most of the volunteers are retired and usually have a background in or an affinity for the subject they teach. Bellegia said the work is important to the instructors, who know they have to keep their classes’ attention since there are no grades or credentials at stake. “It’s a different dynamic for sure,” Bellegia said. “You either have to be interesting or the students will walk.” Lorraine Vail, former OLLI council president, has taught film classes for four years, but in her case had no prior background in film. Her classes are timed around film festivals in Ashland. The classes view the films in the festivals, then discuss with guest speakers and co-teachers in the field for the following weeks. “I’m just a film lover,” Vail said. “That’s what’s great about teaching, some people teach in their academic field and others just teach about things they love.” Peggy Evans, council member, has been teaching OLLI classes since 2004, mostly music and philanthropy. This fall she’s teaching “Sacred Anthems in English” and “How to be a Better Philanthropist.” “We should never stop learning,” Evans said. “When I was growing up, my dad would say every day ‘and what did you learn today?’ and shouldn’t that continue throughout life?” Sandy Theis has been a member since 2008 and said joining OLLI was a given after she retired because her husband has been taking classes for years. She’s done curriculum work her entire life and so naturally joined the group’s curriculum committee as a volunteer while taking courses as a student simultaneously. She also began facilitating courses. For example, after participating in the first Team Ashland, a citizen education series, she led a course explaining the inner workings of the city of Ashland. Theis said OLLI encourages instructors to take a break in the middle of the class so everyone may socialize. “That’s why I do it,” Theis said. “Because I like to meet people.” More than 200 new members signed up at the open house, according to Rob Casserly, program manager.

NEW YORK, July 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq:MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. ""The second quarter results show a solid 16.4% year-over-year increase in total trading volume and record Open Trading™ activity, "" noted Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. ""International client breadth and trading activity continues to improve, led by a 27.0% increase in emerging market trading volume and a 32.3% increase in Eurobond volume. We are seeing rapid growth in trading automation in credit, driving improved trading efficiency and lower trading costs for our dealer and investor clients."" Second Quarter Results Total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 increased 11.1% to $107.0 million, compared to $96.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Operating income was $52.0 million, compared to $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.2%. Operating margin was 48.6%, compared to 50.9% for the second quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $40.5 million, or $1.07 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $38.0 million, or $1.00 per share, for the second quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased 10.5% to $96.1 million, compared to $87.0 million for the second quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 1.5% to $71.7 million on total trading volume of $420.8 billion for the second quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $70.6 million on total trading volume of $361.5 billion for the second quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.4% for the second quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.0% for the second quarter of 2017. All other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services and other revenue, increased 16.7% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $1.1 million. Total expenses for the second quarter of 2018 increased 16.1% to $54.9 million, compared to $47.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $2.0 million, professional and consulting fees of $1.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million, technology and communication costs of $1.0 million and employee compensation and benefit costs, mainly due to an increase in headcount, of $0.9 million. Occupancy costs in the second quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.8 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.03. Other income (expense) increased to $1.2 million from $0.6 million due to a $0.5 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 23.9%, compared to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $5.3 million of excess tax benefits, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on August 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,900 shares were repurchased in the second quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.6 million. Balance Sheet Data As of June 30, 2018, total assets were $617.6 million and included $420.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018 was $557.4 million.

Steve,Cummings,1272,http://www.wbay.com/content/news/Oshkosh-warming-shelter-proposes-major-expansion--489064721.html,"OSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY)- We're learning more about plans for a major expansion of the Day by Day Warming Shelter in Oshkosh which would double it's current capacity. Construction of a new facility would place it at the corner of Ceape Avenue and Broad Street. For the past eight years the Day by Day warming shelter has been located in a former school basement of the Most Blessed Sacrament Church. However, with just a capacity of 25, Executive Director Lorraine Yarbrough says it's not big enough for a city the size of Oshkosh. ""We have limited number of space, we have limited resources of what we can do here, so to meet that community need right now we would need a new shelter,"" said Yarbrough. A proposal being considered right now calls for the construction of a new shelter with a cost up to $3.5 million, all of which would come from donors. This would expand the number of beds to more than 50, and allow the facility to operate year round. For now it's only open from October thru April. Yarbrough added, ""We're very proud of what we've accomplished. It's not just providing food and shelter, but also trying to meet those needs to helping the guests find jobs and housing so we've been pretty successful."" However the potential location, which is on a vacant lot owned by the Oshkosh Housing Authority,has some city officials concerned. That's because it's directly across the street from the Leach Amphitheater and a block from the convention center. Mayor Steve Cummings said,""We're spending millions to revitalize our downtown area for the central city not just downtown. I don't think that's the most appropriate facility to have in that section of town."" Eventually the city council would have to sign-off on any changes. While the exact time table for this project is still being crafted, the hope is to break ground two years from now.

Michael,Gordon,1271,http://www.wabi.tv/content/news/Bangor-Public-Works-clean-up--489158291.html,"BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - Bangor Police and Public Works are cleaning up tent city in Bangor. The homeless camps along the Penobscot River have long served as temporary housing for those who feel as though they have no place to go. ""It's unfortunate, but things happen. Gotta move on. A bunch of us already found new campsites that are safe and still nearby to town, so we can still use resources."" Michael Smith is a homeless veteran who has been staying in what's known as Bangor's tent city for about a month. Until now. ""It's not a good thing that we had to move, but it's not a bad thing either honestly,"" said Smith. After recent issues with violence in the camp, Bangor Police say they had no choice but to clear the area. For many, this place was home, and the people they were with made it feel like it too, until fights broke out. We're told it's the newer and younger folks coming in to town causing problems. ""95% of the people here are very good people,"" explained homeless veteran, Michael Gordon. ""Top of the line. But, you get 5% of the bad people, it makes all of us 95% look bad."" Bangor Police say they started warning folks a couple of weeks ago, that they would have to pack up and move elsewhere, but not without letting them know what resources are available. ""They are down there every day and not in an enforcement way, in a proactive way,"" explained Bruce Hews, Campus Manager of the Hope House & Living Center in Bangor. ""They are down there telling people what's going to go on weeks before they break these camps up. They are giving these people the opportunity, the resources. They are letting them know what's out there."" Boyd Kronholm serves as the Executive Director of the Bangor Area Homeless Shelter. He says their goal is to help those who are willing to help themselves - and that starts by finding some stability. ""They have to save money if they have any type of income. If they don't have income and are able to work, we have them looking for jobs. We do a risk assessment type of evaluation on them as far as how vulnerable they are to remain homeless, and then we try and attach them to any housing program that will best meet their needs,"" said Kronholm.

Andrew,Davis,1269,http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-candid-candace-0729-story.html,"The Chicago International Film Festival gala honored founder Michael Kutza and included appearances by a host of stars, including Kathleen Turner and Terrence Howard. The governing board of Cinema/Chicago and the Chicago International Film Festival presented its annual Summer Gala on July 14, this year honoring Michael Kutza on his retirement after 55 years as founder and artistic director. The event, held at the Loews Chicago Hotel, included appearances by an array of film industry luminaries: actors Kathleen Turner (""Body Heat"" and ""Prizzi's Honor"") and Terrence Howard (""Empire"" and ""Iron Man""); directors/producers Andrew Davis (""The Fugitive"") and Steve James (""Hoop Dreams""); and producer Paula Wagner (""Mission Impossible I-III"" and ""Marshall""), among others. The evening was a film lover’s delight from beginning to end. At check-in, guests were presented with small statuettes that denoted their dinner table numbers. An array of life-size, cardboard cutouts of iconic Hollywood stars, like Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn, filled the reception lobby and made for memorable photo opportunities. A 50-pound Eli's Cheesecake featured the film festival's logo in icing along with other film-inspired edibles. The program began in the ballroom with a video presentation, produced by Kurtis Productions, that featured some of film's greatest musical numbers. Bill Kurtis appeared on-screen as a 1940s film star with slicked back hair. He welcomed the crowd and introduced the song ""A Little Party Never Killed Nobody"" from the film ""Great Gatsby,"" after which colorful streamer cannons fired into the crowd. Co-chair Chaz Ebert, CEO of Ebert Cos., welcomed the stars in attendance and shared brief overviews of their film successes and achievements. Co-chair Maria Pappas, Cook County treasurer, spoke about Cinema/Chicago, the nonprofit parent company of the festival that provides educational outreach and free screenings. A live auction, paddle raise and cake-cutting was followed by a Q&A between Ebert and Kutza that covered his history, starting with founding the festival at age 22. Kutza explained his inspiration for the 55-year success of the festival. ""It's the energy of seeing something that no one's ever seen before that keeps the spark alive for me,"" he said. Video tributes appeared throughout the evening and included accolades from the late Robin Williams, Martin Scorsese, Tom Cruise, Sophia Loren, Leslie and Robert Zemeckis, Oliver Stone, Jacqueline Bisset, Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Douglas, Helen Mirren, Taylor Hackford and more. ABC-7's Janet Davies introduced Andrew Davis, who thanked Kutza for ""offering actors, filmmakers, writers and producers the opportunity to experience sharing their voices, visions and aspirations with the world."" Kathleen Turner admonished the crowd to ""bless (Kutza) and be very thankful you have him or I'll come back."" Producer Paula Wagner presented the Lifetime Achievement Award to Kutza. The inscription read, ""For pioneering a world class event that celebrates the art of cinema and for making an indelible impact on the cultural landscape of Chicago."" Kutza called the festival his ""obsession and his love."" The evening concluded with guest Kari Keillor surprising the crowd with an impromptu song, ""You're Gonna Hear From Me,"" from the 1965 film ""Inside Daisy Clover,"" that cleverly revealed the inspiration for Kutza's upcoming autobiography, ""Who's Looking."" Proceeds from the Summer Gala will support Cinema/Chicago's year-round programs, including the Chicago International Film and Television Festivals, the free CineYouth Festival, and the international screenings and education programs, which provide free film screenings to more than 7,000 Chicago Public School students.

McCaskill (nmccaskill@politico.com or @NolanDMcCaskill) MIDTERM MONEY SPRINT -- House leaders will crisscross the country to raise millions of dollars for candidates and incumbents during the five-week August recess as both parties compete for control of the chamber. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s offices say the leaders have scheduled dozens of events during their summer break. McCarthy aides say he will do more than 30 events in a dozen states, including stops in Ohio, Tennessee, Nebraska, Minnesota, New York and Maine. McCarthy has ramped up his fundraising this year, ascending to a level matched only by Ryan and Pelosi. Story Continued Below “McCarthy’s multiple fundraising entities took in more than $12 million last quarter, with a huge chunk of that coming from a joint committee McCarthy set up with Vice President Mike Pence, another key player in the Republican money chase,” Bres and Heather report. A Ryan aide says the retiring speaker will spend part of next month in Wisconsin doing events with its GOP delegation. The state’s primary is Aug. 14. Then he’ll travel to Illinois, Washington, Oregon and Colorado for fundraisers for incumbents. Pelosi will swing through the Southwest, appearing with Democratic candidates in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, then travel the country with stops in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego, Indianapolis and San Francisco. Pelosi will host her annual donor retreat in Napa in mid-August. Scheduled speakers include former Secretary of State John Kerry, California Gov. Jerry Brown and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. More on other leaders’ summer cash dash: http://bit.ly/2LNIFa9 LEADERS STRATEGIZE TO AVOID SHUTDOWN -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) presented President Donald Trump a government spending strategy designed to minimize the threat of a government shutdown over border wall funding a month before Election Day. The congressional leaders said they will prioritize less controversial bills before the Sept. 30 funding deadline and hope to fund the majority of the government through the appropriations process by the end of September, leaving a fight over border wall funding until later in the year. “Trump made clear to the GOP leaders that he still wants a $5 billion down payment on his wall this year, but he signaled to the leaders that he might be willing to wage that fight after the midterms,” Burgess reports. “Though the House plans to pass a spending bill giving Trump $5 billion for the wall, Senate Democrats are unlikely to agree to fund more than the $1.6 billion initially requested by the Trump administration -- meaning any attempt to fund the Department of Homeland Security could lead to a shutdown.” More: http://bit.ly/2LsRxGo GOP TORN APART OVER TARIFFS -- With the president threatening $500 billion in additional tariffs on China and new duties on foreign cars, Senate Republicans are increasingly focused on crafting legislation to tie his hands. Even Trump ally Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, is working on a bill limiting the president from imposing new national security-based tariffs. There’s just one problem: House Republicans. “[A]cross the Capitol, Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP leaders have all but rejected that approach,” Rachael and Burgess report. “House Republicans, who rarely push back on the president, say it’s more productive to try to convince Trump privately or through letters or committee hearings than to force his hand legislatively.” “Ask them how they expect the president to sign it,” House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said of the Senate. “The split-strategy undermines Hill Republicans’ drive to blunt Trump’s protectionist trade policies,” they write. “Instead, the political party of free markets is watching the president dole out $12 billion in subsidies for farmers hurt by his trade war with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.” Republicans in both chambers agree that an escalating trade war is the greatest threat to their majorities, but House Republicans are far less inclined to challenge the president.

Senate Majority PAC plans to pour at least $20 million into a voter-mobilization campaign in Republican-leaning states. “The initiative … will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake, but it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans,” The New York Times’ Alexander Burns reports. “Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states.” Much more: https://nyti.ms/2LSD1Ue CONSERVATIVES REACH TO IMPEACH ROSENSTEIN -- Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) filed articles of impeachment late Wednesday in an attempt to oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. “Meadows sidestepped a procedural move that could have forced the issue to a vote this week and laid bare divisions among Republicans,” Kyle reports. “Instead, the House is leaving Thursday for a five-week recess and it's unclear whether conservatives will attempt to force the issue when lawmakers return in September.” The filling followed a meeting with top DOJ officials over a lingering demand for documents. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has rejected impeachment calls, recently describing the document dispute as a “compliance” issue that was on its way to being resolved. “Without GOP leaders’ support, it’s unlikely an impeachment bid could pass the House -- and even if it did, it would be doomed in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to oust any executive branch official,” Kyle adds. “But Rosenstein’s sharpest House critics have previously suggested that laying out articles of impeachment could be enough to prompt Trump to act against Rosenstein on his own.” Much more: http://bit.ly/2LrWv68 Related read: “Election meddling bill would curb president's power, Paul warns,” from Stephanie Murray: http://bit.ly/2Lt4f84 POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP ON RUSSIA -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers the president accepts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Pompeo assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Trump “has a complete and proper understanding of what happened” because he briefed the president on it as CIA director. Pompeo “repeatedly urged lawmakers to pay attention to the administration's policies as opposed to what the president may be implying through public comments,” Nahal Toosi and Stephanie Murray report. Pompeo also said the U.S. “does not and will not recognize the Kremlin's purported annexation of Crimea.” More from the hearing: http://bit.ly/2LFAlMM DEADLINE DAY -- Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday say the DHS secretary told them the Trump administration would meet today’s court deadline to reunify families that were separated at the border due to its zero-tolerance enforcement policy. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters that members “questioned her numerous times” on that claim. “That’s impossible,” he said of the possibility. “We all said this to her.” In a statement, Nielsen said she had a “productive and frank conversation” with lawmakers that included the administration’s reunification efforts. Members had a far different characterization, though. They said the meeting ended with few concrete answers and some unresolved issues.

Davis, 29, spent nearly two years as a senior policy adviser for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), focusing on transportation and infrastructure issues. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” “He had a larger than life presence and a passion for making others smile,” his obituary reads. “He was known for his altruistic disposition and could always be counted on to help family or friends in need. Even in the bleakest of conditions, he was someone who always saw the positive in life.” Davis is survived by his 3-year-old son, Alden, college sweetheart and wife, Caitlin O’Donnell Davis, parents and siblings.

Michael,Gordon,1265,https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Melbourne-Recital-Centre-Presents-BANG-ON-A-CAN-ALL-STARS-20180723,"'Bang on a Can is one of the few new-music names known around the world - for 30 years it has led the way with its bold programming and dynamic initiatives: the All-Stars, the People's Commissioning Fund and its annual Marathon.' Julian Day Bringing rock 'n' roll sensibilities to the realm of chamber music, Bang on a Can All-Stars explodes the boundaries between high art and pop art. With a massive repertoire of works written specifically for the group's distinctive instrumentation and style of performance, the All-Stars has become a genre unto itself, with its MEL&NYC performance at Melbourne Recital Centre a rare opportunity for Melbourne concert-goers to revel in the group's exceptional talents and inventiveness. Distinctive repertoire glimmers throughout the program, including commissions by Australian composers J.G. Thirlwell (Anabiosis, 2005) and Kate Moore (Ridgeway, 2009), and personal works by Bang on a Can co-founders David Lang and Michael Gordon. The eclectic program also features co-founder Julia Wolfe's Believing, inspired by lines in the John Lennon song 'Tomorrow Never Knows'; Philip Glass' 'Closing' (1981) from his iconic chamber piece Glassworks; and fan-favourite Horses of Instruction (Steve Martland, 1994), which WNYC described as 'a muscular jazz-funk summit between Reich and Stravinsky.' The roots of Bang on a Can's genius can be traced to David Lang, Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon's post-Yale University years in New York - a time when each was looking to kick-start their careers as composers. They made an incredible decision to try mixing composition with entrepreneurship by presenting a 12-hour new-music marathon at Exit Arts, a gallery at Broadway and Prince Street, in SoHo. With a structure in place, anything was possible, and tendrils sprang rapidly, with Bang on a Can All-Stars forming in 1992. Describing themselves as a part classical, part rock, part jazz group, the six-member amplified Ensemble has shattered the definition of what concert music is today. In the many years since its formation Bang on a Can has become an audacious institution that comprises festivals, marathon concerts, publishing, recording, teaching, commissioning, touring - you name it, and the Bang on a Can All-Stars are its virtuoso heartbeat. The group's celebrated projects include landmark recordings of Brian Eno's ambient cult classic Music for Airports and Terry Riley's In C, as well as performances with Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Don Byron, Owen Pallett and many others. Without a doubt, the Ensemble has come to mean much more to audiences than its music - bringing inspiration and a warm sense of community to everywhere it plays. 'The country's most important vehicle for contemporary music.' The San Francisco Chronicle 'A fiercely aggressive group, combining the power and punch of a rock band with the precision and clarity of a chamber ensemble.'

Michael,Gordon,1265,http://www.wabi.tv/content/news/Violence-in-homeless-camp-in-Bangor-causing-police-to-clear-area-489047891.html,"BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - ""All my stuff's packed. It's gone. It's in storage."" For the last two months, Eric Weyand says he's been living along the Penobscot River in a tent city of homeless people, an area that Bangor Police are getting ready to clear out. ""It's really the violence that forces us to act. We've had several acts of violence that have taken place at the campsite. Our goal is not to arrest or charge anybody with any crime but just get them to move out of the area for their own safety,"" says Sgt. Wade Betters with the Bangor Police Department. We were there last year when the area was cleared out. Betters says when people began moving back in, they were told by police it would be cleared out again if violence became a problem. ""We do let them camp and live down there unless things turn violent, and in this case repeatedly violent, so there's no choice left for us,"" he says. Police started warning people about two weeks ago they would need to find somewhere else to go and are helping them make connections with local resources. Walking along the path, you can see where people have left things behind. There are still some people left. Several we spoke with, including Weyand, say they are sad to go but understand why police are doing this. ""They've just been really tolerant. It's like they show up giving out gift cards. They just haven't been what you would assume."" He says it's new, younger people causing the problems. ""When the youngsters show up, there's a crowd of us that are older that, I hate to use the word regulate things, but these youngsters show up and they were like ODing every other day and what happened the other day was you know, you know, Adrien is a good guy."" We're told by people living in the tent city Adrien is the name of the man stabbed in a recent violent fight. Todd Bray says he got thrown when the fight broke out and broke his arm. ""It's to the point where it's gotten out of hand."" He says he understands. ""They're doing their jobs."" As for where he'll go? ""One of the local shelters or find another place in some other woods somewhere."" Michael Gordon is a homeless veteran. ""We're homeless people staying in a tent. We don't bother anyone, the good people, but the younger kids that come from out of state, come up here to do whatever. They make the good people look bad. They're bringing their drugs in. They're cooking crystal meth. They're shooting their heroin, whatever. It ruins it for the people that are the good people,"" he says. Gordon says he has another place to go to before police and public works come back to begin the clearing process, a move Betters says is hard given homelessness in the area. ""It's a big one to solve because there's a lot of barriers with mental health and substance abuse that prevent people from even utilizing the system the way it is, and that's why we've been so passionate about getting down there so often to say, hey these are the services that are available,"" says Betters.

For the year to June, New Zealand's annual imports increased by $6.02 billion to $59.55 billion, while exports rose by $5.65 billion to $55.52 billion - a deficit of $4.03 billion, according to Statistics New Zealand data. For the month of June, the trade balance slipped into a $113 million deficit, weaker than market and Westpac expectations of a $200 million surplus and ASB's expectations of a $100million surplus. ASB's senior rural economist Nathan Penny said the trade balance was weaker than expected and the June deficit was the largest in a decade. ''We expect the annual trade balance to narrow over the remainder of 2018, although higher oil prices will make the improvement gradual,'' he said in a statement. Mr Penny said lower-than-expected export values accounted for about two thirds of the surprise decline in the June deficit, to $113 million. ''In particular, dairy exports values were weaker than expected, with dairy export prices falling around 2%, whereas we had anticipated a small rise,'' he said. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said in seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose by 2.5% in June, which was a smaller gain than expected, although there no standout drivers behind the surprise. ''Exports of primary products were generally flat or lower, offset by a pickup in exports of manufactured goods,'' Mr Gordon said in a statement. Seasonally adjusted imports were up 6.8% for the month, mostly due to fuel. Oil imports dipped during the maintenance shutdown of the Marsden Point refinery in May, but the rebound in June was larger than expected. Imports of plant and machinery were now easing back after a strong run-up in late 2017 and early 2018, Mr Gordon said. SNZ's acting international statistics manager Dave Adair said the last June year surplus was in 2014, driven by high dairy export values.'' ''Exports dipped in 2015, leading to a deficit, which has widened since due to steadily rising imports,'' BusinessDesk reported. The latest rise in annual imports was led by $24billion of intermediate goods, up $3 billion from the year earlier, the Mr Adair said. Petroleum and products, excluding petrol, led the intermediate goods rise, up by $850 million. This was followed by parts of transport equipment, up $416 million, and parts of plant and machinery, up $413 million. The gain in annual exports was mostly due to an increase in dairy products, the country's largest export commodity group, which rose by $1.65 billion to $14.16 billion, BusinessDesk said. That was followed by a $1.01 billion gain in the value of meat and edible offal exports to $7.05 billion, and a $740 million increase in the value of forestry product exports to $4.96 billion. -Additional reporting by BusinessDesk simon.hartley@odt.co.nz This is just the start. Give labour a second term and the deficit will explode to unprecedented levels !

(WTXL) - A community is trying to heal after a 6-year-old boy in Madison County was hit and killed by a car. ""He enjoyed class, he loved to dance and he was easy to make friends with,"" said Tamisha Ealy, a teacher at Madison County Central School. Andrew Davis Jr. was the light of his classroom at Madison County Central School. ""He was a sweet little boy,"" Ealy said. ""He reminded me of my son actually because he was quiet and humble and very smart."" According to FHP, a driver was traveling north on Parramore avenue, approaching the intersection at Miller street. That's when FHP says the driver tried to avoid hitting 6-year-old Andrew Davis Jr. ""It devastated me because like I said he's an angel. He was very precious, very mannerable and to hear that someone that young passing away that you had an opportunity to interact with is very devastating,"" said Ealy. On Facebook, comments came pouring in about the loss of the child. ""Everyone made sure they were calling the family, calling people that interacted with this young boy to make sure that everyone was together and okay,"" Ealy explained. ""You know it just seemed like this is the most love I've seen in Madison County."" FHP says alcohol did not play a factor in the accident and charges are currently pending for the driver. Funeral services for Davis are scheduled for Saturday, July 28 at 11 a.m. at the Mount Zion AME Church. We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

Andrew,Davis,1264,http://www.gainesville.com/news/20180724/get-head-start-on-school-year,"The annual Stop the Violence/Back to School Rally — with free backpacks and more — takes place Saturday. Families can get a jump on the school year, gather tons of back-to-school information, receive backpacks filled with school supplies and learn to prevent violence in and out of school at the Stop the Violence/Back to School Rally Saturday. The 19th annual rally will be held from 10 a.m.-noon Saturday at the Santa Fe College gymnasium at 3000 NW 83rd St. The first day of school in Alachua County is Aug. 13. The rally is being hosted by People Against Violence Enterprises (PAVE) in partnership with Alachua County Public Schools. The Rev. Karl Anderson, founder of PAVE, said each year, the group partners with the school district to mesh PAVE’s Stop the Violence Rally and the school district’s Back to School Rally into one event. Jackie Johnson, spokeswoman for Alachua County Public Schools, said via a news release, the event is sponsored by various businesses and community organizations, including Meridian Behavioral Healthcare Inc. The goal is to give parents and students tips to prevent violence and help prepare for the upcoming school year. Anderson said this year, 2,500 free backpacks with school supplies will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, thanks to donations from Meridian and other sponsors. This year's theme, “See Something, Say Something, Do Something,” is aimed at encouraging students to speak up if they see or hear about suspicious activity, threats or other safety worries. Anderson said all of the county's school resource officers will be recognized and treated to a special lunch during the event. The event's focus this year will be on school shootings and how to stay safe. Alachua County Sheriff's Office Deputy Andrew Davis will conduct an abbreviated version of the ALICE (Alert, Lockdown, Inform, Counter, Evacuate) emergency incident training that all students and Alachua County schools staff will get at the start of the school year. “We pray it will never happen,” Anderson said, “but this a major problem that affects us all. And we all need to be prepared.” Davis said his presentation will be aimed at helping parents understand the training students, teachers and school staff will receive at the beginning of the school year. The training, which is age-appropriate, will be given by school resource officers to students in kindergarten through 12th grade in all Alachua County Public Schools. “The purpose is to inform parents,” Davis said. “I hope they understand why this is being given and the scope of what students will learn and feel more comfortable about the information students will be receiving.“ At the event, families also will receive back-to-school information and have an opportunity to pick up school calendars, school supply lists and information about after-school programs, the free and reduced-lunch program, dress codes and other information. They also will be able to mingle and enjoy entertainment. Among others, local agencies attending include Florida KidCare, a state health insurance for children from birth to 18 years of age; the Alachua County Health Department, which will offer free school immunizations and flu prevention information. Johnson recommends parents take advantage of the free immunizations the health department is offering at the rally and avoid last-minute hassles and long lines. Choose the plan that's right for you.

The 34-year-old beat Spain's Carlos Llavador 15-11 in the semi-final to guarantee a top-two finish – the best since Bill Hoskyns won silver in the men's epee 58 years ago. ""I'm delighted to win GBs first World Championships medal since 1965 and I hope it will inspire the next generation of British fencers,"" said Kruse. ""I thought I was very sharp today. The draw wasn't too bad for me and it was great to fence my teammate James (-Andrew Davis) in the last eight. ""I would like to thank Ziemek Wojciechowski, my coach for all his hard work over the years. I would also like to thank my sponsors and British Fencing for their continued support."" Kruse has been at four Olympic Games in his career and entered the Championships ranked fourth in the world giving him a bye through qualification. He overcame British teammate James-Andrew Davis in the quarter-final before a come-from-behind victory saw him edge out world number 23 Llavador in the final four. Kruse matched Foconi throughout the final and was level at 6-6 going into the final period but the Italian closed out a hard-fought victory to take the gold. Great Britain Team Manager Johnny Davis was delighted to see Kruse's hard-work come to fruition in China as he ended the long-wait for a medal on the world stage. He added: ""This medal is the culmination of years of dedication and hard work from both Richard and his coach and sets him up in a strong position for the start of the Olympic qualification period. ""Richard is considered one of the best fencers in the world to have never won a World Championship medal. That changed today. ""It was a privilege to see Richard perform today and confirming to everyone once again what a world class athlete he is.""

The 34-year-old world number four beat compatriot James-Andrew Davis to secure a medal and then lost 15-8 to Italy's Alessio Foconi in the final. It comes after British Fencing said its participation at Tokyo 2020 was in doubt after UK Sport withdrew funding. BBC Sport revealed in July a recent crowdfunding bid raised only £170. Find out how to get into fencing with our special guide. British Fencing chief executive Georgina Usher said at the time: ""Our chances of qualifying for the Olympics have been massively impacted. ""Our athletes have got the ability to get there, but are worrying about how they are going to afford competitions. There is no doubt in my mind that it has had an impact on their performances. ""In my lifetime, I can't remember a single moment in the history of sport whereby it has been so bleak. There has always been funding from other sources."" British Fencing received £4.2m in the build-up to the Rio Olympics, but was subsequently one of five sports to have its funding removed. Kruse narrowly missed out on the first British Olympic fencing medal in 52 years when he lost his bronze medal match in 2016. A UK Sport spokesperson said: ""Performance levels are reviewed annually and all Olympic and Paralympic sports are able to submit a case for funding if they can demonstrate evidence of medal-winning potential.""

Phillip,Frost,1262,https://news.fiu.edu/2018/07/frost-art-museum-welcomes-amateurs-to-their-monthly-drawing-salons/124545,"I always wanted to be an artist, I thought to myself as I drew a three-eyed goat climbing an abstract mountain of elongated leaves. I’m at the FIU Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum, which is hosting a drawing salon inspired by “Many Visions, Many Versions: Art from Indigenous Communities in India”, one of their current exhibitions on view. This calming event invites visitors to exercise the artistic part of their brains. Each monthly session is lead by an artist, museum educators or university faculty member and is held alongside an exhibition. The drawing salons are free and open to the community. The Jackfruit Tree by Manisha Jai (2012) Eager beginnings My youth was spent doodling, coloring, fingerpainting and collecting an endless assortment of glitter pens. In the hierarchy of honorable professions, the artist was always above all the rest to me. But beyond sparkling butterflies and the many homemade cards I made for parents, there was not much more to my talent. Still, art is for everyone, both those whose works captivate the world and those of us who simply want to craft something for our loved ones on a special day. I still love to paint at home when I need to de-stress and leave my mind for a much-needed vacation, but sometimes there’s just no time for it. “Many Visions, Many Versions” highlights the art from indigenous communities in India, such as the Gond and the Warli. Their mythical portrayals of animal life and symbolic imagery urge the grandest of questions. “This exhibition is a celebration of life,” said Emily Afre, education specialist at the Frost as she guided us through these intricate paintings. The other guests and I, who ranged in age and artistic ability, were all instructed to take inspiration in the exhibition’s overlapping themes of spirituality and creation and sketch an anthropomorphic animal similar to those hanging in front of us. Sketching away: Visitors of all ages sat in front of the art to work on their drawings. And so, we each took hold of a stool and our drawing materials, which were provided to us by the museum staff. We gravitated toward whichever work of art called out to us and let our hands get to work. A small group of children also sat quietly in concentration, staring at the art. I couldn’t help but picture myself doing the same a couple of years back had I come here at that age. Creatures of wonder I was intrigued by a collection of four drawings called “Fantastical Animals.” One of them showed a multi-headed sheep, another one featured a flamboyant owl with a leaf-shaped body. Traditional Indian music bounced off the museum’s tall white walls as we all focused on our drawings. I peeked to my sides and saw others sketching majestic trees, frogs, snakes and birds. “People of all artistic backgrounds can come and hang out in a relaxing environment,” said Miriam Machado, chief curator of education at the Frost. “It’s great because students with free time in between classes can come in and enjoy it. Art students can even add the drawings to their portfolios.” Adding some final touches to my drawing, I instinctively grazed the white graphite pencil against the black construction paper, building up a giant poofy cloud to crown over a tree that looked more like a broccoli stem. It doesn’t have to be perfect. I leaned back and had a look at my finished creation. Huh, not so bad, I thought. My finished drawing. Many Visions, Many Versions: Art from Indigenous Communities in India will be on view until Sept. 9. Patricia Cárdenas is an editorial intern at FlU News.

Phillip,Frost,1262,https://www.highbrowmagazine.com/9268-deconstructiona-reordering-life-politics-and-art-frost-art-museum,"To kick off its 10th anniversary celebrations, the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum FIU presents the premiere of Deconstruction: A Reordering of Life, Politics and Art featuring the work of 12 Miami artists: Eddie Arroyo, Zachary Balber, Frida Baranek, Christopher Carter, Leyden Rodriguez-Casanova, Yanira Collado, Gonzalo Fuenmayor, Pepe Mar, Glexis Novoa, Sandra Ramos, Jamilah Sabur and Frances Trombly. ""A Reordering of Life, Politics and Art"" comes from the prophetic messages in the 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle. More than 50 years ago, this book foreshadowed our reliance on isolating handheld technology and the 24-hour news cycle that dominates our times. The author Guy Debord warned about ""a future world where social interactions become too influenced by images that would prevent us from direct personal contact."" These 12 artists are boldly confronting global issues that are newsworthy, including current events in the frenetic social media stream. These artists open a window that allows us to step back and take a long, hard look at our world today. ﻿These works examine the theme of deconstruction - from current events in the frenetic social media stream to cross-cultural awakenings these artists have experienced in Miami. The exhibit runs July 14 – September 30. Atworks by artists (in order of appearance): Eddie Arroyo, Zachary Balber, Frida Baranek, Christopher Carter, Leyden Rodriguez-Casanova, Yanira Collado, Gonzalo Fuenmayor, Pepe Mar, Glexis Novoa, Sandra Ramos, Jamilah Sabur and Frances Trombly. Artist featured on main page: Craig Coleman. Highbrow Magazine More information about text formats by The Editors The works in this exhibition speak for the Caribbean’s indigenous peoples whose homes were fractured and divided by colonialism. These are spaces that were mercilessly exploited for labor and goods by distant European monarchies. This area also marks the site of one of the West’s first rebellions (the Haitian slave revolt which led to the independence of the island in 1804) and the Cuban War of Independence in 1898, a byproduct of the Spanish-American War. by Rae Ann Varona While Thanksgiving dishes have stayed the same at the core, it’s natural that they’ve picked up some changes and influences throughout the years. Think deep-fried or brined turkeys that became popular in the mid-1990s, truffled mashed potatoes and savory bread puddings during the transition to the 21st century, and the use of kale in almost all vegetable dishes in the more recent years. © Copyright Highbrow Magazine

Joe,Boulos,1259,http://www.northernpen.ca/living/oquinn-cars-with-history-will-be-entered-in-joe-macneil-antique-and-unique-car-show-228082/,"Susan O’Quinn considers it an honour to drive the 1964 Buick Electra that her deceased father, Clarence O’Quinn, left to her. “It’s also an honour to maintain it and preserve a piece of history, not to mention it beats renting a car while I’m home on vacation,” she said. Her dad got into classic cars late in life and, in addition to the Buick Electra convertible, he purchased a Lincoln Continental Mark V from a man in Fredericton, N.B. that was all original body and motor train and remains that way today. Related stories: Entrant impressed by uniqueness of MacNeil Car Show 'She’s my baby': Antique car owner from Stephenville speaks affectionately about his Galaxie That one went to his daughter Shana O’Quinn, who with Susan both live in Toronto, Ont. Home for a visit, Susan talked of her pride in the car her dad left her, which had been previously owned by Joe Boulos of Stephenville, better known as “The Music Man” for the business he ran for many years. The keychain that came with the car features The Music Man and, as Susan’s a music teacher, the irony is not lost on her the car made its way from a “music man” to a “music woman.” The car was also owned for some time by Conrad White of the former White’s Hotel in Stephenville before her dad purchased it and it was given its stunning pearl finish by the Late Ashley Skinner. The motor in the Electra was changed out after Clarence purchased it and, despite the block being dropped and some damage done, John McLean of Port au Port was able to spot the problem, fix it, and install the motor. Because of its white exterior and red trim, Susan said her dad always wanted her to be dressed in red and white when she got in the convertible. “Being a little rebellious I didn’t get many rides in the car back then but today, to be colour coded and in dad’s honour, I wear red and white when I go in the car,” she said. Shana’s car, the Continental Mark V is a personal luxury coupe marketed by the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company from the 1977 to 1979 model years in North America. At 230 inches long, the Mark V is the largest two-door coupe ever sold by Ford Motor Company. Susan has high praise for local antique car buff Tom Fitzpatrick who helps keep both vehicles running and for instructing her and Shana on maintaining them. “Dad entrusting these cars to us just goes to show that girls can have toys too,” she said. Both these classic automobiles will be featured in the Joe MacNeil Antique and Unique Car Show in Stephenville. While Susan will be heading back to Ontario before the car show, her sister Shana will be home at the time and their mom Mary O’Quinn also takes great pride in the two vehicles her husband took great interest in. Mary attended car shows with her husband in this province and in Nova Scotia.

Steve,Cummings,1256,http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/massif-central-a-chance-for-breakaways-but-no-time-off-for-the-gc-preview/,"Race leaders will have to stay on their toes for stages 14 and 15 As the 2018 Tour de France heads towards the end of its second week, the race moves from the Alps to the Massif Central for what is predicted to be a weekend for breakaways. So far, the main breakaway of the day has only succeeded in winning one stage, with Julian Alaphilippe's efforts into Le Grand-Bornand on stage 10. But the coming two stages should be a prime opportunity for the escapees to take the honours. Related ArticlesCalmejane wins Tour de France stage with panacheTwo-year extension for Calmejane at Direct EnergieTour de France: The Alps in review with Thomas, Dumoulin and Roglic - PodcastGeraint Thomas prepares for next yellow jersey battle at MendeHistory repeats itself with Thomas and Froome's leadership contest First up on Saturday is a lumpy stage 14 from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Mende, which features rolling terrain followed by four classified climbs at no higher than second category. The final ascent in Mende – the Côte de la Croix Neuve – may only be deemed to be a category 2 climb, but it's no joke: while only three kilometres in length, it averages a whisker over 10 per cent in gradient. The top of the climb comes 1.5km from the finish, allowing the weaker climbers to get back on, or the stronger time triallists to potentially take a few seconds. Team Sky directeur sportif Nicolas Portal expects any escapees to be successful, but it won’t be a day off for the general classification riders. ""It will be the breakaway that goes for the stage win, but behind them it will be a fight for the GC,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""On the short uphill in Mende, someone is going to try. Sometimes, if you can get 10 seconds on this climb, it's better than nothing. So, for us, it's going to be a case of being very focused on trying not to lose any time, and maybe gaining time."" The Mende finale last appeared at the 2015 Tour de France with Steve Cummings surprising a duelling Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. Cummings had been dropped by the two flyweight climbers, but his power worked to his advantage as he tracked them down over the top of the ascent. Back in the main pack, Chris Froome and Nairo Quintana came over the top together, but Froome was able to add another second to his lead over the Colombian with a faster sprint. Given his finishing move on top of Alpe d'Huez, Froome's Sky teammate Geraint Thomas could potentially pull out a couple of seconds on the line with his superior sprint. Perhaps third-placed Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) will utilise his time trialling skills to eke out a few of his own as the finish flattens out. As Portal says, 10 seconds is better than nothing at all. The Massif Central journey continues on Sunday with a 181-kilometre ride from Millau to Carcassonne. The three classified climbs – a third, a second and a first category one, in that order – are spread across the parcours. The final ascent of the Pic de Nore comes with just over 50 kilometres remaining before a long descent and a flat run to the line, with a final flick upwards before the line. The 12.3km-long category 1 Pic de Nore is a new addition to the Tour de France, with narrow roads and a long drag to the top with an average gradient of 6.3 per cent. There is one ramp of just over nine per cent, but much of the climb is a steady grind. French breakaway specialist Lilian Calmejane, of Direct Energie, is from France's Tarn department, where the climb is situated, and thinks that it could surprise a few people. ""This is a famous col in my region, but it's not a famous Tour de France climb,"" Calmejane told Cyclingnews. ""We climb it by a small, forest road, so I don't think anybody knows this climb very well, and I don't think that even the GC riders will have reconned this stage because it's a transition stage, so they could be surprised by it. ""It makes for a difficult stage, but I don't think it will be a particularly busy day for the riders chasing the overall classification. It's more a day for a breakaway, and for riders like me, I hope."" Portal is also from the south of France, from the nearby department of Gers, in the larger region of Occitanie. While Team Sky did not go to recon the stage, as Calmejane predicted, Portal has first-hand knowledge of the Pic de Nore, having climbed it several years ago. He believes that someone like Peter Sagan could take the stage if he chooses to go on the attack, and says that the general classification riders are unlikely to take too much out of the day. ""It would be quite complicated,"" he said when asked if any of the GC contenders could feasibly take time. ""The Pic de Nore is a climb I did when I was young, and is part of the Montagne Noire range. It's not an easy climb: it's got rough tarmac, and if the weather continues to be hot, then it could be terrible. ""It could be a good stage for Sagan because if he decides to go in the break, then he could win. He could use the team to drop some sprinters because it's pretty hard, and then, from the top, I think there are only around 40 kilometres to go, but that's just enough to possibly stay away. The race could be pretty full on from the bottom of the climb."" After three tough days in the high mountains, followed by a sprint day, stage hunters like Calmejane are eager for a piece of the pie. The 25-year-old, who won a stage at last year's Tour, has already been on the attack numerous times in this year's race, but he has been eyeing up this weekend in particular. ""I'm quite tired, like everybody in the peloton,"" Calmejane admitted. ""But the stages on Saturday and Sunday are two stages that I've reconned and in fact already know very well. They suit me much better than the big mountains."" Team Sky hold the first two positions in the overall classification, with Thomas holding the yellow jersey with a 1:39 advantage over Froome. Sunweb's Dumoulin is very close behind, only 11 seconds down on Froome. At the start of the Tour, Sky had said that they were 100 per cent behind Froome but Thomas' performance has earned him equal billing with the defending champion. Portal says neither has more support than the other, and that having two riders at the top of the GC is the best possible scenario. ""For us, it's a pretty good situation: we have two cards to play. I always say that, but it's true,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""Maybe at the beginning it was more about Froome, but now, to be honest, Thomas has shown that he's super-strong, and who knows how long he can hold it? He doesn't even know. ""It's the same for Froome, coming from the Giro. Who knows how long he can perform? He could pay the price. At the moment, it looks pretty good because we are in first and second, but let's see what the road brings. We need to support them both,"" said Portal.

Steve,Cummings,1256,https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/tour-de-france/played-hard-can-went-jasper-stuyven-goes-agonisingly-close-victory-tour-stage-14-387593,"""Afterwards you always say 'if, if' but I played as hard as I could,"" says defeated Stuyven Jasper Stuyven on stage 14 of the Tour de France (Image: Sunada) Belgian Jasper Stuyven’s massive 32-kilometre solo attack brought him agonizingly close to a Tour de France victory at Mende’s airstrip on stage 14. The Trek-Segafredo rider “played hard” with his solo bid, but his legs were unable to push out enough watts to keep him free on the steep slopes leading to the airstrip where Brit Steve Cummings last won in 2015. Stuyven was part of a large early escape that contained as many as 32-men and included the likes of Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgrohe), Greg Van Avermaet (BMC), Philippe Gilbert and Alaphilippe (Quick-Step). The group had over 7 minutes on the peloton with 90 kilometres remaining. When Stuyven attacked the group, his breakaway companions pulled him back at two kilometres remaining, right before the climb reached the runway finish. “I felt good on the climbs, then Gorka Izagirre went. I had a plan to go early enough because I have nothing to lose,” Stuyven said. When he had Gorka Izagirre (Bahrain Merida) and Tom-Jelte Slagter (Dimension Data) for company, he caught them distracted and went. “I had three in the front, and when they were discussing, I went all-in to go for it. I had a good gap, but not good enough.” “Afterwards you can always say ‘if, if’ but I played as hard as I could and went all-in.” The final climb is also known as the Montée Frenchman Laurent Jalabert thanks to the Frenchman winning the national jersey on its debut in the Tour. The ascent pitches up at 10.2 per cent over three kilometres. “After the first steep kilometre, I still believed in it because I had a good gap, but I felt my legs were empty. I tried to keep going and keep the cadence high, but the last steep kilometre of the climb, I was really dying.” Cycling Weekly magazine November 15 2018 issue, on sale from Thursday priced £3.25 Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

Bob,Diamond,1254,http://www.atimes.com/italian-banker-dodges-queries-on-africa-deals/,"The chairman of Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, Gian Maria Gros-Pietro, says he knows nothing of his bank’s involvement in co-financing Atlas Merchant Capital’s takeover of Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) or the pan-African Africell mobile-telephone network in cooperation with the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Sources in Washington say Intesa Sanpaolo has expressed interest in entering a co-financing deal with OPIC on the two mega African M&A deals: The circa US$1 billion takeover of Africell – the Beirut-based Lintel Group of Companies’ mobile-phone carrier with subsidiaries in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo and The Gambia – and former Barclays Bank chief executive officer Bob Diamond’s move to take control of Union Bank of Nigeria. Diamond has teamed up with the Dubai-based founder of Atlas Mara, Ashish Thakkar, to create a pan-African universal bank network that currently has banking operations in Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania, and now a major presence in Nigeria through UBN. Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing two African deals with OPIC – now a strategic arm of US President Donald Trump’s administration’s use of private-sector investment in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia as a national-security objective – could cement Italy’s role as the United States’ closest NATO ally. However, it is understood that OPIC and Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing talks are being led by former Intesa Sanpaolo CEO Corrado Passera through his €600 million (US$698 million) Italian SME lending startup Spaxs. Diamond, through Atlas Merchant, is the largest investor in Spaxs. Intesa Sanpaolo spokesman Stefano Lucchini said he had no knowledge of Passera’s or Bob Diamond’s involvement with Intesa Sanpaolo. An Intesa Sanpaolo source said the bank’s London operations had looked at co-financing the UBN and Africell deals along with OPIC. Italian banks, as with Italian companies in general, are top-down institutions in which the board of directors is directly informed of almost any strategic or potentially controversial activity. While co-financing with OPIC carries little risk as the underlying investments are guaranteed by the US government, any involvement by Intesa Sanpaolo with a US government agency such as OPIC could be easily misconstrued by the Italian press harking back to past US-government-connected Italian banking scandals such as the bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano (Vatican/IOR) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro’s Iraqgate scandal. However, Intesa San Paolo co-financing OPIC deals in Africa, Central Asia and North Africa is likely to be raised during Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s meeting with Trump on July 30, sources close to the matter said.
