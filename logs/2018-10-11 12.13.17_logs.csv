FLORENCE — A complaint filed by the owners of Stricklin Hotel against its downtown neighbor, FloBama Music Hall, has been dismissed. Court records indicate Lauderdale County Circuit Judge Benjamin R. Graves signed two orders on Sept. 18 dismissing the noise ordinance complaint against Andrew Davis and FloBama, as well as supplemental defendants, the City of Florence, Florence Police Chief Ron Tyler and City Prosecutor Heath Trousdale. In a joint stipulation requesting dismissal of the suit, plaintiffs' attorney John Saylor stated his clients have reached an ""amicable and confidential resolution of their dispute"" and therefore he asked that the case be dismissed. ""I am not at liberty to give the details of that settlement; however, it was reached by mutual agreement,"" Saylor said. Efforts Monday to reach Davis and his attorney, Jim Stanphill, of Florence, were unsuccessful. The owners of Stricklin Hotel, a boutique hotel located next door to FloBama, filed a complaint July 20, claiming loud music coming from the business late at night was negatively impacting the hotel's customers, and could damage future business. On Aug. 3, Davis and hotel owners Darren Rhodes and Jim Cunningham released a joint statement concerning the court action. In the statement, the owners stated they were working together in good faith to resolve any differences. Due to the confidentiality agreement, Saylor cannot discuss how the two businesses came to terms. ""Both parties are satisfied and live music is alive and well, as it always has been in downtown Florence,"" Saylor said. Saylor said the terms of the settlement are being kept confidential to protect the parties. Court records indicate the complaint against Florence, the police chief and city prosecutor was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning the plaintiff is barred from bringing a new action against the defendants on the same claim. The complaint against Davis and FloBama, however, was dismissed ""without prejudice,"" which means the claim could be filed again. According to the judge's order: ""This court will retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the terms of the parties' settlement agreement and mutual releases."" In their original complaint, Stricklin Hotel owners suggested FloBama add additional insulation to the wall adjacent to the hotel building; detach the stage from the wall adjoining the hotel; or use other sound-dampening materials to prevent sound from penetrating the adjoining building. ""We are very pro live music and we feel live music is part of the fabric of our community, part of the success of downtown Florence,"" Saylor said. ""We are pleased with the outcome. Obviously, we never wanted to go this far."" Efforts to reach city attorney Billy Musgrove were unsuccessful Monday. City Council President Dick Jordan said the issue was between Stricklin Hotel owners and FloBama. The council president said he was happy the complaint was settled. ""I think it's good for everyone that they were able to work that out among themselves,"" Jordan said. ""It's beneficial to everyone. Both of them add to the livability of our downtown."" russ.corey@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5738. Twitter @TD_.RussCorey Your comment has been submitted. Reported There was a problem reporting this.

Andrew,Davis,b'1758',http://floridapolitics.com/archives/277092-ken-hagan-stacy-white-crushing-competition-in-hillsborough-co-commission-campaign-cash,"Two Hillsborough County Commission races look like they might be landslides based on campaign finance activity. Incumbents Ken Hagan and Stacy White are crushing their opponents in the money battle. Hagan has raised more than $500,000 in bid against Democrat Angela Birdsong for the District two seat covering north Hillsborough County currently held by Victor Crist. Crist is running for Hagan’s District 5 countywide seat. North Hillsborough, which includes both rural and suburban areas, is historically conservative and Hagan has won it before. He won that seat in 2002, 2004 and 2008. Birdsong has raised just $30,000 and has less than $200 remaining in her campaign account. Hagan isn’t wasting time with infusing his campaign with nickel and dime contributions. Nearly half of his 36 contributions during the last two weeks of September were $1,000, the maximum allowed. Most of his latest campaign haul came from real estate professionals and developers, followed by construction and contracting businesses, engineering and consulting. All of Birdsong’s contributions came from individual donors, not corporations, groups or business. Hagan spent $4.300 during the latest campaign reporting period including on advertising with La Gaceta for $231 and various campaign support staff. Birdsong spent $7,800 with most of that going to Blue Ticket Consulting in St. Petersburg for advertising. White, the Hillsborough County Commission District 4 incumbent, is also stomping his opposition in campaign cash. The Republican has raised more than $200,000 for his reelection to his highly conservative east and south Hillsborough seat. Those contributions were largely high dollar with more than half of his 20 contributions during the last two weeks of September at $1,000 each. Not one contribution was less than $100. Checks came largely from real estate and construction and development professionals and businesses. His Democratic opponent, Andrew Davis, has raised just over $10,000 to date and spent all but $1,100 of that. Davis brought in just $100 during the latest reporting period. He spent $1,800 on yard signs and printing. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Website Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Andrew,Davis,b'1758',http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6586119-151/bend-council-candidates-debate-bike-lanes-mirror-pond,"Several candidates for the Bend City Council talked about transportation issues and Mirror Pond dredging during a wide-ranging debate Tuesday at 10 Barrel Brewing’s east-side pub. The candidates for position 5 are Andrew Davis, student life director at Central Oregon Community College; Gena Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association; and Victor Johnson, a musician. The position 6 candidates are Barb Campbell, a sitting city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop; Sarah McCormick, a stay-at-home mother; and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, a community activist. Boozell missed the debate because he’s in jail through December for failing to pay child support. McCormick was absent because she was celebrating Canada’s Thanksgiving with her in-laws. But she recorded a video that aired at the start of the debate in which she said she was running because she was worried about her children’s safety downtown because of an “increasingly aggressive homeless population” and worried that Campbell was too concerned with national hot-button issues. Mirror Pond A private group that owns the land under Mirror Pond has spent more than a year seeking contributions from the city, the Bend Park & Recreation District, Pacific Power and private donors in order to pay the $6.7 million cost of dredging decades’ worth of accumulated silt from the pond. A few city councilors and park board members plan to meet later this fall to discuss ways the two governments could contribute. Johnson said everyone should split the cost. Davis agreed, saying the city, park district and homeowners along that section of river have an obligation to pay because Mirror Pond is an important part of the city. “Growing up in Bend, you couldn’t not know Mirror Pond,” Davis said. The city needs to remember that private owners own the land under Mirror Pond, and should figure out how to pay for dredging, Goodman-Campbell said. Old Mill District developer Bill Smith and Taylor Northwest Construction company owner Todd Taylor received the land several years ago. “I’ve been a little bit frustrated watching the city take up time and resources and staff discussing how the city should contribute when I don’t even know that the city should,” Goodman-Campbell said. Pacific Power’s dam, which created the pond, also created the problem of accumulated silt, Campbell said. She compared Pacific Power to a local wood chips company that the city cited when it let wood chips pile up, and said other businesses pay to clean up messes when they make them. Instead of cleaning up its own mess, Pacific Power is trying to get tax money to pay for it, Campbell said. She said she won’t support any city funding for the silt removal. Transportation planning Candidates were asked how they’d reconcile transportation for people who want to bike and people who want to drive. Campbell said she was excited about neighborhood greenways, which the city is now trying on NE Sixth Street and NW 15th Street. Greenways mean bicyclists can spend less time using bike lanes on busy streets, she said. “You take the thoroughfare and you go a block away, onto the residential street where traffic is already slower,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell said they’re both excited about partnering with the park district on ways to provide better-connected paths for bikers and pedestrians, especially on new, undeveloped land that Bend will plan and annex during the next several years. Johnson said he’d want to see more connected bike paths that will make it possible for people to safely bike from one side of town to the other. “We could structure downtown to be more bike friendly and pedestrian friendly,” he said. More than 80 percent of commuters drive with one or two occupants in their cars, Davis said. He said the city should keep high rates of driving in mind while planning, but also make sure new roads are wide enough and have adequate bike lanes. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806411,0,2018-10-11 12:13:10,False

Bob,Diamond,b'1757',http://www.cityam.com/265232/ten-pin-titan-hoping-bowl-over-investors-dividend-hike,"Quality journalism is not free. To access this content, please disable your adblocker or pay for an access pass: 24 hours 1 month pass UK ten-pin giant Hollywood Bowl Group is flirting with the idea of returning a surplus to investors this morning after revealing a rise in annual revenues in a trading update today. The bowling operator reported like-for-like revenue growth of 1.8 per cent in the 12 months to the end of September this year, adding that it expects pre-tax profit will have grown by 10 per cent over the same period. Shares jumped more than four per cent in early morning trading, as the group said it would return the excess cash from its profits to shareholders, providing it decides not to snap up any more expected short-term acquisitions this year. Read more: Panmure Gordon grows profits after Bob Diamond-led takeover Hollywood Bowl Group’s chief financial officer, Laurence Keen, told City A.M. the company was “very pleased with the results”, as it looks to continue its long-term investments. Keen said: “Throwing a metal object at 10 wooden sticks is pretty simple, and people only use us on average 1.3/1.4 times a year, but that is fine with us because we have such a wide appeal.” The group’s results come in the wake of a modest expansion programme which has seen the operator open up an average of two new outlets a year, most recently in Dagenham and Yeovil. * Terms and conditions",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1015016,0.9630101568145125,0,2018-10-11 12:13:10,False
