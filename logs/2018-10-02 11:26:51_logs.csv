Andrew,Davis,b'1704',https://sportscar365.com/sro/igtc/additional-gt4-teams-commit-to-california-8h/,"GMG Racing, PF Racing among confirmed additions to California 8 Hours in GT4 class… by Photo: Brian Cleary/PWC An additional six entries have been confirmed for the California 8 Hours at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, with nearly a dozen total GT4 cars now due to take part in the Oct. 26-28 race. Newly crowned Pirelli World Challenge GTS champions GMG Racing have confirmed a single-car Audi R8 LMS GT4 entry for Andrew Davis, Jason Bell and team owner James Sofronas, who swept all three of the PWC titles this year. PF Racing, meanwhile, will field a Ford Mustang GT4 for Jade Buford, Scott Maxwell and James Pesek, with Ian Lacy Racing confirming Drew Staveley, Ian Lacy and Frank Gannett in one of its Ginetta G55 GT4 cars. BMW will be represented by at least two M4 GT4 entries, fielded by Stephen Cameron Racing and RHC Jorgenson-Strom Racing, with Murillo Racing committing a Mercedes-AMG GT4 for Matt Fassnacht and former PWC TCA champion Christian Szymczak. Additionally, Rearden Racing has entered an Audi R8 LMS GT4 with a yet-to-be-determined driver lineup. The confirmed additions join the previously announced entries from Team Panoz Racing and Automatic Racing for the Intercontinental GT Challenge season finale. It will result in at least seven GT4 manufacturers being represented on the grid, which will also feature GT3, Cup class and TCR machinery. While an entry list has not yet been released, it’s understood a total of 31 cars are currently entered.

Contact John Patrick October 1, 2018 at 5:31 pm Looking forward to seeing the entry list. Definitely a testimate to which GT4 cars are all around the best – an 8-hour enduro! The Camaro GT4, I don’t think, has been mentioned, yet. Coupled with the fact that none of those cars have run the 4-hour IMSA enduro’s, I would like to see how that car’s reliability stacks up to the rest… NotJohnDagys October 1, 2018 at 6:18 pm Just figuring these entries will pull teams away from Sebring’s November race…. KMW October 2, 2018 at 3:57 am Last year’s race was actually very entertaining. Lead changed with about 20 minutes to go. With a race of this length, there is plenty of time to walk the whole course and enjoy every corner. And you won’t have to fight any crowds. Apparently this race is too esoteric for the casual fan. The hardcore will be there. daedalus October 2, 2018 at 4:20 am This year seems to be a race worth watching. The GT3 will get strung out after the first hour so I’m glad there are so many GT4 entries this year to keep things interesting. Your email address will not be published.

Sara,Burns,b'1703',https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/officers-killed-in-fredericton-shooting-honoured-at-ottawa-ceremony-1.4115776,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement Two Fredericton police officers who were killed in a shooting nearly two months ago were among the six officers to be honoured in Ottawa for making the ultimate sacrifice. Six Canadian police officers who died in the line of duty were honoured on Sunday in front of hundreds of colleagues at the 41st annual Police and Peace Officers' Memorial Service outside Parliament Hill. Among them were Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello. Burns and Costello were killed on the morning of Aug. 10 in a shooting at an apartment complex in Fredericton. Two civilians -- Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright – were also killed. The suspect in the shooting, Matthew Vincent Raymond, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. His next court date is scheduled for Oct. 22. Both Costello’s and Burns’ families were at the ceremony in Ottawa, but were too emotional to speak with reporters. “They're doing as well as can be expected,” said Fredericton Police Chief Leanne Fitch. “They are incredible families and I think this has been a very healing event for all of us.” In 1998, the federal government officially proclaimed the last Sunday of September as Police and Peace Officers’ National Memorial Day. In a statement, Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale acknowledged the police officers’ “self-sacrifice and dedication to their noble professions.” “Police and Peace Officers' National Memorial Day is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the vital role police and peace officers play in our society and to honour those who have sacrificed their lives in carrying out their duties,” he said. “It is also an opportunity to think of their families and loved ones, and to extend to them our thoughts and prayers."" The other four officers who were honoured on Sunday included: All six names will be added to Honour Roll tablets on Parliament Hill, which already include the names of more than 860 fallen officers in Canada. With a report from CTV Ottawa’s Megan Shaw A cool + cloudy day in Ottawa, but the National Police+Peace Officer Memorial Service was both moving + impressive. Thousands gathered to pay tribute to fallen officers. #HeroesInLife #WeRemember pic.twitter.com/RfJhV0EyP6 A police officer adjusts her hat before the Canadian Police and Peace Officers Memorial Service on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018.
