The candidates are former Selectman Jack Spanbauer and Heath Cummings, who formerly worked as the school police officer at Pioneer Valley Regional School. The term is three years. The contested seat has been held by Julia Blyth for the last three years. She did not seek nomination this time, explaining that she wanted to prioritize her time differently. Jack Spanbauer has served on the Selectboard for about 16 years since 2000, having taken a few years off at times for different reasons, he said. Most recently he was on the board until May 2018, but did not run for re-election last year for health reasons and because of disagreements with the town administration policy at the time, he said. Spanbauer is now on the Business Park Committee. Previously he was on the Finance Committee and several special purpose committees, including the Master Plan Committee, he said. “I thought I’d offer my experience to serve the town again,” Spanbauer said. He did not cite a more particular reason for his interest in the position, saying that he has “no concerns or complaints” about the current Selectboard. Heath Cummings has lived in Northfield for seven years, he said. Starting in September 2017, he worked for the Northfield Police Department as the resource officer at Pioneer Valley Regional School. He resigned in October 2018, and now works for the Gill-Montague Regional School District as the facilities and energy director. Cummings grew up in Erving, and worked for the Erving Police Department for 17 years before joining the Northfield department in 2017. “I saw how the town works from the inside out,” Cummings said of his time with the Northfield Police Department. “I saw a lot of room for improvement, and how my skills can be used for those improvements.” Specifically, he cited “turmoil” in Town Hall, and said that his professional experience as a team-builder could bring more cohesion to the town’s government. The other 15 positions on the ballot are uncontested. All terms are for three years, except for the Planning Board term, which is five years. ■One assessor — Robert MacEwan ■Two Board of Health members — Philip Baker, FloreSadri ■Two library trustees — Margot Fleck, Deborah Potee ■One Planning Board member — Richard Fitzgerald ■Two Recreation Commission members — Theresa Quinn-Tsipenyuk, Joseph Stacy ■Four constables — David Brassor, Fredd Fuller, Albert Stone, John Ware ■One Sewer Commission member — Dan Gray ■One Veterans Memorial trustee (veteran) — Francis Froment ■One Veterans Memorial trustee (non-veteran) — Raymond Zukowski. New candidates can also be nominated by petition. Nomination papers are available at the Town Clerk’s Office, and must be returned to the Town Clerk’s Office by 5 p.m. on Friday. A petition requires 20 signatures of Northfield voters. Town Clerk Dan Campbell recommends more than 20, in case any signatures cannot be verified.

Diamond, a senior investment banker at the time, wanted to raise money privately to keep it afloat. He was thought to be concerned about his future and that of chief executive John Varley if Barclays fund-raised publicly. Diamond reportedly told a meeting: 'This is about saving jobs – mine and John's.' Richard Boath, a former Barclays executive on trial for fraud alongside Varley, claimed Diamond was against public fundraising efforts because it would have hurt his credibility. Boath, Varley and former colleagues Tom Kalaris and Roger Jenkins are accused of fraud over payments to Qatari investors. They deny the charges. Diamond is not accused of any wrongdoing.

John,O'Neil,2612,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/03/07/judge-lifts-stay-that-temporarily-blocked-ogunquit-recall-election/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The lawsuit that seeks to prevent such a vote is moving forward quickly, and so is the citizen effort to hold such a vote. A York County Superior Court judge this week lifted a stay that had temporarily blocked preparations for a recall election in Ogunquit, but the court still must decide on a lawsuit seeking to block the vote. The stay was issued in February, hours before the Ogunquit Select Board was scheduled to set a date for a recall election targeting Chairman Charles “Bunky” Waite, Madeline Mooney and Robert Winn Jr. The contentious recall effort, launched after the firing of the Ogunquit fire chief, has divided the small town and fueled a series of angry town meetings. Superior Court Justice John O’Neil on Monday lifted the temporary stay and outlined the future proceedings in a lawsuit filed against the town by residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn. The plaintiffs and town had agreed to the temporary stay, according to court records. The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the town from moving forward with the recall election, arguing that there are a number of problems with the recall petitions and the way the process was handled by town officials. The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction to stop an election from being held, as well as a declaratory judgment ordering the town to take no further actions related to the recall. O’Neil said the court would not rule on a pending motion for a temporary restraining order because both the plaintiffs and defendant had consented to the temporary stay. He also laid out an expedited schedule to hear the case, with written discovery due by March 22. Briefs must be filed by April 1 and oral arguments are expected to be held the following week. O’Neil also granted a motion for intervenor status to Jerry DeHart, an Ogunquit resident who circulated recall petitions. Stephen Langsdorf, an attorney from Preti-Flaherty who represents the plaintiffs, said that O’Neil’s order outlines an unusually expedited schedule that will allow time for oral arguments and a ruling before an election would be held, even if an election date is set by the Select Board at its next regular meeting on March 19. The charter says a recall election must be held 45 to 60 days from the date the board calls for a vote. Langsdorf said he and his clients had been concerned about an election being held before the judge ruled on the lawsuit. “We thought that would be an untenable situation,” he said. “It’s reasonable that the court will rule before there would be an actual election.” Langsdorf said O’Neil’s order “clearly recognized we’ve shown there are irregularities” in the petition and certification process. Town Clerk Chris Murphy determined the recall petitions contained 257 valid signatures to recall Mooney, 259 signatures to recall Waite and 253 signatures to recall Winn. Take Back Ogunquit, the group that launched the recall effort, was required to submit 215 signatures for each Select Board member it seeks to recall. Under the town charter, the Select Board has 10 days after receiving the certified recall petitions to schedule the election. If the Select Board fails to call the election, the town charter allows for it to be called by a notary public if petitioners submit to that person a written petition with the number of signatures equal to at least 10 percent of the number of signatures on the certified recall petition. Town Manager Patricia Finnigan did not respond to multiple requests for comment Thursday. DeHart said he was happy with the O’Neil’s order because it will allow the recall election process to move forward. Recall supporters plan to have a notary public call the election within the next few days. “(O’Neil) obviously felt it important to let the voters be heard and we’re going to do just that,” DeHart said. “We’ll have a free and fair election for recall and the voters will decide.” Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

Andrew,Davis,2602,https://news.uga.edu/suntrust-foundations-entrepreneurship-gift/,"SunTrust Foundation, SunTrust Trusteed Foundations enhance student entrepreneurial opportunities at UGA. A $500,000 gift from the SunTrust Foundation and the SunTrust Trusteed Foundations will support the University of Georgia’s Entrepreneurship Program. The gift will help launch a student incubator/accelerator space and provide support for the student-led UGA Kickstart Fund. The renovated UGA Student Entrepreneurship Center, Studio 225, scheduled to open in March and located at 225 W. Broad St. in downtown Athens, will serve as a focal point for student innovation. Providing student support for the entrepreneurial ecosystem at UGA, the dynamic space will help students in all majors cultivate original ideas, propel business startups, and engage with industry partners. It will house Entrepreneurship Program faculty and steer students toward an understanding of best practices as they develop their ideas. The UGA Kickstart Fund is a student-led and privately funded program providing seed grant money for student and faculty startups. Students and faculty can apply to receive grant support for entrepreneurial pursuits. This gift will supply students with the hands-on experience of managing, investing and tracking investments in a controlled environment. A program of this nature equips tomorrow’s leaders with the skills necessary to run revenue-generating companies. “SunTrust Foundation and SunTrust Trusteed Foundations are pleased to join with the UGA Entrepreneurship Program to build out the UGA Entrepreneurship student incubator in the newly designated Innovation District of Athens, while also enhancing the student-led Kickstart Fund,” said Jenna Kelly, president, SunTrust Bank Georgia Division. “We share a common purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being for all students enrolled at UGA. This grant is another example of our dynamic partnership with UGA, and how our teams collaborate in deliberate ways to benefit the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.” The Entrepreneurship Certificate Program has grown from 33 students in 2015 to more than 420 students this past spring. “This momentum will continue thanks to this generous gift,” said Jill Walton, executive director of corporate and foundation relations at UGA. “The SunTrust Foundation and the SunTrust Trusteed Foundations’ gift will provide students the opportunity to lay the groundwork for building a new business, all while still attending UGA.” This gift highlights the growing momentum surrounding innovation and entrepreneurship at the University of Georgia. UGA President Jere W. Morehead recently announced plans to establish a vibrant innovation district at the interface of North Campus and downtown Athens. The district will include an interconnected set of facilities offering a broad range of spaces and amenities to expand innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology-based economic development. Studio 225 represents the first phase of this new development.

Jane,Powers,2604,https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/wolf-wall-street-townhouse-sells-12-65-million,"Alan Wilzig, the race car driving banker known for inspiring a character in Martin Scorsese’s film “The Wolf of Wall Street,” is in contract to sell his New York townhouse for $12.65 million, dramatically less than its original nearly $44 million asking price. Mr. Wilzig admitted that the price cut had less to do with the downturn in the high-end real estate market in New York than with his “pie in the sky” pricing strategy when he listed the property in 2014. He said at the time he hadn’t wanted to sell but had been motivated by some of the aggressive price-tags he’d seen in the area. He wanted to “see if some Chinese billionaire wanted to live in Tribeca bad enough,” he said. Adam Friedberg for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Wilzig said he didn’t get serious about selling the property until he lowered the price to under $20 million in 2017, following his divorce. Until then, he wouldn’t have sold “without being paid such a stupid amount of money compared to what it’s worth,” he said. In the end he made out okay. Mr. Wilzig paid $3.35 million for the roughly 6,500-square-foot home, located on Hubert Street in Tribeca, in the mid-2000s and put roughly $1.5 million into building out the interiors, he said. The townhouse-style home has four bedrooms, a 32-foot-wide great room with an onyx fireplace, an 800-square-foot patio, a media room, a spa and its own private extra-wide garage. When it was first listed, the home drew attention for features such as alligator handrails and a 550-gallon aquarium filled with white butterfly koi, but Mr. Wilzig said he had later toned down the decor to appeal to a wider pool of buyers. He had been looking to sell it because he had been spending more time at his farm in Taghkanic, N.Y., where he has a 40-foot-wide Grand Prix racing track he built in 2010 at a cost of roughly $7.5 million—about half of the $15 million cost for the property, he told The Wall Street Journal in 2016. Mr. Wilzig said he is looking for a rental in the city in the $20,000 to $25,000 a month range and is relieved to have parted with the townhouse, since it gives him more financial freedom. Adam Friedberg for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Wilzig is an investor and the former CEO of the Trust Company of New Jersey. He has retired from professional driving, he said. His connection to “The Wolf of Wall Street,” while touted widely, is largely tangential. In the film, the character he inspired is depicted introducing Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), to his girlfriend (played by Margot Robbie), who later became Mr. Belfort’s second wife. Jane Powers of Douglas Elliman brokered the deal on behalf of Mr. Wilzig, who identified the buyer as a wealthy Brazilian family. Your message is on its way.

A veteran prosecutor and advocate for crime victims, Frei was recently promoted to chief of trials in the office. Staff Writer Deputy District Attorney Michelle Frei, center, is seen speaking to the media following the sentencing in December of the Delaware County man who shot and killed a Westtown teenager. A veteran prosecutor and advocate for crime victims, Frei was recently promoted to chief of trials in the office. WEST CHESTER — Ask Michelle Frei who her favorite teacher was, and she replies immediately. “My history teacher at Pennsbury High School, Mr. Devlin,” she answers without hesitation. “He was awesome. He didn’t just stand there and lecture. He talked to you. But he made you work. Class participation was a must. There was a lot of discussion, And he made you think. He challenged you intellectually.” And although Frei has moved on from teacher Ed Devlin’s classroom at the Bucks County high school she graduated from, the idea of teaching as an engagement of ideas, and not simple rote recitation of dry facts, has not been left behind in the dust of her memories. Frei, in her role as a Chester County prosecutor, continues to pass on, both formally and informally, instruction on the knowledge of the legal — and real — world she has come to know since joining the District Attorney’s Office in 2000. Now, her role in the office as an unofficial mentor will become more formalized, as she takes over the position as chief deputy district attorney for trials, a position held for the past six years by prosecutor Ronald Yen. The promotion was announced last week by District Attorney Tom Hogan. “She is a fierce advocate for victims and a formidable adversary for criminals,” Hogan said in a press release marking the move. “She never quits on a case, no matter how difficult the circumstances. She has the respect of her colleagues and the judges.” Yen requested to move to part-time status, continuing to prosecute individual cases but divesting himself of the administrative duties of chief deputy. In her new role, Frei will assume responsibility for supervising all of the trial courtrooms, assigning cases to individuals prosecutors and courtroom while also assisting assistant district attorneys with the presentations to judges and juries. Like Yen, however, she will also prosecute selected cases. “As a career prosecutor, I am excited, grateful, and honored for the opportunity,” she said last week in the press release. “I will strive to continue the commitment to high ethical standards, seeking justice for all of our victims, and fair treatment for criminal defendants maintained by my predecessors. It is a privilege to work for the citizens of Chester County.” Frei, 47, said her primary advice to those colleagues she serves with is simple. “Rule number one is that you need to be prepared,” she said in an interview at the county Justice Center. You need to be honest with the court. We all make mistakes, but you have to own it.” Frei has drawn praise from those she tutored in and out of the courtroom. “Thankfully, as a young prosecutor, I was guided by Michelle,” said Andrew Davis, a former assistant district attorney now in private practice. “Whether discussing case resolution options, honing opening and closing statements, or generally imparting advice and legal knowledge, Michelle spent hours mentoring me as a young prosecutor, as she has many others, which laid the foundation for our legal careers.” That process of mentoring is less formal, though equally as rewarding, as the other side of Frei’s professional work — teaching fledgling officers at the Montgomery County Municipal Police Academy and the Temple University Law Enforcement Academy. She began work as an instructor in 2005, and has led classes in subjects as wide ranging as Constitutional Law and Rules of Criminal Procedure. “It is so rewarding to see those kids that you had in class becoming working partners in law enforcement,” she said, naming graduates who now work in municipal police departments in the county or for the Chester County Sheriff’s Office. “I believe there is a process in any profession when you move from being a student, to being a practitioner, to being a mentor, and ultimately being an instructor.” One of the more important classes that Frei has taught for many years is Domestic Violence Investigation, in which she leads police recruits through the often messy world of violent attacks in the home — boyfriend on girlfriend, girlfriend on boyfriend, husband on wife, parent on child. Frei’s involvement with such cases came in her first assignment in the county, as one of two prosecutors from the DA’s Office to a Domestic Violence Unit. In it, she worked with multiple police departments and judges in beginning the first true modern approach to such cases. She has continued to work domestic violence prosecutions, as well as to advocate for changes in the law that would benefit ts victims. She counted among her own mentors during those years now-retired Common Pleas Judge Howard F. Riley Jr., she said. “He was always fair and compassionate with victims. He listened to them. He was an active listener, which is something I think you really need to be. I learned so much from him.” Frei has continued to work domestic violence prosecutions even after the DA’s unit disbanded, as well as to advocate for changes in the law that would benefit its victims. She played a vital role in working with the Domestic Violence Center of Chester County to create the Lethality Assessment Program, a tool that uses a series of simple questions to victims to help the police predict which domestic violence cases are likely to lead to extreme violence. This program allows the police to intervene early, getting help for the victim before the case turns into a homicide, according to the DA’s press release. Dolly Wideman-Scott, the head of the Domestic Violence Center of Chester County, paid tribute to her “genuine concern for the safety of victims and an unerring sense of justice.” Her work has drawn her into several high profile cases in the county’s recent history, including the murder of Kimberly Hvizda, the estranged wife of a former minor league baseball player who stabbed her in the parking lot of an Upper Uwchlan Wawa where she worked; the shotgun slaying of Jamica Woods, a longtime victim who had made the decision to leave her abusive boyfriend and start a new life before he killed her; and the brutal torture and death of 3-year-old Scotty McMillan, a case that made international headlines. All three of the defendants in those cases were sentenced to life in prison, sentences won by Frei without trial. “Over the years, this job will break your heart, time and time again,” she told an interviewer who asked why she devoted herself to those cases “You see so many innocent victims. But I guess it is my warrior motivation. You fight for the innocent. I thought about doing other things professionally. But I cannot imagine doing anything different. This is what I want to do.” Frei received her undergraduate degree from Gettysburg College. She received her law degree from Villanova University School of Law. A former soccer player until a foot injury sidelined her, Frei enjoys mountain climbing and all of the physical fitness training that is required for the sport. To contact Staff Writer Michael P.

Peter,Rouse,2605,http://gisborneherald.co.nz/localsport/3990855-135/golf-roundup,"The sight of Mount Hikurangi standing majestically in the distance was befitting as Te Puia Springs honoured a similarly commanding golfing presence on Sunday. East Coast legend Peter Rouse remains a mountainous spiritual presence at the Springs seven years after his tragic death. He’s on the walls of the clubhouse. He permeates the picturesque landscape of a beloved course he dominated for decades. He still crops up regularly in conversation over a 19th-hole drink. He holds an enduring mana and once a year the club dedicates a special day to officially mark the respect in which he will always be held at home and through the Poverty Bay-East Coast golfing district. On Sunday, over 40 players, celebrated the life of PD Rouse — a life ended at the age of 74 when he died in a quad bike accident on a farm near Tokomaru Bay in 2012. The ultimate tribute to Rousie is to play well. If you can’t do that, the next best thing is to enjoy a drink and the company of others in a Springs clubhouse that has produced an anthology of Rouse anecdotes. It was fitting long-time clubmate and friend Brian Morrissey did both. Morrissey’s golf was superb, as was his at-times emotional prize-giving tribute to Rouse. Morrissey broke his age by eight strokes, the 75-year-old signing for 67-10-57, to win the men’s overall net. Rouse, who no doubt would have been age-breaking with regularity had he been alive today, would have been impressed although “bloody burglar” would likely have accompanied his congratulatory comments. Morrissey, on the cusp of achieving the feat at his now home Poverty Bay course, started and finished with birdies, and had a couple more in between. His name goes on a tankard presented to Rouse when he won the 1999 King of the Coast at Tolaga Bay — one of 11 times he claimed that honour. Hiria McClutchie continued her fine form to top the women’s division with 103-40-63. Rousie would also have been highly impressed with the Springs course. It was immaculately presented, auguring well for next month’s East Coast Men’s open.

Gay Young felt she was playing a single-figure handicapper for half of her Hutchinson Cup final against Viv Bell yesterday. Bell defeated Young 3 and 1 in a match Bell described as “a heck of a tussle”. All-square after 14 holes, Bell rattled off wins on the next three holes to seal victory. Her best golf came in the second-third of the match, leading 18-handicapper Young to comment that she was playing “a scratch golfer”. Bell, off 21, made birdie-4 on the fifth hole, then parred the next six holes. She didn’t realise how well she was actually scoring. “I was just in the zone.” Bell ended up signing for 86-21-65 while Young also played below her handicap, shooting 89-18-71. Bell had a tight Monday semifinal against Marg Colebourne. She won on the 18th while Young eliminated Margaret Williams. Sally Spence had a couple of birdies, including a two, in her women’s medal-winning round yesterday. Spence carded 87-19-68, one ahead of Jan Steele’s 96-27-69. Mark Norman (41 stableford points), Lee “Pikey” Hewson (39), Vance Richardson (net 70), Richard Foon (68), Gray Clapham (40) and Dave Mettrick (40) were the men’s competition winners last week.

Approach: S. Willock. Jo Kerr returned to the 70s on Sunday. There were no disco moves and only four 1-overs does not constitute a bogey wonderland, but there were some slick manoeuvres on the 18 dance floors as Kerr ended a series of rounds in the 80s with 76-8-68. It is not known if she said “that’s the way uh-huh, uh-huh I like it” after making two on the 14th, recording the women’s best third shot and winning the women’s net. Johnny Charles enjoys his 70s music — perhaps not disco — and plenty of late 60s material as well. He won the men’s stableford with his second consecutive 86-18-68. Sixty-eight — the year of such classics as Hey Jude, Mrs Robinson, All Along The Watchtower and Sympathy for the Devil — was also the winning score in the men’s net on Saturday. Bo Huhu’s 77-9-68 headed off Rod Moore’s 75-7-68 on countback. Ann Richardson (41 points, Wednesday) and Patutahi’s Sitjze Mohlmann (40, Tuesday) enjoyed stableford competition wins last week.

Peter Johnston entered rarefied sub-80 air in winning the junior men’s net on Sunday with 78-17-61, three shots clear of Rocky Pardoe’s 81-17-64.

Ruru’s 82-15-67 headed off Percy Milner on countback while Ella Wynyard’s 71 was best of the women. SUNDAY — Cup competition, first round, men’s net: T Ruru 67, P Milner 67, L Green 71, U Chambers 72, K Tamanui 73, T Smith 74. Women’s net: E Wynyard 71, M Tuapawa 78, V Grace 86. Twos: T Smith, T Ruru, L Green. COMING UP: SUNDAY, Cup competition, second round. Bryan Pratt added his name to an illustrious piece of Gisborne East Coast veteran golf silverware — the Johnny Jackson Plate — on Tuesday. Pratt fired 83-19-64 to comfortably top the 44-strong field in the net competition held on the Poverty Bay course. The field included nine women, who had a section of their own, and seven clubs were represented. Pratt was four shots clear of Bernie Rothschild (79-11-68), with Warwick Thompson and Brian Morrissey the next best on 69. Shelley Robertson shot 92-19-73 to top the women’s section from Lorraine Haisman (75). It was noted that some golfers are still coming to terms with the new rules, particularly the correct dropping of a ball and the local rule regarding what happens after you go out of bounds or lose a ball. GEC vets are on the road next week to take on their Bay of Plenty counterparts for the Shark Trophy. Around 30 players are already confirmed for the clash, which features rounds at Whakatane (from 11am) on Monday and Kawerau (9am) on Tuesday. Those keen to join the fun need to arrange their own transport and accommodation. You can play on both or either day.

It is not known if she said “that’s the way uh-huh, uh-huh I like it” after making two on the 14th, recording the women’s best third shot and winning the women’s net. Johnny Charles enjoys his 70s music — perhaps not disco — and plenty of late 60s material as well. He won the men’s stableford with his second consecutive 86-18-68. Sixty-eight — the year of such classics as Hey Jude, Mrs Robinson, All Along The Watchtower and Sympathy for the Devil — was also the winning score in the men’s net on Saturday. Bo Huhu’s 77-9-68 headed off Rod Moore’s 75-7-68 on countback. Ann Richardson (41 points, Wednesday) and Patutahi’s Sitjze Mohlmann (40, Tuesday) enjoyed stableford competition wins last week. Electrinet Park results, SUNDAY — Men’s stableford: J Charles 40, B Watene 38, D Harrison 37. Women’s net: J Kerr 68. Twos: D Harrison, R Grace, J Kerr. Approach: S Phillips. Women’s best third shot: J Kerr. SATURDAY — Men’s net: B Huhu 68, R Moore 68, S Phillips 71. WEDNESDAY (Feb 27) — Women’s stableford: A Richardson 107-39-68, 41. TUESDAY (Feb 26) — Veteran men’s stableford: S Mohlmann 40, A Nairne 39, J McGann 38, N Jones 38, G Williams 38, B Atkins 37. COMING UP: SATURDAY/SUNDAY, April 20-21, Summit Forestry NZ Ltd Easter 36-hole tournament, start sheet at office. Peter Johnston entered rarefied sub-80 air in winning the junior men’s net on Sunday with 78-17-61, three shots clear of Rocky Pardoe’s 81-17-64. SUNDAY — Men’s net, senior division: B McKenzie 67, T Hindmarsh 67, S Pohatu 68, J Brown 69. Junior division: P Johnston 61, R Pardoe 64, B Pohatu 65, J Blair 67.

Junior division: C Brown 22, J Blair 21, B Tietjen 21, C Newman 20, D Stevens 20. A two on the 16th proved decisive as Tipi Ruru topped the first round of the cup competition on Sunday. Ruru’s 82-15-67 headed off Percy Milner on countback while Ella Wynyard’s 71 was best of the women. SUNDAY — Cup competition, first round, men’s net: T Ruru 67, P Milner 67, L Green 71, U Chambers 72, K Tamanui 73, T Smith 74. Women’s net: E Wynyard 71, M Tuapawa 78, V Grace 86. Twos: T Smith, T Ruru, L Green. COMING UP: SUNDAY, Cup competition, second round. Bryan Pratt added his name to an illustrious piece of Gisborne East Coast veteran golf silverware — the Johnny Jackson Plate — on Tuesday. Pratt fired 83-19-64 to comfortably top the 44-strong field in the net competition held on the Poverty Bay course. The field included nine women, who had a section of their own, and seven clubs were represented. Pratt was four shots clear of Bernie Rothschild (79-11-68), with Warwick Thompson and Brian Morrissey the next best on 69. Shelley Robertson shot 92-19-73 to top the women’s section from Lorraine Haisman (75). It was noted that some golfers are still coming to terms with the new rules, particularly the correct dropping of a ball and the local rule regarding what happens after you go out of bounds or lose a ball. GEC vets are on the road next week to take on their Bay of Plenty counterparts for the Shark Trophy. Around 30 players are already confirmed for the clash, which features rounds at Whakatane (from 11am) on Monday and Kawerau (9am) on Tuesday. Those keen to join the fun need to arrange their own transport and accommodation. You can play on both or either day.

By ANNA PALMER, JAKE SHERMAN and DANIEL LIPPMAN 03/08/2019 06:10 AM EST Presented by House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) look on as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) speaks at a press conference on Jan. 29. | M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO 23 HOUSE REPUBLICANS voted against a resolution Thursday evening that condemned hate against many groups, including Jews and Muslims, in the wake of REP. ILHAN OMAR’S (D-MINN.) comments that suggested supporters of Israel might have dual loyalty -- remarks that were widely viewed as anti-Semitic. Every Democrat voted yes. HERE ARE A FEW dynamics to keep an eye on … -- FIRST OF ALL, it’s fair to say that, within Democratic leadership, there is a sense that OMAR has two strikes against her, and if there is a sniff of anti-Semitism again, there will be a movement from some of the rank and file to get her off the Foreign Affairs Committee. SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI’S House Democratic Caucus lost all this week to the anti-Semitism story. They don’t want another lost week, or to be painted as a party that’s permissive of anti-Semites. Eliana Johnson and Melanie Zanona on how the Omar controversy has been a gift to Trump -- THERE IS SERIOUS, SERIOUS anger -- seething, it’s fair to say -- at the top levels of the House GOP that Republicans muddled their message with a split on this vote. All week, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY’S leadership team managed to keep his troops in line, allowing Democrats to spend days upon days tripping all over themselves. Now, they have taken a bit of the spotlight off Democrats for reasons that are clear to no one. THERE WERE TWO OPTIONS when it came to this vote, according to top lawmakers and aides: Either every single Republican had to be for the resolution, or everyone needed to be against it. Now that nearly two dozen Republicans voted no, the party is in the mushy middle, unable to define where it stood. THOSE WHO VOTED AGAINST IT -- including New York Rep. Lee Zeldin, who was most animated against the bill -- said it was a sham, and should’ve focused more squarely on Omar’s remarks. THE PREVAILING THOUGHT in House GOP leadership and in much of the rank and file is that the folks who voted against the resolution handed Democrats a gift. -- THE HOUSE GOP is overwhelmingly white and male, so there is definitely a concern about a slice of the party voting against a resolution that condemns hate against minorities. -- HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CHAIRWOMAN LIZ CHENEY of Wyoming split with MCCARTHY and HOUSE MINORITY WHIP STEVE SCALISE (R-LA.) and voted against the bill. Sure, they’re in the minority, so fissures might appear to matter less, but when the rank and file sees that there is disunity at the top, they take notice. WE SPENT LAST NIGHT checking up with our Republican sources who were quite peeved at Cheney -- to say the least. The thinking among most top Republicans is this: When you’re part of a leadership team, you stick together. Period. (Cheney’s allies will tell you this is not a big deal, but they are alone in that thinking.) KEEP AN EYE ON THIS … BURGESS EVERETT and ELIANA JOHNSON: “Fearing mass GOP defections, Trump leans in to emergency fight” … WAPO’S ERICA WERNER and SEUNG MIN KIM: “White House demands GOP support for Trump’s wall plans, won’t say how they’ll affect military construction” Good Friday morning. Happy International Women’s Day! … … NEW MORNING CONSULT/POLITICO POLL -- STEVEN SHEPARD: “Do men have it better than women in this country? It depends which party you ask, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll. More than half of Democratic voters, 55 percent, think men are better off than women in the U.S. — but only a fifth of Republicans shared that view. “There’s a similar divide along gender lines over how the sexes are faring: Forty-four percent of female voters said men have a better life than they do, while just 5 percent said women have a better life. But a majority of men, 52 percent, think there’s little difference between the genders: Just 28 percent said they have a better life than women, while 10 percent responded that women are better off.” POLITICO … POLITICO Magazine asks, “What are the biggest problems women face today?” -- BONUS WOMEN RULE PODCAST -- ANNA sat down with Netflix show “One Day at a Time” showrunner GLORIA CALDERÓN KELLETT and its star JUSTINA MACHADO to talk about why it’s important to have representation in Hollywood writing rooms, telling authentic stories and so much more. Listen and subscribe FIRST IN PLAYBOOK … MIKE RICCI, the former comms director to PAUL RYAN, is joining MARYLAND GOV. LARRY HOGAN as communications director. A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare. Seniors need Washington to focus on the right ones. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to lifesaving medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. Making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare. TALKER … JOHN F. HARRIS in POLITICO MAGAZINE: “How Trump Is Like JFK”: “The Hannity revelation underscores a striking paradox: Even as Trump wages almost daily attacks on individual reporters and news organizations, and often seems bent on undermining the very idea of independent news media, behind the scenes, he arguably has the most frequent, most informal, and most sustained personal interactions with reporters and commentators of any president since the days of Kennedy and Bradlee (as well Joseph Alsop, Charles Bartlett and other journalists of that era who enjoyed special access to JFK). “The media figures Trump talks to informally go beyond his well-documented phone calls with sympathetic commentators like Hannity and Lou Dobbs. His media roster includes regular, if less-publicized engagement with beat reporters and executives at the New York Times, the Washington Post and, on occasion, POLITICO. … “He knows what book projects are underway by various Washington reporters, is participating in several of them and soaks up intelligence of what the books are likely to say. (He gave an interview to POLITICO’s Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer for a book to be released this spring, and another to POLITICO’s Tim Alberta for one to be released in the summer.)” POLITICO Mag UPDATE … WAPO’S ERIK WEMPLE: “AtlanticLIVE’s Steve Clemons won’t join Axios”: “Several young, female subordinates of Clemons at AtlanticLIVE got together for a meal in January and discovered that they had something in common: unfortunate interactions with Clemons in the course of coordinating AtlanticLIVE’s events lineup. “Among the complaints, according to sources familiar with the meeting: that Clemons once mistook two female African American Atlantic staffers for catering workers at an AtlanticLIVE event; that he very frequently hectored employees over small matters; that he was routinely dismissive of his subordinates and made little attempt to learn their names; and that he reacted poorly to negative feedback about his work as a moderator. (None of the accusations included sexual harassment.) … “As for the particular complaints against him, Clemons counters that he’s ‘not a yeller,’ though he doesn’t deny insisting on excellence. ‘I can be short and dismissive and passionate and I think people can hear and experience things in different ways, but I can’t dispute that other people felt the tension, but I’m not an abusive person,’ he says. As for the waitstaff allegation, Clemons denies it. ‘Totally untrue,’ he says. ‘I don’t have any recollection of that.’” WaPo BLOOMBERG SCOOP … NICK WADHAMS and JENNIFER JACOBS: “Trump Said to Seek Huge Premium From Allies Hosting U.S. Troops”: “[T]he administration is drawing up demands that Germany, Japan and eventually any other country hosting U.S. troops pay the full price of American soldiers deployed on their soil -- plus 50 percent or more for the privilege of hosting them, according to a dozen administration officials and people briefed on the matter. In some cases, nations hosting American forces could be asked to pay five to six times as much as they do now under the ‘Cost Plus 50’ formula. “Trump has championed the idea for months. His insistence on it almost derailed recent talks with South Korea over the status of 28,000 U.S. troops in the country when he overruled his negotiators with a note to National Security Advisor John Bolton saying, ‘We want cost plus 50.’ ... Officials caution that the idea is one of many under consideration as the U.S. presses allies to pay more, and it may be toned down. “Yet even at this early stage, it has sent shock waves through the departments of Defense and State, where officials fear it will be an especially large affront to stalwart U.S. allies in Asia and Europe already questioning the depth of Trump’s commitment to them.” Bloomberg INTERESTING … The chief of staff of the Pakistani army gave the late SEN. JOHN MCCAIN and SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) ceremonial pistols in July 2017, according to a recently filed report of foreign gifts with the State Department.

Work also has been done on a missile engine test stand. Given this construction and other activity at the location, 38 North said the site ‘appears to have returned to normal operational status.’” WSJ COMING ATTRACTIONS -- ANDREW DESIDERIO: “House Dems to bring resolution next week to make Mueller report public” 2020 WATCH … -- DANIEL STRAUSS and ELENA SCHNEIDER: “Montana Gov.

Kirsten Gillibrand is still searching for a first presidential endorsement from colleagues in New York’s delegation, leaving her the only senator running in 2020 without any home-state congressional backing. The New York Democrat, who is still in the exploratory phase of her presidential bid, is working behind the scenes to curry support among her colleagues. “Gillibrand is having lunch with House members — some for the first time — and hosting informal drinks with the state delegation next week. She’s made phone calls to them and asked others for help in shoring up endorsements. But, so far, no one has jumped on board.” POLITICO -- “Beto O’Rourke team begins making inquiries about possible staffers, strategists in NH,” by WMUR’s John DiStaso: “Sources: People close to former congressman reach out to key Granite Staters ahead of possible presidential announcement.” THE INVESTIGATIONS -- “Manafort gets 47 months in prison for financial fraud,” by Darren Samuelsohn, Josh Gerstein and Matthew Choi: “Paul Manafort … was sentenced Thursday to nearly four years in prison for a slate of financial fraud crimes, a much lighter sentence than many had anticipated. Manafort’s sentence, handed down by U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria, Va., is not the final word on his fate — another sentencing is scheduled next week for a series of additional crimes. “However, his 47-month sentence is the longest to date for a Trump associate ensnared in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation. Manafort — wearing a green jail uniform and relying on a wheelchair and cane during the hearing — asked for ‘compassion’ from the judge before receiving his punishment, a coda to 16 months of legal wrangling that has featured his jailing over allegations of witness tampering, gag orders, a ripped up plea deal and the only trial to result from Mueller’s investigation so far.” POLITICO -- Scott Hechinger (@ScottHech), a public defender in NYC: “For context on Manafort’s 47 months in prison, my client [Wednesday] was offered 36-72 months in prison for stealing $100 worth of quarters from a residential laundry room.” -- “Cohen’s lawyer says Trump advisers were ‘dangling’ pardons,” by AP’s Michael Balsamo, Mary Clare Jalonick and Jonathan Lemire: AP A message from PhRMA: There are wrong and right prescriptions for changing Medicare.

Wielding little more than a contraband smartphone, the disgraced pharmaceutical executive remains the shadow power at Phoenixus AG, the drug company that became a national lightning rod for jacking up the prices of rare drugs under its former name, Turing Pharmaceuticals AG. Mr. Shkreli still helps call the shots. “A few weeks ago he rang up his handpicked chief executive during a safari vacation—to fire him, according to a person familiar with the exchange. This is the secret life of inmate 87850-053, 16 months into a seven-year sentence for securities fraud. ...

Winds SE at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: March 11, 2019 @ 3:08 pm Iris Martha McKinney Gray passed away peacefully in her home in Bozeman February 27, 2019. She was 93. Iris, born September 14, 1925, was the eldest daughter of Herbert Larkin McKinney and Orlena Ada Siedentop of Dwight, Illinois. Iris graduated from Dwight Township High School where she was yearbook editor and won numerous debate and speech competitions. She attended Illinois State University in Normal graduating in 1947 with a Bachelor of Science degree. For five years, she taught English and French languages at Antioch Community High School, Antioch, Illinois. After leaving teaching, Iris taught in the Hammond, Indiana Felt & Tarrant Comptometer School. Comptometers were mechanical calculators before mainframe computers. Iris was a member of the Kappa Delta Epsilon National Education Sorority, located next to the Chicago University International House, and it was there she met her husband of 55 years. On New Year's Eve, 1954, Iris married Philip Howard Gray of Bar Harbor, Maine in the University of Chicago chapel. Their first child, Cindelyn, was born in Chicago while Philip was in graduate school working on his Master's degree from Austin Riesen, the research pioneer in sensory deprivation and cognitive development. The family moved to Seattle, Washington in 1958, for Philip to complete his PhD under Donald M. Baer, the pioneer of applied behavioral analysis. While in Seattle, Iris worked at General Electric rising through the ranks to be a parts manager. In 1960, Philip hired on at Bozeman's Montana State College as a psychology professor. A second child, Howard Carson, was born in 1962. Iris took a job as the psychometrist (speed) reading comprehension specialist at MSU's Computer Testing Center, retiring in 1990. Iris was brought up in the United Methodist Church and belonged to the local BUMC congregation. In 2012, her Faith guided her to volunteer charity at Bozeman's Love INC. Philip and Iris were active participants in the international and local arts community. They shared a love of folk art and operated an art gallery in Kennebunkport, Maine for two years. While briefly living in Canada in 1969-70 with her husband, Iris began volunteering at the Winnipeg Handicraft Guild. There she developed a passion for Inuit art and along with her husband, amassed a collection of stone carvings and prints, later using her language skills to help edit Philip's books on Inuit art. The couple also collected folk music together and hosted many listening sessions at their home during the folk music revival years. She never missed one of her son's KGLT radio shows. In the 1960s, Iris and Philip belonged to the Four-Wheel Drive Club of Bozeman and participated in many off-road outings. Both of them enjoyed bird hunting with family friends on local ranches. Iris was well schooled in Montana history and often mentioned her favorite course studies with Professor Merrill Burlingame when she took graduate level courses at Montana State College. Iris joined the Daughters of the American Revolution Mt. Hylite chapter during the nation's bicentennial. She served as the Montana State DAR Regent from 1990 to 1992. During that time, she visited every DAR chapter in the state and wore out a complete set of tires from all the driving. She was very proud of her great great-grandfather John A. McKinney's service in the Union Army Pennsylvania Bucktails Company C. After Philip's retirement from MSU, they traveled extensively around the West visiting the various dinosaur museums and dig sites. For twenty years, Iris was an active participant in the docent program at the MOR leading thousands of schoolchildren through the exhibits, eventually amassing nearly 4000 hours of volunteer time. Following her retirement from MSU, Iris volunteered in Jack Horner's paleontology lab at the Museum of the Rockies (MOR) cleaning dinosaur bones. After Phillip's death in 2009, Iris volunteered with the MOR sewing group making craft items as fundraisers for the museum gift shop and working in the Tinsley House Living History Farm museum. Family history and genealogy were a passion for her. This last August, Iris was a recipient of the Prime Awards 24 Over 64 honor sponsored by the Bozeman Chronicle in recognition for her many years as community volunteer. Iris enjoyed playing cards, cribbage, scrabble, puzzles, and crossword puzzles. Like her husband, Iris loved animals and had a number of pets over the years ranging from Peep the chicken, Seymour the duck, and numerous cats and dogs. In 2016 son Howard moved to Bozeman to care for Iris and they enjoyed attending many gypsy swing and classical music concerts, going on road trips to Yellowstone Park, Cody, Wyoming, and driving around the valley. Iris was a splendid cook and mother and son would often cook meals together joking, ""that was a $30 plate"". Iris was also a fan of Tai Chi and practiced several times a week. Iris is preceded in death by her son-in-law, Dr. Ray Edward Eberts; two siblings, Lt Colonel Floyd McKinney of the US Air Force and Madelyn Meatyard of Lexington, Kentucky; and her husband, Dr. Philip Howard Gray. Survivors include her children, Howard of Bozeman, Cindelyn of McAllister, MT; grandchildren, Russell of Seattle and Wescott of Austin, Texas; a sister Lois Draper of Bloomington, Illinois, a brother, Lee McKinney of Florida, and a brother-in-law, Michael Gordon of Bar Harbor, Maine and numerous cousins, nieces, and nephews. Donations in memory of Iris Martha Gray can be made to Gallatin County Love INC, PO Box 7117, Bozeman, MT 59771. A memorial services will be held at the Bozeman United Methodist Church on Friday, March 8th at 10:00 a.m. Her ashes will then be interned with her husband, Philip, at the Fort Harrison Veteran's Cemetery in Helena sometime in May.

He has announced that it will be closing in 2020, a victim of revised Arts Council funding priorities. This programme, though, rings a happier note — it celebrates Alston’s half-century as a working choreographer. And it showcases some pretty wonderful dancing in the process. These days an Alston evening generally includes a contribution from Martin Lawrance. His new Detour, choreographed for five women and four men, is set to percussion pieces by Akira Miyoshi and Michael Gordon. Lawrance’s choreography is here volatile and voluptuous, an articulate and agile response to the rhythms in the music.

Bob,Diamond,2593,https://www.reuters.com/article/illimity-results/new-italian-lender-illimity-trims-2023-profit-forecast-idUSL5N20T1BY,"2 Min Read MILAN, March 6 (Reuters) - Italian challenger bank Illimity trimmed its 2023 profit forecast on Wednesday to take into account regulatory changes which will force it to increase provisions against loan losses. The bank cited increased volatility on Italian government bonds since a Eurosceptic coalition came to power in June. Illimity said it expects net profit of 280 million euros ($316.60 million) in 2023 compared with a 300 million euro target under a business plan announced in July. However, it aims to reach a profit of 55-70 million euros in 2020, up from a previous target of 40-45 million euros. It will start paying a dividend from 2022. Illimity specialises in managing bad loans and lending to small businesses, targeting higher-margin borrowers who are considered too risky by traditional banks. It was founded last year by veteran banker Corrado Passera and had former Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond as its main sponsor. Illimity reported on Wednesday a net loss of 23.5 million euros for 2018 hit by extraordinary start-up costs as well as a decision to cut its government bond portfolio. The bank confirmed its capital targets with a CET1 ratio of more than 15 percent throughout the plan period. Shares in Illimity started trading on Monday on the Milan stock exchange. They rose 1 percent by 0815 GMT against a 0.1 percent increase in Italy’s banking index.

Andrew,Davis,2602,https://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2019/world-clown-association-president-andrew-davis-when-i-started-clowning-my-red-nose-gave-me-confidence/,"Get our free email newsletter with just one click “If you ask my mum, she’ll say I’ve been clowning for 46 years,” says Andrew Davis, better known as Andy the Clown. His life of playing around has not been misspent, however. Last year, the British entertainer was elected president of the World Clown Association, which represents 2,000 performers worldwide, and he begins his two-year term of office at the WCA’s annual convention in Albuquerque, New Mexico this week. When he takes over from Pam Moody, Davis will be the first Brit to head the organisation since Arthur Pedlar in 2004. Coming from a background in retail management, Davis got into clowning by chance while working as assistant manager at Cantor’s Theatre School and Centre for Performing Arts in Lowestoft in 1998. When resident entertainer Kenny Cantor was unable to perform at a children’s birthday party, Davis was asked to step in. “I didn’t know anything about clowns and clowning, I had no make-up or costume,” he recalls. “But I popped on a red nose and afterwards a couple of the mums said: ‘That was really good, can you do our children’s birthday parties?’ They asked my name and when I told them it was Andy they said: ‘Oh, Andy the Clown’ – and the name stuck.” Davis wasn’t entirely without performing experience, having been a part-time DJ since he was 13. “I could never have stood on stage in front of anyone and sung,” Davis says. “But I was always confident as a DJ because there was a barrier between me and the audience – you can hide behind the record decks and speakers. When I started clowning, my red nose became my barrier between me and the audience. It gave me confidence.” Davis’ signature turquoise outfit was found in the theatre school’s wardrobe. “I looked at various costumes, like for a pirate, and there was a set of six baggy flannelette clown suits in different colours. I chose one in blue and orange. I thought the colours clashed well and it was only later that I discovered that’s because they’re on opposite sides of the colour wheel.” More recently, Davis has adopted a new look – yellow dungarees – in tribute to the oilskins worn by fishermen in his hometown of Lowestoft. ‘There aren’t many imaginary characters you can meet – you can’t meet a fairy or a gnome, but clowns are kind of real’ Davis’ comedy heroes include Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer as well as the cartoon characters he grew up with: Johnny Bravo, Ren and Stimpy, and Pinky and the Brain. In his view, the appeal of clowns is that they resemble living cartoon characters. “There aren’t many imaginary characters you can meet,” he says. “You can’t meet a fairy or a gnome, but clowns are kind of real.” As a self-taught clown, Davis joined the WCA to meet his peers. He took on the posts of European director and then alley director, for which his responsibilities included organising the competitions and awards at the annual convention. The title ‘alley director’ comes from the American circus term Clown Alley – the clowns’ dressing area in a big top. The WCA was formed in 1982 and held its first convention in Atlanta, Georgia, the following year. The conventions, which attract about 200 clowns, are held in a different American city each year and in an international location every fourth year. “The conventions are primarily for education. There are more than 40 hours of classes on all aspects of clowning from make-up and costume through to performance and play,” says Davis, who also runs Clown Gathering UK each February. A Variety of Clown Comedy review at Seagull Theatre, Lowestoft – ‘a warm-hearted revue’ In recent years, the image of clowning has been tarnished by media coverage of pranksters dressing up as scary clowns. Davis is pleased that the negative publicity seems to have petered out. “There was very little in the newspapers last Halloween,” he says. Another issue for clowns is TV talent shows inviting professional entertainers to make a fool of themselves for no pay. “If they want me to go on TV to boost their show, I want to get paid,” says Davis. “I don’t want to be rubbished by Simon Cowell. If I were doing a new act and wanted to get noticed, that kind of show would be a good medium, but as fast it could promote an act, it could destroy an act as well.” Generally, Davis says these are good times to be a clown. “I’ve been clowning full-time since 2007 and this past year was my busiest ever,” he says. “I was doing three shows a day at least four days a week through the summer, then weekends, festivals and theatre shows on top of that. “It was reported in the papers that the number of clowns was at an all-time low, but I counted 260 professional clowns in the UK among my Facebook friends alone. They work across the whole spectrum of clowning, including circus, theatre, churches, hospitals, parties and burlesque. So I challenge anyone to say clowning is becoming more difficult. There will always be work for good clowns.” The World Clown Association’s annual convention takes place in Albuquerque, New Mexico from March 3-7 The other comic relief: how clowns bring joy to war zones When you subscribe to The Stage, you’re investing in our journalism.

Bob,Diamond,2593,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47462194,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond wanted to raise funds privately in the financial crisis to preserve his own job, a court has heard. Mr Diamond reportedly told a meeting ""This is all about saving jobs - mine and John's"", referring to then chief executive John Varley. The quote was recalled by former Barclays executive Richard Boath, currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court together with Mr Varley. In an interview with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) played to the court, Mr Boath related Mr Diamond's statement in June 2008. Mr Boath told the SFO Mr Diamond was concerned he might have to leave his job if the bank raised funds publicly, for example through a ""rights issue"". In a rights issue, existing shareholders, many of them large City institutions, are offered the right to buy new shares in exchange for handing over new funds. But, Mr Boath told the SFO, Bob Diamond was opposed to going to institutions. In that event brokers would be required to check the bank's marking of its trading positions [the value of its holdings of shares and bonds]. ""There was a meeting… In that meeting Bob said - this is all about saving jobs - it's mine and John's. ""What he meant was Bob had consistently said - 'no, we don't need capital'. ""The gossip in the market was that we hadn't marked our positions as conservatively as other people and that if we couldn't raise capital in this process the only alternative would be a rights issue…and the brokers would come in and do their due diligence - a ""drains-up"" - and we'd have to defend our position. ""What Bob said about saving jobs was that in those circumstances they [Bob Diamond and John Varley] would have to go,"" Mr Boath told the SFO in 2016. A recording of Mr Boath's interview was played at the trial of John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Richard Boath and Tom Kolaris. They are accused of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. They deny the charges. The charges relate to two fund-raising efforts in June 2008 and October 2008, when the bank raised £12bn, mostly from private investors including Qatar Holdings, a company owned by the state of Qatar. The Serious Fraud Office alleges that defendants misled shareholders by paying Qatari companies £322m in secret fees for ""Advisory Services Agreements"" that were not properly disclosed. The SFO has alleged that the agreements were in fact ""a disguised mechanism for providing extra fees to the Qataris in a way in which defendants knew and intended would not be disclosed"". Today the court heard how Mr Boath told the SFO: ""The pressure to get the deal done was intense from the very beginning."" Bankers senior to Mr Boath were communicating about the deal, he said, including Mr Diamond and Mr Varley. The bank's most senior lawyers, Mark Harding and Judith Shepherd, repeatedly advised that the bank could pay fees for services if it received sufficient value for those services, he told the SFO. Mr Boath described in his SFO interview how he was asked in the first capital raising in June by his senior colleague Roger Jenkins to calculate the size of an additional fee. The Qataris had demanded a commission 1.75% higher than what was paid to other investors. This amount - £42m - was to secure the Qataris' participation in the capital raising, Mr Boath told the SFO. When this was discussed the services to be paid for had not yet been determined. Mr Boath described how he sought ""air cover"" - the reassurance of knowing lawyers and people senior to him knew the issues and had discussed them. ""What I was concerned about was, one - is this legal? And two - how are we going to deal with this if other investors discover this? ""Firstly why don't we tell them [the Qataris] to get stuffed? And two - do the senior - does Varley and Bob and Mark - have they all read this undertaking in the subscription agreement that everyone is getting the same… from where I sat that's a fairly brave thing to say - cos I wouldn't be thanked for it. ""The conversation that then ensued was whether that was something the bank could do - could reasonably do - could legally do - and in that conversation Mark Harding repeatedly said that the bank was able to enter an arrangement like that provided it got value for services,"" Mr Boath told the SFO. ""It was clear for what I recollect that the request had come from the Qataris for a higher fee. The mechanism - the ASA was a mechanism to pay an additional fee and satisfy their demand for an additional fee. That was blindingly obvious from the call and everybody on that call understood that."" There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Qatar. The trial continues.

Steve Cummings, chairman of the Cullman County Republican Party, speaks during Monday’s Cullman Planning Commission meeting. Steve Cummings, chairman of the Cullman County Republican Party, speaks during Monday’s Cullman Planning Commission meeting. The executive committee of the Cullman County Republican Party has voted to opposed Gov. Kay Ivey’s proposed 10-cent gasoline tax, in a move similar to the state party’s resolution before the 2019 legislative session started. The session began Tuesday with a few committee meetings, followed by Ivey’s State of the State address in which she called for a special session to address the gas tax. In doing so, certain procedural votes necessary in the regular session can be avoided. Steve Cummings, chairman of the Cullman County Republican Party, said the executive committee is not opposed to finding a remedy to Alabama’s mounting infrastructure needs. But concerns, he said, exist in the proposed tax increase, which would be implemented in phases. “We’d like to see more transparency before we raise taxes,” Cummings said. “Our biggest problem is that about $63 million a year is taken out of the existing fund for prisons and law enforcement. I thought the Republican Party would have had the lottery up for a vote last year.” Cummings also said concern exists about how the proposed tax would be spent, noting that the Alabama Department of Transportation has no control over its decisions. “They might could get this or something to work if there was oversight,” Cummings said. The state’s gasoline tax was last increased in 1992. Ivey pitched the issue as a necessity for both public safety and economic development. She said half of the state’s 16,000 bridges are older than their 50-year life span, and congested traffic arteries are a hindrance to both commuters and commerce. The governor also noted that neighboring states are investing in infrastructure needs and that Alabama needs the tax to also remain competitive in economic development. The state has enjoyed significant job growth, but developers across the state have been raising the alarm on the condition of roads and bridges as companies continue to expand in Alabama. The Republican governor has the support of leadership in the GOP-dominated Alabama Legislature, but has faced opposition to the gas tax increase from some in her own party. Some of the revenue from the proposed gas tax would also be used to make improvements in Mobile Bay to improve shipping capabilities. The special session will begin today.

John,O'Neil,2623,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190308/judge-rules-ogunquit-recall-can-move-forward,"OGUNQUIT � The judge presiding over the lawsuit filed by four Ogunquit residents seeking to halt the recall vote of three Select Board members, has lifted a temporary stay issued last month, paving the way for a date to be set for the recall election. Residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn filed the lawsuit on Jan. 25 asking the court to order the town to stop moving forward with the recall citing numerous problems with the way the petitions were handled by both circulators and at Town Hall. The lawsuit also sought a temporary injunction, or stay, to stop an election from being held while the lawsuit is pending. York County Superior Court Judge John O�Neil agreed to the temporary injunction on Feb. 4, preventing the Select Board from moving forward in scheduling the recall election. Ogunquit resident Jerry Dehart, who supports the recall effort, filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, and also submitted a motion through his attorney, Leah Rachin of Bergen Parkinson, asking the judge to lift the temporary stay so the recall election could proceed. O�Neil lifted the stay in a ruling issued late Thursday saying without a hearing there was no legal basis for preventing recall proceedings from moving forward, even though a decision in the lawsuit is still at least a month away. O�Neil has issued a tightened court timeline ensuring that the trial and judge�s ruling will come before the recall election can be scheduled, according to Peter Langsdorf, attorney for the plaintiffs. �I�m not unhappy with this order at all. It accomplishes what we want, which is to rule on the legitimacy of this recall before it occurs,� Langsdorf said in a phone interview Thursday. The judge ordered written discovery from all parties to be submitted by March 22 and a trial to be set for the week of March 25, 2019. �Court will issue its decision as expeditiously as possible,� O�Neil said in Thursday�s findings. Rachin said Friday that she was working with her client to determine their next steps. The suit follows months of turmoil surrounding the future of three members of the Select Board � Chairman Charles �Bunky� Waite, Selectwoman Madeline Mooney and Selectman Bob Winn. Residents who initiated the recall process did so following a public appeal hearing on Oct. 9 where the three board members voted to support the termination of former fire chief Mark O�Brien by Town Manager Pat Finnigan. Selectmen Rick Dolliver and John Daley voted against upholding O�Brien�s termination. O�Brien has since filed a complaint against the town in York County Superior Court appealing his firing. Before the lawsuit was filed the recall effort was slated to move forward after Town Clerk Chris Murphy issued findings in the challenges made at a public hearing on Jan. 11 to signatures gathered on the recall petitions. Murphy denied all but three of the 11 challenges, meaning there were enough valid signatures to move petitions to the Select Board. Murphy and Town Manager Pat Finnigan could not be reached Friday to offer details on a possible schedule for the election. The Select Board are slated to meet for a regular board meeting at 6 p.m. on March 19. Choose the plan that's right for you.

Michael,Gordon,2597,https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/titans-super-sub-aj-brimson-ready-to-take-on-big-m/3664071/,"Titans young gun AJ Brimson says he is ready to tackle the NRL's biggest forwards as coach Garth Brennan prepares to throw him into a super sub role. Brimson is in line to wear the Gold Coast's No.14 jersey when the Titans begin their NRL campaign against Canberra at Cbus Super Stadium on Sunday week. Brimson, a Dally M rookie-of-the-year nominee last year, has had an interrupted pre-season after undergoing a shoulder reconstruction. Brimson starred at five-eighth in 15 NRL appearances last season and his long-term future at the Titans is at fullback. But Brennan has indicated he may look to ease the 20-year-old back from injury as a bench utility, meaning he could pop up anywhere on the field. At 89kg, Brimson could be tasked with bringing down 120kg-plus forwards if he comes on at dummy-half. But the Queensland Emerging Origin squad member said he was ready for any challenge in his second NRL season. ""If he wants me there (hooker) I'll go out there,"" Brimson said. ""I haven't spoken in depth too much about it with (Brennan) and what's going to happen. ""I'm trying to get the shoulder right for Round 1 and hopefully I can be out there somewhere in the team. ""I reckon I could play anywhere. I'd be happy to play anywhere. ""I have my preferences but I'd be happy just to be out there."" NRL FANS SURVEY: Take our short survey to make your voice heard on the great game of rugby league. Brimson made a timid return from his shoulder surgery in the Gold Coast's 25-22 trial loss to the Broncos last Saturday night. He came on at fullback in place of Michael Gordon and said he would try to learn as much as he could from the veteran No.1 in his final NRL season. ""Every time I'm subbed out at training I'm watching him and trying to learn,"" Brimson said. ""It's the same with Ash (Taylor), Tyrone (Roberts) and Ryley (Jacks) in the halves.

Michael,Gordon,2617,https://www.powderbulksolids.com/news/Man-Killed-While-Discharging-Sawdust-from-Hopper-03-08-2019,"A man died Thursday afternoon at the Conner Industries lumber yard in Valley Center, KS after he attempted to manually clear a flow issue in a hopper and became buried and trapped by sawdust, local news organizations reported. Crews responded after the accident occurred at about 12:30 p.m. Officials told the Wichita Eagle that the man parked his truck under the hopper and was filling his trailer with dust when the incident occurred. “From what we can gather, he was under there trying to knock some sawdust loose with a pitch fork and it came down on top of him,” Valley Center Police Department Sgt. Michael Gordon said in the Eagle’s coverage. Witnesses interviewed by television news station KAKE said the man was buried by the material. The man was not breathing when first responders reached him and he was declared dead on scene. Police are investigating the death as an accident. Reports did not include the deceased man’s name but noted he was in his 60’s. Connor Industries is a provider of industrial wood and packaging solutions for a wide range of industries, including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, agriculture, and automotive, according to the company’s website.

President and CEO of the mega cruise shipping line, Michael Bayley, and president of the ACMF handed over US$50,000 from that fund last Monday. In addition, Bayley's first visit to CMU served to introduce him to the highlyskilled, internationally certified potential workforce in Jamaica, which may result in internship opportunities for students and employment for CMU graduates.Here, (from left) Professor Ibrahim Ajagunna, Vice president of academic and student affairs, CMU, and Professor Fritz Pinnock, president, CMU receive a cheque valued at $50,000 from Dr Geneive Brown Metzger, president of the ACMF, and Michael Bayley, president and CEO of RCI.

After the truck was on the block for around a week, it finally left overnight, according to another of the people.

There’s a lot of talk in Washington about changing Medicare to reduce costs. But while many proposals would cut costs for governments and insurers, they won’t cut costs for seniors; and even worse, they would limit access to the medicines that could save their lives – now and in the future. Cutting costs for everyone except seniors and limiting access to medicines are the wrong prescription for Medicare. On the other hand, making changes that help seniors pay less out-of-pocket are the right prescription for Medicare.

Andrew,Davis,2602,https://usustatesman.com/going-off-script-with-the-antics-comedy-improv/,"No script and no rehearsal are the ingredients of The Antics Comedy Improv show. The local comedy group performs at the Dansante Theater every Friday, making audiences laugh with their witty and unexpected humor. The group began as a Utah State University club. Members felt they were good enough to perform for live audiences and took the club to the big stage. This has allowed them to interact with the community and create an audience that keeps coming back for more. Carl Calderwood, group manager, gave some insight into how their shows keep people interested. “No two shows are alike. This is one of the few forms of entertainment that involves the audience to make sure everyone has fun,” Calderwood said. At The Antics’ show, audience participation is the driving force. A typical show consists of the audience offering a topic and the cast basing an entire scene off it. Since 2008, Antics has provided the community with fun, family friendly improv shows every friday night of their season, at the Dansante Theater in downtown Logan Alyssa Landrosche, theater education major, said, “It is fun to see them break out of their shell and experience the magic and fun of improv.” The cast also explained that they have several games they regularly play with the audience, one of which is called “a musical day in the life.” The Antics choose an audience member and recreate their day as a musical. Landrosche said it is always hilarious and unexpected. The cast also said they have began getting recognized by audience members in public. Brad Melville, social studies composite teaching major, appreciates this taste of fame. “It makes me feel like I am celebrity for a second,” Melville said. “It is nice to know that in a town with a lot of college students, we can give them something fun to do on a weekend. It makes me feel like I am contributing.” The Antics are a nonprofit group and all ticket sales from their show go towards putting on the next one. It is not about the money, but rather the member’s love of improv. Andrew Davis, Antics member, said he used to dislike improv. It wasn’t until he went to a show and tried it out for himself that he discovered how fun it was. “It is about instilling and improving confidence in yourself. When you are on stage and you are in character, you have nowhere to hide. You are that character,” Davis said. “It’s amazing what going out there can do to change yourself. It is a life skill that can help you find yourself and come out of your shell.” Other members of the Antics also agreed that improv has taught them skills that they have found useful in everyday life. Callie Lythgoe, costume design major, explained that through improv, her confidence had been elevated. “My confidence in every moment has increased, especially in times when you need to be ready to answer a question. That skill has been tremendously useful and I love cultivating it,” Lythgoe said. The Antics are an open group and they encourage students to come to their open practices, which are held in the Lundstrom Student Center. If students would rather watch and laugh along with The Antics, they can catch one of their shows Fridays at the Dansante Theater at 7:30 p.m. The Antics said audiences are sure to enjoy themselves and leave laughing. “If you go, you will not believe how it exceeds your expectations. It’s not funny because we are trying to be funny, it is funny because we understand life is funny,” Davis said. “For anyone who is skeptical, they have to come and see one. The chances are they are going to love it and we are going to laugh right with them.” For more information about The Antics, visit their Facebook page. —shelby.black@aggiemail.usu.edu @shelbsterblack Comment Name Email Url

Retweeting this account, Bettel wrote, ""Saying nothing was not an option for me."" Bettelthe first EU leader to be married to a same-sex partnerhad planned to make the statement before arriving at the summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egyptwhich hosted the first gathering between the EU and Arab League. A second person has experienced sustained remission from HIV-1, according to a case study published March 5 in the journal Nature, CNN.com reported. Effectively, some scientists believe that the ""London patient"" has been cured of the viral infection, which affects close to 37 million people worldwide. The new case report comes more than 10 years after the first case, known as the ""Berlin patient."" London-based Carmen Liu Lingerie/GI Collectionwhich calls itself the world's first transgender lingerie brandrecently launched with a fashion show, according to a press release. However, there were several anti-transgender protesters outside the event causing a stir by singing transphobic songs, wearing ant-LGBT clothing and waving anti-trans derogatory posters. See more about the brand at GICollection.co.uk. Organizers of the largest LGBTI pride event in South Korea urged the government not to give in to conservative groups and protect attendees, Gay Star News noted. The 20th Queer Culture Festival will take place in May, including a parade on June 1, organizers said at a press conference. Pride events in Korea are increasingly under attack from conservative Christians. A court rejected a damages suit filed against a university in Tokyo by the parents of a graduate law student who died after he was outed as gay by another student in 2015, The Japan Times reported. The parents sued Hitotsubashi University, claiming the state-run school failed to respond properly to the outing of the 25-year-old that led to his death. However, the Tokyo District Court ruled the university had not failed in its responsibility to secure a safe environment for its students. Bohemian Rhapsody will be given a limited release in China staring mid-Marchbut the film will be censored for LGBT and drug content, The Washington Blade reported. According to the Hollywood Reporter, footage of Freddie Mercury ( Rami Malek ) kissing other men will be removed from the film. Scenes depicting drug use will also be edited out of the movie. The news comes after China censored Rami Malek's acceptance speech for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. British organization BAFTA has told its members that cinema giant Cineworld, the world's second largest theater group, has pulled support for the organization following Netflix's four BAFTA wins for Roma, Deadline noted. In a letter sent to BAFTA members, the organization said, ""I regret to tell you that ... Cineworld informed us of its unilateral decision to withdraw its support of BAFTA, citing similar concerns [to those expressed by fellow commercial chain Vue concerning streaming movies] regarding the eligibility requirements of the Film Awards.""

Steve,Cummings,2591,https://www.naroomanewsonline.com.au/story/5937738/shopping-options-that-best-support-our-farmers/%3Fcs%3D12,"The retail war between supermarkets has made it difficult for consumers to separate the curds from the whey when it comes to the best way to support Australian dairy farmers. Farmers are in the middle of a fight to keep their farms as drought, low farm gate prices and the high cost of fodder strangle any profit. While Woolworths has taken a step forward, with the initiation of a 10c increase per litre on it's Farmer's Own branded milk, more needs to be done. One dairy farmer, Steve Cummings, is pleased that the plight of the industry is finally getting the attention it deserves, but believes that the Australian public needs to be prepared to spend a little more on the weekly shop. RELATED: Minimum milk price push fails to pass “Woolworths price of $1.10 a litre is still ridiculously cheap,"" Cummings said. To ensure the future of Australian dairy, retailers, consumers and processors need to work together to ensure viability of the industry. As everyone along the production line skims the cream off the profit, farmers are left with very little. The advice industry representatives for consumers is to boycott home-brand products. Stick to branded products or companies that have initiated a levy to support farmers, such as Farmers Own, Dairy Farmers, Pauls and Pura, among others. Milk is only the tip of the iceberg, ensure that you purchase Australian cheese, yogurt and other dairy products. RELATED: Minister calls for boycott over cheap milk Retailers increasing prices alone won’t make a difference, we need to ensure that the increased profits are being passed down to those in need. Consumers can force the milk processors to pass on profits to farmers simply by the way they shop. CEO and company secretary of Dairy Connect, Shaughn Morgan, is passionate about keeping farmers in business. According to Morgan, Australia's national dairy herd has dropped from 9 billion to 8 billion in two years. ""Australia undervalues dairy farmers and undervalues milk,"" Morgan said. “Our farmers are hurting and are trying to put food on the table. “We need to look after people."" Dairy Connect is pushing the government to instate a milk ombudsman for the ACCC to negotiate with processors. So next time you head to the shops, keep in mind the products on the shelf that give the best return to our dairy farmers. These include:

Steve,Cummings,2599,http://cullmansense.com/articles/2019/03/06/cullman-gop-votes-oppose-iveys-proposed-gas-tax-hike,"CULLMAN, Ala. - The Cullman County Republican Party Executive Committee voted Tuesday night to oppose Gov. Kay Ivey's proposed 10-cent gas tax increase, following the lead of the Alabama Republican Party, which recently adopted a resolution opposing an increase in the state gasoline tax without an offsetting tax decrease. ""We just had our monthly executive meeting tonight,"" said Steve Cummings, chairman of the Cullman County Republican Party Executive Committee. ""We voted to adopt the same resolution the state party adopted, which was to oppose the gas tax put forth by Gov. Ivey as it is currently proposed."" Ivey on Feb. 27 announced her Rebuild Alabama Infrastructure Plan, which proposes a 10-cent increase in Alabama’s fuel tax with an index designed to coincide with the rising costs of building roads. Said a statement from Ivey's office that day, ""The state currently imposes a flat excise tax of 18 cents-per-gallon on gas and 19 cents-per-gallon on diesel, without adjusting for inflation and other construction and maintenance costs. This combined fuel tax revenue generates 80 percent of Alabama’s transportation funding. The plan’s 10-cent increase will be phased in over the next three years. New revenue generated by the increase will be dispersed between state, county, and municipal governments in Alabama. These funds are to be used for transportation infrastructure improvement, preservation and maintenance projects. A separate portion of the revenues will go to pay a bond to be issued to finance improvements to the ship channel providing access to the facilities of the Alabama State Docks."" Following her State of the State address on March 5, Ivey called the Alabama Legislature into Special Session. Said Ivey's office, ""The Special Session will be focused on legislation to levy an additional excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel; legislation concerning the Legislature’s Permanent Joint Transportation Committee to provide for effective legislative oversight of the Alabama Department of Transportation; and legislation to provide the Alabama Highway Finance Corporation with authority to borrow money and issue bonds for the purpose of improving the Alabama State Docks and the Mobile Bay ship channel."" Ivey said of her decision, “Due to the dire need to act now, I am the Alabama Legislature into a special session, focused solely on passing this critical infrastructure legislation. Beginning tomorrow, as we enter this special session, we must shift our focus and tackle this issue together! It’s time to make our crumbling infrastructure system a problem of the past.” Copyright 2019 Humble Roots, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Keywords: View the discussion thread.

Residents hold signs expressing their opposition to a rezoning request for property near their homes during Monday evening’s city planning commission meeting. The Cullman Planning Commission recommended a rezoning request on Morningside Drive over the objection of 59 residents. A contested rezoning request involving a residential area won a recommendation from the Cullman Planning Commission, which sends the issue to the City Council. One commissioner, Steve Cummings, voted against the recommendation, while Trent Lowery and Andy Page abstained. Page serves on the City Council and will have to vote when the matter is brought to the agenda. Steve Cummings, chairman of the Cullman County Republican Party, speaks during Monday’s Cullman Planning Commission meeting. As in past months, several people of the Morningside Drive SW community came forward to oppose rezoning of a 10-acre site from R-2 to R-4, which would allow multi-family dwellings, such as apartments to be built. There is not a plan submitted to the city for apartments on the site, but many residents have said they understand that is the intent of the rezoning, which was requested by Wendy Childers of Weichert Realty on behalf of the owners. Brett Boykin, a Birmingham attorney, represented residents Leonard and Linda Romine. He said the change to R-4 violates the spirit or intent of the city’s zoning ordinance. Brett Boykin, a Birmingham attorney, representing residents Leonard and Linda Romine hands documents to Mayor Woody Jacobs “No one has made a detailed presentation of the plan. This would be speculative zoning, which many municipalities do not allow,” Boykin said. The City Council will announce when the matter will be considered by adding the issue to its agenda. Linda Romine, who moved to Morningside Drive 40 years ago, said the road, and Main Avenue, can not handle the traffic flow that would be created by a large development.

Residents also contended a large apartment complex would bring more challenges to utilities and wireless service in the neighborhood, and impact property values over time. Planning Commission Chairman Mike Voss said the board was obligated to recommend or not recommend requests to the City Council. The land in question is adjacent to other property that is R-4. The City Council will vote at some point to approve or reject the recommendation. David Palmer has decades of experience in the newspaper industry. He currently serves as editor of The Cullman Times.

Michael,Gordon,2614,https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwdance/article/-Kronos-Presents-Kronos-Festival-May-2019-20190307,"The San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet/Kronos Performing Arts Association(KPAA) is pleased to present Kronos Festival 2019, Kronos' fifth annual, three-day music festival, at SFJAZZ Center on May 30-June 1. Kronos Festival 2019 will highlight the voices of singers, storytellers, and activists over three evening concerts, a Saturday morning family concert and Kronos Labs, free public events that are new this year. Kronos has long collaborated with vocal artists, including in its recent Grammy Award­-winning album Landfall (Nonesuch Records) with Laurie Anderson and its new album Placeless (Kirkelig Kulturverksted) with Iranian singers Mahsa and Marjan Vahdat. During the festival, a wide range of artists will join Kronos on stage. Experimental duo CocoRosie, Malian griot singer Hawa Kassé Mady Diabaté (of Trio Da Kali), and the San Francisco Girls Chorus are all returning from last year's festival. In addition, folk musicians Sam Amidon and Lee Knight, composer and guitarist Jherek Bischoff, writer Rebecca Solnit, and filmmaker Sam Green will perform. Highlighting Kronos' legacy of mentorship, students from the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts once again take center stage during the festival. Kronos is honored that Valérie Sainte-Agathe, artistic director of the San Francisco Girls Chorus and frequent Kronos collaborator, will be Kronos Festival 2019's Artist-in-Residence. Additional guests will be announced. Each festival presents Kronos with an opportunity to unveil new work. The ensemble will debut the first part of a project, commissioned by the FreshGrass Foundation, that will commemorate the life and legacy of folk icon and activist Pete Seeger, who would have turned 100 years old this May. Kronos will also perform the Bay Area premiere of Glorious Mahalia, a work by Chicago-based composer Stacy Garrop that celebrates legendary singer Mahalia Jackson through the words and spirit of oral historian and activist Studs Terkel. Kronos also premieres two pieces written for 50 for the Future: The Kronos Learning Repertoire. One is by Stanford University composer Mark Applebaum, whose works frequently consist of both gestural movements and sound, and another by Diabaté, whose work is inspired by the tegere tulon-a tradition of handclapping songs and dances created spontaneously by girls in country villages of southern Mali. Kronos' 50 for the Futureis a string quartet commissioning, performance, education and legacy project that is creating a library of 50 works-composed by 25 women and 25 men-designed to guide young amateur and early-career professional string quartets in developing and honing the skills required for the performance of 21st-century repertoire. During Kronos Festival 2019, scores and parts, recordings, and other pedagogical materials for five new works will be made publicly available on Kronos' website, bringing the total number of available works to 30. This year, the festival also debuts Kronos Labs, an admission-free series, on Saturday afternoon. ""Big Five of Bayview"" is a free talk and performance led by Sainte-Agathe that will highlight the legacy of the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood activists and include a protest music sing-along featuring music popularized by Pete Seeger. ""Pete Seeger: 'The World that Music Lives In'"" is a free talk by American Folklife Center, Library of Congress curator Todd Harvey that will illustrate Seeger's career and efforts for peace and social justice. Additional program highlights include Solnit and others reading selected testimonies as part of the national Voices of a People's History project, inspired by the scholarship of historian Howard Zinn on Thursday night; Green enlisting Kronos in Por Vida!, a live documentary short about San Francisco's legacy business Casa Sanchez on Friday night; and ethnomusicologist Dr. Lucy Durán giving a pre-show talk about the tegere tulonon Saturday night. ""I feel so honored to be the Kronos Festival Artist-in-Residence this year,"" says Sainte-Agathe. ""It is, for me, a wonderful opportunity to join artistic forces and give hope and energy for the future to our community. Music is a powerful tool. I am grateful to be able to keep fighting together to advocate for more diversity and to move forward without ignoring the past. I am thrilled to have the San Francisco Girls Chorus be part of this adventure. Making sure women's voices are heard, believed and respected, even at a very young age, is such a priority."" ""Kronos Festival 2019 will celebrate music, activism, stunning voices, San Francisco, and the promise of youth,"" says David Harrington, Kronos' artistic director, founder and violinst. ""You will hear Mahalia Jackson, Studs Terkel, Rebecca Solnit, Sam Amidon, Hawa Kassé Mady Diabaté, CocoRosie and the San Francisco Girls Chorus with Valérie Sainte-Agathe, Kronos Festival 2019 Artist-in-Residence. Filmmaker Sam Green will tell a Mission District story.

Andrew,Davis,2588,https://www.opposingviews.com/society/family-dog-rescues-owner-raging-inferno,"Like many kids, Andrew Davis and his sister, Clara, wanted to have a dog as a pet. Their parents, Nola and Richard, surprised them one day when they brought home Patches -- the new family puppy, reports Little Things. Andrew and Clara were elated to have Patches in the family, and everything went smoothly -- until Patches began to grow. The parents hadn't taken into consideration the breed of their new dog, not thinking about how large it would get. They eventually decided their home was too small for such a large dog, and at a family meeting they announced that Patches had to go. Andrew protested the decision, and Nola agreed to delay the final decision for a few days. It turns out the decision to delay was a fateful one. That same night, as Nola was taking a bath, Patches charged into the bathroom and gently grabbed her by the wrist. Suspecting Patches was trying to tell her something, she got out of the tub, opened the door, and saw the house was on fire. Like Lassie in the movies, Patches led Nola through the maze of flames until they were safely outside the house, where the rest of the family was waiting. Once outside, Nola tried to go back in. Fortunately for her, Patches blocked her entry and would not allow her to go back into the inferno that she had just escaped. A few minutes later, the house exploded. As a result of the canine’s heroic efforts, Patches was given an award by the Red Cross. And the Davis family decided to keep Patches. Sources: Little Things / Photo credit: Wikimedia Commons

Please consider supporting community journalism by subscribing. WINSTON-SALEM — Four runs in the top of the third inning helped trigger the Barton College baseball team to a 9-5 nonconference over host Winston-Salem State at BB&T Ballpark. The NCAA Division II Conference Carolinas Bulldogs pushed their record to 15-8 with their 12th nonconference victory. The Div. II CIAA Rams tumbled to 10-6. The Bulldogs led 2-1 on senior Troy Maslowski’s two-run double in the top of the second when Barton used two hits and two WSSU errors to seize control in the top of the third. Sophomore Colby Warren reached on an error to lead off the third and eventually scored on a wild pitch after a single by shortstop JoJo Allen. Another Rams miscue allowed designated hitter Juan Martinez, who had walked, to score before junior catcher Brayden Olsen rapped a two-run single. The Rams scored in each of third, fourth and fifth innings to trim Barton’s lead to 6-5 before another WSSU error brought in an unearned run in the sixth. Warren tripled in Maslowski and Jacob Marcos for the final markers in the top of the seventh. Freshman left-hander Connor Patterson, the second of five pitchers used by Bulldogs head coach Jim Chester, picked up the win to even his record at 1-1. He worked an inning and a third, giving up three runs on three hits while walking one and striking out three. Relievers Jakob Ryan, Andrew Davis and Warren combined to shut out the Rams over the final 4 2/3 innings. Barton opens a conference series Friday at archrival Mount Olive with a single game starting at 5 p.m. The Bulldogs and Trojans will play a doubleheader Saturday at Scarborough Field, starting at noon.

Andrew,Davis,2581,http://www.voxy.co.nz/sport/5/333342,"The 5th Annual Hilux New Zealand Rural Games offering is heavily focused on free events for children, with a growing array of activities, and our popular events have been bolstered to reduce wait times. Held in The Square, Palmerston North, the Games are New Zealand’s premier celebration of rural sports, attracting more than 200 athletes from a diverse range of disciplines from both sides of the Tasman. Andrew Davis, General Manager of Marketing at Toyota New Zealand, says the Games help bring Kiwis together to celebrate our rural heritage. ""The magic of the games is in bringing New Zealand’s rural sports all together in one location. These are heritage sports, so we don’t get to see such high calibre competition often, so it makes for a spectacular show and a celebration of the cultural elements of rural NZ life."" says Mr Davis. Palmerston North Mayor Grant Smith says the Rural Games marks the start of ten days of rural festivities in the region. Palmerston North Mayor Grant Smith says the Rural Games marks the start of ten days of rural festivities in the region. ""We are one of New Zealand’s few urban cities that are still connected to the land, as well as being the agri-food hub of our nation and last year more than 60,000 people attended dozens of rural-focused events across the ten days from the Games through to the Central Districts Field Days."" New Zealand Rural Games founder and trust board member Steve Hollander says the aim is to celebrate rural sports, provide rural athletes with a national platform on which to perform, and deliver some welcome light relief for everyone. ""At its heart it is a fun event for families and whÄnau. We want to encourage young and old alike to have a go at something new. ""We have the old crowd favourites the ANZAXE, Speed Shear, Highland Heavies and Sheep Dog Trials,"" says Mr Hollander. ""There’ll be two world record attempts this year, in the tree climbing foot lock and hold, and egg throw and catch. ""This year, the Kids ‘n Country area will be larger than ever with inflatable footy fields, throwing walls, three self-drive diggers, tree climbing, miniature horse sulky rides and much more. ""The food court will be transformed into a Farmers Market on both days and for the first time we’ll be showcasing what is on offer around the Central North Island."" The Games will be awash with celebrity sports people, from netball’s Irene van Dyk and Katrina Gore (nee Grant) to Sir Brian Lachore, extreme fisher Matt Watson and the immensely popular Jordan Watson aka How to Dad. Plus the mad cap team from Trillian Trek along with Simon Dellow and Mark Wright will crash the Games on Sunday afternoon.

James,Crook,2595,https://www.pendletoday.co.uk/sport/more-sport/outstanding-performance-from-trawden-ac-runner-john-mcdonald-1-9633015,"While Trawden AC members were racing across three different continents over the weekend, the most outstanding performance came from John McDonald. Never venturing more than 25 miles from home, he packed in five races over two days. John’s epic weekend started at Pendle parkrun on Saturday morning, from where he hot-hooted it to the Stan Bradshaw Round, a 10-mile off-roader on Pendle Hill. Then it was back in the car for the final round of the Mid Lancs Cross Country at Cuerden Valley, before competing in the Podium Race at the Steven Burke Cycle Hub on Saturday night. And as if all that wasn’t enough, he was then the third Trawden runner home in the Ron Hill Accrington 10k race on Sunday morning. Club chairman Paul Brown finished the Tokyo Marathon in under three hours on Sunday, and eight members also ran the Benidorm Half Marathon, with Philip Murphy the first home ahead of Tracy Deed, Alan Deed, Gillian Smith, Lindsey Gawthrop, Karen Young, Diane Shaw and Yvonne McNamara while Michelle Barnsley and Estelle Dean were in action in the 10k race on the same day. Tom Cosway continued his recent good form with a top 50 finish in the Stan Bradshaw event, and there were also strong runs from James Crook, Frazer Durris, Shaun Heys, Fionnuala Swan, Dawn Tibbs, John McDonald, Lucy Beresford, Vic Rogan, John Carman, Rob Scott, Louise Preston and Karen Windle. Martin Greenwood, in a new 5k PB, was first Trawden runner home in the Podium Race, Adam Holda also secured a top 10 finish, and there were strong finishes from Simon Smith, Shaun Heys, Stephen Hartley, Jasmine Aherne, David Lord, Mark Fawcett and John McDonald. Saturday was the final round of the Mid Lancs Cross Country League at Cuerden Valley. Charlotte Robertshaw, Isabelle Perry and Tamzin Osborne won the Under 11s girls’ event while Freddie Holland, Oliver Brown and George Camara took the boys to second in the same age group. Joss Waiting, Isabel Holt and Isobel Beechey secured third spot in the Under 13s girls, and in the same age group William Walker won the boys’ race and Matthew Fleming and Ben Stratton ensured team success, while Abigail Stratton, Ellie Singleton and Paige Singleton made sure of fourth place in the Under 15s girls. Julie Townson, Dawn Tibbs and Jenny McAndrew took Trawden to 11th spot in the ladies’ race, and also fifth in the V35 race, and Julie and Dawn were joined by Caroline Fleming to finish third in the V45 race. In the men’s race, Adrian Blackledge, Stephen Hartley, Kevin Fenton-Clough, Allan Boult, Gavin O’Connor and John McDonald were 18th, with Adrian, Kevin, Allan and John 12th in the V40 race. Saturday also saw 55 TAC members in parkrun action – the furthest afield being Jonathan Lund in the Dubbo event in New South Wales. On Sunday, at the Ron Hill Accrington 10k race, Jordan Strachan finished second. David Howard secured a top 50 finish, and the other Trawden members in action were John McDonald, Jo Perry, Allan Boult, Dawn Tibbs, John Thompson, Tony Quinn, Chris O’Brien, Debra Leah, Colin Smith, Sarah Roberts, Neil Taylor, Andy Lamb, Anne Clark, Maxine Betts, Alan Wilkinson, Jackie Allen, Tracy Taylor, Saima Afzaal, Nigel Bullock, Louane Frances and Julie Bithell. David McCabe finished top 50 in the Haweswater Half Marathon, with Graham Denney and Linda Ensby also finishing well, and Sean Cole put in a strong performance in the Settle Half Marathon. ©2019 JPIMedia Ltd.

Jamie,Forese,2596,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/work/goldman-sachs-drops-stuffy-dress-code-for-flexible-look-1.3816135,"A trader works at the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The bank has become the latest Wall Street finance house to abandon its stuffy dress code in favour of a “flexible” approach. Photograph: Brendan McDermid/Reuters Goldman Sachs has become the latest Wall Street bank to abandon its stuffy dress code in favour of a “flexible” approach likely to find favour with the millennials the company is trying to hire. Goldman’s new chief executive David Solomon, whose penchant for weekend DJ-ing already stands to put him in good stead with the firm’s younger workforce, announced the move in a memo. The change comes three years after a similar pledge by JP Morgan Chase, though staff there say take up of “casual everyday” has been limited, in part because bankers fear showing up in jeans will alert their bosses to the fact that they have no meetings that day. Goldman Sachs itself brought in a casual dress code for its 8,000 technology staff almost two years ago, but maintained a more formal approach for the rest of its 36,000-strong workforce, including an explicit ban on “short trousers” for men. One insider said engineering workers “absolutely” embraced the relaxed dress code, adding that “some (juniors) had to be counselled against ripped and overly tight T-shirts”. Tuesday’s memo – co-authored by Mr Solomon, Goldman president John Waldron and finance boss Stephen Scherr – does not specify items of clothing that are banned or encouraged, instead telling staff to dress in a manner that is consistent with their clients’ “expectations”. “Of course, casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard,” adds the memo. “All of us know what is and is not appropriate for the workplace.” Bank dress codes have generally become less prescriptive in recent years. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chief executive, is often pictured without a tie, as is the bank’s president Daniel Pinto, while Citi’s president, Jamie Forese, is known for wearing a sport-style gilet in the office. Dress codes for women, who are slowly occupying a greater number of senior seats on Wall Street, are also typically more vague. Still, the loosening of the rules at Goldman has added significance as part of the bank’s evolution under Mr Solomon, who took the reins on October 1 after Lloyd Blankfein’s 12 years at the helm. Mr Solomon has promised a new era of transparency, including more detailed quarterly financial statements, the first instalment of which was warmly received by analysts in January. He is also reviewing strategy and resource allocation across the company, which is likely to result in a further pivot away from its investment banking roots into consumer banking and other new areas. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019 Subscribe.

Andrew,Davis,2615,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/obituaries/peter-hurford-dead.html,"Advertisement Supported by By David Allen Peter Hurford, a British organist, composer and choir director known for his incisive, buoyant recordings of Bach, died on March 3 in St. Albans, England, just north of London. He was 88. His death was announced by the St. Albans International Organ Festival, which he founded in 1963. Mr. Hurford made his name internationally by recording Bach’s complete organ works for Decca in the late 1970s and early ’80s. When the record industry was booming, such an encyclopedic endeavor was almost the norm for organists of stature. Many managed it once; a few, like Helmut Walcha, achieved it twice; Marie-Claire Alain somehow did it three times. But while other organists might have had a loftier vision for this music, none played it on record with quite the commitment to authenticity and the all-around good sense of Mr. Hurford. His playing was “characterized by brisk tempi, a strong sense of rhythm and highly articulated musical lines,” Thomas Trotter, the organist of the city of Birmingham and St. Margaret’s Church, Westminster Abbey, wrote in an email. “At the time it was a breath of fresh air, and a revelation to hear the music of Bach dance.” The New York Times music critic John Rockwell wrote in 1983, when the Bach cycle was completed, that while “Mr. Hurford is not the flashiest or most eccentric of players,” his Bach was “deeply, eminently satisfying.” Simplicity and clarity defined Mr. Hurford’s approach to the organ. And although he often played grander Romantic works, he saw the century or so between the birth of Buxtehude in 1637 and the death of Bach in 1750 as the pinnacle of his instrument. For a chapter on Bach in “Making Music on the Organ,” a handbook he published in 1988, Mr. Hurford took a verse from Keats that reflected his effective, straightforward approach: “Beauty is truth, truth beauty, — that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” Peter John Hurford was born on Nov. 22, 1930, in Minehead, Somerset, England, the son of Hubert Hurford, a lawyer, and Gladys (James) Hurford. He trained under the composer and organist Harold Darke and became an organ scholar at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied music and law. After military service and further study with the French organist André Marchal, who inculcated in him a love of the Baroque, Mr. Hurford became organist at Holy Trinity Church, in Leamington Spa in central England. In 1958 he became organist and master of the music at St. Albans Cathedral, just north of London. Firmly rooted in the tradition of English church music, and a composer of organ and choral pieces himself, Mr. Hurford remained at St. Albans until 1978 and oversaw the installation of a new organ there by the English builder Harrison & Harrison. Andrew Davis, the music director of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and a boyhood student of Mr. Hurford’s, recalled his “incomparable music-making, boyish charm and infectious enthusiasm,” especially during the construction of the organ in St. Albans. “He was, every week, like a kid with a new toy,” Mr. Davis said in an email. “One day I remember ascending to the organ loft to find him grinning from ear to ear. ‘Go and stand by the Positive,’ he said, ‘the Crumhorn has arrived!’ ” Mr. Davis recounted, referring to a section of pipes and its new addition. “He played a chord on the new stop and almost blew my head off.” In addition to the Bach project, which Mr. Hurford reprised by performing the works for BBC radio, he made solo recordings for Decca of composers including César Franck, Felix Mendelssohn and Paul Hindemith. He also recorded Handel’s Organ Concertos with Joshua Rifkin and Saint-Saëns and Poulenc with Charles Dutoit. In the early 1980s Mr. Hurford was visiting artist in residence at the Sydney Opera House, where he oversaw the completion of the organ in its concert hall. He served as president of the Royal College of Organists from 1980 to 1982 and was made an officer of Order of the British Empire in 1984. In 1955 he married Patricia Matthews, who died in 2017. His survivors include a daughter, Heather; two sons, Michael and Richard; and nine grandchildren. Mr. Hurford performed the works of Bach in a series of 15 concerts at the Edinburgh Festival in 1997. In an interview, he was asked what made Bach’s music so powerful. “It’s his simultaneous mastery of technique and ability to convey what is deepest in his spirit in the music that he writes,” he replied. “The challenge is one of expressing this on an instrument which is arguably the most difficult to make music on — the organ.” Advertisement

Sara,Burns,2624,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/crown-to-proceed-by-direct-indictment-against-accused-fredericton-shooter-1.4327692,"Live Now: CTV News at Six Advertisement FREDERICTON -- A Fredericton man accused of fatally shooting four people in the city last August is one step closer to a possible trial. Matthew Raymond is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and residents Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. The accused was back in provincial court Friday following a psychiatric assessment to determine if he can be found criminally responsible for what happened. The findings of that assessment have been sealed. Meanwhile, the Crown confirmed Friday it will proceed by direct indictment to send the case to the Court of Queens Bench, which means there will be no preliminary hearing. Outside court, defence lawyer Alison Menard said it would be a mistake to draw a link between the Crown's decision and the findings of the psychiatric assessment. ""It's not really fair to the process or people involved to make assumptions about what the evidence will ultimately be,"" Menard said. ""The fact that the Crown would choose to use one process over another ... it would not be fair for people to make assumptions about what that all means."" Preliminary hearings are typically held before criminal trials to determine if there is enough evidence to hold a trial. Raymond was previously found fit to stand trial. That assessment simply means the accused understands why they are in court, who the people in the courtroom are and how to instruct their lawyer. The 48-year-old man is accused of firing a long gun from his apartment window, killing Robichaud and Wright as they loaded a car for a trip on Aug. 10. Police allege Raymond shot the two officers as they responded to the scene. Raymond has previously told a judge there is evidence that would allow him to be ""exonerated."" He has yet to enter pleas to the charges. That's expected to happen once the process begins at the Court of Queen's Bench. He is expected to appear in Court of Queens Bench sometime before April 8, when proceedings at the provincial court level will be wrapped up. With video files from CTV Atlantic's Laura Brown Back in Fredericton court for Matthew Vincent Raymond appearance:https://t.co/Fy8ycGtQOP Matthew Raymond, 48, faces four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. Tributes poured in Monday for the victims of a plane crash in Ethiopia, many of whom were humanitarians, environmentalists and aid workers who had dedicated their lives to making the world a better place. weather Change city Advertisement Advertisement Use of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy © 2019 All rights reserved.

Sara,Burns,2624,https://www.nsnews.com/in-the-news-today-march-8-1.23657346,"March 8, 2019 01:15 AM Four stories in the news for Friday, March 8 ——— ALLEGED FREDERICTON SHOOTER TO RETURN TO COURT A Fredericton man accused of murdering four people in an August shooting spree is set to return to court today following a psychiatric assessment. The assessment was ordered to determine if Matthew Raymond can be found criminally responsible for the crimes he has been accused of. He is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. He is alleged to have fired from his apartment window with a long gun, killing the two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip on Aug. 10, and the two police officers as they responded to the scene. ——— SENTENCING FOR CALGARY MAN WHO KILLED MOTHER, CHILD A sentencing hearing is to begin today for a Calgary man convicted of killing a woman and her young daughter. A jury found Edward Downey guilty last year of first-degree murder in the 2016 deaths of Sara Baillie and five-year-old Taliyah Marsman. The Crown told the trial that Downey believed Baillie had influenced her best friend to break up with him and Baillie had refused to work for him as an escort. The prosecution further argued that Baillie's daughter was a witness who needed silencing. Downey repeatedly denied the killings in his testimony, and his lawyers argued someone else was responsible. ——— SALMON HABITAT TO RECOVER FROM PIPELINE WORK: DFO Work on a Trans Mountain pipeline crossing in a British Columbia stream altered habitat for young salmon, but the creek is expected to return to normal in one to two years, says Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Two biologists with the department visited Stewart Creek in Chilliwack on Jan. 30 after receiving a complaint from Mike Pearson, a biologist who raised concerns about the work done by Trans Mountain Corp. Pearson said in January the placement of 17 metres of articulated concrete mats at the bottom of the stream had reduced hiding places for coho and chum salmon and inhibited growth of the aquatic invertebrates they feed on. The DFO said the habitat has been altered, but the natural accumulation of sediment is expected to restore the salmon habitat. ——— SCIENTISTS VIEW OLD-GROWTH FORESTS THROUGH LICHENS Two Canadian biologists say there is more to old-growth forests than just trees, and lichens can be used to assess their value. Troy McMullin, a lichenologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature, says defining forests by the age of the trees is an oversimplification because it overlooks the importance of biodiversity in those habitats. He says lichens are like the canaries in the coal mine because they're sensitive to the smallest of changes, including pollution, humidity or the amount of light being received, which makes them strong indicators of the environment. He says more lichen in forests is associated with more biodiversity. ——— ALSO IN THE NEWS: — Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. will release preliminary housing start data for February. — Statistics Canada will release its labour force survey for February and industrial capacity utilization rates for the fourth quarter of 2018. — The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations will hold a press conference today in Saskatoon to address the federal government's child welfare legislation. — Alberta Premier Rachel Notley will announce a private-sector investment in a project that will get more value for the province's oil and gas resources. ‹ › or view results Nostalgic designs tell the story of B.C.

Michael,Gordon,2617,https://peabodyinstitute.wordpress.com/2019/03/08/adam-rosenblatt-performs-at-creative-alliance/,"Adam Rosenblatt (BM ’10, Percussion; KSAS BS ’10, Molecular/Cellular Biology) is an artist-in-residence with Creative Alliance, and as a winner of a Dean’s Incentive Grant will be performing Michael Gordon’s percussion sextet Timber. Usually, Timber is played using the best tropical wood available (mahogany, rosewood, etc). For this performance, though, Rosenblatt is sourcing the pieces of wood directly from the abandoned and vacant homes of Baltimore. These homes themselves thus become the main voice, telling the ongoing story of a city that still struggles with equity and stability for all its residents. Rosenblatt will collaborate with other Peabody alumni to make this performance come to life. The performance will take place on Friday, March 8, at 6:30 pm at Creative Alliance in Baltimore, Md.

Michael,Gordon,2617,https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/club-by-club-preview-for-on-field-action-nrl-in-league-of-its-own-20190131-p50uth.html,"By Phil Lutton Relaunch: The captains from the 16 NRL teams gather to officially mark a new season.Credit:AAP Gains: Tom Opacic, Josh McGuire (Broncos), Nene Macdonald (Dragons), Kurt Baptiste (Roosters)Losses: Johnathan Thurston, Antonio Winterstein (retired), Lachlan Coote (St Helens), Kane Linnett (Hull KR), Shaun Fensom (Broncos), Ben Barba (sacked)Last year: 13th (eight wins, 16 losses)In short: McGuire is a strong addition through the middle and, along with Jason Taumalolo, gives them formidable presence against any side. But with the Thurston era now over, Michael Morgan must not only fire but remain fit if they are a chance to play in the finals.What could possibly go wrong? After his acting debut in the NRL promo, Taumalolo finds he enjoys acting so much he heads off to play ""bouncer 3"" in a string of straight-to-streaming action flicks. Gains: Tyrone Peachey (Panthers), Shannon Boyd (Raiders), Tyrone Roberts (Warrington), Jesse Arthars (Rabbitohs), Ryley Jacks (Storm), Brian Kelly (Sea Eagles)Losses: Brenton Lawrence, Ryan Simpkins (retired), Kane Elgey, Brendan Elliot (Sea Eagles), Konrad Hurrell (Leeds)Last year: 14th (eight wins, 16 losses)In short: Some good signings make this a far more robust roster for coach Garth Brennan. Should AJ Brimson continue his rapid rise and Ash Taylor become a true general, they are a genuine shot at the eight. Tyrone Peachey might not regret his decision after all.What could possibly go wrong? It's a football team based on the Gold Coast. Use your imagination. Gains: Sean O'Sullivan (Roosters), Shaun Fensom (Cowboys)Losses: Korbin Sims, Jonus Pearson (Dragons), Tom Opacic, Josh McGuire (Cowboys), Marion Seve (Storm), Corey Allan (Rabbitohs), Sam Thaiday (retired)Last year's finish 6th (15 wins, nine losses)In short: Anthony Seibold arrives at Red Hill (eventually) with a clean slate and a talented young squad. No doubt they are good enough to be in the finals but his challenge will be to lift them to a level that can challenge hardened outfits like the Roosters. Big watch.What could possibly go wrong? Brisbane make it to another grand final, only to lose to Souths. Wayne Bennett smiles. Gains: Tim Glasby (Storm), Jesse Ramien, Edrick Lee (Sharks), Mason Lino, James Gavet (Warriors), David Klemmer, Zac Woolford (Bulldogs), Hymel Hunt (Rabbitohs), Kurt Mann (Dragons)Losses: Jack Cogger, Nick Meaney (Bulldogs), Brock Lamb (Roosters), Ken Sio (Salford), JJ Felise (Raiders), Cory Denniss (Rabbitohs), Luke Yates (London), Dylan Phythian (Burleigh), Pat Mata'utia (Wests Newcastle), Chris Heighington, Jacob Lillyman (retired)Last year's finish: 11th (9 wins, 15 losses)In short: Another non-finals club to add some solid stock in the off-season, the Knights look every bit a side on the rise, with Kalyn Ponga bursting to put together a dominant season in a key position. David Klemmer should be a superb signing in the forwards.What could possibly go wrong? Ponga decides to make good on his dreams of one day becoming an All Black. That day is the day before the NRL season starts. Wunderkind: Newcastle hope Kalyn Ponga can bring them to life in 2019.Credit:AAP Gains: Kane Elgey, Brendan Elliot (Titans), Corey Waddell (Panthers), Reuben Garrick (Dragons)Losses:Akuilla Uate (Huddersfield), Shaun Lane (Eels), Tom Wright (rugby union), Brian Kelly (Titans), Jonathan Wright, Lewis Brown (retired)Last year's finish: 15th (seven wins, 17 losses)In short: With Des Hasler back at his spiritual home, Manly should at least see some improvement from a difficult 2018 campaign. But without any top-shelf additions, Hasler must work his mad magic with a similar squad. Might be slow going.What could possibly go wrong? Daly Cherry-Evans does his back in while he unloads Hasler's backyard furniture before training. Gains: Junior Paulo (Raiders), Blake Ferguson (Roosters), Shaun Lane (Sea Eagles), Maika Sivo (Panthers)Losses: Suaia Matagi (Huddersfield), Corey Norman (Dragons), Cameron King (Featherstone), Nathan Davis, Siosaia Vave, Tony Williams, Jarryd Hayne (released), Beau Scott, Kirisome Auva'a (retired).Last year's finish: 16th (six wins, 18 losses)In short: Corey Norman departs but Blake Ferguson arrives, so at least the sets should start on a decent note. Brad Arthur needs a promising season from the wooden spooners to alleviate the immense pressure building out west. His job may depend on it. New stadium might be helpful.What could possibly go wrong? Spooked by another poor season, the club rules out ever hiring another coach with two first names, crushing the dreams of Michael Gordon, Nick Kenny, Matt Scott, James Graham and Shane Rodney, among many others. Blue and gold: Can Blake Ferguson help lift the Eels off the bottom?Credit:Parramatta Eels Gains: Ryan Sutton (Wigan), John Bateman (Wigan), JJ Collins (Knights), Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad (New Zealand Warriors)Losses: Shannon Boyd (Titans), Junior Paulo (Eels), Blake Austin (Warrington), Charlie Gubb (Widnes), Craig Garvey (released), Mikaele Ravalawa (Dragons), Liam Knight (Rabbitohs)Last year's finish: 10th (10 wins, 14 losses)In short: At their best, they can have patches where they can go toe-to-toe with the better sides in the competition. Sadly for the Raiders, forecasting when that is going to happen is rarely a simple task. Will that change this season?What could possibly go wrong? Ricky Stuart skipping his anger management classes and the club's contents insurance lapsing proves to be a costly combination. Gains: Dylan Napa (Roosters), Jack Cogger (Knights), Nick Meaney (Knights), Sauaso Sue (Tigers), Corey Harawira-Naera (Panthers), Christian Crichton (Panthers), Chris Smith (Roosters) Losses: David Klemmer (Knights), Moses Mbye, Josh Morris (Sharks), Brett Morris (Roosters), Greg Eastwood, Matt Frawley (Huddersfield), Zac Woolford (Knights)Last year's finish: 12th (eight wins, 16 losses)In short: The Dogs showed signs of improvement late last year and have some young players, like Rhyse Martin and Lachlan Lewis, ready to take the next step. Finals would be a surprise, though, and the departure of Klemmer looks damaging.What could possibly go wrong? Wally Lewis, the uncle of Lachlan, commands his nephew to pick a side and return to Queensland. He has that sort of power. Gains: Shaun Johnson (Warriors), Josh Morris (Bulldogs)Losses: Jesse Ramien (Knights), James Roumanos (Bulldogs), Trent Hodkinson (Manly), Edrick Lee (Newcastle), Luke Lewis (retired), Joseph Paulo (St Helens), Ricky Leutele (Toronto)Last year's finish: Fourth (16 wins, eight losses)In short: Another team that starts the season after some turmoil, with coach Shane Flanagan banished by the NRL and the club heavily penalised for salary cap breaches. But they do get arguably the biggest signing of the year in Shaun Johnson. Should be around in the finals again.What could possibly go wrong? Like an AFL footballer in Queensland, Johnson finds himself horribly homesick and returns to NZ for humanitarian reasons. Not-so-fresh start: Shaun Johnson has found a new home in the Shire, but he couldn't have predicted the pre-season troubles that have hit the Sharks.Credit:John Veage Gains: Leeson Ah Mau (Dragons), Taane Milne (trial), Adam Keighran (Penrith), Lachlan Burr (Bulldogs)Losses: Shaun Johnson (Sharks), Ata Hingano (Raiders), Albert Vete (Storm), Anthony Gelling (Widnes), Simon Mannering (retired), Zac Santo (released), Mason Lino (Knights), James Gavet (Knights)Last year's finish: Eighth (15 wins, nine losses)In short: The Warriors snuck into the finals last season but face an enormous test of depth to try and replace Shaun Johnson and the retired Simon Mannering. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck, the Dally M winner, was smouldering last year. He will need to even more influential now.What could possibly go wrong? RTS goes MIA. Gains: Tom Eisenhuth (Penrith), Marion Seve (Brisbane), Albert Vete (Warriors)Losses: Young Tonumaipea (religious mission), Tim Glasby (Knights), Ryan Hoffman (retired), Billy Slater (retired), Louis Geraghty (released), Lachlan Timm (Dragons), Ryley Jacks (Titans)Last year's finish: Second (16 wins, eight losses)In short: After yet another grand final appearance, the Storm lose the wondrous Billy Slater to retirement, putting even more pressure on the ageless Cameron Smith as he plays his 127th season in the top grade. They could be tested.What could possibly go wrong? Smith retires early to exclusively focus his energies of making the Tokyo 2020 AFLX Olympic team. Lone burden: A lot rides on Melbourne Storm captain Cameron Smith in the absence of Billy Slater.Credit:Justin McManus Gains: Tim Grant (Tigers), Hame Sele (Dragons), Tyrell Fuimaono (Rabbitohs), Malakai Watene-Zelezniak (Tigers)Losses: Tyrone Peachey (Titans), Tim Browne (retired), Christian Crichton (Bulldogs), Peter Wallace (retired), Oliver Clark (Tigers), Tom Eisenhuth (Storm), Corey Harawira-Naera (Bulldogs), Soni Luke, Corey Waddell (Sea Eagles), Trent Merrin (Leeds)Last year's finish: Fifth (15 wins, nine losses)In short: Like a few other clubs, the off-season has been a disaster, with the video-sharing scandal a source of constant turmoil. Should they rise above, though, new coach Ivan Cleary has every chance of guiding them to a top-four finish. Need to cut out the slow starts of 2018.What could possibly go wrong? It turns out the five-year plan resets at the end of every five years. Gains: Corey Allen (Broncos), Kurt Dillon (Sharks), Bayley Sironen (Tigers), Matt McIlwrick (Tigers), Liam Knight (Raiders), Cory Denniss (Knights)Losses: Angus Crichton (Roosters), Jason Clark (Warrington), Richie Kennar (Broncos), Hymel Hunt (Knights), Zane Musgrove (Tigers)Last year's finish: Third (16 wins, eight losses)In short: After a strong 2018, there is a huge watch on Souths as Wayne Bennett takes the helm. He must prove he still has what it takes to coach at the top level and needs a fit Greg Inglis and Adam Reynolds on his side. Good enough on paper.What could possibly go wrong? It turns out Wayne Bennett loves the Sydney media so much he quits halfway through the season to join their ranks. Loves the press box pies. All in his stride: Bunnies coach Wayne Bennett has been there, done that. Credit:AAP Gains: Zane Musgrove (Rabbitohs), Paul Momirovski (Roosters), Ryan Matterson (Roosters), Robert Jennings (Rabbitohs)Losses: JJ Collins (Raiders), Tim Grant (Panthers), Tuimoala Lolohea (Leeds Rhinos), Matt McIlwrick (Rabbitohs), Taane Milne (Warriors), Kevin Naiqama (St Helens), Sauaso Sue (Bulldogs), Malakai Watene-Zelezniak (Penrith Panthers)Last year's finish: Ninth (12 wins, 12 losses)In short: Michael Maguire returns to the NRL coaching ranks and should give the Tigers a hard edge to their entertaining style. They have every chance to improve after a 50-50 season in 2018. Need to progress from that fringe-finals grey zone.What could possibly go wrong? Players get on the bus but a service outage sees it terminate in the bottom four. Gains: Angus Crichton (Souths), Brett Morris (Bulldogs), Ryan Hall (Leeds)Losses: Ryan Matterson (Tigers), Jayden Nikorima (released), Blake Ferguson (Eels), Frank-Paul Nuuausala (retired), Paul Momirovski (Tigers), Eloni Vunakece (retired), Mitch Cornish (retired), Sean O’Sullivan (Broncos)Last year's finish: First (16 wins, eight losses)In short: Oh look, the premiers have signed Angus Crichton and Brett Morris.

Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: March 11, 2019 @ 4:52 pm Kennel ordinance draft representative as seen in February Kennel ordinance draft representative as seen in February At a recent Caswell County Board of Commissioners meeting, a row or two of benches were filled at the Historic County Courthouse with citizens who were against a kennel ordinance draft rewrite first publicly addressed in February. Chris Johnson, from the southern side of Caswell County, said there already is ordinance in place and he recommended the supervisors reflect on what their intentions are because he, a hunter with “probably more dogs than any other person in the county,” would be negatively affected by the new legislation while inhumane puppy breeders of times past wouldn’t. Cynthia Drake of Oxford said while she lives outside the county, legislation passed here could have implications and copy-cat legislation elsewhere. Drake is a breeder-handler for a rare heritage strand of American black and tan coonhounds that she said may go extinct without her efforts. She said while she does have a larger number of dogs, they’re all treated well and within federal guidelines yet such legislation as originally written would negatively affect her if implemented in her county. Drake said she uses her dogs as a free service to hunters for tracking down deer that run away injured. She and Johnson both said that animal-rights groups shouldn’t be the only authors to animal-welfare ordinances and other groups should be included in the discussion. Commissioners Chairman Rick McVey said the meeting wasn’t a back and forth discussion format, but perhaps one should be setup. McVey shared a letter sent to the commissioners by a hunting and wildlife advisory group and asked the dog owners if they too had seen it and if they agreed with the concerns written within. Commissioner David Owen said the letter covered several of his concerns, but didn’t specify which. More than half the dog owners said the letter didn’t cover what they would like to see in an ordinance and Johnson said he disagreed with most of it. “Commissioners, Mr. Chairman, I’d be more than happy to take the comments you as commissioners have; incorporate those into the draft we have now; and put those onto the county website, making those available to the public before any type of public meeting is held,” said County Manager Bryan Miller. “I think we need to be very careful about drafting specific language that would in some way hinder individual rights,” said Owen. Commissioner Bill Carter said people would need more than two weeks to read over the potential ordinance. Owen said the meeting should be at night so working citizens could more easily attend. Regardless of what’s written, Owen said, those determined to do wrong will do so even if 100 pages of ordinances are written, so if citizens see or know of animals being done wrong, let county animal control officers know, he said. The next meeting to discuss animal ordinance is set for the third Monday next month, April 15. Sorry, there are no recent results for popular images.

Michael,Gordon,2597,https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/police-make-dramatic-arrest-of-robbery-suspect-in-busy-intersection,"Members of the London police emergency response unit arrested Michael Gordon Tuesday morning at Wonderland and Southdale roads. Gordon, 38, is charged in connection with an armed robbery at a Florence Street home on Feb. 25. Photo shot on March 5, 2019. (DALE CARRUTHERS / THE LONDON FREE PRESS) London police arrested a suspect in an armed robbery during a dramatic takedown at a busy intersection Tuesday morning. Several unmarked police SUVs surrounded a van at Wonderland and Southdale roads shortly before 9 a.m. About a dozen emergency response officers swooped in on the van and arrested a man. The woman driving the vehicle was not arrested. “I can’t believe they came out in full force like that,” one witness said. “It was crazy.” Michael Gordon, 38, is charged with armed robbery and breaking a probation order banning him from possessing a gun or ammunition. He’s scheduled to appear in court later Tuesday. His arrest stems from a Feb. 25 incident in which three men, armed with a gun, knives and a baseball bat, went to a home on Florence Street near Kellogg Lane and robbed residents. While the trio was leaving, several shots were fired, striking one of the three men, who was treated at hospital for multiple gunshot wounds, police said. Officers sent to the scene at about 1:15 a.m. arrested a suspect nearby and recovered a gun, police said. They also arrested the man in hospital. With Gordon’s arrest, one other robbery suspect, whom police have not identified, remains at large. Johnny Grebenchan, 28, of London is charged with robbery and breaching a release condition. Grebenchan is accused of robbing a woman while armed with a gun, and breaking a prior release condition banning him from having weapons, court documents show. Craig Chapman, 39, is charged with aggravated assault and discharging a firearm with intent to injure for allegedly firing a handgun at Grebenchan, court documents revealed. Chapman, who faces 10 charges in total, is linked to the Gatekeepers motorcycle club, the local support club for the Hells Angels’ London chapter, sources tell The Free Press. 365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com © 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Andrew,Davis,2615,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/03/08/hollywood-mine-julianne-moore-gloria-bell-its-personal/,"Trending: Julianne Moore is “Gloria Bell,” opening in Boston and a veritable tour de force for the Oscar-winning actress who is in virtually every scene for this mostly affectionate portrait of a 50something divorcee. A grandmother and very much on her own, Gloria’s passion extends beyond her job, her two grown children. It’s on the dance floor at a local bar where disco classics prompt her to let loose that she feels most alive. It’s here that whenever she gets knocked down, Gloria finds the guts, the strength, to pick herself up, embrace the present, look to the future. It’s a life lesson Moore herself learned early in her brilliant career. This past week at Manhattan’s Langham Place Hotel I mentioned how for the first time since it opened, I had recently rewatched Andrew Davis’ classic thriller, 1993’s “The Fugitive.” Time has been kind to “The Fugitive,” a gigantic Harrison Ford hit that spawned not a sequel but a spin-off “U.S. Marshals” with Tommy Lee Jones. What really surprised me? Moore’s star billing, right below the two male leads. At the time she was known for a scene-stealing role in “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.” How did she get that top spot for a relatively small role? Was it simply a good agent? “Because it was a big part,” Moore explained. “I tested for it. It was going to be a big part — he [Ford’s wrongly accused Dr. Richard Kimble] would meet me at the hospital and I was going to go on the run with him. Two weeks before shooting, they made a decision to cut that part from the movie. It was devastating. Because this was my big break! It was a really big deal. Instead I showed up and worked for those few days — and that was it. I had the billing but I didn’t have the part. Honestly, how did I feel? I was devastated. Sometimes that happens.” Q: Like Gloria, you had to say it doesn’t matter and you go on? JULIANNE MOORE: You can’t say it doesn’t matter, that’s the thing. But you have to go on. That’s the difference – resiliency is stuff happens, you feel it, it is painful. It does matter. But you still go on. A Julianne Moore feature runs in the HERALD next week. Francis Ford Coppola Intros 50th Anniversary Edition of Mario Puzo’s ‘The Godfather’ Francis Ford Coppola will be forever defined by his “Godfather” trilogy, whose first installment in 1972 was a notoriously troubled production. Its spectacular success rebooted Marlon Brando’s career, made stars of Al Pacino, James Caan, John Cazale and Robert Duvall and paved the way for many, many Mafioso movies to come, including “The Sopranos.” But first, to start our enduring fascination with the Mob, there was Mario Puzo’s 1969 bestseller. In an Introduction written specifically for this 50th Anniversary edition ($16, Berkley), Coppola refers to his lackluster school days (“I was a perpetually bad student”) who’d been “temporarily paralyzed by polio.” He recalls a thuggish Italian brute coming up to him as he was riding high on the initial success of “The Godfather” and snarling at him regarding Puzo, “You didn’t make him!! He made you!” Coppola won’t disagree: Puzo’s novel, he writes, “changed my life.” Although he does confess his first impression reading Puzo was “This was more like Harold Robbins or Irving Wallace” – best-selling authors of what today would be derided as “popcorn novels,” entertaining but hollow. When it became apparent Coppola would adapt Puzo’s book for a movie, a re-reading offered a discovery: “Lurking within it was a great story,” he writes, “almost classical in nature: That of a king with three sons, each of whom had inherited an aspect of his personality.” The filmmaker recalls Puzo’s handwritten notes on Coppola’s script – “He was terse.” He mentions the Italy-set saga of Vito Andolini who came to America after the brutal killings of his father and mother – a key chapter that Coppola could not insert into “Godfather” but became the subtitled Robert De Niro sequence in “The Godfather, Part II.” Coppola writes that he was irritated that “The Godfather, Part III” was so titled when he and Puzo thought of it not as the conclusion of a trilogy but “a coda” that should have been called “The Death of Michael Corleone.” He happily credits Puzo with coming up with that film’s most memorable line: “Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.” Coppola concludes, “The more familiar I became with Mario’s work, the more impressed I was.” It may be 50 years on but it’s not too late – check out Puzo’s “The Godfather” and see for yourself. Brilliant Brit Crime Drama “Manhunt” Martin Clunes is the British actor best known for the wry, offbeat, long-running “Doc Martin,” so it’s quite a switch as he commands serious attention in “Manhunt,” a true-crime British miniseries premiering Monday on Acorn.TV. Based on the memoirs of London Metropolitan police detective DCI Colin Sutton, who co-wrote the series, “Manhunt” is an extremely well-paced procedural that begins with the investigation into the death of a visiting French student Amelie Delagrange whose body is found on Twickenham Green in August 2004. The Green is open, bordered by shops and restaurants, yet there are no witnesses. There is no motive and while there has been no sexual assault, the killer was careful to leave no forensic evidence. Clunes’ DCI Sutton is not thought the best man for this job where the public demands they find the killer. His subordinates are hardly a happy bunch when Sutton’s directives mean a mountain of drudgery going thru hundreds and hundreds of hours of CCTV footage or the license plates of every registered car. A connection is discovered with the murders of two other young women and there’s a sighting of a suspicious man dumping into a nearby canal – it’s a corpse. Finally, as months pass the police get a break with the video footage. Once Sutton is certain they’ve found the killer, he must collect enough evidence for a conviction. Clunes is best when unexpected grace notes appear, as when he goes to Paris to not just comfort Amelie’s grieving parents but to apologize – for if the police had not screwed up on discovering a crucial clue, the killer would have been stopped earlier and Amelie would be alive. NEW DVDs: Eric Dane is retired as “The Last Ship: The Complete Fifth Season” (Blu-ray + Digital, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, Not Rated) begins its final 10-episode season. With Michael Bay among its executive producers, this apocalyptic drama emphasizes action and moral quandaries among its crew as a lone naval warship the USS Nathan James patrols the seas to save humanity from extinction after the Red Flu, a powerful virus, has decimated Earth’s population. Dane’s Tom Chandler remains central to the action as the ship’s crew tries to avert another world war. Bonus: two featurettes. A novel look at Superman’s origins, the hit SYFY series “Krypton: The Complete First Season” (Blu-ray + Digital, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, Not Rated) begins two generations before the Faster than a Speeding Bullet resident alien lands on Earth. Here Superman’s grandfather Seg-El bonds with a time traveling Earthling Adam Strange to restore the fate of his future grandson. Cameron Cuffe’s Seg-El is the big reason this “Krypton” flies high. Extras abound: Gag reel, deleted scenes, the 2017 Comic.Con panel and featurettes. Jesse Eisenberg is the executive producer on the fascinating documentary “The World Before Your Feet” (DVD, Greenwich, Not Rated) and as a DVD bonus, there’s an interview with him along with deleted scenes. But the focus here is on two men. There’s Matt Green, whose odyssey is the point of the film. Behind the camera is Jeremy Workman as director, producer, cinematographer and editor. “World Before Your Feet” details Green’s quixotic life-changing journey. Namely, to walk the 8,000 miles of roads and paths that comprise New York City. Green left his engineering job and his apartment, devised a $15 per day budget and couch surfed and cat-sat to be able to continue on his peculiar trek. From Staten Island thru all five boroughs, from parks, streets, cemeteries and bridges, Green learns about his city and offers,according to The Hollywood Reporter, an “endearing” look at the “pleasure of wandering.” A three-hour WWII epic that stands as the most expensive Finnish film yet made, “Unknown Soldier” (Blu-ray, Kino Lorber, Not Rated) covers three years in the life and death(s) of an infantry unit in what was known as the Finnish Continuation War. In Finnish with English subtitles, the extensive bonus material includes deleted scenes, ‘Into the Unknown: The Making of “Unknown Soldier”’ and post-production featurettes.

Andrew,Davis,2615,http://www.bendbulletin.com/home/6984255-151/guest-column-bend-council-got-appointment-wrong,"By Brian Douglass Do you have a point you’d like to make or an issue you feel strongly about? Submit a letter to the editor or a guest column. The city of Bend government is in crisis. The most egregious act against democracy in the history of Bend, has been committed over the filling of a vacant council position by Sally Russell and Bruce Abernethy. Not in my nearly 30 years as a volunteer disability rights advocate and community activist have I seen an elected public official sworn in and then within a month virtually self-destruct and lose all their credibility and trust with their constituents. However, that is what we all have witnessed with our new mayor, Sally Russell. Do you have a point you’d like to make or an issue you feel strongly about? Submit a letter to the editor or a guest column. She must be censored, sanctioned, or reprimanded by the Deschutes County Democratic Party and likely face a recall, after she has served six months in office. My several failed attempts to engage the Deschutes County Democratic Party, indicate that the party has decided to “circle the wagons” around Russell. Running as a “progressive” and fully supported by the Deschutes County Democratic Party, Russell dismayed voters by voting for a white, male Republican, to fill her remaining two years on the Bend City Council. Russell betrayed her supporters by supporting a candidate heavily promoted and lobbied for, by the Bend special interest group consisting of the Bend Chamber, Central Oregon Builders, Central Oregon Realtors and Russell, prior to her vote. Russell, as a Democrat, would certainly prefer another progressive. Apparently, she could not find a suitable choice, in the field of 36 candidates who applied for the appointment. Councilor Bill Moseley, a Republican, would certainly have preferred a conservative that had the blessing of the Bend special interest group. That would be understandable. Elections have consequences, as we all know. Voters defeated Moseley for mayor and Andrew Davis and Sarah McCormick and their $100K campaign for council. Yet in a flash, Russell thwarted the demonstrated will of the people, by supporting a special interest candidate; Abernethy then followed Russell’s lead. The “ideological balance” on the council with four progressives and three conservatives which was commonly in place for the past several years, and was publicly preferred, and with Russell’s and Abernethy’s votes the “ideological balance” became five conservatives and two progressives. Unbelievable! There can be no doubt by the votes of Russell and Abernethy that they will ever vote with the two progressive’s remaining on the council. They simply should not be trusted again. The important and needed progressive ideas to benefit average, hard-working Bend residents pursuing the American dream is what is needed to move forward, such as a reform of the council governance model, the $15 living wage, affordable housing, “starter homes” on unclassified lands south of Bend, a light rail system and Net Zero Energy (Solar) program all would improve the quality of life for many residents. It is hard to imagine with the current five conservatives and two progressives, that any of these ideas will see the light of day. All through the campaign Russell spoke to the need for “collaboration” on the council. She then became a “collaborator” aligned with special interest groups, when it came time to fill the council vacancy. I believe that both Russell and Abernethy should resign their positions immediately. Voters must wait six months prior to a recall campaign against Russell. Chris Piper, who received the interim appointment, is severely compromised and should also resign immediately. A blue ribbon nonpartisan commission should be formed to guide the city through to a smooth and orderly transition process. Bend cannot afford and should not have to wait two to four years to rectify this travesty and breach of the public trust and a new election should occur in the May primary election. Russell as the first elected mayor in 90 years, should now become the first mayor in Bend history to be recalled by the voters. — Brian Douglass lives in Bend.

Firefighters stand back as smoke pours out of a window at a house fire on Gregwood Circle in Queensbury on Wednesday evening. Firefighters stand back and assess the best way to get under the house and put out the remaining embers of a house fire on Gregwood Circle in Queensbury on Wednesday night. QUEENSBURY — Six fire departments were called into action Wednesday night in response to a fire that destroyed a home at 77 Gregwood Circle. The fire at the home in the Forest Park mobile home park was first called in around 5:45 p.m. West Glens Falls Fire Department First Assistant Chief Michael Gordon said everyone was out of the house before his team arrived and there were no injuries. Fire crews remained on the scene until around 10 p.m. Firefighters dug their way under the home from the front side to get at remnants of the fire underneath the house. Several panels and windows were removed in order to pump smoke out of the home. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, according to Gordon. Bill Barber, a brother of one of the residents, said the residents recently had electrical work done and he thought the fire may be related to that. He said when they returned home and plugged in appliances, something sparked and caught fire. Gordon said cold weather, such as the near single digits on Wednesday night, makes fighting fires much more difficult. He said frozen water lines and hoses can back things up, and several firefighters said their gloves were frozen in the frigid temperatures. There were no water lines close to the home, so several tanker trucks were needed to shuttle in water. The assisting departments included West Glens Falls, South Queensbury, Queensbury Central, Bay Ridge, Corinth and South Glens Falls. Fire crews remained on the scene until around 10 p.m. Firefighters dug their way under the home from the front side to get at remnants of the fire underneath the house. Several panels and windows were removed in order to pump smoke out of the home. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, according to Gordon.

Andrew,Davis,2602,https://news.uga.edu/ecology-students-use-botanical-garden-as-living-lab/,"(Gallery photos by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) What better way to learn about ecology than conducting a study in a living lab at the University of Georgia’s State Botanical Garden of Georgia? For a semester-long stream project, UGA students in Ecology 3500 designed their own original studies involving observing and measuring ecological processes in the Orange Trail stream at the botanical garden, a UGA Public Service and Outreach unit. They conducted field research this week. “Specifically the students study macroinvertebrate communities in the stream and tend to look at different abiotic factors that influence their abundance and/or diversity,” said Katie Brownson, doctoral candidate in Integrative Conservation and Ecology, the lead teaching assistant for the course. “But there is a lot of variability in what they study, as the students design their own projects.” Ecology 3500, or simply titled “Ecology,” in the Odum School of Ecology introduces students to core principles, classic experiments, current events and ongoing research in ecology. Students learn to apply principles of ecology to evaluate the structure and function of the natural world, including how ecological processes shed light on human-environment interactions. Course lab activities use inquiry-based learning, which provides a more realistic experience of ecological research than traditional lab format. Working in teams, students design an original ecological study and collect, analyze, and present their data.

Steve,Cummings,2608,https://advancetitan.com/news/2019/03/07/new-inspection-policies-in-place-for-rental-properties,"New inspection policies in place for rental properties Megan Behnke, News WriterMarch 7, 2019Filed under News, Spotlight The Oshkosh City Council approved a new amended program for inspections on rental properties. It started March 1 and raised prices for landlords if any violations are found. Oshkosh Mayor Steve Cummings said the whole goal has been to ensure that people have clean and safe housing. “It’s been going on for a couple years,” Cummings said. “The legislatures in Madison gave communities the ability to focus on ‘Targeted Areas’ and bad rental properties.” Inspection Services Division for the City of Oshkosh Chief Building Official John Zarate said the new program and the previous program have two differences. “The program is not required to be enforced city-wide as required under the previous law by the state of Wisconsin,” Zarate said. “A fee cannot be charged for initial and follow-up inspection as long as violations are corrected within 30 days.” OshkoshLiving rental property owner Mark Neubauer said inspections shouldn’t change too much now that the new program is in place. “We just have to make sure that all the houses are up to code,” Neubauer said. “The only thing that’s really changing is if a rental property is found to have a violation, it will cost more to pay that fine, whether or not the property is being rented.” Cummings said the inspections won’t affect students/residents already renting apartments as much as it’ll affect the landlords. “The inspections are more for the landlords,” Cummings said. “If they see something wrong, they try to make you pay for it, trying to intimidate the students.” Zarate said programs are typically not updated each year. “The reason this program has had to undergo changes is that many landlords throughout the state are against this type of program, and they have tried to get laws to stop it,” Zarate said. “So when the laws get changed then the city has to adjust the program accordingly.” Neubauer said the advice he would give to students-residents renting any kind of property is to take care of it. “Treat your rental property like it’s your own home, because it is,” Neubauer said. “Be sure that everything is how it should be: appliances work, the walls are good, the windows are good, electricity, you shouldn’t have a problem.” Cummings said landlords should try to keep their properties in good condition in order to avoid getting a violation and that residents should take pictures of their place when they move in. “Whatever you’re paying, you’re expecting it to have proper heat, running water, etc.,” Cummings said. “Something could go wrong, something could break or a pipe burst, a window could be smashed and the landlord can ask students to leave, accusing them of something that they might’ve not done. Take pictures when you move in so you’re not hit with something that isn’t your fault.” Zarate said there is no cost to the tenant at any time for the inspection, and the inspection is voluntary. “If the tenants allow for the inspection of the rental unit, it will ensure that the unit meets minimum housing standards that the landlord is required to provide to a renter in Oshkosh,” Zarate said. “The standards cover health and safety items to make sure tenants have a safe and healthy place to live.” News RUB hosts 70th Winter Carnival with 90s theme News What are sororities and fraternities?

Firefighters stand back as smoke pours out of a window at a house fire on Gregwood Circle in Queensbury on Wednesday evening. Firefighters stand back and assess the best way to get under the house and put out the remaining embers of a house fire on Gregwood Circle in Queensbury on Wednesday night. QUEENSBURY — Six fire departments were called into action Wednesday night in response to a fire that destroyed a home at 77 Gregwood Circle. The fire at the home in the Forest Park mobile home park was first called in around 5:45 p.m. West Glens Falls Fire Department First Assistant Chief Michael Gordon said everyone was out of the house before his team arrived and there were no injuries. Fire crews remained on the scene until around 10 p.m. Firefighters dug their way under the home from the front side to get at remnants of the fire underneath the house. Several panels and windows were removed in order to pump smoke out of the home. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, according to Gordon. Bill Barber, a brother of one of the residents, said the residents recently had electrical work done and he thought the fire may be related to that. He said when they returned home and plugged in appliances, something sparked and caught fire. Gordon said cold weather, such as the near single digits on Wednesday night, makes fighting fires much more difficult. He said frozen water lines and hoses can back things up, and several firefighters said their gloves were frozen in the frigid temperatures. There were no water lines close to the home, so several tanker trucks were needed to shuttle in water. The assisting departments included West Glens Falls, South Queensbury, Queensbury Central, Bay Ridge, Corinth and South Glens Falls. Fire crews remained on the scene until around 10 p.m. Firefighters dug their way under the home from the front side to get at remnants of the fire underneath the house. Several panels and windows were removed in order to pump smoke out of the home. The cause of the fire is still under investigation, according to Gordon.

Victor Hugo's Les Misérables may have been written centuries ago, but the novel's themes of forgiveness, compassion, and love are as relevant in 2019 as they were in 1862. ""Les Misérables does have an extraordinary resonance with people,"" actor Dominic West says in a new exclusive clip previewing the Masterpiece PBS series in which he plays Jean Valjean, a prisoner in the early 19th-century condemned for stealing bread to feed his family. ""Victor Hugo said so long as there is poverty in the world, this story will have meaning."" David Oyelowo, who portrays West's on-screen adversary Inspector Javert, agrees. ""Les Miserables represents redemption, the ability to forgive, things that I think make it feel very resonant to an audience."" In the sneak peek of the upcoming adaptation, it's clear the cast understands that most people's touchpoint for this story is the Les Miserables musical, be it the stage version, or Tom Hooper's 2012 film starring Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe. While the new mini-series doesn't have songs, it does offer, as writer Andrew Davis put it, a ""richer sense of the characters."" ""So many people associate Les Mis with the musical, but the original is a novel, and it's all drama,"" explains Lily Collins, who plays the ill-fated Fantine. ""This rendition you really get to see the polarities much more. You see Fantine at her most vibrant, which is a perfect comparison then to when she's at her worst."" Watch the sneak peek above. Les Misérables premieres Sunday, April 14 at 9 p.m. ET on Masterpiece PBS.

Bob,Diamond,2586,https://www.stamfordadvocate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/If-they-found-out-they-ll-go-completely-nuts-13661433.php,"Callum Burroughs, provided by Reuters A senior Barclays executive claimed he wouldn't sacrifice himself to save the jobs of then CEO John Varley and former president Bob Diamond if capital-raising negotiations at the height of the financial crisis fell apart, a London jury heard today. ""Well fuck that, I’m not taking a hit to save John and Bob’s jobs. Fuck that,"" the court heard that Roger Jenkins said. The quote from the former executive chairman of investment management in the Middle East and North Africa came in written testimony to the Serious Fraud Office by former Barclays Capital executive Richard Boath, in 2o14. The implication is that Jenkins was afraid the deal might be toxic enough to generate legal consequences that would land on his doorstep. The executives believed, during the darkest part of the global financial crisis, that if they failed to persuade a set of Qatari investors to give them £4 billion then Barclays might collapse. Other banks — Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Northern Rock — had gone to the wall at the time. The SFO alleges that Varley and other executives — Boath, Thomas Kalaris, and Roger Jenkins — misled investors in the deal by using ""advisory services agreements"" (ASAs). The SFO alleges that the side-deals paid Qatari companies £322 million ($423 million) — a 3.25% commission — in fees during the capital raisings, which were fraudulently not disclosed to other investors. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bob Diamond is not accused of any wrongdoing. Jenkins received a £25 million bonus for his role in the fundraising, given his close relationship with the Qatari investors. During a conversation between Jenkins and Boath in 2008, the two executives discussed the viability of paying Qatari investors additional fees, adding up to a larger sum than other investors received, the court heard. Boath said: ""We can’t do a capital markets transaction where we give one set of fees to the market or to one set of investors, and ... have a different set of economics for another set of investors because if they found out they’ll go completely nuts. You can’t do that."" The interview with the SFO indicates that there were numerous discussions about the way in which the Qataris could be paid, with Boath at one point getting frustrated by the prospect of an ASA being used. ""Tell them to get stuffed. Let’s do something else,"" the jury heard. Read more: See all our coverage of the Barclays Qatar trial here. Previously, the court heard that Thomas Kalaris, formerly head of Barclays Wealth Management said, ""None of us wants to go to jail here."" He was referring to a draft of the agreement. Boath responded, ""it ain't worth it and apparently the food sucks."" Kalaris then added: ""No the food sucks and the sex is worse."" In his interview with the SFO, Boath made it clear that there ""wasn’t a genuine concern about going to jail at all,"" and that his conversation with Kalaris was simply ""a joke."" He also claimed that his anxiety about the ASA deal ""disappeared"" after he learned that senior bank executives had consulted external legal advice about the agreements and the services provided. ""How could senior people at the top of their profession at a global bank like Barclays have agreed to this without some verification of the services?"" Boath said. The trial at Southwark Crown court is ongoing.
