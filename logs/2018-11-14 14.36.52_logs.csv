Yet so distinctive is his harmonic idiom, so unmistakable the sense of profound sadness that lies behind even the most apparently carefree of gestures, that it could be the work of no other. Sketches for his Cello Concerto, for example, date back as far as the 1930s, yet it was not until the early 1950s that he began seriously on the piece and even then it took four years of on-and-off work to complete. Cast in three movements lasting nearly 40 minutes, it contains a central Andante quieto that is especially poignant, coming from the pen of a composer who had been recently diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease and told he had as little as five years left. Paul Watkins’s captivating performance, supported devotedly by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under an inspired Andrew Davis and captured in opulently detailed sound, radiates insight and conviction in every bar. Rarely have the opening movement’s declamatory outbursts resonated so profoundly, nor the slow movement’s noble restraint and the finale’s triumph in the face of adversity. With first-class couplings, this is a Finzi disc to cherish.

Andrew,Davis,1928,https://www.nj.com/south-jersey-towns/index.ssf/2018/11/things_getting_hairy_at_clayto.html,"By Community Bulletin The Clayton Police Department is participating in ""No Shave November"" cancer awareness month. Clayton Police Chief Andrew Davis has suspended the department's facial grooming policy for all Clayton police officers who wish to participate in the event. The goal of No-Shave November is to grow awareness by embracing hair, which many cancer patients lose, and letting it grow wild and free. Participants are encouraged to donate the money they would typically spend on shaving and grooming. The hope is that seeing officers with facial hair will spark conversation in the community about cancer awareness. All police officers participating also will voluntarily make a donation to the Chordoma Cancer Research. This event is especially significant to the Clayton Police Department since one of its own -- Patrolman Nicholas Carr -- was diagnosed with Chordoma Cancer in 2013. Through surgery and treatment, the Clayton native has made almost a 100 percent recovery. Thos who would like to donate money for this program can contact any Clayton police officer or stop by the police station during business hours. Make out checks to the Clayton Fraternal Order of Police and write ""Cancer"" in the memo line. Cash will not be accepted. To donate online, visit impact.chordomafoundation.org and navigate to Carr's fund-raising page. All proceeds will be donated to the Chordoma Cancer Research.

Phillip,Frost,1927,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/12/why-opko-health-inc-shares-soared-today.aspx,"Returns as of 11/14/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/14/2018 Shares of Opko Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) soared 19.1% higher as of 11:26 a.m. EST on Monday. The healthcare company topped analysts' expectations with its third-quarter results, announced after the market closed on Friday. Opko also again defended itself and CEO Phillip Frost against fraud allegations made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in September. Wall Street analysts' consensus estimate was that Opko would lose $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Instead, the company posted a net loss of $27.7 million, or $0.05 per share. This was a marked improvement from the prior-year period loss of $35.9 million, or $0.06 per share. Image source: Getty Images. However, Opko's bottom-line improvement didn't come from tremendous gains on the top line. The company's revenue increased only 1.5% year over year to $249.8 million. Opko's better-than-expected Q3 net loss stemmed primarily from spending cuts, particularly in selling, general, and administrative expenses. While beating Wall Street estimates is a good thing, the reality is that Opko can't use spending cuts to generate improvement indefinitely. Although the company continues to see incremental prescription growth for Rayaldee, sales for the secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug still aren't anywhere close to where the company needs them to be. Opko's statements during the company's Q3 conference call didn't provide any new details on the SEC fraud allegations. Steve Rubin, Opko Health's executive vice president-administration, said that the company is working with advisors to respond to the allegations. The charges of fraud against Opko Health and Phillip Frost came at a point where it seemed the company was beginning to turn things around. Opko's Q3 results reflected some improvement, but it wasn't enough to convincingly show that the company is coming back in a strong way. And it's still too soon to know what will happen with the SEC allegations. It's possible that Opko will successfully defend itself against the SEC. It's also possible that Rayaldee and other products will generate solid revenue growth for the company over time. For now, though, there are still too many questions to make Opko Health stock a good pick for most investors. Keith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Phillip,Frost,1927,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/business-in-brief-rocket-attacks-send-tel-aviv-shares-lower-in-final-half-hour-of-t-1.6652205,"Bezeq moves step closer to merger of three operating subsidiaries ■ Trading suspended in bonds of U.S. property developer Brookland ■ Rocket attacks send Tel Aviv shares lower in final half hour of trade Rocket attacks send Tel Aviv shares lower in final half hour of trade A rocket barrage from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel caused shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to drop sharply late in the session Monday. The benchmark TA-35 index turned down 1% in the minutes after 5 P.M. on the news and closed down nearly 0.6% for the day at 1,694.32 points. The TA-125 index lost 0.6% to 1,480.69 on turnover of 1.29 billion shekels ($350 million). Bank shares were big losers: Hapoalim declined 1.55% to close at 26.01, Leumi 1.5% to 24.31 and Israel Discount down 1.3% to 12.92. TowerJazz dropped 4.2% to 53.70, extending a month of declines that has seen its share price plunge 27%. Gilat Satellite fell 8.6% to 35.97 after it revised 2018 revenue projections to as low as $265 million from as high as $305 million. Kamada added 1.7% to end at 20.27. Its net loss widened more than tenfold year on year in the third quarter but it said it expected to meet its 2018 projections. (Eran Azran) Trading suspended in bonds of U.S. property developer Brookland Trading in Brookland Upreal bonds was suspended on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange Monday after the New York-based property company called a meeting of bondholders for Tuesday. S&P Maalot added Brookland to its credit watch list with a “negative” outlook. The developments came after TheMarker reported that the company would need to reschedule debt. Israeli investors hold about 150 million shekels ($40.7 million) in Brookland bonds, whose prices dropped as much as 5% to lift their yield to junk levels of 30% before trading was suspended. Brookland’s problems appear to stem from its failure to sell assets as it had planned in order to boost its cash position. The company, controlled by Israel Boaz Gilad, was among the first of a wave of U.S. property companies to sell bonds in Tel Aviv, issuing two series in 2014 and 2015. The company declined Monday to comment beyond its official TASE statements. (Eran Azran) Bezeq moves step closer to merger of three operating subsidiaries We've got more newsletters we think you'll find interesting. Please try again later. The email address you have provided is already registered. Bezeq, Israel’s largest telecommunications company, took a step forward Monday in its long-awaited plan to merge its Pelephone, Yes and Bezeq International units to help it compete more effectively. The company said Moti Elmaliach was stepping down as CEO of Bezeq International, clearing the way for Ran Guron to take his job. The CEO of Pelephone, Bezeq’s cellular unit, Guron has already taken on the role as CEO of Yes, the satellite television unit. Taking on the Bezeq International job will give the three units a single CEO as a preliminary step to a full merger. Meanwhile, TheMarker has learned that Ilan Segal, now Pelephone’s marketing chief, will be named head of marketing for all three subsidiaries and report to Guron. Bezeq is merging the three units amid delays in regulatory approval to merge the three into Bezeq itself to create a seamless management and operational structure. Bezeq shares ended up 1% at 4.47 shekels ($1.21). (Nati Tucker) Opko Health shares gyrate amid concerns over cash situation Opko Health shares went on a roller-coaster ride on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange over the last two days amid worries about its cash situation. The Miami-based health care holding company reported Friday that it burned through $22 million in cash during the third quarter, leaving it with just $44 million. That compares with $194 million in cash at the end of 2015. A day before the quarterly report was issued, Opko raised more than $150 million, mostly from controlling shareholder Phillip Frost, who bought $70 million of a $92.5 million share offering and agreed to provide the company with a $60 million credit line. The five-year credit line carries an interest rate of 10%. Without the cash infusion, many investors worried that Opko would not have had the money to continue operations for the next 12 months. Opko shares, which fell 10.6% Sunday, ended up 5.9% in Tel Aviv on Monday at 13.23 shekels ($3.59).

Michael,Gordon,1925,https://www.stereogum.com/2022433/mk-gee-new-year/premiere/,"Michael Gordon makes drowsy, atmospheric indie pop under the name Mk.Gee. After moving to LA in 2016, the New Jersey native began pairing his R&B and jazz roots with more dreamy electropop. He dropped his debut album Pronounced McGee back in May via Orchard Ears. One of its tracks, “You,” ended up on Frank Ocean’s Blonded Radio last week. Since that EP’s release, Gordon has already announced another one, the Fool EP, and shared lead single “Come On (You Know That I’m A Fool).” He’s self-releasing the EP this Friday, and today we’re getting its second offering “New Year.” The track drifts gentle and subdued, and Gordon’s falsetto remains suspended in a whisper. Each pluck and strum feels heavy and stark against the rest of the production’s cloudy tranquility. The lyrics explore a time warped-new year where everything seems to have stayed the same. “Not everybody wants to change/ See your mind is stuck in champagne,” Gordon murmurs. Listen to “New Year” below and check out his upcoming SoCal tour dates.
