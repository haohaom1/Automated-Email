It was the fifth win of the season for the Eels, who scored just six points after halftime and had captain Tim Mannah sent to sin-bin with 13 minutes to go in Saturday's ANZ Stadium encounter. Hayne, who finished 2016 at the Titans and spent 2017 there, didn't have much impact early on, gifting the Gold Coast a scrum feed 20 metres out from his own line after losing the ball. But he worked his way into the game and played a big role in the Eels' decisive surge late in the first half, as they piled on 16 points in 10 minutes to lead 22-6 at halftime.. He showed great strength and footwork to brush off three defenders to score the Eels second try. Hayne was instrumental in setting up a try for winger Bevan French, with the Eels other wide man George Jennings crossing after some slick passing from five- eighth Corey Norman and fullback Clint Gutherson. The Titans squandered several great second-half opportunities either side of winger Anthony Don sprinting 90 metres for his second try after intercepting a Mitchell Moses pass. Fullback Michael Gordon dropped the ball over the line and centre Konrad Hurrell lost the ball just short of the line. Potential tries to Sami and captain Ryan James were rubbed out for forward passes and halfback AJ Brimson had a clear passage to the line but dropped a pass from Mitch Rein. Gordon missed all three of his conversion attempts. Mannah was sin binned for multiple ruck indiscretions but the only score that came while he was off was the clinching try from five-eighth Corey Norman who pounced on his own kick. Mannah and lock Nathan Brown provided Parramatta plenty of go forward with their powerful running, while halves Norman and Moses impressed with their playmaking options. Prop Mannah scored the first points when he smashed through three defenders to notch his first try in 31 games.

The Warriors survive. 6:22pm: 54 mins - Warriors 18 Dragons 12 The Warriors come up with a brilliant set now, resulting in Johnson kicking through on the last. Widdop gets back, but is tackled in goal to force a dropout. Kata runs the ball - but he's been stripped! The Warriors are an absolute shambles so far in the second half. 6:18pm: 51 mins - Warriors 18 Dragons 12 TRY!!! The Warriors have a scrum and Fusitu'a runs off the back. The winger runs into a tackle from Hunt, but he spills the ball! The Dragons now have a scrum of their own. The Dragons throw the ball around in front of the Warriors' line, before Widdop kicks through on the last. Leilua chases and grounds the ball first! The Dragons score again - will the Warriors fall apart? Widdop with his second kick, and he's got it! 6:13pm: 47 mins - Warriors 18 Dragons 6 TRY!!! The Dragons make a fast start to the second half and look to break through. Hunt exchanges passes with Aitken just in front of the Warriors' line. McIness charges from dummy half, and he scores! The Dragons are on the board. Widdop has no issue with the kick, and the Warriors' defence has finally been breached. 6:06pm: 41 mins - Warriors 18 Dragons 0 The Warriors have first use of the ball in the second half as the Dragons kick off. 5:52pm: HALFTIME - Warriors 18 Dragons 0 TRY!!! The Warriors add a third! Kata has a double, going over wide on the left once again after a brilliant cutout pass from Green. The Warriors have scored three while Dufty's been off the field. The siren goes as Johnson lines up the kick. Johnson's shot from the left is just wide of the posts to bring the half to an end. 5:48pm: 39 mins - Warriors 14 Dragons 0 Lafai tries to go for the line as the Dragons attack, but has Tuivasa-Sheck saved the Warriors?! He has! Lafai's spilled the ball in the in-goal, brilliant from the skipper! 5:46pm: 38 mins - Warriors 14 Dragons 0 Green puts up a bomb on the Warriors' last and Nightingale tidies up at the back with Dufty still off the field. The Dragons look to go forward and get something before the break. Hunt kicks on the last, and Fusitu'a spills it! The Dragons will have a great chance to get a try back here with a scrum inside the Warriors' half. 5:43pm: 36 mins - Warriors 14 Dragons 0 TRY!!! The Warriors on the attack again. Mannering finds Luke with an offload, but the Dragons get there first and knock the ball on as Tuivasa-Sheck tries to pass. Warriors scrum just shy of the 10m line. Papali'i runs the first, before Tevaga has a go on the second. He offloads to Issac Luke and he scores under the posts! Brilliant from the Warriors who get their second of the afternoon. Johnson with his third kick of the match, and he has no trouble with this one either. 5:38pm: 32 mins - Warriors 8 Dragons 0 TRY!!! Johnson goes close - but Frizell makes the tackle. The Warriors are close, the offload is thrown by Papali'i and Kata scores in the corner! The Warriors get the first try of the match! Johnson lines up the kick from wide on the left, and he blasts it through the uprights! 5:35pm: 30 mins - Warriors 2 Dragons 0 Have the Warriors scored? A kick through on the last tackle sees Mannering and Tuivasa-Sheck chasing the ball into the in goal. Aitken misses the clearance, and Mannering appears to have grounded it? Its a foot race between Mannering and Dufty, but did the Dragons fullback impede Tuivasa-Sheck? The bunker says no try, but Dufty is sin binned for the foul on Tuivasa-Sheck! 5:31pm: 28 mins - Warriors 2 Dragons 0 Paul Vaughan is done for the afternoon doctors have confirmed. The Warriors restart play from their own 30m line. Tuivasa-Sheck runs on the fourth, before Green goes to the air on the last. Pereira does well to beat Fusitu'a in the air and the Dragons escape danger this time. 5:24pm: 20 mins - Warriors 2 Dragons 0 Penalty!

A healthy amount of Kiwi supporters in this afternoon. 4:52pm Both sides going through their final warm-ups. Kick off around 10 minutes away in Wollongong. PRE MATCH Having started the season on fire, the Warriors are coming into today's match in dire form with consecutive losses leaving them at risk of losing their sport in the top eight to the chasing Wests Tigers. A second half capitulation on the Gold Coast last week resulted in an embarrassing loss to the Titans. That result and the Tigers' win over the KNights yesterday mean Wests trail the Warriors by a solitary win. The Warriors face a Dragons side also struggling for confidence after being heavily beaten by the Roosters last week. These two sides have already met this season, with the Warriors winning 20-12 at Mt Smart Stadium back in round seven. The Warriors' task will be made even harder, with Tohu Harris ruled out of tonight's clash with injury. TEAMS Warriors: 1. Roger Tuivasa-Sheck (c), 2. David Fustitu'a, 3. Gerard Beale, 4. Solomone Kata, 5. Ken Maumalo, 6. Blake Green, 7. Shaun Johnson, 8. James Gavet, 9. Issac Luke, 10. Agnatius Paasi, 11. Isaiah Papali'i, 15. Simon Mannering, 13. Adam Blair. Interchange: 14. Jazz Tevaga, 16. Leivaha Pulu, 17. Bunty Afoa, 21. Sam Lisone. Dragons: 1. Matt Dufty, 2. Jordan Pereira, 3. Euan Aitken, 4. Tim Lafai, 5. Jason Nightingale, 6. Gareth Widdop, 7. Ben Hunt, 8. James Graham, 9. Cameron McIness, 10. Paul Vaughan, 11. Tyson Frizell, 12. Tariq Sims, 13. Jack de Belin. Interchange: 14. Jeremy Latimore, 15. Kurt Mann, 16. Leeson Ah Mau, 17. Luciano Leilua. Premiership favourites Melbourne will wait with bated breath on scans for Cameron Smith after the Storm skipper suffered an ankle injury in last night's loss to South Sydney. Smith limped from the field in the 73rd minute at ANZ Stadium and failed to return as he was immediately treated to on the sideline. Storm coach Craig Bellamy said medical staff were unclear on the exact nature of the injury. ""I don't think they're quite sure. Must be on the edge of something, the achilles or something else. I think he felt a sharp pain going into his heel,"" Bellamy said. ""Five years ago he probably would've played on, but you get a bit wiser as you get older so I thought that was the best thing to do, to come off. ""They'll check it tomorrow or sometime over the weekend, early next week."" It is also unclear how the reigning Dally M winner suffered the injury, having only exited the field after Damien Cook had scored and before the restart. ""He just told me, he felt it when Cook scored the try and then as he was coming back to halfway, he could really feel it,"" Bellamy said. The Storm appeared on their way to a ninth straight victory when they led by 10 points in the first half but were frozen out of the game by the Rabbitohs' second half assault. Bellamy was pleased with their start but suggested his team may have been gotten swept away by a stretch of strong form that swept them to the top of the table. They are now second after being leapfrogged by the Rabbitohs. ""Perhaps during the week some of our guys might've been reading too much or hearing a little bit too much after the last couple of weeks,"" Bellamy said. ""But certainly we're back to reality this week. We'll review it, have a look at what we need to do and what we didn't do so well and move onto next week."" The Storm face Cronulla next Sunday afternoon."

Updated: August 16, 2018 @ 11:07 pm McDowell Titans senior linebacker Andrew Davis crushes an East Henderson ballcarrier during a scrimmage game at Titan Stadium last wednesday. Davis led the team in tackles last season and will spearhead the defense again this year. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titans senior linebacker Andrew Davis crushes an East Henderson ballcarrier during a scrimmage game at Titan Stadium last wednesday. Davis led the team in tackles last season and will spearhead the defense again this year. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com With a new season about to begin, the McDowell Titans will feature one of their more experienced groups in recent history on the defensive side of the football. This year’s version will likely have as many as eight seniors in the starting lineup on opening night, seven of those with two or more seasons of varsity experience already under their belts. With that amount of experience built through the rigors of playing on defense and a few new pieces being added to the mix, there is an optimistic feel that the fruits of their labor may begin to blossom in 2018. So far in the first two weeks of the preseason, defensive coordinator Keith Styles has been pleased with the production put forth not only physically but mentally for a defensive unit who is wanting to change the course this season. “We have made some changes since last year in getting our defensive lineup ready and these kids have really worked hard in preparing for what we want to do this season,” said Styles. “Attitude is something that we stressed going all the way back to the spring and the seniors are doing a good job in showing leadership skills, which is important to being successful as a team. There are areas in which we don’t have a lot of depth, but of the 38 or so kids we have I think a good number of them will be able to contribute in some way and that will mean a lot to our success on defense.” One of the areas in which Coach Styles has seen the most improvement in the preseason has been with his secondary and the ability to defend and to tackle. “I think having the addition of a couple guys in the secondary has been a positive for us and it will make us better,” he said. “Tackling the runner, especially from our secondary, is one area last season where we didn’t get the results that we wanted and I think it will be a big key in how improved a defense we can be this season.” Statistically, the team will return three of the top five tacklers from a year ago, including All-Northwestern 3A/4A Conference middle linebacker Andrew Davis, who recorded 100 tackles as a junior. While the numbers in some of the other defensive stat categories didn’t really stand out, there is reason to believe that lineup changes will help produce overall better results as a whole. Improving greatly on last year’s averages of 35 points and 439 total yards surrendered per game will be crucial to McDowell’s success. Defensive backs look strong, athletic The McDowell Titans secondary will have a different look this season as the team looks to provide a bit more of an athletic feel in that final tier of the defense. While not fielding a deep unit of players, defensive backs coach Turner Kincaid does see a group with some flexibility. Multiple starters will return, but a handful of new faces for the 2018 campaign will slide in and help provide the Titans with a more athletic lineup to help improve the defense as a whole. “Our biggest challenge for us is that a big number of the defensive backs will also have to continue on offense but with the experience we have I think they will be able to adjust to that role,” said Kincaid. “I do think we have an athletic group of kids at corner and safety and they are flexible which is important depending on the kind of offenses we will see throughout the season.” The middle of the defensive backfield will feature at least one new face. Senior Brycen Seymore (6-1, 202) joined the team over the summer and has impressed the coaches going back through summer workouts with his quick ability to learn the game. Seymore will start the season at strong safety and is noted by the staff as one of the strongest guys on the roster. “Brycen is probably the strongest guy we have in the program right now, literally,” said Kincaid. “And so far he has shown that he likes to play physical and is quick. He has shown the ability to either go up in the box or play in space which is something that we need from him in that spot.” Sophomore Dequan Boyce (5-11, 175) will slide into the free safety spot. Boyce, who played prominently on the junior varsity team as a freshman, did get some reps on the varsity team late in the 2017 season, recording seven tackles in three games played. Obviously, Boyce is expected to play a bigger role as a sophomore. Senior Adam Randolph (11 games, 37 tackles, 1 INT) returns and is the most experienced player of the group. As a four-year varsity player, Randolph has often been on the defensive side of the football but with the emergence of Seymore and with Boyce now on the varsity squad, hopefully Randolph can focus more on the offensive side of the football. “Adam plays a big part to our team’s success on the other side of the ball but his experience at safety will be a significant for us,” said Kincaid. “Adam can play either free or strong. There are times in which we will have to rely on him, but hopefully, with the emergence of our other players, we can hopefully reduce his workload some.” Flexibility also comes into play at the cornerback position as well for Coach Kincaid. Stephen Webb, after getting significant playing time as a junior, was penciled in as one of the corners, but a fractured clavicle back during the early portion of the summer workout schedule will keep him on the sidelines for the first couple weeks of the regular season. One of the big surprises of the preseason is with transfer student Andrew Green, who arrived from out of state – and before that, from Erwin High – and has emerged as a candidate for significant playing time at the corner, especially early on. Green, who moved in from the state of Georgia, has been a pleasant surprise in the early going. “We have been pleased with some things that we have seen from Andrew in the early going,” said Kincaid. “He’s quick and can move really well. He’s having to learn a lot quickly about the coverages, but we like what we see in him and he will have an opportunity for playing time early on. We’ll see what he does for us.” Senior J.C. Olivo will be looked upon to take a corner spot as well, even with his primary role as a tailback offensively. That still hasn’t deterred Olivo from being a leader on the defensive side of the ball. “One of the things we love about J.C. is that he gets out there and shows the leadership qualities that he possesses on both sides of the ball,” Kincaid said. “That’s really an invaluable thing to have. We know that J.C. commits a lot to playing the tailback position but he’s 100 percent when on the defensive side as well.” Providing depth at corners will be three-year varsity players Andruw Randolph and Dakota Effler along with junior Kurtis Padgett. Davis spearheads defense from linebacker spot By far the most experience for the McDowell Titans defensively going into Friday’s season opener is at the linebacker position. Only one starter from the 2017 season opener, DeAndre Collins, is no longer with the squad and that in itself is merely a technicality, as other linebackers gradually saw an increased work load throughout last season, which helped lead to eventual lineup changes for this year, giving the Titans a solid returning core of linebackers. The one spot most importantly that didn’t change in McDowell’s 3-4 defensive scheme was at the middle linebacker position, as the team’s leading tackler Andrew Davis (69 solo tackles, 31 assists, three caused fumbles, two fumble recoveries, two sacks) returns for his senior campaign. Davis, an All-Northwestern 3A-4A Conference performer in 2017, has continued to improve each season and now in his third varsity season looks poised to be a big part of McDowell’s success defensively. “One of the things we have worked with inside linebackers on is with the different reads,” said head coach Andy Morgan, who also coaches linebackers. “Andrew (6-0, 235) has looked good so far in the preseason, has lost about 10 pounds or so in weight and is moving around a lot better. He’s a returning 100-tackle guy and has the capability of doing that again this year and better.” Sophomore Harley Allison (6-1, 185), along with senior Tice Edwards (6-1, 215) and junior Braedon Allison (6-2, 185) will also be viable options to provide depth for Davis in the middle along with the ability to play on the outside as well. Morgan and Styles have noted Harley Allison’s improvement in both size and strength since last year when he was a standout on the junior varsity team. Allison could be looked upon to have an increased role as the season progresses. Titans hoping for big plays out of OLBs The outside linebacker position also returns some experienced players from a year ago. Cedric Biddle (5-9, 185) and Johan Ayala (5-11, 190) will man the outside this year. The two seniors combined for 76 tackles a year ago. Biddle recorded five fumble recoveries and 3 ½ sacks in 2017, which was second best on last year’s squad. He also returned two blocked punts and a fumble for touchdowns. For Ayala, it will be somewhat a change of scenery as he spent most of his time a year ago as middle linebacker, so he is learning quickly the nuisances of moving outside. “Cedric spent a lot of last year playing the bandit position being in open space and he seemed to produce the most big plays from that spot with the sacks and fumble recoveries,” said outside linebackers coach Bill Taylor. “We hope to see more of that from him this year. The biggest thing we have noticed so far in preseason is that he is a more disciplined player which is important in that area. Johan is moving to the outside to play the Sam position. That will be a bit of an adjustment, but his strength will be an asset to him moving out there to that spot.” Additional outside linebackers in the group include seniors Evan Cable and Mack Branch. Cable, who is capable of playing on either side and is a solid player in open space, could see increased time on the field, especially against more offenses who like to spread the field. Juniors Luke Bright and Richard Handy will also provide depth on the roster, Bright will likely play a bigger role offensively and Handy is the team’s second quarterback on the depth chart. Defensive front unproven The most numbers on the defensive side of the football will lie up front with the defensive linemen and defensive ends, however this area also has the most inexperience of any position on the defense in 2018. Defensive line coach Keith Styles also will be faced with the challenge of relying on several players who will also play prominent roles on the offensive line. Regardless of the situation, there are pieces to work with in the trenches. “We have got more depth at defensive line than any other position on this side of the ball, however there’s not a lot of experience,” said Styles. “Several of these guys are also going to play a role offensively, so it’s going to be a balancing act with some of these guys going both ways. That said, I think they’re all working hard and over the course of the year will work into a role on either side of the ball.” Defensive lineman Ricky Amador (43 tackles, fumble recovery, one sack) along with defensive end Trey Beverly (55 tackles, four sacks), McDowell’s third leading tackler and sacks leader in 2017, are both gone and leave a significant void in the defensive front. The one returning player who looks to fill the void and anchor the defensive line this season will be junior defensive tackle Nick Ivy (6-1, 265). As a sophomore, Ivy slid in and played significant minutes up front, showing flashes of the kind of talent he possesses. As a junior, he will be looked upon this season to be a more consistent person up front. Junior Levi Lister (6-0, 230), along with senior Bryce Allison (6-1, 195) will line up on opposite ends. “Nick played a lot of for us last year and did some good things, and we look for him to continue getting better anchoring down the line,” said Styles. “Levi is a kid that is a smart football player. He works hard and does a lot of good things for us. He will likely be snapping the ball on offense so we’ll have to watch him carefully. Bryce is another kid who is an intelligent football player and has gotten better with each year. He is a kid that as a senior is going to provide some leadership for us up front. He can play a 4-technique up front or can move and play outside linebacker.” Walker Hughes (5-11, 225) returns to the program after not playing as a junior and can also provide the defensive line with another option.

New parking enforcement efforts will include license plate checks, monitored lots during the first week of classes, and a reduction in parking opportunities for people without permits. | Michael Slaten/The Cougar Zone Parking, in addition to stricter enforcement of license plates and evening and weekend parking, is set to begin the first day of the semester. With the purchase of a student parking permit, which became available through the parking portal this spring, students are required to pick from one of six zones (labeled A-F). Remote campus, garage and motorcycle permits will not be zoned. “Anyone parking without a permit for that specific zone is subject to not only a ticket but a tow as well,” said Bob Browand, director of UH Parking and Transportation Services. In the past, drivers parked incorrectly in a student lot received a ticket for the first offense. According to Parking and Transportation Services, Zone Parking is intended to redistribute traffic from heavily used parking lots throughout campus, so students are more likely to be able to find a spot consistently in the same lot. This summer, UH parking began using license plate enforcement, which involves scanning license plates throughout the parking lots to ensure they’re parked in the correct area and with the appropriate permit. “We are transitioning to license plate recognition to increase the efficiency of enforcement and further reduce the likelihood that someone without a permit can park and not get caught,” Brownard said. “Keep in mind that although we”ll be using license plates for enforcement, properly displayed permits are still required at all times”. An email sent out by Kathrine G. McGovern College of the Arts Dean Andrew Davis announced that all evening and weekend visitor parking on campus, including evening and weekend parking for arts and cultural events, will convert to paid parking. Visitors to campus will pay $5 in cash or with a credit card to a parking attendant stationed at lots throughout campus. “Clearly this is not ideal for our patrons, but the change is necessary in our dynamic and rapidly changing campus environment,” Davis said in the email Political science senior Raihan Siddiqui believes that the leeway that students were offered after 5 p.m. and on the weekends made PTS’s prices and systems more tolerable. He said it is ridiculous that parking enforcement has been cracking down on ticketing in the summer when there are plenty of parking spots available. “The fact that they went out of their way to purchase license plate scanners might be a positive during busy hours when people with permits need highly sought after spots,” Siddiqui said. “But, using them when space isn’t an issue seems almost petty. I really hope they choose to ease up and shows students some courtesy and mercy.” Between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, only people with the appropriate permit will be allowed to park in their chosen zone. “We are increasing the shuttle service to accommodate the zone parking program, and this will mean two new routes that will circulate campus. Next year students will find that they can show up to their zone, park and get to class more quickly and efficiently,” Browand said. After 4 p.m. during weekdays and throughout the weekends, anyone with a parking permit can park in any zone or student lot, along with any faculty and staff non-gated lot on campus. “Permits are required at all times to park on campus, even the first day of class,” Browand said. PTS will have representatives at the entrances of all parking lots during the first week of classes to ensure no one parks in the wrong zone and also guarantee that everyone can locate their correct parking location. Permit costs will continue to rise as PTS takes on more debt to build to a total of eight garages on campus, according to a PTS budget from spring.
