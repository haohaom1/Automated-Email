Related Venues The Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum in Miami is hosting “Deconstruction: A reordering of life, politics, and art,” a group exhibition showcasing the work of 12 Miami-based artists. The exhibition is on view through September 30, 2018. “Deconstruction” features work by artists Eddie Arroyo, Zachary Balber, Frida Baranek, Christopher Carter, Yanira Collado, Gonzalo Fuenmayor, Pepe Mar, Glexis Novoa, Sandra Ramos, Leyden Rodriguez-Casanova, Jamilah Sabur, and Frances Trombly. These artists, in their works, interrogate varying notions of deconstruction. “In the 1960s, the philosopher Guy Debord encouraged a ‘reordering of life, politics, and art’ and cautioned against social interaction mediated by images. He presciently asserted that humans did not interact with one another enough in person. Debord perceptively anticipated society’s reliance on small hand-held technology, social media, and the twenty-four-hour news cycle that now permeates daily life. Often read by students of art history, Debord’s declarations were written during a time of political upheaval in France. The contemporary artists represented in this exhibition live in Miami, and while certain works are infused with local realities, global and even utopic questions populate the exhibition. These artists reorder objects and imagery in disparate ways to disrupt and question conventional narratives and ways of seeing,” the museum writes. The artists featured in the show take part in ideas and processes; they create mechanisms through which life, politics, and art can be reexamined. While some of the artists in the exhibition deconstruct current events, personal memory or cultural archetypes, others dismantle norms to suggest alternative societal and personal structures. The exhibition is on view through September 30, 2018, at The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St, Miami, FL 33199, USA.

Spacecom didn’t say who would now get the Amos 8 contract but said it was examining options that include a partnership with the Israeli government. Spacecom had signed a $112 million deal in March with SSL, but the deadline to pay a deposit passed Monday, nullifying the agreement. Spacecom has been under pressure from politicians and labor unions to award the contract to state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, which had bid to build Amos 8 but at a much higher cost of $200 million and a longer delivery time than SSL promised. Three weeks ago, the cabinet agreed to subsidize Amos 8 to the tune of $90 million, but a source involved in the project said a deal with IAI was still not final. Spacecom shares ended 2.7% higher at 13.76 shekels ($3.84). (TheMarker) Taavura Holdings, Israel’s largest trucking company, explores initial public offering The board of Taavura Holdings, Israel’s largest trucking and logistics company, is exploring an initial public offering. The board acted at the behest of Clal Industries, which controls Taavura on a 50-50 basis with the company’s founding Livnat family and has been seeking to sell all or part of the stake. Sources said Clal, which is controlled by Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries, may have pushed the IPO option as a way to coax the Livats family into buying it out. In recent months, Clal has sought to sell between 20% and 40% of Taavura at a 2 billion shekel ($560 million) valuation at various times to the Livnats, a group of Israeli insurance companies or Leumi Partners and a group of institutional investors but failed to reach a deal. Before that Clal had pressed Taavura to increase its dividends payout, which the LIvnats opposed out of concern it would leave the company overly leveraged.

The email address you have provided is already registered. A struggle for control of ADO Group, a Tel Aviv Stock Exchange company whose sole asset is the German real estate company ADO Properties, ended with an agreement Tuesday on appointing directors and selling stock. Housing & Construction Limited and Moshe Dayan agreed not to oppose each other’s slate of candidates for six board seats due to be voted on at the next general shareholders meeting. The two, which hold 37.5% and 19.7% of ADO Group, respectively, also agreed with a third shareholders — the Apollo Fund, with a 14.7% stake — to give each other right of first refusal in the event any of them sells ADO Group stock. The agreement replaces one reached in September 2017 after a bitter power struggle that was disallowed by securities regulators in Luxembourg, where ADO Properties is domiciled, unless the three had agreed to make a general offer for all ADO Properties shares. ADO Group shares fell 3% to 78 shekels ($21.75).

The benchmark TA-35 index finished down 0.25% at 1,666.16 points, while the TAS-125 edged 0.08% lower, to 1,503.85 as 994 million shekels ($277 million) in shares changed hands. Teva Pharmaceuticals dropped 2.8% to 86 shekels after the European Medicines Agency on Friday recommended the approval of U.S. pharmaceutical group Eli Lilly’s migraine treatment, bringing the drug one step closer to competing with Teva’s own newly approved drug. Opko Health tumbled 5.5% to 15.10, reversing three sessions of sharp gains. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said September 7 it would be filing charges against Opko founder and CEO Phillip Frost and the company. Ormat Technologies slumped 2.1% to 198.60. Pluristem gained 4.5% to 4.93 after the drug developer announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted orphan drug status to the company’s PLX cell therapy for the treatment of graft failure.

Phillip,Frost,b'1679',https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180925006159/en/Robbins-Arroyo-LLP-Controlling-Shareholders-Cocrystal-Pharma,"SAN DIEGO & TUCKER, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Shareholder rights law firm Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that purchasers of Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) (NASDAQ: COCP) filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1934 between September 23, 2013 and September 7, 2018. Cocrystal is a clinical stage biotechnology company that develops novel antiviral therapeutics that target the replication machinery of hepatitis viruses, influenza viruses, and noroviruses. View this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: https://www.robbinsarroyo.com/cocrystal-pharma/ Cocrytsal Pharma charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in fraudulent stock scheme According to the complaint, BioZone was created in June 2011 through a reverse merger by a group of investors whose fraudulent stock manipulation scheme ultimately caused significant harm to unsuspecting investors. The controlling shareholders of BioZone engaged a stock promoter to tout Opko Health's CEO Phillip Frost's involvement in BioZone in exchange for below-market price BioZone shares. Then, on January 3, 2014, BioZone announced it had finalized its merger with Cocrystal Discovery Inc., forming Cocrystal Pharma on April 15, 2014. Thereafter, Cocrystal Pharma repeatedly assured investors regarding the accuracy of its financial reporting, the disclosure of any material changes to the company's internal control over financial reporting and the disclosure of all fraud. It therefore came as a surprise, when, on September 7, 2018, the SEC charged 10 individuals, including Cocrystal Pharma Director Phillip Frost and the controlling shareholders of BioZone, for participating in long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors. On this news, shares of Cocrystal fell more than 15% over two days to close at $3.16 on September 11, 2018, and now trades at around $2.40.

Steve,Cummings,b'1678',https://www.americanbanker.com/news/the-women-to-watch-2018-no-6-mufgs-ranjana-clark,"Chief Transformation Officer, MUFG Ranjana Clark already had two large jobs — head of transaction banking for the Americas and Bay Area president for Tokyo-based MUFG. But she may be taking on her biggest challenge yet, having been named in March to the newly created role of chief transformation officer. She is tasked with making the bank ""an agile organization powered by a resilient, flexible technology and data stack,"" Steve Cummings, chief executive officer for the Americas at MUFG, told her at the time. In her first two roles, 2017 was a banner year. Revenue for her transaction banking business grew by 19% to $1.2 billion and net income after taxes rose 30% to $461 million. As Bay Area President, Clark built and deepened relationships with local leaders and organizations. The new transformation job, however, is a work in progress. Clark is driving adoption of technology including robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and blockchain, as she talks about in this video. See the most recent rankings:• Most Powerful Women in Banking• Women to Watch• Most Powerful Women in Finance ""I came from the business side, but have some background in technology,"" Clark said. ""I want to make sure we drive that strong nexus and tight link between the business and the technology to ensure that everything we're doing in terms of modernizing our technology — putting in a new data platform, putting in a new core banking system — all of that is improving the client experience and simplifying our business."" Clark is a pragmatic technology enthusiast. Asked at an MUFG women's forum this year how colleagues could keep up with fintech's impact on banking, Clark emphasized the need to stay on top of trends. ""Technology is part of every business,"" she said. ""Keep learning and stay relevant. It's not going to come from reading one book or taking one class. You have to learn on a dynamic basis, read blogs, and listen to podcasts. If a colleague says something or you hear about something that you don't know, go and look it up. It may not be completely relevant to your job today, but if you broaden your lens, you'll be surprised how horizontally you can think."" Clark herself strives to constantly be learning. ""I receive great energy from listening to a podcast after it's wheels-up on an airplane and then engaging in a conversation on that subject with a colleague or client when it's wheels-down,"" she said.

Michael,Gordon,b'1677',https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7340654/charles-bronson-mocks-ex-paula-williamson-flabby-taunts/,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. The notorious lag, 66, is divorcing wife Paula Williamson, 38, who he married in Wakefield Prison last year after falling in love having exchanged letters NOTORIOUS lag Charles Bronson has mocked claims he is a cry baby and his hard man image a sham with a photo showing him flexing his muscles behind bars. And he boasted that far from being old and frail he is fitter than any SAS recruit, pumping out 94 press-ups in half a minute. Responding to jibes by his ex-wife Paula Williamson, the 66-year-old told a pal: “Despite being an OAP I can do 94 press-ups in 30 seconds. “The SAS have to do 60 press-ups in 60 seconds so I smash that in half the time. “I have self-belief, stamina, posture.” Bronson is currently in HMP Frankland, in County Durham, the same prison as Soham killer Ian Huntley, Levi Bellfield and Peter Sutcliffe - with no parole date imminent. He is divorcing wife Paula, 38, who he married in Wakefield Prison last year after falling in love having exchanged love letters. Bronson - who changed his name to Charles Salvador in honour of artist Salvador Dali – was furious after The Sun exposed her juggling her breasts in the face of another man earlier this year. It led Paula to hit out at Bronson, calling him a “liar and a phoney” whose hard man image is far from reality. She said: “He’s not this hard geezer – if anything he’s a frail little old man. “At his parole hearing he started crying when he found out he’d been turned down. He also blubbed at our wedding – he’s soft. “Charles isn’t buff any more. He’s lost loads of muscle mass and has saggy skin – I’m glad I never had to have sex with him. “I used to visit and spend £20 on lunch in the canteen for him. “He’d scoff eight pasties in a row then go back to his cell for dinner.” Paula also said she has been left out of pocket campaigning for his release while he continues to be sent cash by fans, who he mocks. She said: “Even people on disability benefits were sending him cash, which he’d just take and bin the letter without reading. “He once told me he’d given a woman £5,000 because she’d written to him asking for a boob job.” But armed robber Bronson, born Michael Gordon Peterson, and first caged in 1974, said of his ex Paula: “This is a woman scorned. “She is a green eyed monster. She married me for fame. I would sooner set fire to my handlebar moustache than kiss her. “She is a liar and a diva. I’m a fitness fanatic.” The lifer, who has spent more than 40 years in jail, wrote on the subject to new pen-pal Jasmine Lennard. The model, an ex of Simon Cowell, told The Sun: “How dare Paula try and tarnish him like this. “So what if he cried when told he wouldn’t get parole. I defy any man not shed a tear after 44 years. “She implied he pocketed money from disabled people and fans. It’s not true. “One thing he is not is a cry-baby. He has people shouting at him from the prison floor above him now, also accusing him of being old and frail. “He’s probably the strongest man in there. There are boxing promoters praying he gets released so they can try and sign him up. “If he was a frail old man they wouldn’t send eight men at a time to escort him to the yard. He works out and does charity work tirelessly.” Earlier this month we reported how the jailbird launched a range of fitness supplements. We pay for your stories!

John,O'Neil,b'1676',https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/fife/730535/malcolm-the-peacocks-near-miss-prompts-warning-to-fife-dog-owners/,"©2018 The Courier Careless dog owners are thought to be responsible for nearly cutting Dunfermline’s peacock population by at least one in recent weeks. Much-loved Malcolm, one of Pittencrieff Park’s resident peacocks, was found to have suffered a leg injury after what locals believe was an altercation with a dog. It has prompted renewed calls for owners to keep their pets on a tight leash. Thanks to the efforts of a small band of volunteers, the famous Glen is home to the familiar screech of peacocks once again after a fairly barren time following the death of the park’s most famous peacock Clive, in 2017. However, after a series of near misses reported in the last few weeks, it appears one canine did not take too kindly to Malcolm and attacked the popular bird. John O’Neil, team parks manager for the city of Dunfermline area, urged people to have more consideration for the feathered residents, although he admitted staff were not 100% certain Malcolm’s injury was caused by a dog. “When we noticed Malcolm was limping, we called in the vet and he stated the bird had a strained ligament,” he commented. “We do know the bird has been chased by dogs recently, but can’t be sure that was the cause. “The park rules state all dogs are to be under proper control or on a short lead. “There is additional signage posted by the volunteer group asking for dog owners to keep dogs on leads near the aviary building.” Peacocks have the Freedom of the City and were introduced by philanthropist Henry Beveridge in 1905 when he brought several back from India. Those involved with the peacocks in Pittencrieff Park have been fundraising to install CCTV in and around the aviary area to keep the birds safe and secure, with items such as coasters, magnets and key rings on sale to help pay for their upkeep. Peacock numbers were boosted earlier this year when the owners of Tullibole Castle, Rhoderick and Alison Moncrieff, donated a number of peafowl to the newly-refurbished peacock enclosure at Pittencrieff Park to join existing peacocks Malcolm and Louise. The Moncrieffs have been pivotal in providing expertise on the care of the existing peacocks and swelling the ranks.

John,O'Neil,b'1676',https://www.energymatters.com.au/renewable-news/dubbo-solar-home-tesla-battery/,"A building company in Dubbo says the Tesla Powerwall 2 battery in its new display home means the Dubbo solar home could potentially go off-grid. Award-winning Greenmark Homes installed a Tesla Powerwall 2 battery to boost the display home’s energy efficiency. Greenmark builder John O’Neil won the Master Builders Association (MBA) regional award for energy efficiency and environmental management. The MBA member will now use solar batteries to build more energy efficient homes in Dubbo. According to MBA President Stuart Crowfoot, Greenmark Homes beat off other contenders featuring more expensive homes. Solar home batteries like Tesla Powerwall 2 are helping households slash power bills. O’Neil’s Dubbo solar home won out over a $3 million project, which shows how good Dubbo builders are, Crowfoot added. Dubbo builder Matt Lack also won an award for best additions and renovations up to $200,000. Lack praised his small team’s focus on a niche market. Delivery of high-quality work marks the team out as special, he says. Tesla Powerpack, its scaled-up, commercial version of the Powerwall 2, has also earned national awards. In May this year the big battery at South Australia’s Hornsdale Wind Farm took out two categories at the 60th Annual Good Design Awards. It won the Good Design Award for Sustainability, one of the premier categories. It also emerged as Gold Winner in Engineering Design for outstanding design and innovation. The Hornsdale battery is the largest lithium-ion battery in the world. It was built by Tesla founder Elon Musk following South Australia’s catastrophic outages in 2016. Tesla still dominates the home battery storage market in Australia and around the world. Car giant Mercedes-Benz announced earlier this year it would no longer make residential batteries, saying it proved harder than anticipated to move from car batteries into home storage. However, German manufacturer sonnen is also gaining popularity as part of residential solar installations. Owners of a sonnen battery can also link up with other users via the sonnenFlat scheme. This allows owners to generate, share and trade energy with the sonnenFlat network. This scheme delivers an annual electricity amount from just $30 flat fee per month with no power bills. Users can also sell excess electricity back to the grid.

Bob,Diamond,b'1675',http://theweek.com/articles/796893/business-medias-nauseating-nostalgia-financial-crisis,"The business media's nauseating nostalgia for the financial crisis The 10th anniversary of the financial crisis has arrived with the predictable, month-long blizzard of retrospectives and commemorations in the business media. These segments have dutifully checked off all the main issues financial journalists imagine the public expects them to cover: the run-up to the crisis, the transition from the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the passage of TARP, low interest rates and their enduring impact on the global economy, the crisis' political legacy, whether we're any safer today, and so on. There's been a plodding aspect to much of this coverage, but fortunately the doyens of financial news have not left viewers to starve on a grim diet of discussions about the rehypothecation of collateral. With the boring stuff out of the way, the financial media has knuckled down to the real business of this 10-year anniversary extravaganza: the reunion tour. This nauseating display was most conspicuous around the anniversary of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy earlier this month. That weekend, CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox Business, and the big press outlets ran extensive interviews with all the major players of the crisis. Each one boiled down to the same question: Where were you when Lehman went down? Hence we learned that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was having dinner with his soon-to-be-son-in-law's parents when the news of Lehman's imminent collapse came through. Warren Buffett was at a charity concert in Canada, setting the scene for a hilarious mix-up with a fax machine that ended with him not buying Lehman Brothers. Bob Diamond was struggling to master voicemail. Reporters over at The New York Times recalled the dinners of Lehman weekend: steak at Bobby Van's on 50th Street for Eric Dash, pizza for Andrew Ross Sorkin. On and on it went. Even the Bank of England got in on the act, pushing out a quick vid featuring the Lehman weekend stories of a bunch of nameless staffers (""I was cycling with my family in Richmond Park,"" ""I was actually on a canal boat in Essex"") that did impressively bad traffic on YouTube. With the help of the media, players big and small have all had their chance to help recast the gravest economic slump of our time into a gentle comedy of manners involving canceled dinner plans and a handful of mild technological misunderstandings. The financial crisis slashed the value of America's publicly traded companies, put a crater through household wealth, worsened an already-appalling racial wealth gap, sent wages for the bottom 70 percent of American workers plummeting, and fed, even through the years of superficial recovery that followed, the resentment and economic insecurity that allowed a figure like President Trump to prosper. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture: It was also great fun. It was exciting. Indeed for many of the main actors — the guys and (rarely) girls at the center of the action, pushing the buttons of stimulus and making fiat money rain — it was the best weekend of their lives. A weekend from which, of course, these actors emerged as heroes. Thankfully, the financial media's commitment to Lehman weekend trivia has allowed us not to lose sight of this happy tableau. Risk and leverage and derivatives and all that stuff: Who cares about that? The real question the world needs the answer to is: What was Jamie Dimon wearing the exact moment when Barclays killed its deal to buy Lehman? The 10th anniversary festivities reached a peak of nostalgification when Sorkin took to the stage at the Brookings Institution to interview Ben Bernanke, Tim Geithner, and Hank Paulson about their experience of crisis month. The band, literally, was back together, and with Sorkin's giddy prompting, the memories flowed like lender-of-last-resort liquidity. During his time in public office Geithner had a reputation for being slightly crotchety, slightly impatient — a precious egghead with too-high hair — but on stage at the Brookings Institution, free to jam with Hank and Benny, his hair long having descended from the Krameresque heights it reached during the crisis, he was positively loose, man. He was funky. Paulson rambled and contradicted himself in that inimitable way that only he and Grampa Simpson can, and as for Bernanke? Well, he was the same as always: wise old Ben, the prof with the trim beard and encyclopedic knowledge of the history of counter-cyclical stimulus who could now afford to look back on the whole crisis thingy with a fond, Gandalf-like chuckle. If the band members were relaxed, it's because Sorkin did them the favor of keeping the focus of his questions squarely on the small moments. The crowd loved it. Paulson said he had trouble sleeping some nights in September 2008. A ripple of laughter went around the room. Bernanke described a meeting with then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. More laughs. Geithner said the hardest thing about the crisis was sitting across from his wife in the morning. Sniggers. ""Just seeing the look on her face,"" he said. Laughs. ""Just that mixture of despair and doubt, like, she looked at what we did and said, 'Really?'"" The biggest laughs of all. What crazy adventures we all had when we were young and the world economy was about to collapse! Later in the gig Geithner bemoaned the depth of public anger that accompanied the $700 billion bailout of the financial system — a reaction he attributed to bad PR, a failure to better communicate the reasons behind the bailout. If only the optics had been better, he mused, yucking it up on stage with his famous pals for a room full of rich people. Nostalgia, Christopher Lasch once said, is the abdication of memory. If the media has indulged the financial crisis nostalgia-fest so gleefully over the past few weeks, the desire to forget its own role in abetting the crisis may be part of the reason why. By taking a complex, cumulative, and profound moment of global crisis and turning it into the occasion for a series of jokey reminiscences, the financial media not only disrespects the millions of people who suffered — and continue to suffer — real distress as a result of Wall Street's malpractice, it diverts attention from a more searching examination of the media's own conduct in the run-up to the crisis and how little things have changed in the years since. It's no accident that Sorkin, who's built a career on parroting back to Wall Street's leading lights the things they've just told him, has been the most faithful chronicler of financial crisis trivia. To call him an access journalist would be an offense to the word ""journalism;"" he's less a reporter than a stenographer. In this, he is more representative than exceptional. Journalists don't escape diagnosis of the causes of the crisis without blame. They missed all the warning signs of a growing calamity, sacrificed accountability for access, and were complicit in puffing up the financial industry's pre-crisis narrative of innovation and progress — a narrative designed to secure only the lightest fetters of regulation. If the past month shows us anything, it's that the the financial media's relationship with the industry it ostensibly covers hasn't changed one bit. In The New York Times' recent piece about its own reporters' experience of Lehman weekend, business editor Lawrence Ingrassia recalled a July 2008 meeting with Paulson in which the then-treasury secretary was ""quite unconvincing."" But the story about Paulson the Times published following that meeting said nothing of the sort: On the contrary, it was a fairly positive, soft-focus profile. This is an omission that feels, in retrospect, emblematic. Everything about the media's desire to trivialize the crisis these past few weeks and hero-worship the bank CEOs and officials who steered the response speaks to this enduring reality: Most financial journalists still view Wall Street with a mix of childish awe and deference. For anyone looking to the financial media to provide the scrutiny and accountability needed to head off the next financial crisis, this may be a sign that it's time to give up. This presupposes, of course, that anyone — journalist or otherwise — has the power to see the next crisis building, which may be a forlorn hope. On stage at the Brookings event, Sorkin asked Paulson whether better data might have improved the quality of officials' decision-making in response to the crisis. ""I don't think it was about data,"" Paulson replied. ""My strong belief is that these crises are unpredictable in terms of cause or timing or the severity when they hit."" This has been a popular take in recent weeks: The next crisis, we've been told, will be unlike the last one, and just as difficult to plan for. In other words, there's bad news and good news. The bad news: The Wall Street elite doesn't have a clue how to prevent the next crisis and doesn't think it bears any responsibility to guide the financial system away from the excesses that might feed it. The good news: Ten years after the next crash we'll be able to come together and have a reunion tour with a whole new set of actors and mediocre anecdotes. Oh next financial crisis, the memories you'll give us!

Andrew,Davis,b'1674',http://floridapolitics.com/archives/275540-hillsborough-county-commissioners-up-big-in-re-election-fundraising,"Incumbent Hillsborough County Commissioner Stacy White has continued piling on cash in his District 4 re-election bid, while fellow Commissioners Victor Crist and Ken Hagan are each far ahead as they look to swap seats on the seven-member panel. White, first elected in 2014, added a couple thousand dollars to his war chest during the first couple weeks of the month, bringing his overall fundraising total to $187,261, with just shy of $100,000 of that money still left to spend seven weeks out from the Nov. 6 general election. White, whose District 4 seat includes much of south and western Hillsborough County, faces Democratic challenger Andrew Davis in the general election. To date, Davis has raised $7,879 for his campaign, though he only has about $850 left in the tank. Crist, the current District 2 commissioner, is running for the countywide District 5 seat held by Hagan. His new report showed a healthy $16,550 in receipts alongside less than $1,000 in spending, bringing his campaign’s overall total to $147,630 with just shy of $56,000 on hand last Friday. Crist’s overall fundraising beats the combined records of his two challengers, Democratic nominee Mariella Smith and unaffiliated candidate Joe Kotvas. Smith has raised just over $99,000 so far and has $44,000 in the bank, while Kotvas has raised $10,125 and has and has $575 left to spend. Hagan, who is looking to move from his countywide seat into Crist’s northern Hillsborough one, only showed $1,500 in new money collected during the two-week reporting period, though his overall fundraising efforts dwarf those of his lone challenger, Democratic nominee Angela Birdsong. Through Sept. 14, Hagan had raised more than $487,000 in hard money and had more than $350,000 of that cash ready to deploy. Birdsong, meanwhile, has raised $27,817 and has $6,260 on hand. The fourth seat on the 2018 ballot, the countywide District 7, won’t feature any incumbents. Todd Marks, who overcame a major fundraising gap to defeat Aakash Patel in the Republican primary election, currently leads in overall fundraising in the three-way race between him, Democratic nominee Kimberly Overman, and Green Party candidate Kim O’Connor. Marks, an attorney, received $16,575 in contributions in his new report, which accounts for most of his on-hand cash after the bruising primary battle. He’s now raised nearly $176,000 overall and has a little less than $18,000 in his campaign account. Overman, meanwhile, has raised $77,321 thus far and had $13,300 banked, while O’Connor is currently the cash leader with $26,000 raised and all but $50 of that money still in her campaign account. The District 2, 4, 5 and 7 seats will all be on the Nov. 6 general election ballot, alongside other county government seats including sheriff and four school board districts.

Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, faces four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. The slim, balding Raymond sat quietly in the courtroom during his brief appearance. Defence lawyer Nathan Gorham told the court he had just received a large volume of material and needed time to review it. “We received some information from the prosecution. We are in the process of investigating the case further, reviewing the disclosure, and then making some meaningful decisions on how the case will proceed,” Gorham said outside the court. “I still expect there will be a not guilty plea at some point in the future.” Judge Julian Dixon set the matter to return to court on Oct. 22. The opportunity to enter pleas will come once the matter is sent to the Court of Queen’s Bench. Members of the victims’ families were among the people who filled the courtroom Monday. They left without speaking to reporters. The police officers and civilians were gunned down outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed.

Sara,Burns,b'1672',https://www.nsnews.com/in-the-news-today-sept-24-1.23440348,"September 24, 2018 01:15 AM Six stories in the news for Monday, Sept. 24 ——— CAPITAL RESIDENTS RETURN TO TORNADO RUBBLE Ontario Premier Doug Ford has pledged the province’s full support to Ottawa residents recovering from Friday's tornadoes. He made the promise Sunday after arriving in Dunrobin, the Ottawa neighbourhood hardest hit by a pair of tornadoes that snapped power lines and levelled homes. Accompanied by Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson, Ford said it was heartbreaking to see the damage first-hand, and he praised the resilience of local residents, many of whom were seeing their smashed properties for the first time. ——— N.B. VOTERS HEAD TO THE POLLS TODAY New Brunswick voters go to the polls today in a provincial election that appears to be a tight race between the incumbent Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives. Liberal Leader Brian Gallant is looking to become the first New Brunswick premier to win a second term since 2003. Going into the election campaign the Liberals held 24 seats and the Progressive Conservatives 21, while there was one Green, one Independent and two vacancies. ——— ALLEGED FREDERICTON SHOOTER TO APPEAR IN COURT A Fredericton man, accused of killing four people, including two city police officers, in a shooting spree last month makes his second court appearance today. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, faces four counts of murder in the deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. ——— WETTLAUFER INQUIRY TO HEAR FROM VICTIMS' FAMILIES Families of victims and a woman who was almost killed by an Ontario nurse will speak for the first time today in St. Thomas, Ont., at a public inquiry into the serial-killer case. Elizabeth Wettlaufer is serving a life sentence after confessing to killing eight patients with insulin overdoses and attempting to kill four others at long-term care facilities and private homes in Ontario. The closing submissions are expected to provide insight into the impact her crimes had on the victims' families. ——— DECISION EXPECTED IN MILLARD'S 3RD MURDER TRIAL A decision is expected today in the case of a man accused of killing his father. Dellen Millard, 32, of Toronto, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the death of 71-year-old Wayne Millard, whose death was initially deemed a suicide. The Crown alleges the younger Millard killed his father over his potential inheritance. The defence claims Wayne Millard's death was a suicide. ——— CITIES MAKING FISCAL POWER PLAY AHEAD OF 2019 FEDERAL ELECTION Canada's cities believe they will finally land easier and direct access to federal dollars in next year's budget, or at least wrest a platform pledge from parties in the 2019 election. A pre-budget submission from the Federation of Canadian Municipalities asks the Liberals to end the buffet of application-based programs, and instead put the money into predetermined, annual payment programs. And the cities vow to make their financial concerns an election issue if they don't get their way. ——— ALSO IN THE NEWS: — Halifax trial of Darren Smalley and Simon Radford, accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a Halifax-area military base. — Statistics Canada releases wholesale trade data for July. — Rally outside Saudi embassy in Ottawa to call on Saudi officials to release women who advocated the right to drive in the country. — The International Pipeline Conference opens in Calgary. — Johnathan Ryann Gunville to appear in North Battleford, Sask., court on charges stemming from Sept. 16 Amber Alert. ——— ‹ › or view results September 24, 2018 September 25, 2018 September 22, 2018 September 24, 2018 September 22, 2018 September 26, 2018 September 26, 2018 September 26, 2018 September 26, 2018 September 26, 2018 Find out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.",0.0,2.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.8905882487407198,0,2018-09-26 13:55:26,False

Photo: Belinda Soole. Two Dubbo Master Builders Association members have won awards for their high-quality work. Greenmark Homes won the MBA regional award for energy efficiency and environmental management. Builder John O’Neil said he was pleased to win the award because Greenmark Homes is trying to establish a nice market in Dubbo. “Our homes are designed and built with energy efficiency in mind,” he said. “We have installed the first Tesla Powerwall 2 battery in our display home and within reason, this house could live off the grid. “We had to show the measures we put in place to make the house energy efficient and we had people from the MBA spend a few hours here, so we feel we earned the award. “I am over the moon to win this; I wasn’t expecting it, our goal is to specialise in building energy efficient homes for Dubbo people.” ALSO READ: SOLD: Dubbo breaks the record for house sales numbers in a rolling year Builder Matt Lack won his award for best additions and renovations up to $200,000. “It is good to be recognised for the work that we do; I feel pretty excited to get this award,” he said. “We are a small team that focuses on a niche market and we pride ourselves on quality and being able to deliver high-quality work for our customers.” ALSO READ It’s more expensive to rent a house in Dubbo now than 12 months ago-we tell you why MBA President Stuart Crowfoot said Greenmark Homes won their award against homes that were more expensive than his. “John has won his award over a $3 million project, for example, it’s a huge achievement,” he said. “The MBA awards have been around for a long time, both of these builders have won dedicated regional awards against high-quality entries from other builders, and it shows how good Dubbo builders are.” Sign up to receive our Breaking News Alerts and Editor's Daily Headlines featuring the best local news and stories.
