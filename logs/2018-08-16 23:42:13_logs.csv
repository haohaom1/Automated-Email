Sara,Burns,b'1383',https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/families-of-shooting-victims-const-sara-burns-and-const-robb-costello-release-statement-1.4049359,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9630101568145125,0,2018-08-16 23:41:40,True,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns of the Fredericton Police Force lost their lives in Friday's shootings. Following the fatal shootings in Fredericton early Friday morning, Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was charged Saturday with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, Donnie Robichaud, 42, Const. Robb Costello, 45, and Const. Sara Mae Burns, 43. The families of Const. Sara Burns and Const. Robb Costello have released the following statements: Statement on behalf of the Burns Family After the tragic events that took place earlier today, we would like to offer our sincerest condolences to the family of Cst. Robb Costello, and the other victims who lost their lives. Our thanks go out to the Fredericton Police Force officers and all of the other first responders who answered the call and came to help. Sara absolutely loved her job, and went to work each shift committed to serving this great community. We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers during this difficult time, and respectfully ask for privacy as we grieve. Statement on behalf of Jackie Steeves/ Costello Family I have received many requests from media wondering what kind of a person Robb Costello was. I am grieving and need some privacy, but wanted to share this with you. Robb was the single most positive person I have ever met; and that was obvious to everyone who met him. He had a special way of dealing with people – fair, but strong and tough when needed. He was the only officer I’ve ever known to write a ticket and have the recipient thank him for it. Robb spent years working in a specialized unit, that dealt with some tough investigations – which would faze most – but Robb was dedicated to helping others, and did the job with passion and the utmost professionalism, and always came home with a smile on his face. Robb loved the Unit work, but loved being on patrol even more. He was often heard to say he was a “CFL” - Constable for life. He loved the people, he loved the variety of calls, but mostly he loved being able to deescalate an escalating situation. I know he responded eagerly and willingly to that last call. While I met Robb relatively late in my life he was my soulmate, my best friend and the light of my life. We shared a love of one another that I only believed existed in the movies, except this was real life and it really happened. I cannot even begin to imagine my life without him. Robb was a dedicated family man. My children were so fond of Robb that they that they affectionately referred to him as their “Faux-Pa”. Robb’s mom was the most important woman in his life and Robb was extraordinarily proud of his daughters. My heart goes out to the other families who are also suffering from this tragedy. So many other officers and friends share in this loss and my heart breaks for each of you as it breaks for me. I am grateful for all the messages of love and support but ask for some privacy as I go through this difficult time.

Sara,Burns,b'1383',https://www.timescolonist.com/life/fredericton-man-48-charged-with-four-counts-of-first-degree-murder-in-shooting-1.23397026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9630101568145125,0,2018-08-16 23:41:41,True,"August 11, 2018 04:23 AM FREDERICTON — A man charged with multiple murders at a Fredericton apartment complex is being described as seemingly ""polite and pleasant,"" with police yet unable to offer the public any alleged motive for Friday's burst of violence. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, of Fredericton is accused of killing 32-year-old Bobbie Lee Wright, her boyfriend Donnie Robichaud, and police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns, police said Saturday. Raymond has lived in the complex for about four months, said Judith Aguilar, an office manager for Sunfield Apartment Rentals, the complex's owners. Aguilar said he is an avid cyclist who often came into pay his rent in cash while wearing a bike helmet. ""He seemed like a reasonably normal person. He seemed normal and made small talk every time you saw him,"" Aguilar said Saturday. ""He came in every month to pay rent. He was always polite and pleasant."" Both Robichaud, 42, and Raymond were residents of the complex, but lived in different buildings, she said. Investigators have not established a relationship between the accused and the deceased, said Fredericton deputy police chief Martin Gaudet. ""That is a piece of information we're looking to establish, and we haven't established it yet,"" he said at a news conference outside police headquarters, where residents have placed flowers, notes and teddy bears for the fallen officers. While little is known about the alleged gunman's potential motives, police have begun piecing together what happened. Investigators allege a man shot at Wright and Robichaud from an elevated position shortly after 7 a.m. Friday, using a long gun. They said Costello and Burns were responding to the shooting and found two victims on the ground, a man and woman. That's when the officers were shot, police said. Officials said Saturday that just one person was hospitalized after the shooting — Raymond, who is being treated for serious injuries after being shot by police. He is to remain in custody until he appears in court Aug. 27, police said. In an interview, Aguilar said that at one point maintenance workers needed to do some repairs in his apartment and he didn't want them there while he wasn't present. ""He seemed concerned, he said he had an expensive computer and an expensive bike and he didn't want anyone to be there alone,"" she said. ""They didn't even have to go all the way into the apartment, they were just fixing his door frame at the time."" She said she didn't interact with Robichaud much because he didn't come into the office to make his rent payments, and she did not know if he knew Raymond. As of Saturday morning, the area surrounding the crime scene remained cordoned off by yellow tape, but police allowed some shaken residents through to check on their pets. An RCMP forensic unit was on scene and police could be seen moving through the complex of low-rise brick apartments. More than half a dozen bullet holes could be seen in the window of an upper-floor corner apartment, while a second window appeared to have been mostly smashed. Joe Cartwright emerged from the building to say all the doors in the complex had been kicked in and one of his cats had escaped. Cartwright said his girlfriend, Caitlyn Francis, and four-year-old son had been at home during the shooting, and he rushed to the scene in a panic once he realized his family could be in danger. ""I'm very torn up,"" he said. ""I'm not doing very well at all, my girlfriend's not, my son's not, so we're going to go and just try to calm down from this."" Francis said she had been getting her stepson ready for daycare at 7:10 a.m. when she heard police sirens. She looked out and saw a police car pull in, driven by a man she believes was Costello. ""Not even a minute or two later I heard the first gunshot,"" she said Saturday morning, as she stood wrapped in a Red Cross blanket outside the apartment complex. ""I started bolting into my apartment and heard a second one."" The next moments were a blur as she focused on keeping her stepson safe and calm as several more shots could be heard, she said. ""I pulled him into my bedroom, got him to lay on the floor back there, tried to play cartoons for him, but he still could hear (the gunshots),"" she said. ""There was no playing off what those sounds were, he knew it."" Five minutes after the gunfire ceased, she said she peeked out the window and saw the leg of a person who was lying on the ground. Police have asked anyone who captured photos or video of the incident to come forward. Fredericton police said Friday night that the city and Red Cross had found lodging for 50 residents unable to return to their homes on Brookside Drive on the city's north side. At least 10 children lost a parent in the shooting. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. On Saturday evening, the Fredericton police released statements from both officers' families. Burns' family expressed sympathy for the families of Costello and the other victims, and asked for privacy as they grieved. ""Sara absolutely loved her job, and went to work each shift committed to serving this great community. We appreciate all of the thoughts and prayers during this difficult time,"" the statement said. Costello's partner, Jackie McLean, said in a statement of behalf of the family that she also sought privacy, but wanted to say a few things about him. ""Robb was the single most positive person I have ever met; and that was obvious to everyone who met him. He had a special way of dealing with people — fair, but strong and tough when needed. He was the only officer I've ever known to write a ticket and have the recipient thank him for it,"" she said. ""He was often heard to say he was a 'CFL' — constable for life. He loved the people, he loved the variety of calls, but mostly he loved being able to de-escalate an escalating situation. I know he responded eagerly and willingly to that last call."" Robichaud, a father of three who played bass and sang in a few local bands, had just begun dating Wright. ""It is just unfair, cruel and senseless. I have a lot of mixed emotions right now. I just pray to God that justice is served in this situation,"" said Amanda Lee Leighton, 32, of Fredericton, a close friend of Wright. ""I feel horrible that this could happen to one of the nicest girls I had ever known. Literally, she never fought with anyone or disliked anyone,"" she wrote in a text. — With Nicole Thompson and Gabriele Roy in Toronto and Alex Cooke and Michael Tutton in Halifax › Eric Akis Eric Akis: The benefits of quinoa waffles Eric Akis's Sunday Dinner: Try B.C. sockeye Japanese-style David Sovka Wheel Adventures: Smooth cycling and a dodgy detour in Panama Wheel Adventures: In Costa Rica, a jungle farm welcomes cyclists Get the day's top Times Colonist headlines emailed to you every morning The Times Colonist is looking for people to deliver flyers every Thursday ..."

Canadian charged in 4 people's deaths TORONTO -- Canadian police charged a man Saturday in the deaths of two police officers and two civilians in a shooting that struck a nerve in a country that has been roiled in recent months by instances of mass violence. Police in the eastern city of Fredericton, New Brunswick, said that Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was arrested and charged with four counts of first-degree murder. Horizon Health, which delivers care for New Brunswick's Department of Health, said Raymond was the only person being treated for injuries related to the shooting. He is due to appear in court Aug. 27. The victims have been identified as police Constable Robb Costello, 45, police Constable Sara Burns, 43, Donnie Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie-Lee Wright, 32. Robichaud and Wright were in a relationship, according to Facebook and Robichaud's cousin, Sean Callahan, who said they had just gotten together at the beginning of August. Police said they were working to determine a link between the gunman and the couple. Police said Costello and Burns were responding to calls of shots fired at an apartment complex and saw two deceased civilians before being shot and killed themselves. The last homicide in the city of about 60,000 people was in 2014. Japanese protest U.S. base relocation TOKYO -- Tens of thousands of protesters gathered Saturday in Okinawa vowing to stop the planned relocation of a U.S. military base on the southern Japanese island. Opponents of the relocation say the plan to move U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from a crowded neighborhood to a less populated coastal site would not only be an environmental debacle but also ignore local wishes to have the base moved from the island entirely. About 70,000 people gathered at a park in the state capital of Naha under pouring rain ahead of an approaching typhoon and observed a moment of silence for Okinawa's governor, Takeshi Onaga, who had spearheaded opposition to the relocation. He died Wednesday of cancer. Deputy Gov. Kiichiro Jahana, representing Onaga at Saturday's rally, said he will follow through with the revocation process as instructed by the governor and succeed his ""strong determination and passion."" Okinawans are trying to block the central government plan to start dumping soil into Henoko Bay within days to make a landfill for the new site of the Futenma base. Environmental groups say construction at the bay risks corals and endangered dugongs. About half of the 50,000 American troops in Japan are stationed on Okinawa. Equality report spurs protest in Tunisia BARDO, Tunisia -- Thousands of Muslim fundamentalists protested Saturday in front of the nation's parliament to decry proposals in a government report on gender equality that they claim are contrary to Islam. Men and veiled women marched under a blazing sun from Tunis to Bardo, outside the capital where the parliament is located, to protest the report by the Commission of Individual Liberties and Equality. The report, among other things, calls for legalizing homosexuality -- now punishable with three years in prison -- and giving the sexes equal inheritance rights. Men now receive double the inheritance of women. The commission was put in place a year ago by President Beji Caid Essebsi, who is expected to speak about it on Monday, Women's Day in Tunisia. It was not immediately clear whether the proposals would eventually be put before parliament. The protest was organized by the National Coordination for the Defense of the Koran, the Constitution and Equitable Development, and protesters defended a literal reading of the Koran, the Muslim holy book. Tarek Azouz worried that the proposals amounted to a ""wish to destroy moral values"" by legalizing homosexuality. If acted upon, he said, ""we'll end up with gay marriage."" Congo attacks imperil bid to curb Ebola BENI, Congo -- Suspected rebels killed seven civilians in an overnight attack in northeastern Congo, a local official said Saturday, highlighting the threat to efforts to contain the latest Ebola virus outbreak nearby. The administrator of Beni territory, Donat Kibwana, told The Associated Press the attack was likely carried out by Allied Democratic Forces fighters in Mayi-Moya, about 24 miles from Beni city. Kibwana said it sent the local population fleeing. Such mass displacement complicates health workers' efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak -- the nation's tenth -- that has killed 11 people so far in the densely populated region near the border with Uganda. Global health officials have said they are combating this outbreak in what is essentially a war zone, with multiple armed groups in the mineral-rich region and about 1 million displaced people. The attack occurred as the World Health Organization's director-general is visiting the area to see the Ebola response. Vaccinations began Wednesday for health workers and contacts of Ebola victims, and nearly 1,000 people are being monitored. -- Compiled by Democrat-Gazette staff from wire reports Police officers stand guard Friday at a newly established Ebola response center in Beni, Congo.

The woman was crying but Dozier was as well, so it felt right, she said. ""We're a close community,"" said Dozier, who's originally from Newfoundland but has lived in the city of 58,000 for more than 40 years. ""We're a small city. I didn't know her, but that's just the way we are here."" The strangers held each other for a few minutes, mourning police officers Sara Mae Helen Burns, 43, and Lawrence Robert (Robb) Costello, 45, Donald Adam Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Countless flowers, cards, balloons and teddy bears have been placed at the Fredericton police sign in front of the station downtown. But in the middle of the sea of flowers and colours, two objects stand out: a Superman painting and a framed Wonder Woman caricature. Alex Browne, a 10-year-old boy who lives in Fredericton, saw the Superman painting while walking by the police department with his mother. He decided another one had to be done. But this one would be Wonder Woman. ""I usually draw SpongeBob, but I tried to represent her, Sara,"" said Alex, referring to Const. Sara Burns. He didn't personally know her, but his sister knew Burns' youngest son. ""My daughter has met Sara's youngest son before and this really hit her hard. I'm a counsellor and have clients who knew the family so we felt the need to do something,"" said Shannon Browne, Alex's mother. ""Fredericton has never had to deal with something like this,"" said Dozier with a cracking voice. She lives with her husband on McKnight Street, just ""two minutes away"" from where the shooting took place. When her daughter called her Friday morning to warn her about the shooting, she thought it was a joke. ""I said what? I thought she was joking. I really did,"" said Dozier. ""But we're going to be a better Fredericton for this. I know we will."" All photos by María José Burgos. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

The rally in Salem was part of a series of rallies around the country hosted by Students for Life of America, a youth organization dedicated to abolishing abortion in their lifetime. The organization, which considers themselves a ""post-Roe organization,"" also provides education on abortion and promotes student leadership at a local and national level. Rallies around the nation were either organized by a regional coordinator or student leaders. Nichole Bentz, the Pacific Northwest regional coordinator for Students for Life of America and Salem rally organizer, said the purpose of Saturday's event was to show Oregon Senators Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) that there is support for Kavanaugh in the state. ""We're organizing this rallies to call Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed because he is a solid court nominee,"" Bentz, 24 of Corvallis, said. ""He has a strong record on religious liberty, free speech and protecting the pre-born."" Kavanaugh is President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, following Justice Neil Gorsuch who was confirmed in 2017. Kavanaugh's confirmation could change the direction of the court to a more conservative side for decades. Bentz spoke at the rally, along with Jessica Stanton, a public affairs official from Oregon Right to Life, and Marcos Sanchez, a student leader for Students for Life of America. ""After Justice Neil Gorsuch was placed on the Supreme Court, we could only dream of another opportunity to have such major influence for the pro-life movement,"" Stanton said. ""We must show our support and raise our voices for our U.S. Senators to confirm the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh."" Abby Luschei can be reached at aluschei@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6747.

Const. Sara Burns, 43, is shown in this undated police handout photo. HO/The Canadian Press In the middle of raising three boys, Sara Burns decided to go back to school and chase her dream of becoming a police officer. At 35, the Fredericton native decided to get a criminology degree, and then leave her husband and sons for six months of intensive training at the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. The driven recruit arrived in 2015 with a maturity that was uncommon among her 60 or so peers – most of whom were about 21 years old – and she was soon named the leader of the cohort for that year, according to Edgar MacLeod, who retired in January as the academy’s long-time executive director. Story continues below advertisement In an interview at the time with the Journal Pioneer, a local PEI newspaper, Ms. Burns explained her reasoning for joining law enforcement. “[Policing] is something that I think challenges you physically, mentally and socially; you need to be aware of those components. It’s a really challenging field and to survive you need to keep all of those in check,” she said. “To do well, you obviously need to maintain a certain standard, and here at the school they provide a lot of the theory and the skill to do that.” Mr. McLeod, a former president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, remembered her as physically capable and in possession of all the skills needed to enforce the law in dangerous situations. “But, beyond that, we also want to train our police officers to be compassionate and understanding of people, be patient with people – that sort of thing – and boy, she had that part down in spades,"" he said. “You could tell she would treat everybody with respect, not a showboat, she didn’t have an edge.” On Friday, friends and colleagues mourned Constable Burns after she and a fellow officer were killed in a quiet residential neighbourhood of Fredericton. Two civilians were also killed and a 48-year-old local man was in police custody on Friday evening with serious injuries. In 2016, soon after graduating from the academy, Constable Burns was hired by her hometown force, of which she had been an auxiliary member.

Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was charged Saturday morning with the deaths of two Fredericton police officers and two civilians, according to a news release from Fredericton police. The officers, identified Friday, are Const. Sara Burns, 43, and Const. Robb Costello, 45. Police confirmed the identity of the other two victims Saturday morning: Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Robichaud and Wright were in a new relationship, according to his cousin, Sean Callahan. He said they had just gotten together at the beginning of August. Callahan said there was “nothing bad you can say about” Robichaud. “When I got a message yesterday asking me if Donnie got shot, I was like, who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?” he told the Star in an interview. Callahan said he joined Robichaud’s mother and other family members at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital on Friday morning. An RCMP officer confirmed with them around 6 p.m. that Robichaud was one of the victims, Callahan said. Robichaud, a father of three, lived alone on Brookside Dr., according to his cousin. The shooting occurred at that address around 7 a.m. Friday. Just 12 hours after a shooting that shocked the city of Fredericton, more than 100 people packed into a local church Friday night to mourn the victims. St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church is less than a kilometre away from the site of the shooting. Citizens of the small New Brunswick city gathered to sing hymns, sit in silent prayer and light candles. “I’m so sad,” said Mei Yong, who brought her 2-year-old son, Nova Lin, to the vigil. Yong said she was there to show her support to Fredericton police, who helped her in a time of personal need. Even though she didn’t know the two officers who were killed, she said she was grieving with those who did. Costello, 45, had served for 20 years with Fredericton police. “He loved being a police officer and he lived for being a police officer,” his common-law partner, Jackie McLean said. “He is the only police officer who I have ever known who could write someone a ticket and have the person thank them after.” Burns, 43, was with Fredericton police for the past two years as an officer, and two years before that as an auxiliary officer. Fredericton is a city of less than 60,000, and its residents are tightly connected. One of those residents, retired United Church minister Brian DeLong, began getting calls just after 4 p.m. Police had just released the names of the officers — the first to respond to the call — who had been fatally shot, and people were badly rattled by the news. One of the victims, Const. Burns, was the daughter-in-law of two members of his congregation. “People from my congregation called me and said, ‘Did you know?’ ” DeLong said before the vigil. He rushed to join the vigil at St. John the Evangelist, where he read a scripture in dedication to Burns’ family, and all those grieving. The vigil was open to the whole community, its doors propped open to let in the evening breeze as the sun began to set. Fans moved the air around in the small gym where people gathered, but it remained hot after another stifling summer day.

Several blocks around the site of the shooting remained blocked off by police and New Brunswick RCMP on Friday evening, with several officers and a forensic investigation vehicle parked outside a four-building apartment complex at 237 Brookside Dr. Apparent bullet holes were visible in a second-storey window of one of the buildings at the complex. “It’s unbelievable in Fredericton,” Yong said. “It’s safe here, it’s not Toronto, so I just can’t believe it.” With files from The Canadian Press Taryn Grant is a reporter for StarMetro Halifax.

The 24-year-old was given his first chance since round seven, during Saturday's heart-breaking 17-16 loss to Penrith, through a training injury suffered by fullback Michael Gordon which could be season ending. It meant AJ Brimson switched to fullback, allowing Elgey to combine with Ash Taylor in the halves. While there was speculation Elgey may be forced to move to the English Super League to rebuild his career, he said he always wanted to stay in the NRL and is relieved he has some security. Three years ago Manly chased the then 21-year-old during his outstanding rookie season in response to Daly Cherry-Evans moving to the Gold Coast. After Aidan Sezer had departed for Canberra and Cherry Evans reneged on his Titans deal, Elgey stayed loyal to his home club after fans signed a petition to keep here. However, after a pre-season accident forced him to miss the entire 2016 season (coinciding with Taylor's arrival) and he struggled with confidence and a sternum injury in 2017, he has largely been the Titans' forgotten man after new coach Garth Brennan dropped him after the round seven loss to the Cowboys and told him to work on his defence. Brimson took full advantage of his opportunities in the No. 6 jersey and it looked like Elgey would never wear the Titans colours again. He was solid in his return, combining with Taylor to set up a try for winger Phillip Sami and was a dominant ally for Taylor in attack. He was willing in defence despite being targeted but was pushed off by Panthers centre Dean Whare late in the game as Whare squeezed between Elgey and Brendan Elliott to set up a try for Nathan Cleary. ""It's been hard and pretty nerve-wracking,"" said Elgey of the past few months while he knew the Titans would not offer him a contract. ""Of course I was worried [he mightn't get an NRL contract], but I just had to keep at it in 'Q Cup' and hope my manager could get something for me and in the end I had a few options, which was good. ""It is what it is, it's a business. My type of football wasn't what they wanted here and you have to accept that but hopefully I can go down to Manly and get better and better and I just want to keep learning. ""Having [former Titans head coach] John Cartwright at Manly had a lot to do with it, and Trent Barrett, being a five-eighth, as head coach is great. ""I'm hoping I can stay in the Titans team for the next few games and get some confidence to take into next year but if I'm not I'll go back to Tweed and do my best there. ""All my family came out today and treated it like my last game [for the Titans]."" Gordon's injury is tough luck for the 34-year-old veteran who has been in outstanding form. He has a two-hour operation to put his wrist back in place after it became entangled in another player's body in a defensive drill on Wednesday. The Titans announced on Friday Tyrone Roberts will return to the club for two years after he completes the season with Warrington, who are on the way to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley. They are also interested in Melbourne Storm's Riley Jacks as a further back-up in the halves.
