Bob,Diamond,2954,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/business/jes-we-can-staleys-battle-to-keep-bramson-off-the-barclays-board-w7wz3cd70,"The chief executive is having to defend the investment bank  an issue plaguing the lender for years April 28 2019, 12:01am, The Sunday Times In a chic hotel in Manhattan, the board of Barclays Bank gathered for what they initially thought was a routine meeting. It turned out to be anything but. The chief executive dropped a bombshell: he wanted them to consider whether it would make sense to spin off the prized  if troublesome  investment bank. That meeting took place not last week, but in October 1998. More than two decades later, the debate is still raging about whether Barclays should be a big player in investment banking, a potentially lucrative but volatile business dominated by a handful of Wall Street giants. Then, the debate was held largely behind closed doors at the instigation of the boss, Martin Taylor.

Bob,Diamond,2954,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/28/barclays-investment-bankers-have-fallen-out-premier-league-bob-diamond,"Contact author Sun 28 Apr 2019 02.00 EDT Cast your mind back a decade, to the spring of 2009. The UK was four months into its first recession in 18 years, the banking crisis had reached its zenith  or perhaps its nadir  and Manchester United were on the verge of winning the Premier League title. The fortunes of the British economy and the Red Devils have certainly reversed since them, the former improving modestly and the latter  well, not so much. But while the banking sector is no longer in crisis, it isnt exactly in fine fettle. Deutsche Bank is more or less a zombie bank, still struggling to shake off the after-effects of the crisis 10 years later. Italys financial sector is in a parlous state, reawakening fears of national and regional contagion. Critics say it has wasted resources, sucking up too much cash while offering little financial return Back in those heady days of 2009, investment bankers still ruled the roost. Bob Diamond, infamously described by Lord Mandelson as the unacceptable face of banking, was arguably the most powerful figure at Barclays, having presided over the meteoric rise of its investment banking arm, BarCap. Such was his status that, despite spreading global distaste for bonus-happy traders  who were seen as having plunged the world into recession  he was already being lined up as group chief executive. But what of the house that Bob built now? The division that was once Barclayss pride and joy has become the embarrassing relative. The division is seen as having underperformed  a point that group chief executive Jes Staley conceded last month as he defenestrated the units boss, Tim Throsby. Critics say it has wasted resources, sucking up too much cash while offering little financial return. The units pre-tax profits sank 29 in the first quarter, according to figures released last week. That will give its critic-in-chief, activist investor Edward Bramson, all the ammunition he needs to turn the screw on the banks leadership at Thursdays annual meeting. The corporate raider holds a 5.5 stake via his Sherborne Investors vehicle, making him one of its largest shareholders. He is rattling his sabre, asking fellow investors to vote him onto the banks board. Should he succeed in becoming the cuckoo in Barclayss nest, he will push for the investment banking unit to be hacked back to boost the groups share price. Barclays isnt the only investment bank having a tough time. UBS said last week that its investment banking profits plunged 64, while Deutsches trading arm, which appears to be in a perpetual state of decline, suffered its second loss-making quarter in a row.

Public Service Company of Oklahoma RETAIL CENTER Developer signs new marketer MCALESTER TNS  The proposed highway retail project known as Shops at McAlester has shifted gears, with a new marketer signing and on and renewed word from the developer regarding when the first dirt is expected to be turned on the project. Projections from last year that the highway district retail center, planned for the intersection of Fourteenth Street and U.S. Highway 69, would be ready to open by Christmas 2019 are obviously not going to happen  placing it well past the original schedule. Developer Burk Collins of Burk Collins & Company and his associate Danny Cooper were in McAlester this week to assess the situation and to meet with some partners. Theyre our equity partners, Collins said of those he met with in McAlester. Weve got our financing pretty much in line. Collins addressed some of the reasons for the delay in starting the proposed highway retail shopping center. Eight-five percent of the lenders arent making loans, Collins said. He said they think that Amazons going to continue to saturate the market. Collins said his confident the team he now has in place will get the project rolling. Weve got 80 percent of the space leased, Collins said. Weve got most of the engineering. Based on that information, Collins projected there could be groundbreaking in from 45-to-60 days. Hobby Lobby, Ross and T.J. Maxx are still the proposed anchors for the highway retail shopping center, he said. FFO Furniture Factory Outlet and Burkes Outlet are also on board, the developer said. Collins recently switched his marketer, changing from one he said hes been associated with for years. Its not in their market, Collins said of the way the former marketer viewed the proposed McAlester site.  McAlester News-Capital Choose the plan that's right for you.

In November 2017, Brooklyn BreYanna Stevenson, 31, was found dead in a hotel room in Oklahoma City with multiple gunshot wounds. An anonymous tip to police led them to arrest Brandon Michael Tyson, 32, in connection with the murder, and a witness connected him to the crime. Lambda Legal filed a federal lawsuit challenging Tennessee's policy prohibiting transgender people born in the state from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates, a press release noted. Tennessee is one of just three remaining statesincluding Kansas and Ohiowhere Lambda Legal has similar lawsuits currently pending in federal district court. ""Tennessee's birth certificate policy is archaic and discriminatory. By refusing to correct the birth certificates of transgender Tennesseans, Tennessee puts transgender people in harm's way and violates our most fundamental constitutional rights,"" said Lambda Legal Senior Attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan. Amazon, IKEA, Lyft, Hilton, Warby Parker and several other businesses operating in Tennessee are speaking out against legislation affecting LGBT individuals, arguing the proposed bills will make employee recruitment more difficult and harm the state's business climate, The Tennessean reported. Marriott International, MassMutual, Nike, InterContinental Hotels Group, Salesforce, Unilever and Replacements also signed a letter dated April 23, initiated by the Human Rights Campaign and sent to Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and House Speaker Glen Casada. Warner Music Group, Curb Records and AllianceBernstein have previously issued statements voicing their concerns about the bills. A sorority's new diversity statement explicitly bans transgender women from membership, LGBTQ Nation reported.

Philly Black Pride  PBP  and Philadelphia gay bar Woody's are at odds after PBP claimed that the Gayborhood bar was throwing a PBP block party without the namesake organization's consent, Philadelphia Gay News  PGN  reported. PBP President Le Thomas said that AIDS Healthcare Foundation submitted a special-events permit to close part of 13th Street for a block party April 28 that would conflict with a party PBP is hosting around the corner. Woody's, in a statement to PGN, claimed it never used the name. It turned out that a post published on the website Medium accusing Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg of sexual assault was fabricated as part of a smear campaign led by two right-wing agitators, PinkNews noted. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman and provocateur Jacob Wohl had been looking for young men willing to accuse Pete Buttigieg of sexual misconduct as part of their plan to stop the candidate's momentum, The Daily Beast reported. The Medium account that posted the false accusation bore the name of Hunter Kelly, a 21-year-old gay Republican college student who told The Advocate he was flown to Washington, D.C., by Burkman and Wohl; Kelly later denied the claims against Buttigieg. Evangelical pastor Franklin Graham  the son of the late pastor the Rev. Billy Graham  is calling on Pete Buttigieg to repent for being gay, The Washington Blade noted. Graham tweeted April 24 the Bible ""defines homosexuality as a sin."" Graham's comments come after Buttigieg declared himself a ""gay Christian"" and claimed ""God doesn't have a political party"" at a CNN town hall.

The bill includes language excluding transition-related medical services for transgender Iowans from all insurance coverage funded by public dollars, including Medicaid, and preventing Planned Parenthood from engaging in competitive bidding for certain sexual-education grants. In part, Hoffman-Zinnel said, ""By passing this legislation, our state has sent the appalling message that transgender people are second-class citizens in our state. Make no mistake, this cruel bill threatens people's lives."" The Human Rights Campaign  HRC  noted a vote by the Minnesota House of Representatives to include H.F. 12legislation to protect LGBTQ youth from conversion therapyin the HHS Omnibus finance bill.

Indiana police went undercover using Grindr to catch 19-year-old Jacob Trosper, who once again is accused of using the dating app to rob victims at gunpoint, The Times of Northwest Indiana reported. Police said the idea on how to catch him came from his last robbery victim20-year-old Zach Keil, who advised officers to use the same method the suspect used to lure him. Trosper is still facing charges of armed robbery, robbery resulting in bodily injury and kidnapping from an incident Dec. 2, when he allegedly used Grindr to lure in a 52-year-old Dyer man to injure and rob him. An entire confirmation class at First United Methodist Church in Omaha, Nebraska, announced to their congregation that they have decided not to become members due to the church's stance on LGBTQ issues, LGBTQ Nation reported.

Michael,Sylvester,2927,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/04/24/maine-voices-local-clean-election-program-would-open-door-to-more-portland-candidates/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Public campaign financing for municipal races would make it easier for all citizens to seek public office. This fall, Portland voters may have the chance to make local elected offices more accessible to everyone by adopting a public campaign financing program. This program, proposed by Maine Citizens for Clean Elections and the League of Women Voters of Maine, may appear on city ballots as a referendum question if enough signatures are collected. This program would guarantee that anyone who wants to run for local office will have access to enough campaign funding to have a fair shot. Participating candidates would not need to raise huge sums for their campaigns, the way they do today. Joey Brunelle of Portland was an at-large candidate for City Council in 2017 and 2018. This is not a new concept for Mainers: We already have a very successful statewide public financing program commonly known as the Clean Election program that has allowed dozens of people from all walks of life to be elected to the Legislature. For example, Portland state Sen. Ben Chipman and state Reps. Rachel Talbot Ross and Michael Sylvester were all Clean Election candidates. But that program is only for state offices  there is no equivalent program for people who want to be city councilors or school board members. Its time we change that and make local elections just as open and fair as state elections. In the last few years, weve seen a number of City Council candidates raise previously unheard-of sums for their campaigns by soliciting massive donations from a small number of wealthy donors. This has made it nearly impossible for other candidates to compete, and actually discourages a lot people from even trying. I have tried to encourage many smart, passionate, dedicated members of our community to run for City Council or school board, but very few have. Why? Because theres no way I could raise all that money, they say. Thats a valid concern: If you dont have connections who can write you some fat checks, sorry  you dont stand a chance in a Portland City Council race. It didnt used to be this way. Just five years ago, municipal campaigns were run on $5,000 or $10,000, or even  in some rare cases  less than $1,000. But that has changed: In 2016, at-large City Council candidate Pious Ali broke all records by raising almost $31,000 for his campaign. The next year another at-large candidate, Bree LaCasse, shattered that record by raising almost $45,000, in large part from wealthy donors contributing the maximum amount allowed by law. In 2018 an incumbent district councilor, Spencer Thibodeau, raised over $21,000, and an incumbent at-large city councilor, Nick Mavodones, raised almost $42,000  over half of which came from just 20 donors, their families and the businesses they own, according to my analysis of publicly available candidate finance reports. Is this how our local democracy is supposed to work? Are 20 wealthy families supposed to have this much power over our local elections? I dont think so. The problem is not any specific candidate, but the system that gives them no other path to victory than this kind of fundraising. Campaigns should not be contests of who is better connected to wealthy donors. They should be about who has better ideas to improve the lives of all Portlanders. In an April 15 Press Herald article, City Manager Jon Jennings is quoted as saying, The effort to require a clean elections process at the municipal level will lead to the further crowding out of necessary and core functions of municipal government. But what could be a more core function of government than to make elections open to everyone, regardless of someones ability to court wealthy donors? Is it not necessary for our government to ensure that our representative democracy is truly representative of everyone, not just wealthy donors? We have early voting and mail-in voting to make it easier for voters to vote. We should have public campaign financing to make it easier for all citizens to run for office and give back to their community. Such a program would give everyone  teachers, service workers, grad students, retired folks, young parents, naturalized citizens, everybody  a fair shot to compete against candidates funded by wealthy donors. Lets make democracy a little more democratic. Sign a petition to get a public campaign financing program on the ballot in November. Send questions/comments to the editors.

John,O'Neil,2960,https://www.baltimoresun.com/ph-ag-hdg-weekend-0426-story.html,"Next weekend is going to be a busy one in Havre de Grace as the city celebrates the first John ONeill Day and welcomes visitors to the 38th Annual Decoy & Wildlife Art Festival. On May 3, 1813, ONeill manned a cannon by himself and fired it against the enemy during the War of 1812 and wouldnt leave his post. Thats when the city was attacked by the British, and ONeill defended the city, Havre de Grace Tourism Manager Lauri Orzewicz said. In August, the Havre de Grace City Council declared the first Saturday in May as John ONeill Day. Its the citys first municipal holiday and will celebrate heritage and tradition. Havre de Grace will celebrate John ONeill Day with Defenders Weekend in Concord Point Park. The celebration will begin Saturday, May 4 at 7 p.m. with a concert by the 229th Army National Guard Band. Martin, a history teacher at Aberdeen Middle, will talk about the history of Havre de Grace during the War of 1812 and the importance of ONeill. John ONeil is not only the first lighthouse keeper, but he is also a war hero to Havre de Grace citizens, Martin said. His actions on May 3, 1813, in which he solely attempted to defend the town from British invasion has become the story of legends, he said. I honestly believe that John ONeills determination, courage and swag lives with every Havre de Grace citizen until this day, Martin said. That is why our community has the best citizens and volunteers. Must be something in the water we drink from the Susquehanna. The concert will lead up to fireworks that will be fired off a barge off Concord Point. The festivities will continue Sunday, May 5, in Concord Point Park with two live bands, a large beer garden and 20 food trucks, Orzewicz said. The idea is for everyone to bring a blanket or chair and have a picnic, enjoy a family event, Orzewicz said. If the fireworks are rained out Saturday, they will be set off Sunday, she said. About 70 vendors are expected for the annual Decoy and Wildlife Art Festival, which runs 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday, May 4, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday, May 5, at the Decoy Museum, 201 Giles St., and the middle school, 401 Lewis Lane. The festival will not be open on Friday evening this year, Decoy Museum Executive Director Kerri Kneisley said. In addition to artists exhibiting and selling their art work, food, childrens activities, silent auctions, retriever demonstrations and carving competitions are on tap. The honorary chairmen are Capt. Joey Jobes of Havre de Grace and John Ingoglia New this year will be entries in a childrens art contest, which drew pieces from about 85 young people up to age 18. The art will be on display throughout the middle school and will be judged by festival leaders and popular opinion at 3 p.m. Sunday, May 5. The pieces had to be waterfowl or water-life related. I was so amazed at the talent of Harford County kids, Kneisley said. Retriever demonstrations that in previous years had been limited to certain times on one day of the festival will be on-hand the entire weekend, she said. Other events include carving competitions, an old decoy contest and a silent auction and raffle as well as activities for children throughout the day. Its an annual tradition, 38 years of the event, Kneisley said. Its a great opportunity to see and purchase, if you wish, numerous works of art.

Phillip,Frost,2948,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/26/sec-primary-strategist-in-lucrative-market-manipulation-case-to-settle.html,"Keep Me Logged In It only took one word from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on inflation to send the markets reeling, and that word was 'transitory.' Wall Street firms have a playbook for a potential rapid move higher in stock markets. The Federal Reserve did, however, make a slight cut to the interest rate paid on excess reserves that banks keep at the Fed. Washington and Beijing have pushed to resolve a trade dispute that led to a series of tariffs and raised fears about spiraling economic damage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 turned negative on Wednesday after the top-ranking Federal Reserve official hinted that lower rates may not be in the cards. Microsoft's Bret Arsenault, who serves as its top cybersecurity executive, discussed the top issues facing his company and its clients, and offers advice for smaller firms on... Barr's testimony Wednesday intensified Democrats' calls for Mueller himself to testify and led some of them to accuse Barr of giving misleading answers. Facebook on Tuesday announced a bevy of new shopping features for its various apps, setting a business foundation for the company's pivot to privacy. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says the central bank is likely to keep interest rates steady, despite pressure from President Trump to cut them. This is a comparison of Wednesday's FOMC statement with the one issued after the Fed's previous policymaking meeting on March 20.

Apple could just be one of the many companies getting a boost from the turnaround in Chinese economy. Florida businessman Barry Honig plans to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC said, in what it called ""classic pump-and-dump schemes"" when the charges were announced. The SEC filed a motion on Friday afternoon requesting an extension of time. ""This week, Defendant Honig and the Commission staff reached an agreement in principle to settle the Commission's claims for liability,"" the motion said. Honig's company GRQ was also charged and is included in the proposed settlement. The extension of time was requested to allow the SEC to obtain ""approval of a settlement in principle,"" according to the latest filing. No other details about the potential settlement were given. The SEC charged 19 others along with Honig. The SEC already settled in full or in part with nine defendants, including Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost, according to the filing. ""Honig was the primary strategist, calling upon other Defendants to, among other things, acquire or sell stock, arrange for the issuance of shares, negotiate transactions, and/or engage in promotional activity"" in the $27 million schemes, according to the SEC's amended complaint, filed in March. The SEC declined to comment beyond its latest motion. Eli Richlin, one of the attorneys for Honig, said he had no comment when reached by phone. Honig was once the largest shareholder of Riot Blockchain, the cryptocurrency company whose stock skyrocketed after it changed its name from Bioptix. He was charged by the SEC along with John O'Rourke, the former CEO of Riot Blockchain, who left Riot in the wake of the charges. The SEC case is unrelated to Riot Blockchain. O'Rourke remains a defendant in the case and takes no position on the extension of time, according to the SEC's motion. Attorneys for O'Rourke did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment. A CNBC investigation in February 2018 found a number of red flags at Riot Blockchain, including annual meetings that were postponed at the last minute, sales of stock by company insiders soon after the company's name change, dilutive share issuances on favorable terms to large investors, confusing SEC filings and evidence that a major shareholder was selling shares while everyone else was buying. ""We have made significant inroads in building a diversified portfolio of investments and to begin securing digital assets,"" O'Rourke said in a letter to shareholders the day the CNBC investigation aired. As bitcoin's price hit record highs in late December 2017, Riot was making news on a daily basis.

Michael,Gordon,2970,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nz-marginal-improved-in-april-business-confidence-westpac-201904300430,"Michael Gordon, analyst at Westpac, notes that the New Zealands business confidence improved marginally in April, but remained close to its recent lows. Key Quotes A net 38 of firms were downbeat about the general economy. Own-activity confidence improved slightly to 7, but remains well below its long-run average. Beneath the broadly unchanged headline, there were mixed results across sectors. Manufacturing and agricultural firms were more upbeat than in March, the latter likely helped by rising dairy prices and an easing of the dry conditions in late summer. Against this, confidence fell further in retail and construction especially residential. Pricing intentions and expected inflation were little changed compared to March. Expected costs fell, but ANZ noted that a change to the wording of the question meant that it was not comparable to the previous month.

Michael,Gordon,2942,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nz-strong-trade-surplus-in-march-westpac-201904260453,"Michael Gordon, analyst at Westpac, notes that the New Zealand recorded a whopping $922m trade surplus in March, much stronger than market forecasts and well above even Westpacs top-of-the-market pick of $400m. Key Quotes Part of the improvement in March was seasonal, with exports usually nearing their peak at this time of year. Even so, the seasonally adjusted surplus of $201m comes after a 14-month string of deficits. Exports were up 11.5 in seasonally adjusted terms. There was a strong lift in volumes for both dairy and meat, along with growth in wood, fruit and oil exports. This was an exceptionally strong month for exports, and we would expect some reversal in April. That said, the sharp rise in dairy export prices in recent auctions, which will more than offset lower volumes, has yet to come through in the trade figures. Seasonally adjusted imports were down 1.3, reflecting a decline in imports of various materials. Petroleum imports rose, with world oil prices rising again recently. Imports of capital equipment have picked up since the end of last year, and were broadly steady in March.

Andrew,Davis,2932,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/MUSIC-Ravinia-CEO-Welz-Kauffman-on-upcoming-season-/65899.html,"There will be more than 50 artist debuts and 35 festival premieres, including Ravinia's co-commissioning of the last composition of the late Andre Previn, a one-act for Renee Fleming. Nine conductors take the podium for the 84th annual residency of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, including Marin Alsop, returning as curator of Ravinia's multi-season celebration of Leonard Bernstein.  There will also be a Bernstein exhibit.  Windy City Times recently talked with Ravinia CEO Welz Kauffmanwho's helmed the organization since 2000about this year's acts. Windy City Times: When it comes to procuring artists for the next season, do you all start immediately after the previous season ends? Welz Kauffman: That's a really great question. One of the things that makes the process practical and logical is that different artists book at different times. Classical artists are always way ahead of the game. A great singer like Placido Domingo or Renee Fleming will be typically booked six or seven years in advance because they're such big stars. With summer festivals and classical music, it's not THAT far in advance, but I'm pretty much locked for 2020 with some. With the non-classical artistswho are about 35-40 percent of what we dothey don't typically like even begin talking with me until Thanksgiving before the coming summer; that's a little bit of a nail-biter. Why do they wait so long? Because if you're Maroon 5 or Lionel Richie or Sting, you're booking six-, eight- or 10-week tours at a timeand box office can determine where they go. And I'm always thinking about who I'd like to have. Stevie Wonder can come whenever he wants to; he's been on my bucket list forever. I've been able to get through most of the bucket list I've had since 2000, which is gratifying. Stevie Nicks carne a couple years agoand she was mad at me because I hadn't been more forceful to get her to come. I like Joan Baez and Bonnie Raitt summed it up best: They think of Ravinia as a big Park Westwhich I took as a huge compliment, especially regarding the layout. This is perfect for me. I'm an omnivorous enjoyer of all kinds of music. WCT: Has the Ravinia line-up always been this diverse? For example, has rap always been there? WK: I guess one of the questions one has to ask is ""How long has rap been around?"" It hasn't been around as long as jazz, for example, but you're right. Wyclef Jean and having Mary J. Blige were new to usbut they were such great shows. We want to see many audiences and many different types of people. If they want to see Mary J. Blige one night and Mozart the next, more power to them. WCT: You're also doing something LGBT-related that's also connected with the 50th anniversary of Stonewall. WK: So we did the show ""Considering Matthew Shepard"" for the first time last year, and it was the 20th anniversary of his murder. It's a piece I've loved and known for a couple years. No one needs an anniversary to do a piece, but it just came together that way. And this year, we have jazz pianist Fred Hersch; he was out pretty early, and he's a fascinating person and consummate musician. This year, we're also doing a Leonard Bernstein piece. It's not just that Bernstein was gay or bisexual, but it was a political piece. This was when he and Nixon were battling back and forth; J. Edgar Hoover told Nixon that Bernstein had written lyrics in a secret code to kill Nixon. Also, Leonard was very involved in the times he was living in; he entertained the Black Panthers, for example. We're not hugely political at Raviniabut, at the same time, we never shy away from things. Also, we've collaborated with Center on Halsted, and I've been involved with them for some time. Last year, there were some guys named Well Strung, who mix things like Bach and ""Call Me Maybe""; they're coming back this year for a farewell tour. We've also worked with the Center on ""Considering Matthew Shepard."" We were also in the Pride Parade a couple years ago; we had Lea DeLaria, who was the Pride Parade grand marshal, do a showshe's a wonderful singer. These are wonderful artists. They just happen to be part of the LGBT community. WCT: You mentioned a bucket list WK: which includes Bruno Mars. WCT: What musician do has retired or even passed away would you have loved to have at Ravinia? WK: Oh, man. Most recentlypartially because I used to work for himthe great composer/raconteur Andre Previn I would've loved for him to come here, because we actually have the premiere of what we think was the last work he ever wrote. That's happening in July with Renee Fleming and the Emerson String Quartet. And, Andre revered Bernstein; they were incredibly alikewriting for film, concert hall, Broadway, opera, as well as conducting and being great television personalities. They had charisma, and were witty and super-smart. Who else? We had Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington, but would still love to them again. Definitely, Tom Petty was on my bucket list; we got close but it never happened. Elviswhy not? For more, visit www.ravinia.org/ .

Steve,Cummings,2969,https://www.comicsbeat.com/jim-zub-ya-comics-stone-star/,"The Beat The News Site of Comics Culture Jim Zub chats about his new science-fantasy series 04/30/2019 2:30 pm by Matt O'Keefe Leave a Comment Jim Zub completed his 30-issue opus Wayward last November and it seemed like it would be his last creator-owned title for a stretch. Hes busy writing Avengers weekly series for Marvel and even relaunched Champions with Wayward co-creator Steve Cummings. But, out of nowhere, ComiXology Originals dropped the first issue of Stone Star from Zub and Max Dunbar, his collaborator on Dungeons & Dragons titles. Seeing a trend of writing comics of all ages, I was excited to interview my most frequent guest about Stone Star, writing for Marvel, and Zubs interest in writing YA comics. Art by Max Dunbar & Espen Grundetjern Stone Star started began soon after Wayward ended its run. Is it important for you to consistently have a creator-owned book on the stands? Absolutely. Work-for-hire and creator-owned projects each flex different creative muscles, and ideally Ill always have at least one of each on go at the same time. I didnt originally intend to launch a new creator-owned project in 2019, but when Chip Mosher from ComiXology and I started talking about the flexibility digital-first could provide and their ongoing plans for ComiXology Originals, Max was available and I realized that if we didnt go for it and make Stone Star there might not be a good time to make it happen down the road. As much as I wanted a break, I wanted to build something fun with Max even more. Now that were in the thick of it, as crazy as it is in terms of my schedule, it also just feels kind of right. The art in Stone Star is different from Dunbars past work, a little less intricate but much more lively. Is it a style hes wanted to try for a while? This is me letting Max just go wild with whatever look he thinks will fit the story. Im encouraging him to design up a storm and have fun with it. Same with the pages themselves. Im writing dialogue-heavy sections in full script and then going Marvel-Style for the action beats so Max can decide if those scenes end up being tightly choreographed fights with lots of panels or bigger blow out pages. The more excited he is about the book, the better results we get in the finished pages. Art by Max Dunbar & Espen Grundetjern Stone Star feels like the kind of book put out by a YA publisher like GRAPHIX or Random House. Is the bookstore market on your mind for the print version? Stone Star definitely skews younger than Wayward in terms of subject matter and art style. The book market is a natural fit for the collected edition and my fingers are crossed that we can make a splash there once its released. I have a few story concepts Id love to develop for the same age range, the kind of adventure-centered stories that would have grabbed my attention as a young reader. Co-writing with a veteran like Mark Waid and someone as established Al Ewing, has working on the two Avengers storylines served as crash courses in writing Marvel comics? Al and Mark are stellar collaborators. Ive had the good fortune to co-write with Gail Simone on Conan-Red Sonja and Pat Rothfuss on Rick and Morty VS D&D as well, but the kind of sprawling continuity-laden stuff Mark, Al, and I put together for No Surrender and No Road Home was kind of next level. It was a masterclass in superhero storytelling, character and team dynamics, and learning how to communicate effectively, both on the page and with each other. On No Surrender I felt like I was the new guy, and I was desperate to prove I could carry my share and wouldnt let the team down. On No Road Home wed already been through the fire and come out the other side, so we just got right back to work without any hesitation. I knew what I could bring to the table and knew what everyone elses strengths were too. As obvious as it may sound, thats what the Avengers do  work together to battle the foes they cant handle as individuals. Having stellar art teams and editorial backing us up just makes it that much better. Art by Alexander Lozano Whats the co-writing process like with Dan Slott on Iron Man? Dans the biggest Marvel fan Ive ever met, and I mean that as the highest compliment. I jump on a call with him and I know its going to be at least two hours of pure enthusiasm packed with incredible story concepts and dramatic payoffs he cant wait to tell me about. We start riffing off each other and the story just gets bigger and better. Since I stepped into the story Dans been building, the first few issues felt like I was getting up to speed, trying to match Dans energy and do my best impression of him. Now that Ive done that for a few issues, Im getting comfortable putting more of myself into it and bringing Dan on board with a lot of my ideas as well. Its a ton of fun. Working with Mark, Al, and Dan, with Tom Brevoort overseeing the whole thing  What a wild ride. Were all Marvel-obsessed storytellers with a deep need to honor and build on the comics that inspired us. Theres a level of respect and one-upmanship I absolutely love being a part of. With newer heroes, every story does more to define the character. Does that make writing Champions a liberating experience? Thats exactly it. Theres a freedom to define these younger characters and shake them to their core in ways thats a lot more difficult with more established heroes. With Champions I set out to prove that these new heroes could step up and face threats just as intense as any classic Marvel icon. Whether or not I succeeded, well thats for readers to decide. Im too close to it right now to say. Art by Kim Jacinto & Rain Beredo Is there a certain member of the team youve come to especially appreciate writing Champions? Champions is an ensemble cast, varied and eclectic, so I go through phases of focusing on different characters at different times. The first few issues introduced Amka and put Riri through the ringer, then Sam, and then Viv. Currently, its Kamala and Miles in the hot seat. Kamala, Sam, and Viv have more trouble theyll be dealing with in upcoming issues and showing the strain that keeping this team pulled together takes on them is important to me. Just because theyre teenagers doesnt mean it should be easy. If anything, its even more difficult  they have a ridiculous amount of responsibility heaped on them without the experience to back it up, plus teen angst. How does your collaboration with Steve Cummings change working on a Marvel title as opposed to creator-owned? In a lot of ways, it feels the same. Steven started drawing Champions a week after he wrapped Wayward, so I had to rewire my brain a bit to remember that we were looping in editors now and that we couldnt just keep doing whatever we wanted. The reference gathering is different. Instead of Steven heading out to the streets of Tokyo to gather visual ref of neighborhoods for Wayward, Im compiling Marvel character ref and getting him up to speed on continuity for all these teen characters. The 13-hour time difference still has a magical quality to it. I wake up in the morning and theres almost always new art waiting in my inbox. Its a nice way to start the day. Between Stone Star and Champions, a lot of your work has a young adult appeal. Is that where you wanted to steer your career or did it happen naturally? The next generation of readers is connected and vibrant. That feels like a good space to plant a few flags, absolutely. For all the angst Im putting into Champions, the overall message is one of persistence and hope in the face of adversity. I think readers need some of that right now. I know I do.

Michael,Gordon,2951,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-27/nrl-brisbane-broncos-v-cronulla-sharks-wests-tigers-v-gold-coast/11044032,"Updated April 27, 2019 22:17:23 The Broncos answer a number of their critics by ending a four-match losing streak with a convincing victory over the Sharks, while the Tigers snare a win against the Titans in Tamworth. Milestone man Anthony Milford guided Brisbane to a drought-breaking 29-6 win over an injury-hit Cronulla at Lang Park. Five-eighth Milford celebrated his 150th NRL match with a first-half masterclass, as the Broncos ended a worrying losing run. Milford set up two of Brisbane's three opening-half tries and potted a field goal, as the hosts stormed to a 21-0 buffer at the break and were never threatened against a Cronulla outfit struck down by injury. The Sharks were behind the eight ball from the outset when they lost centre Josh Dugan hamstring before kick-off then star playmaker Shaun Johnson succumbed to a suspected hamstring complaint in the 22nd minute. Brisbane showed no mercy, entertaining the 27,638-strong crowd to provide sweet relief for besieged coach Anthony Seibold. The Broncos were under pressure after suffering their worst season start in 20 years but appeared to rectify their defensive woes overnight to avoid losing five-straight games for the first time since 2012. Seibold's only concern was losing back rower Alex Glenn midway through the second half with a thigh injury. It gave Brisbane a timely shot in the arm ahead of their upcoming grudge match against former Broncos coach Wayne Bennett's South Sydney. While Milford silenced the cynics, winger Corey Oates  running 170 metres  was enormous along with centre Jack Bird 101m, 12 tackle breaks against his former club Cronulla. Brisbane's pack also stood up, led by props Matt Lodge 180m and Payne Haas 153m, while lock Tevita Pangai Junior 160m impressed in his return from suspension. Oates ran off Milford to open the scoring in the eighth minute after the Broncos made the visitors pay for full-back William Kennedy's shocking pass that led to a knock-on. It marked Oates' seventh-consecutive match he had scored against the Sharks. Glenn burrowed over in the 11th minute after a knock-on from 19-year-old Ronaldo Mulitalo who made a nightmare NRL debut after being slotted onto the wing in a reshuffled backline following Dugan's withdrawal. Milford was at it again to send Joe Ofahengaue over for a 27th-minute try to make it 20-0 before kicking a field goal just before half-time. Brisbane centre James Roberts crashed over in the 53rd minute for what turned out to be the match winner. Cronulla did not get on the board until the 61st minute when hooker Jayden Brailey pounced on a Chad Townsend kick. A Mahe Fonua hat-trick and some Esan Marsters magic helped the Wests Tigers come from behind to beat Gold Coast 30-14 in Tamworth. After the Tigers trailed 14-0 following just 20 minutes, Michael Maguire's men put on six unanswered tries to lift themselves back into the top eight. But the win may have come at a cost, with five-eighth Josh Reynolds suffering a possible medial ligament injury to his left knee early in the first half. That blow formed part of a horror start to the night for the Tigers, after Reynolds also dropped the ball from the opening kick off before Marsters was penalised for running in front of a restart. Just five days after copping a 51-6 flogging at the hands of Parramatta, however, the Tigers showed all the resilience asked of them by Maguire. Man-of-the-match Ryan Matterson impressed filling in for Reynolds at five-eighth, while Luke Brooks and Robbie Farah stepped up with the boot at the end of sets. Marsters kickstarted their revival in the 24th minute when he collected an offload from Matterson and got a one-handed basketball style pass away for Fonua to score. The Tigers centre also had one of his own before the break, stepping and pushing his way through three Titans defenders to help his team to an unlikely 16-14 half-time lead. Fellow centre Robert Jennings too had tries either side of the break. His first came after Michael Gordon fumbled a Moses Mbye kick while his second after the break was straight out of dummy half. Brooks then put Fonua over for his two second-half tries. The Tigers half-back threw a long cut-out ball from a rebounded kick to give the Tigers a 26-14 lead, before grubbering for the chasing winger on the siren. Just as impressive was the Tigers' defence, though. They held out five straight sets late in the match to hold on for their fourth win of the year. In contrast, the Titans barely fired a shot after the opening 20 minutes, where Anthony Don scored in a fifth straight game from a cross-field Tyrone Roberts bomb. Winger Dale Copley was also forced from the field early in the first half with a quad cork, summing up an unhappy night.

Michael,Gordon,2936,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/04/25/were-too-nice-to-each-other-pongas-home-truths/,"KNIGHTS Knights dynamo Kalyn Ponga hopes it was the honesty session that kick-starts their season. When Ponga and his teammates fronted for their pre-training review on Wednesday, coach Nathan Brown made them sit through every error they made and all the shortcuts they took in their 38-14 loss to Gold Coast last Sunday, with a view to making them more accountable. After five straight losses, the Knights are running out of time, excuses and explanations, but Ponga said they were all committed to turning their year around. Weve had a review of the game and a bit of an honesty session. Theres a few effort areas that we werent happy with, Ponga said. Three handling mistakes led directly to three Titans tries as the Knights compounded their errors by pouting, pointing fingers and shifting blame. Ponga put that down to frustration but said they all had to be harder on each other to become better teammates and a more resilient team. Losing is never easy, and you do get frustrated. That comes down to being competitive and what-not, but at the end of the day youve got to trust what were doing, he said. We do believe in what were doing  weve just got to do it better and work harder  but its always frustrating losing. I think were probably a bit too nice to each other. Theres a few efforts where your mates probably not doing what hes supposed to be doing and were like, Oh, its alright, but weve got to be more honest and accountable with each other. That will obviously make your mate better, which makes you better and makes the team better, so weve just got to be more honest and keep each other accountable. Though he scored his first try of the season, made three line breaks and ran for a game-high and season-high 234 metres against the Titans, Ponga was still less than satisfied with his own output. In hindsight, reflecting on a line break in the ninth minute when he skipped into the clear, he wished he backed himself in a foot-race against opposite number Michael Gordon instead of kicking for winger Edrick Lee and coming up empty. I dont know why I kicked it, but as soon as I did I knew it was the wrong option, he said. Thats just a learning curve, and I definitely learned from that, so if I put myself in that position again, I probably shouldnt kick it, I should just back myself. Just competing, I want to compete a bit more. Those effort areas, my effort areas on the weekend werent good enough. Obviously I made a couple of breaks and thats all good, but theres a lot of things off the ball I want to work on, so hopefully the boys keep me accountable and I can keep myself accountable as well. Ponga said the players can feel the pressure building on themselves, and their coach, and he knows a win against Parramatta at McDonald Jones Stadium on Sunday is the only way to silence their critics. Weve just got to do our best to get a result. Thats the only thing we can do to relieve the pressure, I guess, just go out and work on those things weve identified, he said. Each week weve sort of touched on areas we need to work on, then we go into the next week working on that area but forgetting the rest. What we need to do is put in an 80-minute performance across the board and relieve some of that pressure. If we get a win, the fans will be happy, so we just want to give them that win.

Bernard,Osher,2933,https://news.psu.edu/story/570899/2019/04/24/academics/kirby-overcomes-addiction-graduate-honors,"Lauren Kirby WYOMISSING, Pa.  Lauren Kirby, 32, is a fighter: She has won her battle with opioid addiction and turned her life around. On Saturday, May 4, Kirby will receive her bachelor of arts in communication arts and sciences from Penn State Berks during the colleges commencement ceremony at 10 a.m. She is graduating with the highest grade-point average of any student in the degree program. After graduating from Phoenixville High School, Kirby enrolled in Montgomery County Community College, where she excelled academically, making the Deans List for several semesters. Then she states that she began working nights as a bartender and suffering from undiagnosed bipolar disorder around the same time. She explains that she started to self-medicate when she was 26, the first time she ever used drugs. Kirby received treatment for bipolar disorder and got clean on April 13, 2015, a date that she remembers well. Soon after, she became pregnant with her son. While she was pregnant, she also took custody of her two nieces, ages 4 and 8. She found herself a single mother with three young children. Instead of giving up, Kirby decided to go back to school and earn her degree to provide a better life for herself and her children. She was determined to make up for lost time and completed her remaining credits at Montgomery County Community College in less than a year, graduating Magna Cum Laude with an associate degree in liberal studies, before transferring to Penn State Berks. I always wanted to go to Penn State, explained Kirby. She soon found a home in the communication arts and sciences major. During her time at the college, she had an opportunity to work on a marketing campaign for Penn State Health St. Joseph and she presented her work to the Penn State Board of Trustees during their annual meeting on campus in July 2018. She also completed internships for Reading Greenhouse, a nonprofit educational facility. Kirby was honored with the colleges CAS Academic Achievement Award. She served as president of Lambda Pi Eta, an honor society of the National Communication Association, and a member of Phi Kappa Phi, which recognizes academic excellence in all disciplines. When asked what her plans are after graduation, Kirby stated that she would like to go to graduate school but for now she is job hunting. Her ultimate goal is to earn a masters degree and teach CAS at the college level. Its so important, Kirby stated about the degree program. Ive learned so much since Ive been in the CAS program. Everything I learned can be applied to everyday life. Now, I weigh different perspectives and points-of-view before making a decision. The degree has rewired my brain and made me the person I am today. Kirby also received support through the colleges Fran and Gene Curry Trustee Scholarship and The Bernard Osher Foundation Re-Entry Scholarship for adult learners. 312 Old Main, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802 814-865-7517 The Pennsylvania State University  2019 Link: https://news.psu.edu/story/570899/2019/04/24/academics/kirby-overcomes-addiction-graduate-honors",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1031786,0.9630101568145124,0,2019-05-01 15:42:33,True,Priority Mail

The original, directed by Andrew Davis, was based on the 1960s television series of the same name. It featured Ford as the famed surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, who is sentenced to death after he is wrongly convicted of his wife's murder. The Japanese version, to be directed by Seiji Izumi, will be made into a special program for the country's network TV Asahi. It will be set in present-day Tokyo just before the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, reported Variety. The story will follow Kazuki Kakurai Watanabe, an elite surgeon, whose wife is murdered. Despite Kakurais insistence that a man with a prosthetic hand is the culprit, Kakurai is arrested, tried and sentenced to death. The program will be produced by TV Asahi production chief Kazuhiko Fujimoto.

FlightAware Photo provided by Nolan Law Group Wayne Estopinal Reporter This image shows Wayne Estopinal's plane before winglets were added and before the November 30 crash that killed Estopinal and two others. FlightAware Photo provided by Nolan Law Group LOUISVILLE, Ky. WDRB -- It's been almost five months since a private jet crashed in southern Indiana, killing all three people on board. Wayne Estopinal, a beloved architect, entrepreneur, humanitarian and founder of Louisville City FC, Andrew Davis, who his attorney described as an ""absolutely excellent"" pilot with ""extraordinary"" experience, and Sandra Johnson, a marketing executive who worked at Estopinal's architecture firm all died shortly after leaving a Clark County, Ind., airport. Federal investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board are still trying to figure out what caused the crash, but Tom Ellis, whose Chicago-based law firm is investigating the crash for Estopinal's estate along with Louisville-based law firm Lynch, Cox, Gilman & Goodman, believes a clearer picture is starting to emerge. ""I would hate to see any kind of loss of life or injury,"" Ellis said. Estopinal owned a Cessna 525A Citation airplane, but Ellis' issue isn't with the airplane but with what was attached to the wingtips after it was purchased: an upgrade called ""active winglets."" ""A winglet is a piece that fits on the end  a vertical piece,"" said Travis Kircher, a private pilot and WDRB News employee. ""A winglet reduces the drag."" Kircher said winglets are installed to help pilots fly farther with less gas. ""Pilots want to fly fuel-efficient aircraft the same way anyone would want to drive a fuel-efficient car,"" he said. Records sent to WDRB News show Estopinal had Idaho-based Tamarack Aerospace Group install the active winglet system in May 2018. According to Ellis, he was one of the first active winglet customers. Another maintenance record shows the winglet system was repaired on Nov. 20, 2018. When the plane crashed shortly after take-off in Clark County just ten days later, killing Estopinal and the other two on board, Ellis immediately thought of the winglets. ""In our case, we have suspected from the start that these winglets were involved,"" he said. Ellis said his theory gained new evidence just days ago. On April 19, the European Union's version of the FAA, known as the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, sent out an emergency airworthiness directive about the active winglet system, writing ""occurrences have been reported in which ""they appear to have malfunctioned,"" causing situations where some pilots ""had difficulty"" recovering planes ""to safe flight."" The order requires pilots in Europe to deactivate those winglets until further notice. ""The U.S. FAA should do the same so that there are not aircrafts still flying with these winglets active,"" Ellis said. ""Not only is it a danger to those who are flying and aboard the aircraft, it would be fortuitous as to where one of these aircraft came down."" Wayne Estopinal A spokesman for Tamarack Aerospace said he couldn't comment on the directive or Ellis' allegation but said he's referred the issue to the company's president, Brian Cox. Additionally, WDRB News reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration for comment but hasn't yet heard back. Attorneys for the other two people killed in the crash also hope the FAA will take action and ask more questions about the winglets in question. Joseph Slama, the attorney for Davis, said he's in total agreement with Ellis' concerns and said there's ""ample evidence"" the winglets played a part in the crash. David Katzman, the attorney for Johnson, said he'd be surprised if the FAA doesn't follow the European Union's lead in requiring deactivation of the Tamarack winglets. The FAA released a statement Friday on EASA's decision: ""The FAA is aware of EASAs action and currently is evaluating whether safety actions may be necessary.""

Bernard,Osher,2946,http://www.chicoer.com/2635003,"GET BREAKING NEWS IN YOUR BROWSER. CLICK HERE TO TURN ON NOTIFICATIONS. X Trending: As people age, they may become forgetful and find they arent as mentally sharp as they used to be. Dont simply allow time to take its toll on your mind, advises psychologist Harry Keshet. He recommends taking action with exercises to train your brain and help keep it vital. New discoveries in brain science show this to be quite possible, he said. Keshet will talk about the subject at a free workshop from 3 to 4:30 p.m. Monday, April 29, in Chico. The workshop, The Brain: Emotional Style and Spiritual Health, will be at The Social Chico formerly Craig Student Living, located at 1400 W. Third St. The event is sponsored by Osher Lifelong Learning Institute OLLI at Chico State. The program offers a variety of classes for people 50 years old and older. Training the brain is among the topics Keshet plans to cover at the workshop. One good method of training is mindfulness meditation, he said. By meditating for 10 minutes twice a day, meaningful changes can be made, he said. These changes can help mitigate the effects of aging on the brain. Traits such as shyness, fearfulness and depression are open to change as well, he said. In the last decade, there has been tremendous change in scientists understanding of the brain, according to Keshet. It used to be thought that human personality and brain functioning were set in stone, he said. Genes were thought to predestine personality, and losses in brain function were believed to be permanent. These beliefs are not entirely groundless, Keshet said. However, the discovery that the brain has plasticity has led to new ways of thinking about the brain. Scientists now know the brain can be trained to change itself, he said. This has revolutionized everything. For example, its now understood that the way we think about things has a great effect, he said. When we think negatively, we create certain pathways in the brain. The more we think negatively, the more those pathways are reinforced. Were creating worlds of danger, depression and anxiety by what we think. The good news is all that is open to change, he added. If you change the way you think, the brain can open up new pathways toward compassion, well-being and generosity. Born in Philadelphia, Keshet attended Temple University and the University of Michigan, where he earned his doctorate in social psychology. He taught at the University of Massachusetts and later opened a clinical practice. Since retiring, he has worked part-time as a consultant. He also has taught classes on Eastern spirituality for OLLI in Chico and in Utah, where he now lives. Keshet said he is giving the workshop partly to help draw attention to OLLI and to hopefully attract new students. Taking OLLI classes can be both fun and good for ones emotional health, he said. OLLI is now in its 30th year at Chico State. The program was begun by a few seniors who wanted to take classes to gain knowledge and enjoy learning. It was originally called Prime Timers. One of the first classes was a memoir-writing course. Since then, OLLI has grown to offer more than 250 classes annually to more than 1,100 older adults in Chico and surrounding areas. The national OLLI program was started by businessman and philanthropist Bernard Osher in 2001. It is known as Ollie, pronounced like the nickname for Oliver. There are OLLI programs at 122 colleges and universities around the nation. The Chico program offers classes in such things as meditation, music, philosophy, current events and drawing. The classes are all taught by volunteers who are 50 or older themselves. Our teachers have a strong passion for their subjects and want to share their interest, said Chico State OLLI program director Ann Nikolai. Keshet exemplifies this volunteer spirit. He has been interested in Eastern religion since he was a young man, and has meditated for many years and made several trips to India to study and meet with religious leaders. He has given OLLI classes on such subjects as Gandhi and the Bhagavad Gita, one of Hinduisms holy books.Related Articles Senior Planner John Muirs impact still felt in parks, nature today  Natural Wonders Senior Planner Senior Planner Senior Planner Harry was always one of our most popular instructors, Nikolai said. His classes were led with compassion. They were more like experiences than lectures, and he had a following of students who are excited about his upcoming workshop. Becoming part of a lifelong learning community is also something Keshet values about OLLI, she said. The program provides a gathering place for lifelong learners to share, explore and learn together. Its an example of the kind of positive change Harry will be talking about on Monday. OLLI offers a four-week Summer Term in June, for which registration opens May 16. A Summer Class Preview will be held from 10 a.m. to noon on May 15 at the Chico Masonic Family Center, 1110 W. East Ave. You dont have to be a member to attend the free preview.

Andrew,Davis,2945,http://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2019-04-26/tiger-woods-hopeful-5th-masters-leads-more-majors,"Tiger Woods celebrates winning the 2019 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club, Sunday, April 14. ANDREW DAVIS TUCKER/FOR THE AUGUSTA CHRONICLE WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  Tiger Woods hopes winning the Masters to end 11 years without a major will be a spark in his renewed pursuit of the record held by Jack Nicklaus. Even so, Woods tells GOLFTV it will take ""special moments"" like his one-shot victory at Augusta National. ""The only thing I can promise you is this, that I will be prepared,"" Woods said in his first extensive comments since leaving Augusta National with a fifth green jacket. ""Now whether or not it all comes together ... because you need to have mind, body and soul come together for those four days. That doesn't always happen,"" Woods said. ""If you think about it, I've been out here what, 23 years or so? It's only come together 15 times."" Woods spoke to Discovery-owned GOLFTV in a 27-minute interview Thursday as part of his endorsement role to provide exclusive content to the global video streaming service. Nicklaus set the gold standard in golf with 18 professional majors. Woods won his 14th major in 2008 in the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines when he was 32, and breaking the record seemed inevitable until a fourth surgery on his left knee, and then four surgeries on his back in a three-year span. ""I always thought it was possible, if I had everything go my way,"" Woods said in the interview. ""It took him an entire career to get to 18, so now that I've had another extension to my career  one that I didn't think I had a couple of years ago  if I do things correctly and everything falls my way, yeah, it's a possibility."" Woods believes his Masters victory  his first major when he was trailing going into the final round  began last summer when he briefly held the lead Sunday at the British Open, and then pushed Brooks Koepka to the end in a runner-up finish at the PGA Championship. ""Those two major championships allowed me to have this one,"" Woods said. ""And hopefully, this one will allow me to have a few more."" He attributed a big part of his Masters victory to a swing key leading up to the week that allowed him to hit draws with his driver. Woods conceded he no longer has the length that allowed him to hit 3-wood off several tees, which he could hit right-to-left more easily. ""I've lost a little bit off my fastball, so I've got to rely on the driver,"" Woods said. ""And so I found something in my game when I start feeling comfortable turning it."" He also gave credit to his caddie, Joe LaCava, for persuading him to arrive at Augusta National on the Sunday afternoon before instead of Monday. Woods said he was working so hard on his game that he wasn't about to play, so instead he took a wedge and a putter for nine holes. ""That nine-hole session on Sunday set the tone for my mind being opened up to see the amount of break,"" Woods said. Woods said he had been thinking about the Masters for six months. Now he faces a quick turnaround  the PGA Championship starts in three weeks at Bethpage Black, where Woods won the U.S. Open in 2002. He last played it in 2012 during the FedEx Cup playoffs, which is when he first complained of a sore back. He says he will lean on experience of past preparations, such as his three straight majors in 2000 that he won in a span of 66 days. For now, he has done very little. Woods compares this Masters to his first one in 1997 because it took time for the magnitude to sink it. ""I haven't got to the point where I'm willing to put in the hours yet and do the dirty stuff to get the body ready, to put in all the hours of hitting golf balls and putting,"" Woods said. ""I'm doing all the visual stuff, but I haven't put in the physical work yet. But it's probably coming this weekend.""

Andrew,Davis,2939,https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/blog/best-practices--content-marketing/2019/andrew-davis-shares-tips-for-mastering-b2b-video-on-linkedin,"Here's what you'll get: In honor of its five-year anniversary, weve revamped our Sophisticated Marketers Guide to bring you even more insights from industry experts and thought leaders. This digital resource is your one-stop shop for comprehensive guidance on getting the most value from LinkedIn, for yourself and your organization. As part of the refresh, we spoke with some of todays top marketers to tap into their viewpoints on how marketers can get the most out of LinkedIn. Up first is keynote speaker, best-selling author, and video marketing specialist Andrew Davis. Andrews career has put him both behind-the-scenes and in front of the camera, including producing for NBCs The Today Show, working for The Muppets, and creating documentary films. His Loyalty Loop series is very popular among the marketing crowd. Given his expertise, we wanted to pick Andrews brain about one of the most impactful types of content on LinkedIn: video. Heres an in-depth look at his perspectives on this format, as well as other ways to deepen your connections with audience members on LinkedIn. The first thing you should do is create an appointment with your audience. Set a time and day, every single week, that you are going to deliver valuable content via video to your LinkedIn audience, and deliver on it religiously. I upload my videos every single Friday morning, and it keeps me on track. It ensures that I actually make a commitment to my audience. That commitment of consistency will deliver the longest and best returns on your investment, in the time it takes to create great video content. The second piece of advice I have for you is to shoot with what youve got. Dont go out and buy a bunch of fancy gear to get started; do it today, with the equipment you have. If you have an iPhone, shoot on your iPhone. Whatever you have in your pocket is the first thing you should start to shoot with, because the truth is, the gear can get in the way. Theres a large and long learning curve for a lot of this stuff, and instead of trying to figure that all out, you just need to start shooting some video. And, three: Take the time to pre-produce. Think about what exactly you are going to say. I use notecards for everything I shoot. I write down the answers to questions, or the plan I have for the video, and then I ensure that I use my notecards to get through the video  because, for some reason, as soon as you hit record, everything intelligent you are about to say leaves your head. Dont fall into that trap. Have some notecards or a script ready, so that you can use it to create your videos efficiently and effectively, and not worry about what youre going to say. Thats my best advice if youre a video marketing newbie. When Im scrolling through my LinkedIn feed, there are a couple of types of content that catch my attention and engage me as an audience member. In fact, there are three. Video is one of the most compelling ways to stop me in a feed of content, especially on LinkedIn  but not just any type of video. I am tired of talking heads. Instead, if youre going to create video content, make sure you show instead of tell. Video is a show me medium, so if youve got something to show, show me! Think about additional shots you can add to your video to make it more compelling. Two: imagery. Great imagery  compelling, intriguing imagery  makes me stop in the LinkedIn feed, and at least read the description and, sometimes, engage in a conversation. Great imagery is really a key piece to getting people to consume your content on any social media platform. And three, and maybe most importantly: questions. If somebody that I follow on LinkedIn has a question, Im always interested in the answers other people give, or the conversation it sparks in the comments, or  maybe more importantly  Im interested in sharing my insight and advice with the people that I care about, and have contacted and connected with on LinkedIn. If I can help, I love to engage when people ask questions. Dont overlook the small, significant power of simply asking a question. Ive tried to create a lot of different content types on LinkedIn to find the right kind of fit for me, my voice, and my audience. Ive tried writing posts, Ive posted images and updates, Ive asked questions of the audience  but for me, the content type thats been most successful is video. Consistently delivered, high-quality video content on a regular basis has been a real success for me. Its led to more business, better business, and better connections with my audience on a more frequent basis. I cant speak for everyone, but I think video is a great way to engage your audience in a meaningful conversation by showing them something, instead of just telling them. Platforms like LinkedIn, or any social media platform, are easily treated as a great customer acquisition or awareness tool by marketers. But I think weve undermined the real opportunity with social media platforms for the customers and clients we already serve. Instead of just thinking about acquiring new customers from a platform like LinkedIn, I think the most significant opportunity to create great customer loyalty  and a real interaction between the customers and clients you already serve  is to actually create a group. Yea, thats right. Create a group and invite your existing customers and clients to participate in conversations that add value to their business and yours, so that you can continue the relationships you have with the customers and clients youve got in a much more meaningful way. That is one of the most underutilized pieces of the puzzle when it comes to marketing on LinkedIn today. Page updates are not meant to be a dumping ground for your press releases. They are not just for new product announcements. Remember, LinkedIn is a wonderful place for you to share the culture of your company. Imagine I get to your Page and I want to understand if your company is a good cultural fit for me as an employee, customer, or even a vendor. Can you give me a feel for what your company is like? Instead of posting these highly contrived videos, or content that is dumped everywhere, try thinking about what it would look like if your Page of updates gave me a good sense of what its like to work at your company, for your company, or with your company. I know LinkedIn is supposed to be a business tool, and, you know  in business, we dont have emotions and we dont laugh  so emotions and humor shouldnt be part of your LinkedIn strategy. No, I dont believe that for a minute. I think that emotion and humor are two of the key pieces to actually building a good rapport with your audience on any social media platform, no matter how stodgy or uptight your business might be. Remember, its a community-driven platform, and there are a lot of people who want to feel something. One of my favorite quotes is by a guy named Dr. Donald Kahn, and he said, Emotion leads to action, while reason leads to conclusions. Emotion leads to action. So, if you want people to act on the content youre creating and the updates youre delivering, you must connect with them emotionally. Empathize with their position and get them to feel something. And when it comes to humor, dont try too hard. Thats the biggest downfall I see companies making on LinkedIn. They are trying too hard to be funny. Social media, Im told, is always about being authentic; creating an authentic connection with your customers and clients, and being authentic on the platform. But theres one main pitfall that I see people making on social media platforms  they come across as overproduced. In the video world, that doesnt feel authentic at all. For example, a lot of companies create Day in the Life videos to give you a good idea of what it would be like to work at, with, or for one of the companies theyre representing. These videos are so overproduced that it doesnt feel authentic. We live in a world where you can ask an employee to video-record their entire day on their phone, and you can cut together an authentic-feeling Day in the Life video. Dont hire a huge production crew to create those videos if you want it to feel authentic. Stop overproducing our content. If a brand wants to launch a series of videos on LinkedIn, what are some things they should consider? If you want to launch a series of videos on LinkedIn, I have three pieces of advice for you, and they all come out of the television business: 1. Make sure your idea has legs. Having legs means the concept could run forever; that there are an infinite number of topics you could tackle that ensure the show doesnt run out of ideas. When you come up with a video concept, write down 25 topics that fit into the video concept, to ensure theres enough content for you to cover over time. The worst thing you can do is realize, three episodes in, that youve got nothing else to talk about; that the show or series you created is finite. Make sure its infinite. 2. Bring some personality to it. Make sure that if you are creating content as a brand, there is a persona attached to the content youre creating. LinkedIn is a social platform. Its a social environment. Its hard to have a relationship with content that doesnt feature a personality that drives the show. I can build a relationship with that person, and then a relationship with the brand. Without a personality, its hard to connect with content on a regular basis, so make sure you have a show host to drive content and build connections on a social media platform. 3. Create a format for every episode. People fall in love with the format of a show before they fall in love with the show itself. Ask yourself: What is the formula for this show? It could start with an intro, introduce a problem, talk about three potential solutions, and close with a tease for next week. Thats a very simple outline, but if you create a format that reliably delivers consistent, high-quality content every week, people will eat it up. Whats something interesting about you thats not on your LinkedIn profile? I was a childhood actor! If I could have my way, Id love to see LinkedIn be the CNBC of business news, information, and insight. I would want to see LinkedIn producing high-quality, business-oriented programming that felt more like a Netflix or Amazon production, designed specifically for business audiences, to give them better insight and advice on how to run their businesses. Im talking deep, half-hour long or hour-long shows that people can binge-watch, and transform their businesses. Thats my dream for LinkedIn. Thank you Andrew for giving us a peek into your mind, and providing some awesome advice and inspiration.

Andrew,Davis,2939,http://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2019-04-25/tiger-woods-says-hell-play-new-pga-tour-event-japan,"Tiger Woods waits to putt on No. 6 during the final round of the Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club, Sunday, April 14, 2019, in Augusta, Georgia. ANDREW DAVIS TUCKER/FOR THE AUGUSTA CHRONICLE Masters champion Tiger Woods is adding to his international travels at the end of this year, announcing Wednesday night that he will compete in Japan for the first time in 13 years at the new Zozo Championship. Woods said on Twitter that he was excited to play the new tournament and described Japan as ""one of my favorite countries."" Im excited to play in the inaugural ZOZO Championship in October, and return to Japan, one of my favorite countries. Its going to be a fun fall. https://t.co/vaFO4DEv1r ""It's going to be a fun fall,"" he said. Woods is U.S. captain for the Presidents Cup that will be held Dec. 12-15 at Royal Melbourne in Australia, giving the 43-year-old Woods at least two trips halfway around the world. The Zozo Championship will be Oct. 24-27 at Accordia Golf Chiba Narashino Country Club, about 50 miles east of Tokyo. It is part of three tournaments that make up the PGA Tour's Asia Swing, following the CJ Cup in South Korea and the HSBC Champions in Shanghai. The Japan tournament, co-sanctioned with the Japan Golf Tour, is a 78-man field with a $9.75 million purse. Woods last played in Japan in 2006 at the Dunlop Phoenix, where he lost in a playoff to Padraig Harrington. Woods won the Dunlop Phoenix the two previous years, beating Ryoken Kawagishi by nine shots in 2004, and beating Kaname Yokoo in a playoff in 2005. He also hit one of his best wedge shots in Japan in the 2001 World Cup, when he hit a pitch into the bank of the green and into the cup for an eagle that got Woods and David Duval into four-team playoff. South Africa wound up winning the World Cup. .video-container  position:relative; padding-bottom:56.25; padding-top:30px; height:0; overflow:hidden;  .video-container iframe, .video-container object, .video-container embed  position:absolute; top:0; left:0; width:100; height:100;  Woods won for the 81st time in his PGA Tour career two weeks ago at the Masters, winning his fifth green jacket and 15th major.

After building a 5-2 lead through three and a half innings of Fridays NCAA Division II Conference Carolinas baseball tournament game, Barton College was shut out the rest of way by University of Mount Olive in a 6-5 loss. The No. 2-seeded Bulldogs 31-19, coming off an 8-7 win Thursday against No. 5 Belmont Abbey, now must face the Crusaders again Saturday afternoon in an elimination game at Ashmore Park of the campus of tournament host and top seed North Greenville University. Mount Olive 29-13, the No. 3 seed, will take on NGU at 11 a.m. with the winner headed to the championship game Sunday and the loser facing the Barton-Belmont Abbey winner in another elimination game Saturday evening at 7. The Bulldogs, who scored three runs in the bottom of the eighth thanks to a Belmont Abbey, got some help early from the Trojans as starting pitcher Caleb Bishop issued back-to-back walks to Juan Martinez and Chase Riker before an errant pickoff throw allowed Martinez to score with two outs. Bishop then hit Trevior Edior with a pitch with the bases loaded to bring in another run. Bartons lead swelled to 4-0 in the third when Gatlin Pate drew a one-out walk off UMO reliever Hunter Britt and Martinez blasted his team-leading eighth home run of the season over the left-field fence. Mount Olives Joe Mason answered with a two-run shot in the bottom of the inning but the Bulldogs came right back on JoJo Allens two-out double in the top of the fourth to score Edior, who had led off the inning with a single. The momentum began to shift, however, in the bottom of the fourth. James Smibert and Blake McLean, a North Johnston High product, opened the frame with consecutive singles off Bulldogs starter Dylan Ward. An error by Allen and a single by Junior Snow brought in a run and ended Wards night. His replacement, Andrew Davis, uncorked a wild pitch that brought in another run and Barton head coach Jim Chester summoned Colby Shimmel, usually a starter, to the mound. Shimmel escaped further damage with a 1-6-3 double play but gave a two-out solo homer by Smibert in the bottom of the fifth to tie the score. Mount Olive scored for the fourth straight inning in the bottom of the sixth when Snows double down the left-field line off Shimmel 5-4 brought in Gunner Tolston, who had singled to open the at-bat. From there Seth Houston and Jake Isbell slammed the door on the Bulldogs as they each threw 2 2/3 scoreless innings. Houston 1-1 picked the win and Isbell notched his second save. Barton got the leadoff batter aboard in each of the fifth and sixth innings but the Trojans turned double plays each time. Isbell entered in the seventh with two runners on and only one out and proceeded to get Brayden Olsen to pop up and struck out Troy Maslowski. Isbell allowed just Pates one-out single in the ninth, walked none and struck out three. The Bulldogs are a win from tying the program record of 32 wins in a season.

Andrew,Davis,2945,https://revengeofthefans.com/2019/04/26/first-trailer-for-russo-bros-produced-thriller-21-bridges-starring-chadwick-boseman-is-out/,"With the highly anticipated release of Avengers: Endgame finally upon us, it would seem that STX Entertainment are hoping to capitalize on the hype and excitement surrounding the superhero epic this weekend by revealing the first trailer for a gritty action-thriller titled 21 Bridges. In terms of scale and genre, this film is obviously worlds apart from a blockbuster event such as Avengers: Endgame, but 21 Bridges happens to be a project with a few notable ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the King of Wakanda himself Chadwick Boseman both starring and producing the thriller, along with Endgames directors Joe and Anthony Russo also onboard as producers. Watch the trailer down below! The trailer focuses on selling audiences on two core elements to 21 Bridges; its main protagonist Andrew Davis played by Boseman and his plan to catch several members of a cop-killing gang by cutting off all means of transportation off Manhattan to the rest of New York City including the titular twenty-one bridges across the island. While I mentioned before that this is something far more minuscule in scale compared to the cosmic forces at play in last years Avengers: Infinity War and the new Endgame, Davis plan for smoking out the cop-killers here definitely feels more grandiose than the average thriller Ive seen about a police officer. As for the character himself, the trailer wastes no time in establishing that Davis is a police officer haunted by his past. As one character aptly states in the trailer, Davis very clearly sees his dad in the face of every cop who dies. Its a line that could signal a couple of different routes for Davis presumable character development in the film and Im intrigued to see which way the film veers to when it hits theaters this summer.

Dairy, meat and forestry exports led the rise, and exports to China were up 52 to $1.5billion in March, StatsNZ data showed yesterday. The market had expected a $131million surplus and the ASB $100million, ASB's senior rural economist Nathan Penny said. ""We expect stronger dairy exports values to lift the underlying trade balance over 2019,"" Mr Penny said. Export values hit a record high for a month, he said. ""Export values were strong across the three main export categories of dairy, meat and forestry. ""Dairy and meat export values both surged 7.4 on top of strong February outurns,"" he said. While total goods exports lifted 19 to $5.7billion last month from March 2018, imports for the same period shrank 3.5 to $4.8billion. StatsNZ international statistics manager Tehseen Islam said: ""Exports to China were the leading contributor to increases in several primary sector commodities including dairy products, beef, lamb, and forestry products."" Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said the ""whopping"" $922million trade surplus was much stronger than market forecasts and well above even Westpac's ""top-of-the-market pick of $400million"". ""Part of the improvement in March was seasonal, with exports usually nearing their peak at this time of year. ""There was a strong lift in volumes for both dairy and meat, along with growth in wood, fruit and oil exports,"" he said. ""This was an exceptionally strong month for exports, and we would expect some reversal in April. ""That said, the sharp rise in dairy export prices in recent auctions, which will more than offset lower volumes, has yet to come through in the trade figures,"" Mr Gordon said. Exports of dairy products led the overall rise in exports, up 22 to $1.4billion, led by milk powder, up $226million from a year earlier, Mr Islam said. The increase was driven by a larger quantity, but unit values also rose, up 6.5 on March 2018. While the value of cheese exports rose $42million, butter exports fell, also by $42million. Other main contributors to the rise in total exports were meat and edible offal, food preparations such as infant formula, forestry products, and fruit, he said. The decline in imports was due to a 20 slide in purchases of petroleum and products to $516million. Vehicles, parts and accessory imports were down 11 at $717million while aircraft and parts imports were down 54 at $71million. - Additional reporting: BusinessDesk.

WCAX On stage now at the Main Street Landing in Burlington is a comedy called ""The Legend of Georgia McBride."" ""We've got some jokes up in here, we have some heart we have some drama, we have everything,"" said Irving Green, one of five actors in the play at the Vermont Stage. The other actors are Larry Connolly, Britt Michael Gordon, Lia-Shea Tillet and Bob Bolyard. The play follows an Elvis impersonator who can no longer bring in the crowds. The club owner replaces his act with a troop of drag queens. During the play you'll see how characters evolve, trying to balance the responsibility of home life and following a dream. Green plays two characters, Jason the landlord, who Green refers to as a ""loveable loser,"" and Rexxy, the ""character that you love to hate but hate to love her all at the same time."" He says you'll come for the laughs and leave with a new appreciation for drag. ""People can really see that drag -- just like any other art form -- takes commitment, takes time, takes energy and it's not a hobby, as Rexxy would say,"" Green said. During the play, Green promises singing, dancing, laughs and fashion. ""If you like comedy, if you like experiences, if you like the drama of it all, you should definitely come and see the show,"" he said. Because of some language in the show, its suggested for people ages 14 and up. The show runs through Sunday afternoon.

Michael,Gordon,2928,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/04/24/new-titans-skipper-roberts-turns-to-tahu-for-guidance/,"TITANS Five-eighth Tyrone Roberts will turn to former Knights mentor Timana Tahu for one last pearl of wisdom before he leads the Gold Coast Titans for the first time in Saturday's clash with the Wests Tigers in Tamworth. The season-ending knee injury suffered by Ryan James stripped coach Garth Brennan of not only a key forward but his team's captain, consulting with head of culture Mal Meninga, chairman Dennis Watt and owners Darryl Kelly and Rebecca Frizelle before informing Roberts of his decision. The 27-year-old shed a tear in his car after he was told he was in contention to take over from James, the likes of Kevin Proctor and Michael Gordon the other senior players considered. A key figure in both of Gold Coast's two recent wins, Roberts captained the Titans in their pre-season trial against the Cowboys but said leading the side in an NRL game was an honour he never expected. ""I'm honoured,"" Roberts said. ""When Garth told me yesterday that I was in contention I had to go and sit in my car and shed a little tear because I was so emotional. ""It's a big part to be responsible for the whole team and to represent my family and everything that's involved. I'm proud and honoured. ""Being a half you have to take control on the field and it felt normal on Sunday against the Knights. Now you think about it when it comes to representing your family and the club and all the players alongside you look up to a player like yourself, it's a big deal. ""I had to take a couple of seconds yesterday just to realise what the club means."" It's a dramatic reversal for a player who just 18 months ago wasn't considered one of the best two halves in the club. Since he has returned he has become something of a sounding board for the young players at the Titans, performing a role that Newcastle legend Timana Tahu filled for him when he came into the Knights' first grade side as a 19-year-old in 2011. ""I had some great leaders at the Knights but having an Aboriginal background I had Timana Tahu to talk to,"" Roberts explained. ""He was a big stepping stone for me to lean on someone and share my opinion. ""Because of the way he represented his country and himself and with Aboriginal and Maori background, that's someone who I leaned on for advice and I still do. I'm sure I'll give him a phone call and ask him for some more advice. ""I had great skippers in Kurt Gidley, Danny Buderus, great leaders in the club. ""I've learnt a lot from the past and hopefully I can share that with the younger generation. ""I want to be approachable as a captain. I want to see the young kids coming through the club who want to ask a strong question be able to come to me. ""That's the role I was doing before and now that I've got the 'c' I don't want that to change."" Round 7 - Round 7 - Saturday 27 Apr Home Team Wests Tigers Away Team Titans Venue: Scully Park Match broadcasters: Prior to 2019 the only game that Titans hooker Mitch Rein had played with Roberts was for Country Origin in 2014 and said that he is a far more vocal player than he was five years ago. ""He does lead with his actions but he also has a lot to say as well,"" Rein told NRL.com. ""I noticed since he's been back here he's older and more mature. I played with him at City-Country a few years ago and he was a bit quieter then. ""He always had the skills but just noticing a huge difference from now to then. At training and video sessions he's always got a lot to say and what he says matters. ""He's leading us around the park at the moment and doing really well the last couple of weeks. ""It's gone to the right guy.""

Andrew,Davis,2973,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/WORLD-Trans-woman-threatened-Ecuador-marriage-bill-equality-coin/65950.html,"Jose Miguel Vivanco, on behalf of Human Rights Watch, presented a amicus brief to the Honorable Constitutional Court of Ecuador in the case 0011-18-CN concerning same-sex marriage, according to a post from the organization. The document suggests that the Ecuadorian court should protect the rights of same-sex couplesas opposed to leaving the decision to recognize same-sex marriage in hands of the legislature. The brief is at https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/04/26/ecuador-amicus-brief-regarding-same-sex-marriage. The Royal Canadian Mint has unveiled its new $1 ""equality coin,"" honoring the progress of civil rights for LGBTI Canadians, Gay Star News noted. Canada Minister of Finance Bill Morneau unveiled the coin via a Facebook Live stream. The unveiling ceremony took place at The 519 Centeran LGBTI facility in the heart of Toronto's gay village. It has been created to mark 50 years since the beginning of the process of decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada. Only 3 million of the coins will be produced. A federal politician in Australia has apologized for linking same-sex marriage with pedophilia, Gay Star News noted. Gurpal Singh, the Liberal Party candidate for the Victorian seat of Scullin, made the controversial comments at a marriage-equality debate in 2017. Australia legalized same-sex marriage in 2017 following a postal vote. More than two dozen LGBTI activists from around the world participated in the Human Rights Campaign's annual Global Innovative Advocacy Summit that took place in D.C., The Washington Blade reported. Activists from Barbados, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Ukraine, Pakistan, Malawi and other countries took part in workshops and attended events that included a reception at Spanish Ambassador to the U.S. Santiago Cabanas Ansorena's official residence. Also, Wanuri Kahiudirector of Rafiki, a Kenyan film about two women who fall in love with each otherspoke with the activists. Prince Harry has offered his encouragement to Mermaids, a charity providing support for trans children, Gay Star News reported. The CEO of Mermaids, Susie Green, told The Telegraph that this move was done as the the Duke believes Mermaids are on the front-line of mental health work in the United Kingdom. However, Mermaids has been caught in the middle of a polarizing debate, as a number of women's-rights activists and several high-profile figures  such as Piers Morgan  have expressed their opposition to trans-rights groups. Brazil's far-right president, the self-declared homophobe Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of inciting hatred toward LGBT people after declaring the South American country should not become a ""gay tourism paradise,"" adding, ""If you want to come here and have sex with a woman, go for your life,"" The Guardian reported. ""This is not a head of statethis is a national disgrace,"" said David Miranda, a leftist congressman and LGBT activist. Miranda said the president's remarks simultaneously endangered members of Brazil's LGBT community by ""putting a target on their backs"" and promoted the sexual exploitation of Brazilian women. Speaking of Bolsonaro, a second company has decided to distance itself from an event honoring him, The New York Daily News noted. Bain & Company, one of the country's largest consulting firms, said it was withdrawing its sponsorship of the 2019 Person of the Year Awards Gala Dinnerdays after The Financial Times did the same. In a statement, Bain said it is ""focused on diversity,"" and it works with several LGBTQ organizations across Brazil. Bangladesh will allow parts of the transgender community to vote under their proper gender identity, PinkNews reported. Officials have introduced hijra as a third gender option on voting forms for the first time. ""From now onward, a third gender individual can be a voter with their own identity, as a hijra,"" said Abdul Baten, the director of national identity registration, according to The Telegraph. The Italian Supreme Court of Cassation has ruled in favor of a gay refugee who was denied asylum in Italy, PinkNews reported. His case will now be referred to another appeals court for a final decision. If they decide that he has a legitimate claim for asylum, he will be allowed to stay in Italy. The man, who is called Bakayoko Aboubakar S, is a Muslim and from the Ivory Coast; he also was married and had two children in his home country. The One Nation Australian senate candidate Steve Dickson has resigned after footage emerged of him groping dancers and making disparaging comments about a woman in a Washington, D.C., strip club, The Guardian reported. Dickson said he was ""deeply remorseful for my disrespectful comments towards women"" and his wife was standing by him. Queensland One Nation candidates previously sparked controversy, after Guardian Australia reported two had come under fire for promoting anti-gay messages and Port Arthur conspiracy theories. Just weeks after Spotify launched in India without securing rights from Warner/Chappell Music Publishing, it is being sued by the country's oldest record label, Saregama, and will remove that company's 120,000-song catalog from its platform within 10 days, Variety reported, citing Inc42 and Music Business Worldwide. The streaming giant had approached the label for a license before its launch in the country, and based on initial negotiations, Saregama allowed Spotify to post its music; however, the two parties were not able to finalize the deal and the label asked Spotify to remove its content from the platform. A model participating in Sao Paulo's Fashion Week died after getting sick and falling on the catwalk, USA Today noted. A statement from organizers said Tales Soares took ill while in a parade of fashion brand Ocksa. A medical team attended to him on the catwalk and Soares was later taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Gay Star News noted that Soares was an LGBTQ-rights advocate. Big Brother Italy host Barbara D'Urso reprimanded one of the housemates for repeatedly using a homophobic slur to refer to a fellow housemate who is openly gay, PinkNews noted. The Big Brother host first showed a clip of housemate Daniele Dal Moro twice using the Italian slur ""checca""  ""sissy""  to refer to his fellow housemate Cristian Imparato behind his back.

The Rabbitohs looked to have this one in the bag, until last week's form reversal from the Broncos. Elsewhere the Cowboys battle the Titans for the title of Queensland's worst team, while the Bulldogs pay old coach Des Hasler a visit. The Sharks and Storm always bring bags of passion for their clashes while the Eels and Dragons at Bankwest Stadium really tops off a great weekend of NRL action. Good luck with your tips.

Sean O'Sullivan Verdict: The Rabbitohs continue to impress, last week overcoming a determined Panthers side in Penrith. The Bronocs finally had some good news last week, thumping the Sharks at home for only their second win of the season. This clash sees the first meeting of coaches Wayne Bennett and Anthony Seibold following their messy club swap. Bennett simply won't let his Rabbitohs fall to Seibold's Broncos.

Jesse Arthars Verdict: There is a lot of pride on the line in this one, with neither team keen to earn the title of Queensland's worst team. Both teams sit on four points from two wins and the loser here could well be in contention for the wooden spoon. The Cowboys were out-enthused last week by the Bulldogs which is a real worry, while the Titans threw away a big lead to lose against the Tigers. I can only think that playing at home will be enough to lift the Cowboys to victory here.

Curtis Scott Verdict: The injury-hit Sharks were well beaten last week by the Broncos, while the Storm were lucky to escape with the points against the Warriors on Anzac Day. These two teams don't like each other and the Sharks will be fired up to win this one at home, but they look to be missing too many quality players and the Storm won't be off their game two weeks in a row.

The Raiders were beaten by the Sea Eagles after leading at half time. This game has been taken to Wagga Wagga where a big crowd is expected. The Panthers are desperate for a win, but the Raiders won't be happy with their performance last week and will be looking for a return to form.

The Dragons were unlucky to lose to the Roosters on Anzac Day. The Bankwest advantage will have to be huge to get the Eels home against the Dragons who appear to be a rung above the Eels in class.

Michael,Gordon,2970,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/04/30/cowboys-v-titans-round-8-preview/,"MATCH PREVIEW The Cowboys started well in last week's road meeting with the Bulldogs and were in control for most of the first half before being out-played over the final 50 minutes. Coach Paul Green reacted by saying his team's low standing on the NRL ladder would cost players Origin jerseys and it's hard to disagree. The Cowboys have a strong forward pack but question marks remain over the entire backline, barring Michael Morgan. The Titans were well on the way to a third straight win when they raced to a 14-0 lead over the Tigers last week before falling asleep and being overrun 30-14, failing to score a point after Michael Gordon's 19th-minute penalty goal. Round 8 - Round 8 - Friday 3 May Home Team Cowboys 15th Position Away Team Titans 13th Position Venue: 1300SMILES Stadium Match broadcasters: Cowboys: The club revealed on Tuesday evening that Te Maire Martin was suffering from a bleed on the brain and would be sent to a neurologist. His place at fullback is taken by Jordan Kahu. Tom Opacic has been called in to first grade to start in the centres. Jason Taumalolo has again been named as a reserve as he nears a return from a knee injury but coach Paul Green said he won't take any risks on rushing his star forward back. Titans: Several changes for coach Garth Brennan, with Jarrod Wallace back from suspension and Moeaki Fotuaika dropping to the bench. Phil Sami is the new starting winger in place of injured Dale Copley quad, while AJ Brimson returns to the bench. Jai Whitbread and Jack Stockwell have been relegated to the reserves. Round 8 - Round 8 - Friday 3 May Home Team Cowboys Away Team Titans Venue:1300SMILES Stadium 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Morgan should have an edge in his duel with Tyrone Roberts but it certainly won't guarantee a win. Roberts has more help around him in the backs than Morgan and needs to spread the ball quickly to the likes of Brian Kelly, Tyrone Peachey and Anthony Don. Morgan will be counting on rookie Jake Clifford to share some of the load. As mentioned the backs have to step up and take greater responsibility or the Cowboys' season will soon be kaput. Morgan can't do it by himself, while the forwards also have to live up to their reputation as one of the toughest packs around. The Cowboys need to make more line breaks than the solitary break they made against the Bulldogs. They have to put last week's collapse in the rear view mirror and set an aggressive tone in the opening 10 minutes on Friday. Ash Taylor and Tyrone Roberts need to spearhead the offence, while the Titans must work hard as a team to improve their standing as one of the competition's worst defensive teams. What is going on the with the Cowboys? Paul Green made a comment last week saying his players were playing their way out of Origin contention. I think the coach needs to coach them back into Origin form. To me that doesnt look like a were all in this together attitude. The Titans led so well last week and then got blown off the park. Can the Titans bounce back? Titans by 6 The Cowboys completed at a very tidy 82 in the 24-12 loss to the Dogs. The only problem was the Doggies completed 86. Josh McGuire made 70 post contact metres to take his tally to 452 for the season - tops in the NRL. Morgan has kicked an NRL-leading three 40/20 kicks. Good as he is, Michael Morgan was facing the prospect of being named on the bench for the Maroons in this year's Origin series. Cameron Munster appears locked in for the No.6 jersey and Daly Cherry-Evans was the popular pick for the halfback and captaincy role. But with DCE racing the clock after injuring his ankle, Morgan now seems certain to start alongside Munster in the halves for game one on June 5 at Suncorp Stadium.

Under current law, teachers and other public employees can rally and protest -- but they are not allowed to go on strike. LD 900, sponsored by Rep. Michael Sylvester D-Portland, would give teachers and many other public workers the ability to strike if they could not reach agreement on new contracts. The bill would exclude people employed in the safety realm of public work, like police, firefighters, and corrections workers. RELATED: Teachers in Maine push for the right to strike The opinions about the bill are, however, largely divided. ""The reality is, I don't know if there would be anyone who would actually do it -- but at least the opportunity's there. If things get so bad, they have some other avenue to pursue,"" said Senate President Troy Jackson D-Allagash. ""As it is now, administrations can say, 'This is what we're going to give you,' and that's it."" ""It would be just so disruptive to have the University of Maine system, the community college systems shut down by strikes,"" said Stacey Guerin R-Glemburn. ""They're there to serve the public. On average, the public sector employees make seven thousand dollars a year more than private sector, so I think they're doing pretty well in their negotiating."" The bill is likely to follow a party line battle in the House and Senate. There is no word yet when the bill is up for debate. Gov. Janet Mills' office says she has not yet taken a position on the issue.

Michael,Gordon,2928,https://www.standard.net.au/story/6087503/origins-of-the-iconic-slouch-hat/%3Fcs%3D7,"Few things symbolise the Australian military and the Digger spirit quite as well as the iconic slouch hat. The Army refers to the hat as a khaki fur felt, but slouch hat became the popular phrase for the iconic headwear due to the sloped brim of the hat. Its become synonymous with the infallible pride soldiers abroad have for their home soil, but its history dates back almost 150 years. The khaki hat first became part of an Australian military uniform in 1885, when it was chosen for the newly-formed Victorian Mounted Rifles by the commanding officer, Colonel Tom Price. His son later said Colonel Price had been inspired by similar hats worn by Burmese Police in the late 1800s. The original versions were looped up on the right side of the hat, but most states except Tasmania and Victoria had adopted a loop on the left side by 1890. It was in South Africa that the slouch hat first became recognised as part of the Australian military garb during the Boer War. Then, Army historians said in 1903 it was made standard for the Australian army uniform and the loop was largely standardised to the left side. The iconic perched bream of the hat served a purpose, too, it was designed to provide good protection for the wearer without interfering with orders to show or shoulder their rifles. The slouch hat is also adorned with a three-plait puggaree an adaptation of Indian headwraps designed to provide insulation for hot climates. During World War I it was a plain khaki cloth, which was later replaced with coloured woolen bands that denoted the arm or service after 1930. World War I was also where the rising sun badge was added to the sides of the hat. The current hats feature a seven-plait pale-khaki puggaree denoting a plait for each state and territory of Australia. Using information from Australian Army.

Click here to see your options Start slideshow The Middletown varsity baseball team extended its winning streak to six straight following a pair of home victories last week. On Tuesday, April 16, the Blue Raiders claimed a 7-3 win over an improved Milton Hershey squad in a Mid-Penn Conference Capital Division contest. On Thursday, the Raiders prevailed in a 10-8 decision over Susquehanna Township in a Mid-Penn crossover game. The team stands at 6-3 as the seasons first half ended. The Raiders were scheduled to face Northern York and East Pennsboro, the top two teams in the Capital Division, this week, along with Boiling Springs on Friday. Northern and East Penn both beat the Raiders in the beginning of the season. The game at Boiling Springs was rescheduled from March 22. They are No. 9 in the PIAA District III Class 4A power rankings. The top 10 make the postseason. Middletown 7, Milton Hershey 3 Historically, Milton Hershey has struggled in baseball, and the Spartans woes continued in 2019, having won just one game prior to their visit to Middletown. But they did show some improvement and got off to a good start with a 2-0 lead in the top of the first inning. The runs came following a one-out single by Dominic Williams, an RBI double by Dion Bryant and a fielders choice ground ball by Dakota Class. The Blue Raiders went scoreless in the bottom of the opening inning but picked up their first score in the home half of the second. Ray Truntz and Garrett Miller led off the frame with back-to-back walks and Jaxson Seniors bloop single with one out loaded the bases. Collin Heffner then drew a walk that forced in Truntz for the run. After giving up those two early runs, Miller settled in on the mound in the second and third. The Raiders tied the score at 2 in the bottom of the third on a two-out RBI single by Miller that drove in Williams from third. But Milton Hersheys Ethan Frishko led off the top of the fourth with a triple and later scored the go-ahead run on Michael Gordons single to left. In the bottom of the inning, Heffner singled to right, went to second on a throwing error and reached third on a wild pitch by Frishko. With two outs and Scott Ash at the plate, a passed ball allowed Heffner to race home with the tying score. Michael Tuffy took over on the mound to start the fifth inning. After a hit batsman put the first runner on base, he sat down the next three batters to preserve the 3-3 tie. In the bottom of the inning, Williams led off with a single up the middle, went to second on a wild pitch and reached third on a fielders choice by Tim Wagner. Truntzs sacrifice fly knocked in Williams and the home team edged ahead 4-3. A 1-2-3 inning for Tuffy kept the score unchanged in the top of the sixth. In the bottom of the inning, the Blue Raiders plated three runs, which proved to be the difference. Heffner was safe on an error to lead off and was replaced by pinch runner P.J. Sidhu. Tony Powell and Ash both walked to load the bases and Williams greeted new pitcher Rasheed McCrae with a sac fly that drove in Sidhu from third. With two outs, following a force out at home, Truntz punched out a sharp single between third and short, driving in Ash and Williams for the 7-3 lead. Brady Keyser pitched the seventh, giving up a leadoff single before setting down the next three in order for the save. Middletown 10, Susquehanna Township 8 After the visiting Indians grabbed an early 1-0 lead, the Blue Raiders scored 8 runs in the bottom of the first inning and then plated two more in the second to jump out to a 10-1 advantage. As the game progressed, it appeared as if the margin would continue to grow. But the visitors picked up a pair of runs in the fourth and two more in the fifth to cut the lead in half, 10-5. Then the Indians scored 3 runs in the top of the seventh to send this one right down to the final out. A one-out single, coupled with a pair of errors on the play, gave the Indians the early lead at 1-0 before Middletown pitcher Ash prevented further damage. In the home half of the first inning, Susquehanna starter Javier Perez picked up two quick outs before running into major trouble. Wagner walked and Truntz lifted a bloop single to right to put two runners on base. With Miller in the batters box, Truntz stole second, the throw from catcher Ryan Jacobs sailing to the outfield, and Wagner raced home for the tying score. It only got worse for the Indians after that. First Miller drew a base on balls and Peters was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Heffner was also hit by a pitch that forced Truntz in from third, and Justin Yohn was safe on an error that scored Miller. Perezs control problems continued as he also hit Senior to force in another run that made the score 4-1. Lucas Ballistrere took over on the hill for the Indians and was immediately greeted with a bloop single to right field by Ash that knocked in two more runs. Before it was over, the Raiders scored two more times, one coming on an RBI single by Williams and the other coming on another catcher error. The 8-1 lead held up as Ash had a 1-2-3 inning in the top of the second. In the home half, Truntz led off with a single to right, Miller walked on five pitches and Peters singled to load the bases with no outs. A passed ball with Heffner at the plate scored Truntz, and another passed ball with Senior in the box gave the Raiders a 10-1 lead. But the Middletown nine was held scoreless by Ballistrere and the Susquehanna defense the rest of the way. Susquehanna scored two runs in the top of the fourth on two hits and some Blue Raider miscues in the field. The Raiders threatened in the home half, loading the bases with two outs, but could not pick up another run. Another fielding error and a pair of hits led to two more scores for the Indians in the top of the fifth as the visitors cut the lead to 10-5. The Raiders went down in order in the bottom of the inning as the score held. Tuffy relieved Ash with two outs in the top of the sixth and gave up a two out walk before ending the inning. The home team threatened again in the bottom of the sixth following back-to-back singles by Peters and Tuffy and a walk to Yohn that loaded the bags with one out. But all were left stranded. Powell took over on the hill to start the top of the seventh and picked up two quick outs after issuing a leadoff walk. But an infield single by Emmanuel Holley and a walk by Nate Leibig loaded the bases for the Indians. Another base on balls forced in one run and Raider coach Mike Lupia sent Tuffy back to the mound to save the day. But the Raiders got a big scare when Nate Weader ripped a hard liner just inside the left field line for a two-run single that closed the gap to 10-8. Fortunately, Tuffy induced a fly ball to center that ended the threat and locked up the Middletown victory.

Andrew,Davis,2963,https://www.mtv.ca/21-bridges-chadwick-boseman/,"No results found Chadwick Boseman, otherwise known as TChalla in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is making his first appearance in a new movie after blowing us away in Black Panther. Bosemans latest project is 21 Bridges, a new movie from the Russo Brothers yes, the very same responsible for keeping everything so hush-hush surrounding Avengers: Endgame and Boseman himself with a producer credit. The title is a reference to the 21 bridges that connect Manhattan to the rest of the East Coast, and it marks the directorial debut of Brian Kirk. On Avengers: Endgame eve March 25 the trailer for 21 Bridges has arrived, and it looks like nothing less than a gritty thriller thatll keep you on the edge of your seat. From its opening moments, its already foreshadowing some pretty heavy action that we cant wait to see Boseman get down with. They told me you were the guy who kills cop killers, says an unknown bystander of Bosemans character Andrew Davis. The trailer, accompanied by Futures Mask/Off, offers an extended look at Bosemans cop protagonist Davis and how he grew up without a father. Mr. Davis was killed in the line of duty, and as such Davis has grown up with a score to settle with those who dare to kill those serving on the police force.

Michael,Gordon,2962,https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/04/29/559125/rising-wages-not-expected-to-drive-up-consumer-prices,"Become a supportervia PressPatron Economists don't expect much change in the employment picture for the March quarter, with rising wages doing little to push up consumer prices, keeping the prospect of rate cuts alive. Photo: Lynn Grieveson. boardroom Economists don't expect much change in the employment picture for the March quarter, with rising wages doing little to push up consumer prices, keeping the prospect of rate cuts alive. The March quarter unemployment rate was 4.2 percent versus 4.3 percent in the December period, according to the median of economists polled by Bloomberg. The central bank also expects a slight drop to 4.2 percent. Private sector wage inflation - including overtime - is forecast to be 0.5 percent in the three months through March versus 0.5 percent growth in the prior quarter. The data is due Wednesday. The central bank has a dual mandate to support maximum sustainable employment and keep annual CPI inflation between 1 percent and 3 percent over the medium term, with a focus on the mid-point of 2 percent. Annual inflation was 1.5 percent in the March quarter and has been below the mid point since it briefly touched 2.2 percent in March 2017. Meanwhile, the labour cost index is expected to have increased an annual 2 percent in the March quarter, an unchanged annual pace from the December quarter. Average private sector wages rose an annual 3.7 percent to $29.66 an hour in the December quarter. Business confidence surveys show firms have bemoaned the rising cost of wages and difficulty of finding skilled staff for several years. More recently, they've complained about an inability to pass on those costs to consumers, and are bracing for profit margins to get squeezed. Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr cited a slowing local economy and weaker global outlook when he surprised investors at the March review, shifting the central bank from a neutral stance to saying the next likely move was a rate cut. While some economists expect a cut as early as next week, others say August is more likely, in particular given the May 8 monetary policy decision and statement is the first that will be published by a new committee, which includes three external and four internal members. Westpac Bank senior economist Michael Gordon expects the unemployment rate lifted to 4.4 percent. ""That would still leave it close to the RBNZs estimates of the maximum sustainable rate of employment, but the RBNZ would be concerned if it were heading in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""The Q1 labour market prints are expected to rebound from their Q4 'weakness', with elevated labour market utilisation and a historically-low unemployment rate,"" said ASB Bank senior economist Mark Smith. ASB is tipping an unemployment rate of 4.2 percent. ""Our expectation is that the labour market will remain tight over 2019, but that wage growth will fail to fire sufficiently to push medium-term inflation higher,"" he said. ""We expect 50 basis points of cuts over 2019."" ANZ Bank New Zealand economist Michael Callaghan expects the unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in the March quarter and says ""improvement in the near term seems unlikely with GDP growth subdued."" He tips private sector wage inflation to be around 2.1 percent year on year, not including overtime, reflecting previous tightening in the market and minimum wage increases. ""A stable or slightly lower unemployment rate should set the scene for the RBNZ to deliver a downward-sloping OCR track at the May MPS, in line with our expectation for an August rate cut. A higher unemployment rate and subdued wage inflation would add to the risk of a rate cut as soon as May,"" Callaghan said.

Note: ANZAC Round in 2018 was Round 8, this year it was Round 7. Round 7 ratings Note: Ratings figures courtesy of Mediaweek Australia on Twitter, TV Blackbox and TV Tonight. It is indeed wonderful to see how respectful NRL crowds have been across the entire ANZAC Round of matches, with commemorative services included with each match. Having said that, a poll over the weekend open til 8pm Monday night indicates many NRL fans are keen for just the ANZAC Day matches to feature the commemoration rather than all eight games in the round. At the time of publishing, around 70 of respondents indicated they'd prefer only April 25 matches to include these ceremonies.

Bernard,Osher,2959,https://www.journaltribune.com/articles/stateregional/maine-artist-of-the-year-wants-to-create-a-major-arts-festival-in-portland/,"Todays E-Edition   Full Forecast By Ed Pierce  on April 29, 2019 Emily Isaacson, a local musician and conductor, envisions a large-scale music festival for the area. BEN MCCANNA/Portland Press Herald The artistic director of a small Portland classical music festival hopes to turn a $45,000 grant from the Bernard Osher Foundation into a large-scale performing arts festival that takes advantage of Portlands status as a food-friendly and arts-savvy city. In Emily Isaacsons grand vision, Portland would create something akin to Spoleto in Charleston, South Carolina, a sprawling, multi-week festival with music, dance and theater that generates about $42 million in economic activity over a couple of weeks each spring. Portland is a long way from realizing that vision, and there are many people in the arts community who arent sure if it would be a good fit for the city, but Isaacson wants to explore using the fledgling Portland Bach Experience festival, which she founded in 2017 after splitting from another Bach festival, as a proving ground for something much larger. I want it to be the Spoleto of the North. I want to expand and become the festival that draws all different kinds of art and performance from around the country to Portland, she said. Spoleto has been around a long time and contributes tens of millions of dollars to the local economy of Charleston each year. I want to see that kind of financial influx for Portland. When people think of Portland, I want them to think not only about the incredible food and natural beauty, but incredible art as well. Spoleto is the perfect model for that. Spoleto began in Charleston in 1977 as a companion to an arts festival in Spoleto, Italy. In 2016, the festival generated $42 million in economic activity for Charleston, a city with a population of about 110,000 people, and sold more than 61,000 tickets to 160 performances over 17 days, according to the College of Charleston School of Business. It operates with an annual budget of about $7 million. Right now, theres no comparison with Isaacsons modest Portland Bach Experience. She operates her festival on about $150,000, and offers about two dozen events, many of them free, throughout Portland this year, June 13-24. Her audience is about 1,500 people right now. But in five to seven years, I think we can be closer to Spoleto, she said. Were doing something, and its working. Lets take this small scale and make it bigger. Isaacson, 36, wants to build on the momentum of being named the first-ever Maine Artist of the Year by the Maine Arts Commission last fall to begin a community discussion about the arts in Portland and the role of a festival in branding Portlands image as a destination for arts tourism. In addition to her work with the Portland Bach Experience, she also is artistic director of the Oratorio Chorale. A conductor, she grew up in Brunswick and lives in Portland. Isaacsons challenges are immense. Peter Plumb, a longtime and avid supporter of the arts in Maine who has served on and advised the boards of many nonprofit arts organizations, said the topic of a large-scale arts festival has been discussed for more than two decades, and a consensus about whats best for Portland has been elusive. The talks always bog down around size, scope and funding and an underlying question about whether a festival should be local in nature or national or international, in terms of the performers and the audience. If its local in nature, the components for a successful festival already are in place. The calendar is full of events that could be brought under the umbrella and branding of a multidisciplinary arts festival that builds on Portlands reputation as a food destination, he said. Its astounding what we have here now and what we did not have 20 years ago, and how the variety and quality have both gone up dramatically, he said. The issue that drives the whole conversation is making the decision whether you rely on local forces or do you put together an organization that brings in outside talent? The latter becomes a much more expensive proposition. Its also an issue of territory. Arts funding is scarce, and arts organizations often draw from the same pool of donors and ticket buyers. While they may share common visions and goals, they dont always buy into common strategies for achieving them, he said. Caroline Koelker, executive director of Opera Maine, likes the idea of an arts festival because it would highlight what makes Portland distinct. Food, tourism and the arts, she said. For Opera Maine, every chance we get to be a part of something like that and find ways to collaborate with other organizations around the city and state, thats wonderful. When we are looking to do larger projects, we want to align ourselves with other organizations and groups with high artistic standards and organizations with the capacity to take on the support, planning, execution and cross-marketing to make it successful. Dinah Minot, executive director of Creative Portland for the past 2.5 years, called the festival topic sensitive and very volatile. I remember having a meeting during my first year in office about this with different stakeholders, and I felt a lot of resistance from a lot of people, she said. People are territorial, especially in the classical music world. The resistance surprised her at first, but as she listened she heard many people talk about the organizations and events they have built over time and their fear of seeing them harmed by a large festival that may not succeed long term or have local interests at the center of its mission, she said. I love the concept and I love the idea of community engagement, and the more festivals the better. The more music we present, the more people we attract to the region. I am all in favor of all those things conceptually. We just have to work together, she said. Creative Portland is convening an arts and cultural summit on June 18 at Ocean Gateway, and one of the topics is the importance of private investment in the arts and the impact of the arts on the local economy. Minot hopes Creative Portland can help cultivate arts patronage among newcomers to Portland and young professionals. That topic is central to the growth of Isaacsons Portland Bach Experience and her hopes for a larger festival. The Portland Bach Experience includes events geared toward families and young Portland professionals in unconventional spaces, as well as traditional concerts. One will involve musicians performing six of Bachs Cello Suites, all for free, in public locations around town, so audiences can experience the music by chance or follow the performances like a processional. Other concerts will pair pieces of music with local beers and coffee. Isaacson sees the Osher grant as key to realizing her vision. The grant is relatively small  $45,000 over three years  but Isaacson can use it however she wants, and is treating it as an investment in the festival and endorsement from a respected foundation with a history of supporting arts and education on a national scale, as well as in Maine. Bernard Osher is a Biddeford native and Bowdoin College graduate, who made a fortune as founding director of World Savings Bank in California. Isaacson met with Osher and his wife, Barbro, last year in San Francisco, and they urged her to be bold with the money and use it to shape her organizations future. The fact that he is saying, We believe in you, go do what it takes, is enormous. That is what it takes to get us to the next level, Isaacson said. Neither Osher nor his wife, who serves on the foundation board, would talk on the record about the grant. Mary Bitterman, the foundations president, said in a statement the foundation decided to support the Portland Bach Experience because it has become a cultural phenomenon capturing the interest and attention of ever larger and more diverse audiences in Portland and across the state of Maine, and said Isaacsons combination of musical skills, entrepreneurial spirit and executive acumen augurs well for PBEs promising future. Isaacson plans to put the money toward the salary of someone who shares her ideas about the potential of something big, and preferably someone with private-sector business experience. The Portland Bach Experience is a nonprofit arts group, but Isaacson wants to run it like a business. I dont like fundraising, she said. That whole conversation about development and donor relations, thats not a cycle I want to be in for the entirety of my career. Were a nonprofit, but lets pretend were a for-profit.

Michael,Gordon,2936,https://www.idsnews.com/article/2019/04/annual-african-american-choral-ensemble-to-perform-spring-concert-on-saturday,"Independent journalism for more than 150 years The African American Choral Ensemble performs as part of the First Thursdays Festival on Feb.11 at the Fine Arts Plaza. The group will present its annual spring concert at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater. IDS file photo Buy Photos A group of people clad in yellow, red and black robes smile and clap as they enthusiastically sing the lyrics, Open your mouth, say something. This group is the African American Choral Ensemble, who will present its annual spring concert at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Buskirk-Chumley Theater. This is the ensembles 43rd year. We try to sing music that has a message that will inspire them to lead and be a light in the community and make the world better, director of the ensemble Raymond Wise said. The ensemble consists of around 50 IU students, with members coming from different majors and backgrounds. The concert will feature a variety of music genres, including African pieces, spirituals, pop and gospel. Wise said the group chooses music that promotes hope and unity. The music from the African American race is so very very unique in that its the music of America, he said. Its the music of hope, its the music of inspiration, its music that inspires. Wise said this particular concert will be special because it will commemorate the lives of former Dean of Students Michael Gordon, former ensemble director Dr. James Mumford and Crystal Ibe, a student who was in the ensemble, all of who died this semester. Songs and portions of the concert will be dedicated to these three individuals throughout the performance. Despite all of the events this past semester, the concert is a time to rejoice and celebrate, said Hannah Crane, events and communication specialist at the African American Arts Institute. You walk away feeling enriched, uplifted, inspired, she said. In a time when there is a lot of social, political, racial, socio-economic distress and struggles, having the opportunity to bring people together around music, around art and community is so special and so valuable. Crane said much of the concert encourages audience participation, whether it be through clapping along to the songs or through call-and-response singing. Wise will also give brief historical and educational context to each song. Wise said the ensemble gives students an opportunity to promote unity on campus and in their communities. Its the ideal musical style that allows us to share that inclusive, wonderful, diverse message for the university, Wise said.

Michael,Gordon,2962,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/rebounding-unemployment-rate-predicted,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. First-quarter labour data is expected to show some rebound from weakness seen in the previous quarter and reflect a historically low unemployment rate. The low unemployment rate does not bode well for sectors in Otago and Southland, both in manufacturing and the service provider sector, which have been plagued by shortages of unskilled and skilled staff for more than two years. The StatsNZ household labour force survey is due out tomorrow. ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley was picking the unemployment rate would ease back slightly to 4.2 of the labour force; the same expectation of the Reserve Bank. ""Our expectation's that the labour market will remain tight over 2019, but that wage growth will fail to fire sufficiently to push medium-term inflation higher,'' he said in a statement. ""We expect the labour market to remain tight given slower growth in the labour supply,'' he said. He expects the unemployment rate to ""hover'' around 4 by late 2019. Economists don't expect much change in the employment picture for the March quarter, with rising wages doing little to push up consumer prices, keeping the prospect of official cash rate OCR cuts alive, BusinessDesk reported. The March quarter unemployment rate was 4.2 versus 4.3 in the December period, according to the median of economists polled by Bloomberg. Private sector wage inflation, including overtime, is forecast to be 0.5 in the three months through March versus 0.5 growth in the prior quarter. The central bank has a dual mandate to support maximum sustainable employment and keep annual consumer price index CPI inflation between 1 and 3 over the medium term, with a focus on the mid-point of 2. Annual inflation was 1.5 in the March quarter. Meanwhile, the labour cost index is expected to have increased an annual 2 in the March quarter, an unchanged annual pace from the December quarter. Average private sector wages rose an annual 3.7 to $29.66 an hour in the December quarter. Business confidence surveys show firms have bemoaned the rising cost of wages and difficulty of finding skilled staff for several years. More recently, they've complained about an inability to pass on those costs to consumers, and are bracing for profit margins to get squeezed. Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr cited a slowing local economy and weaker global outlook when he surprised investors at the March review, shifting the central bank from a neutral stance to saying the next likely move was a rate cut. While some economists expect a cut as early as next week, others say August is more likely, in particular given the May 8 monetary policy decision and statement is the first that will be published by a new committee, which includes three external and four internal members. Westpac Bank senior economist Michael Gordon expects the unemployment rate will have lifted to 4.4. ""That would still leave it close to the RBNZ's estimates of the maximum sustainable rate of employment, but the RBNZ would be concerned if it were heading in the wrong direction,'' he said. ANZ Bank New Zealand economist Michael Callaghan expected the unemployment rate to be 4.3 in the March quarter and said ""improvement in the near term seems unlikely with GDP growth subdued.'' He tipped private sector wage inflation to be about 2.1 year on year, not including overtime, reflecting previous tightening in the market and minimum wage increases. ""A stable or slightly lower unemployment rate should set the scene for the RBNZ to deliver a downward-sloping OCR track at the May MPS, in line with our expectation for an August rate cut. A higher unemployment rate and subdued wage inflation would add to the risk of a rate cut as soon as May,'' Mr Callaghan said. - Additional reporting BusinessDesk simon.hartley@odt.co.nz Link: https://www.odt.co.nz/business/rebounding-unemployment-rate-predicted",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2019-05-01 15:42:33,True,Priority Mail

Peter,Lunder,2926,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/04/23/pso-receives-500k-for-music-education-from-the-lunder-foundation/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The money will be used to support youth concerts and other programs for kids and families around the state. The Portland Symphony Orchestra has received $500,000 from the Lunder Foundation to support the orchestras musical education programs. With the gift, the orchestra will create an endowed Lunder Maine Music Accessibility Fund that will be used to help pay for the orchestras KinderKonzerts, Youth Concerts, Discovery Concerts, Instrument Petting Zoos and PSO Explorers series, which serve kids across the state. The Portland-based Lunder Foundation is the philanthropic arm of longtime Maine residents Paula and Peter Lunder. In the arts in Maine, the foundation has directed much of its philanthropy toward Colby College and the Colby College Museum of Art, and lately has targeted major arts organizations in Portland. It gave a $3 million challenge grant to Maine College of Art in November. The orchestra will invest the money in its endowment fund, and draw about $20,000 a year from the fund to support the music education programs, said Carolyn Nishon, the orchestras executive director. Its an important piece of a puzzle to make sure we can sustain those programs in the long term, she said. It does not cover all of those programs, but it gives fantastic support for those programs, and it enables us to plan and budget for them. In a statement, the Lunders said, We are pleased to support the continued success of the education programs provided by the Portland Symphony Orchestra, which enrich the lives of many Maine children each year. Nishon said the orchestras educational programs are critical to its long-term success and central to its mission. Our mission is to serve our community by enriching lives through music. We have discovered through being heavily involved in the schools and understanding needs of students and teachers, the symphony is able to do just that, she said. This gift is indicative of how I hope foundations are seeing the PSO as a critical part of the community. Music is not something you do on the side. Music has the power to transform lives.

NEW YORK, April 24, 2019 GLOBE NEWSWIRE -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. Nasdaq: MKTX, the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. ""MarketAxess trading volumes set records across all of our core products in a quarter with rapidly narrowing credit spreads, said Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. Open Trading continued to contribute to our growth as market participants seek to benefit from increased liquidity options and significant transaction cost savings. The trend to automated execution is gaining momentum in fixed income globally, putting MarketAxess in a strong position to capitalize on its technology, global client network and extensive data resources."" First Quarter Results Total revenues for the first quarter of 2019 increased 8.5 to $124.5 million, compared to $114.7 million for the first quarter of 2018. Operating income was $63.2 million, compared to $60.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 5.0. Operating margin was 50.8, compared to 52.5 for the first quarter of 2018. Net income totaled $52.5 million, or $1.39 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $47.9 million, or $1.27 per share, for the first quarter of 2018. Commission revenue for the first quarter of 2019 increased 9.7 to $112.8 million, compared to $102.8 million for the first quarter of 2018. Variable transaction fees increased 11.7 to $89.1 million on total trading volume of $526.2 billion for the first quarter of 2019, compared to variable transaction fees of $79.8 million on total trading volume of $465.0 billion for the first quarter of 2018. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRAs high-grade TRACE trading volume decreased to an estimated 17.6 for the first quarter of 2019, compared to an estimated 18.0 for the first quarter of 2018. All other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services and other revenue, decreased to $11.7 million, compared to $11.9 million for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in all other revenue was principally due to the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar of $0.5 million offset by higher data revenue. Total expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased 12.4 to $61.3 million, compared to $54.5 million for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs, mainly due to an increase in headcount, of $3.8 million, clearing costs of $0.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $0.8 million and professional and consulting fees of $0.8 million. Other income increased to $2.0 million from $0.8 million principally due to a $0.8 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2019 was 19.5, compared to 21.4 for the first quarter of 2018. The income tax provision reflected $3.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the first quarter of 2019 and 2018. Employee headcount was 476 as of March 31, 2019 compared to 429 as of March 31, 2018. Dividend The Companys board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on May 22, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 8, 2019. Share Repurchases A total of 23,365 shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2019 at a cost of $5.2 million. Balance Sheet Data As of March 31, 2019, total assets were $774.8 million and included $483.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted a new lease accounting standard and recorded new operating lease right-of-use assets of $79.5 million, eliminated a deferred rent liability of $11.7 million and recorded lease liabilities associated with the future minimum payments required under operating leases of $91.2 million. Total stockholders equity as of March 31, 2019 was $631.1 million. Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items To supplement the Companys unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding the Company's operating results.

Now let me turn the call over to Rick. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results. This morning we reported strong first quarter results driven by record trading volumes across our core products and record Open Trading activity. Overall, fully electronic trading volume of $526 billion was up 13 compared to Q1 2018. U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield, emerging markets and eurobonds all experienced record volume, and Open Trading also had a record quarter with volume up 66 year-over-year to $134 billion. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share was 17.6. Based on available data for fully electronic institutional corporate bond volumes in the U.S. and Europe in Q1, we believe our leadership position grew substantially year-over-year. This quarter, trading activity outside of U.S. reached record levels with international client volume up 18 to $154 billion. First quarter revenues were a record $124 million, up 9 compared to Q1 2018. Operating income for the quarter was also a record $63 million, and diluted EPS was up 9 to $1.39. In addition to the financial results, we are also pleased to add Nancy Altobello to our Board of Directors. Nancy brings more than 3 decades of global audit and talent management experience to our board from E&Y. In her last role at E&Y, Nancy served as Global Vice Chair of Talent, where she led the firm's global talent initiatives. Slide 4 highlights market conditions. Our record results were achieved this quarter in spite of market conditions that do not typically work in our favor. Unlike the fourth quarter when we set new records for market share, the Q1 environment featured a risk-on sentiment and rapidly narrowing credit spreads. In this kind of market, new issue corporate bond demand runs very high and secondary trading flows moved to buy orders for scarce bonds. It is encouraging to see record MarketAxess volumes and strong growth rates during this period. High-grade new issue levels were very similar to 1 year ago. High-grade TRACE volume rose sharply, we believe due to strong domestic and international demand for U.S. corporate bonds. The treasury yield curve remains flat, leading to slightly shorter years to maturity for bonds traded on the system. Slide 5 highlights Open Trading activity. Open Trading experienced another strong quarter. Adoption continues to accelerate with record volume of $134 billion, up 66 year-over-year while average daily Open Trading volume surged to $2.2 billion. Open Trading represented 26 of our volume in Q1, up from 17 last year. Over 344,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the first quarter, up from 204,000 in Q1 2018. Open Trading liquidity providers, or price makers on the platform, drove approximately 2 million price responses on live orders, nearly doubling the level of activity a year ago. During the quarter, approximately 855 firms provided liquidity through Open Trading. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $51 million in transaction costs through Open Trading on the system, up 59 from the first quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 2.6 basis points in yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. In addition, we estimate that liquidity providers saved an estimated $44 million in the quarter, up 48 year-over-year. Open Trading volume continues to grow across all 4 core products, as dealer and investor clients embrace Open Trading as an important source of liquidity. Slide 6 provides an update on international progress. Our international business experienced another quarter of strong growth. We're especially gratified with results in Europe, where we've had a 32 compound annual growth rate in fully electronic trading volume over the last 3 years and feel confident we are strengthening our competitive position in the region. European client volumes increased by 23 compared to Q1 2018 with eurobond volumes up 32 year-over-year. Emerging market volume was up 10 with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets where we currently operate. We now have over 780 international client firms active on the platform, representing a 33 increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Activity from international clients now represents 29 of all trading volume on the platform. It's worth noting that, in preparation for Brexit, we successfully launched our new EU-based MTF arm and APA-regulated entities this quarter. We believe our continued investment in the talent and technology required to capture the international credit trading opportunity significantly expands the long-term growth potential for our shareholders. Slide 7 demonstrates the benefits of greater automation in credit trading. Growing automation on the MarketAxess trading platform is creating a highly competitive environment, including small micro-lot orders. We are seeing both dealer and investor clients rapidly embrace trading automation tools. The use of dealer algorithms has grown rapidly with approximately 2.2 million algo responses in Q1, a 126 increase year-over-year. U.S. high-grade inquiries increased to 720,000 in the quarter. 17 market-making firms are now providing algo-generated responses versus 13 firms active in the same period last year. In Q1, 83,000 investor trades took place using auto-execution functionality on the platform, up from 7,000 trades in the same period a year ago. This activity was generated by 46 large global asset managers executing trades via auto-execution this quarter. For reference, the number of firms using auto-execution in the same period last year was 14. We believe the cost benefits and trading efficiency will continue to drive investor and dealer clients to higher levels of automation and credit trading, and we will continue our investment in this area. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 8 for summary of our trading volume across product categories. Overall trading volume was up 13, despite the narrowing spread environment that Rick mentioned earlier. U.S. high-grade volumes were up 11 year-over-year to $277 billion for the quarter, driven by the increase in estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes. Our other credit category trading volumes were up 17 year-over-year on advances in estimated market share. Our trading volume gains in emerging markets, U.S. high-yield and European corporate bonds far outpaced estimated changes in market volumes. Eurobond trading was a standout this quarter, posting a 36 increase in trading volume on an estimated 2.6 percentage point increase in market share. April market conditions look similar to the first quarter, but April U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are both tracking down around 8 from Q1 levels. While April month-to-date high-grade market share and overall average daily volume are tracking lower than the first quarter, our overall April ADV is currently more than 20 higher than April 2018. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 9 year-over-year. The 13 increase in trading volume resulted in a 10 uplift in commissions. Information services revenue was up 4 and, on a constant currency basis, up 8. Excluding onetime MiFID II implementation fees recognized in the first quarter of 2018 and foreign currency impact, post-trade services revenue was up slightly year-over-year. Expenses were up 12, and operating income was up 5 year-over-year. EBITDA was up 8 and reached a record $71 million in Q1. The effective tax rate was 19.5 in the first quarter. In Q1, we recognized $3 million in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Our diluted EPS was $1.39 on a stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On Slide 10, we've laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were up 12 year-over-year, as the 13 increase in trading volume was offset by slightly lower overall fee capture. U.S. high-grade fee per million was down slightly from the fourth quarter, as the favorable impact of lower yields was offset by a mix shift in trade-size buckets. Our other credit category fee per million decreased by $12 on a sequential basis solely due to a shift in product mix. There was little change in the fee capture at the individual product level during the quarter. As discussed in the January earnings call, we had 1 dealer migrate from the U.S. high-grade distribution fee plan to the all variable fee plan effective January 1, resulting in a sequential decline in U.S. high-grade distribution fees. Our strong volume growth led to a sequential reduction in unused minimum fees in the other credit category. Slide 11 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were up 5, largely due to higher compensation and benefits cost of $4.9 million, offset by lower marketing and advertising cost of $1.2 million. An increase in employment taxes and benefits reflecting the typical first quarter seasonality, higher variable bonus accrual on improved financial results, an increase in headcount and wage rate and higher stock-based compensation related to senior hire rewards each contributed to the compensation and benefits increase. On a year-over-year basis, expenses were up 12. The increase in compensation and benefits represented almost 60 of the absolute change in expenses. A year-over-year increase in headcount of 47 coupled with higher stock-based compensation expense were the main contributors to the rise in compensation and benefits. The increase in Open Trading activity accounted for the year-over-year uplift in clearing costs. On Slide 12, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of March 31 were $483 million and trailing 12-months free cash flow reached a record $182 million. During the first quarter, we paid out year-end employee bonuses and related taxes of roughly $33 million and a quarterly cash dividend of $19 million. We also repurchased 81,000 shares in total during the quarter, including 23,000 under our share buyback program and 58,000 associated with tax obligation net downs upon vesting of employee stock awards. Our new $100 million share repurchase program went into effect at the beginning of April. Effective January 1, we adopted a new lease accounting standard requiring the recognition of operating lease assets and liability on the balance sheet. Adoption of the new standard did not have an impact on regulatory capital requirements. Based on the first quarter results, our Board has approved a $0.51 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 5 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you, Tony. Our first quarter results demonstrate the resilience and consistency of our growth rates across a variety of market environments. We're encouraged by the ongoing growth in international client activity as well as Open Trading. Dealer and investor investment in trading automation provides evidence of an inflection point for electronic trading in global credit markets. Our growth agenda continues to expand with new initiatives in data, trading and ETFs. Of note recently, we are pleased to partner with Refinitiv for data distribution and with VIRTU for ETF share trading. Now I would be happy to open the line for your questions.  Questions and Answers -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 1 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Instructions And our first question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Edward Campbell, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Lead Analyst 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So the IPO of a competitor of yours obviously brought a lot of attention to the electronic fixed income trading space. I'm just kind of wondering if you could share an updated view on the competitive dynamics in the space right now? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 3 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure, Jeremy. Happy to start with that. And let me start by congratulating Lee and Billy and the entire Tradeweb team on a highly successful IPO. They had a tremendous year in 2018, and it's another sign of the investor demand that exists for quality fixed income electronic trading businesses. So well done to the team there. It does provide further insight on the competitive landscape in institutional credit, and their way of presenting financial information differs from ours, but I do think there are ways to get to pretty good estimates. They provide some apples-to-apples comparisons. And the first one that I would look at, Jeremy, really starts with the revenue section on credit, which last year per Tradeweb was right around $140 million. But it does include all 3 client segments: the retail business, the interdealer voice brokerage business as well as the institutional electronic trading business. And if you think about parsing those 3, the information we have has the retail business at about $78 million, or a little over half of that $140 million. It's hard to know exactly where interdealer voice brokerage is, but we estimate $10 million to $15 million per year is probably a good guess. So that combination gets you to $90 million, and what is left then is about $50 million in annual revenue for global institutional electronic trading. We would attribute about half of that to corporate bonds, or $25 million a year, and the other half to CDS and STP business. And apologies that we don't have the estimates right, but I think that's one way of thinking about it. And what it reflects is what we have known all along, that Tradeweb has a very strong business in institutional rates through the acquisition of BondDesk, now an important business in retail. But the true institutional electronic credit trading business is further down the line and, we believe, represents something around 3 of total company revenue. So that would also demonstrate that the area of overlap is just not that great. Growth rates, very good in both cases, but the area of overlap in institutional corporate bond trading is probably not that great. The other place I would look is really the volume reports that we and Tradeweb both put out every month. And the 3 credit products where we compete with Tradeweb, for institutional electronic business are U.S. high-grade, U.S. high-yield and eurobond credit. And if you look at those 3 for the first quarter and the numbers that Tradeweb has already put out, the fully electronic high-grade business was $478 million ADV or up about $120 million year-over-year. The U.S. high-yield number was roughly flat at about $53 million. But euro credit went the other way. I do believe that their reporting mechanics are different for European credit than they are in the U.S. because we have not been able to find a split between electronic business and STP for euro credit, but the full number was down $280 million year-over-year about 18. We just took an estimate that 40 of that electronic is -- is electronic and about 60 STP. But if you put those 3 together, what I would suggest is that the volume in those 3 credit products for institutional electronic trading was flat year-over-year. And as you know, from our numbers, year-over-year and just those 3 products, our ADV was up $800 million year-over-year. So this is what led to the comment that we are more confident than ever of our competitive position in fully electronic trading in the institutional credit markets. And Jeremy, just one other thing that might provide some clues on the space that I would guide you to is that the retail platforms as well as the interdealer electronic venues and some of the institutional cross-matching systems are all registered and report to TRACE as ATS. And if you look at ATS volume, much of it in the retail space, you will see that, year-over-year, there were good growth rates, which I think is another sign of the demand for U.S. credit in all client segments. But TRACE, as you probably know, also carries a flag on whether the volume is D2D or client-to-dealer trading. And what's interesting about the aggregate ATS volumes that were reported to TRACE in Q1 is, one, it represents 4.4 market share of all of TRACE; and within that, 96 of that volume was reported as D2D and only 4 as client business. So when you think about the other source of competition that has been talked about coming from platforms like Tradeweb retail or TMC or BondPoint or the interdealer venues, the lesson there is that it today is still almost entirely D2D business, and there is very little evidence of institutional clients operating within those ATS venues. There are a few platforms, so Tradeweb Institutional, MarketAxess, Bloomberg, are primarily regulated as broker-dealers today and do not report as ATS, so those volumes are separate from the ATS numbers I just gave you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jeremy Edward Campbell, Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Lead Analyst 4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Just a quick follow-up, I guess, on the auto-execution, auto-response side of the business here. I know you guys mentioned that the number of firms increased both for brokers and the buy side. How do you envision that evolving over the coming year with regards to either greater usage of those already using it already or signing on new brokers or asset managers and maybe the impact you think it might have on your market share? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 5 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's Chris. I'll take that one. So this is an exciting area because really what we hear mostly from our clients, both dealer and the buy side, is how to reduce the friction around their trading day, and much of that is delivered through auto-execution services. So you can certainly have an RFQ market, but how you interact on that RFQ market can be automated to a point where we have clients that are even having a no-touch experience on some of their auto-execution. So I see it as just dramatic upside in our market for not only the growth of our clients -- remember, it's around 46 clients today are using our auto-ex feature. That's out of close to 1,500 clients globally. So we have a long road ahead of auto-execution growth. But what it does is it reduces their daily job of executing orders across a very diverse market of products. So -- and it's one thing where you hear about expense reductions on the buy side, they are reducing -- looking to reduce how much -- how many people they put on their desk to solve the broad number of products that they have to trade. So I would say the demand is high and getting higher, and it's not just from the buy side, it's also from our dealer clients looking to increase their ability to have algos on the platform. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 6 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Henry Repetto, Sandler O'Neill  Partners, L.P., Research Division - Principal of Equity Research 7 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My question is just on the topic we were just on, the automated trading. And Rick, you mentioned that you feel like we're at an inflection point, and I guess what jumped out at me was the number of trades. I was just trying to see how the number of trades was up 11 or 12x year-over-year, but how it -- what was it last quarter? And just further color, and I see Open Trading was much more resilient than we thought it would be, it's still holding at 26. So I guess, more color on this inflection point you think we're reaching in automation? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 8 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, I think Page 7 goes to your first question, Rich. Auto-ex in the fourth quarter, the trade count was around 60,000, so Q1 does represent another big increase sequentially. And these are early days. So these numbers, we think, can go significantly higher because the asset managers are very, very focused on trading efficiency right now. And to the extent that they can fully automate the low impact smaller tickets, it makes a big difference to trading efficiency. And I would point out that what is enabling this to happen is the quality of our real-time data. So you see composite price plus, in particular, is the primary driver in how investors think about their willingness to execute on an automated basis relative to where they would have expected the responses to come back. So it's a combination of the investment we've made in data plus the technology to help them. But our expectation would be based on the conversations we're having with lots of large asset managers as those numbers will be substantially higher in the quarters ahead. And you see the same thing on the dealer side. 3 years ago, we had very little sign of algo trading in credit. And to see over 2 million algo responses in a quarter and 17 firms now making markets with algos, that's an enormous sea change. And we are just so excited about the investment in automation that we see by both dealer and investor clients. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Henry Repetto, Sandler O'Neill  Partners, L.P., Research Division - Principal of Equity Research 9 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. Thanks, Rick, for pointing out the chart that you have right there on Page 7, that helps. Anyway, the follow-up question would be the market share, you comment on market share in April to date, I guess, and be down in 1Q, that would be -- it seems a little surprising, given the March trends as well as what we see in April. And did you talk about -- did you mention duration and pricing? I didn't hear -- I'm not sure whether I caught all that on April. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 10 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so Rich, it's Tony. On April, the one prepared remark we said was that market conditions look similar to the first quarter. And what that means at a more granular level, if you look at the nature of the flow on the platform, it is -- continues to favor the offer wanted side. You know that the hit rates are lower on the offer wanted side versus the bid wanted side. So that trend continues. We continue to see narrowing spreads, which again, a more favorable environment for us would be spread gapping out or more volatility, and new issuance has been fairly healthy in April. The other piece that's coming through in April, which is a continuation of Q1, is that the block percent of U.S. high-grade is up at about 46. So that would be close to the high watermark. So for us, market conditions continue to be not as constructive as what you saw, say, in the first quarter of '18 or the fourth quarter of '18. So it is a continuation of the less constructive conditions you saw in the first quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 11 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Daniel Thomas Fannon, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst 12 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I was hoping you could expand a bit on Slide 6 on the international progress and kind of talk about some of the higher level trends. I'm wondering if MiFID or any regulatory change is also part of the kind of pickup that you saw here in first quarter and really over the last several quarters? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 13 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wouldn't really say that MiFID this time around is driving any trading behavior change with -- changes with clients. That was an impact Q1 or Q2 last year, when MiFID II first went into place. The thing that I would point to is clearly European investors and dealers are now benefiting from the expansion of Open Trading in eurobond and emerging markets. So that differentiator, in terms of our liquidity pool and driving down transaction costs, is clearly one of the main factors that is allowing us to take share from key competitors in Europe. Secondly, we made big investments in protocols. We've done some new things around Open Trading protocol specific to European clients as well as in EM. And then I would reiterate that the third piece that has surprised some market participants is that the quality and breadth of our real-time data for European clients is far greater than what's available through the APAs from MiFID II currently, and that's because the vast majority of corporate bonds are not deemed liquid by the regulators currently, so they don't qualify for real-time reporting. So our investment in CP and Axess All to provide real-time data tools we think is also part of what's driving clients to use MarketAxess more each quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Daniel Thomas Fannon, Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Research Analyst 14 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it, that's helpful. And then, Tony, just a question on expenses. The run rate from the first quarter is tracking towards the low end of guidance. Just any color in terms of how the year is progressing on expenses? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 15 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, Dan. So you're right. If you took the first quarter and you simply multiply it by 4, you're going to get to the low end of the guidance range. But when we think about this year, and we talked about this in the January call, the investments that we're making to expand our addressable market, expand the geographic reach, support new products and protocols, all of that is embedded in the expense guidance. And at this point, when you fast-forward for the rest of the year, there is -- we typically talk about 3 variables, and the one big variable would be about -- around headcount. And right now headcount -- the headcount hiring are on track with our plans. We do have expectations that we're going to grow headcount throughout the balance of the year. So we feel good about the headcount numbers. The other variable typically is around variable compensation. And we had a very good first quarter. And April right now, what we said was April volumes are tracking up 20 over April of last year. We expect to continue to deliver. So the view on the variable compensation is consistent with where we had planned. The other factor in there will be around foreign exchange. We do have GBP 50 million of expenses. So that FX movement could influence expenses up or down. Right now, FX rates are tracking close to budget. So I know -- looking at the consensus estimates, I think everybody as a group are probably more towards the lower half of the range than the middle or upper half of the range. We're still comfortable with the range that we provided. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 16 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kyle Kenneth Voigt, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Associate 17 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just on the ETF platform. Can you just -- or the agreement with VIRTU, can you talk about the demand from your clients for that offering? I suspect it's just adding functionality for credit traders to get access to credit ETF, but I wasn't sure if it was more broad-based than that? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 18 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- It's Chris, Kyle. Yes, it's been -- the demand has been quite high for some time. We've been looking at a variety of different solutions, including building our own solution, but given the economics in ETF share trading and the economics in building new solutions for credit trading, obviously, partnering with someone made a lot of sense. And so RFQ-hub, which is now owned by VIRTU through their acquisition of ITG, was really a great partner, a great offering, provided an RFQ experience, which is similar to the RFQ experience that our clients are currently accustomed to. And the clients have been asking for a real focus on ETF trading, fixed-income ETFs, in particular. And it's really targeted at our clients that are on our platform to remain on our platform, so they can access the ETF market directly through our platform. And it does make their lives much easier, while giving them a very competitive solution with a lot of liquidity. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Kyle Kenneth Voigt, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Associate 19 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then just a follow-up. Just on the eurobond. I know we've spoken a lot about it already. But just the Open Trading there continues to take hold. I think just 2 years ago, it was in a low-single digit range in terms of Open Trading. And attrition in that eurobond business and it's moved substantially higher. And I think it's even grown sequentially from 4Q to 1Q as well. I just -- just wondering if you could provide some commentary around the competitive dynamics, not just between you and Tradeweb, which you've given already, but between you and Bloomberg, who is the larger player there, on the eurobond side. Just wondering how sustainable you believe the competitive maybe market share shift is here in terms of staying ahead of Bloomberg and in terms of protocol technology and Open Trading liquidity pool and if there's anything that they can do from a competitive standpoint to kind of slow the market share shift? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 20 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. I'd be happy to take that one. We're very happy we got out in front on all-to-all trading or Open Trading 5 or 6 years ago. And it's a major investment, as you know, Kyle, and involves lots of work in technology, lots of work in risk management, in the infrastructure, lots of client documentation. And so we do believe that we've got a significant lead in the all-to-all Open Trading space for institutional credit. I'm sure that our competitors are well aware of the progress that we're making in Europe and the growth there. I'm not aware of any plans by Bloomberg to move into all-to-all, which of course would require that they really establish a full-fledged broker-dealer and make all the investments in infrastructure to go there, which we have not seen yet. I would expect that with the new ownership structure, Tradeweb will have more flexibility on determining their own path around all-to-all tradings. So we are expecting that all competitors will continue to invest more, given the success that we are having in the growing demand from both dealers and investors. It's clearly here to stay. You're seeing a total transformation of the market-making model in institutional credit, where ETF shares are very much in the mix, electronic trading is growing, all-to-all is an important source of liquidity, portfolio trading is getting more active. And we're right at the center of that, and we would expect it to continue to grow. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 21 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Rick, I would just add, in Europe, we're seeing a high demand for the auto-execution features. We certainly see many of the dealers providing algos on our platform. So the demand for an electronic execution in the eurobond market is quite high and growing. So I think the overall market, that market share, which is electronic in Europe, is growing to our benefit. We are clearly growing in share, but also growing in converting the market to an electronic solution, and that's some of the benefit that we're feeling in Europe. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator Instructions And our next question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst 23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So maybe a market structure question for you, Rick. In other inaudible classes and I think, in particular, treasuries, we've seen fair bid stream providers like LiquidityEdge really start to make some inroads. Do you think that sort of market solution is a viable solution to corporate bond space or because corporate bond universe is so fragmented and illiquid, it just really wouldn't work? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well, I think a little bit of both. When we really think about live market environments, we believe that the most liquid corporate bonds and especially new issues could move in that direction, and we also see automation really having a huge impact on small tickets. So I think that there are parts of the market that could go that way. The number of bonds that are liquid enough on a regular basis in corporates is a small subset, though. You see somewhere around 30 to 50 bonds that have enough turnover during the day where they could actually operate in a quasi-central limit order book model. So I don't think it's likely to take hold broadly throughout corporates, but there are segments of the market where automation could lead us in that direction. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Patrick Joseph O'Shaughnessy, Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst 25 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got it. And then just curious about industry-wide corporate bond volumes. Most asset classes, volumes were down pretty significantly year-over-year in the first quarter. In corporate bonds, and I think in particular, high-grade were kind of outlier with industry-wide volumes up pretty nicely in the first quarter. Any sense of kind of what is driving that? And I guess, maybe to that point, is growing electronification now starting to have an impact on trading velocity, do you think? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 26 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Very much so because that is our belief and it follows on the comments I just made about the market-making model changing. And look, there's no doubt that corporate bond demand was running extremely high in Q1, not just in the U.S., but internationally. It was all triggered by the rapid shift in central bank policy and the messaging from the Fed and elsewhere about concerns about the economy and slowing down the move toward higher rates. And what that triggered, for one example, Patrick, is the amount of government debt around the world trading at negative yields spiked from around $8 trillion back up to almost $11 trillion, and that triggers a lot of demand for U.S. credit. So that's clearly one of the drivers, but what I really like about what we see is that the amount of corporate bond debt outstanding in the U.S. year-over-year was up about 6, but TRACE volume was up 14. And I think that's exactly to your point, that we're now moving to a new model with investors and dealers embracing new ways of transferring risk, including electronic trading and all-to-all trading that is starting to have a positive impact on overall market turnover. And that could be a very positive thing for our business because those turnover rates have generally been trending lower since the financial crisis. And I do believe now with new entrants in the market combined with greater levels of automation, we may be at the beginning stages of now starting to see those turnover numbers head back higher. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 27 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Hugh Miller with Buckingham. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hugh Michael Miller, The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated - Director 28 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I appreciate the insight you provided on the VIRTU agreement, but I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more sense of the partnership with Refinitiv to redistribute your market data? And I know you guys have great connections with a vast majority of institutional investors, but how do we think about Refinitiv extending your reach and any benefit that we should expect on noncommissioned revenue growth? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 29 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. It's Chris. I'll take that. So we're excited about the Refinitiv data distribution agreement. Refinitiv has been a great partner. We look forward to this partnership going forward and that's really how it's structured. It is a revenue split between us and Refinitiv on future sales of our -- and distribution of our data products. These are our most popular data products: CP, Axess All, that's all available on the Refinitiv platform. They clearly have a unique distribution channel out to both vendors -- other third-party vendors, but obviously many users on their platform, and we're talking about each one of these products is about a $5,000 price tag per month. So very attractive pricing for us and our partner at Refinitiv. And it's really a growth story. So I just really can't help you model it. It's -- as users come on to the platform and select our products and they can select all or several different versions of our product. But we're pretty excited about the partnership and the efforts already. Again, this just launched April 15, which was in our announcement. And Refinitiv is known for their presence in OTC data. So many of the clients that they are already distributing to use them for access to their over-the-counter market data subscription plan. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hugh Michael Miller, The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated - Director 30 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great color there. I appreciate that. And just -- I guess, the follow-up being on, I know you guys had previously indicated the dealer migration that would impact distribution fees from 1Q, just wanted to double check, should we just be assuming kind of distribution fees being relatively unchanged? Or do you see anything kind of line of sight into any dealer migration adjustments, which you consider in the coming quarters? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 31 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure, Hugh. Just taking one step back. If we do give dealers a couple of plans, we give them the choice of a distribution fee plan or a plan that's all variable. And then, in most products, if the dealer is on a variable plan, there is a minimum monthly fee commitment. So just as a reminder. And we're always cautious about giving guidance on distribution fees because we give dealers the choice, so we give them multiple options. And the other point is, the unused minimum fees that can vary period-to-period depending on activity, and you saw that in the first quarter where, in particular, for under our eurobond plan where volumes were up 45 sequentially, you saw the unused minimum fees go down. Great news for us. We would like the unused minimum fees to be 0. To your specific question on what are the expectations going forward, there's some minor changes that we're tracking right now in commitments, but if you look at Q2, where we have more complete visibility, we're expecting Q2 to look a lot like Q1 in the aggregate. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 32 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher Charles Shutler, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst 33 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Can you talk about the move of certain ETF market makers recently going from Open Trading to a disclosed protocol? How do you think about the impact on your business over the long term and, maybe more specifically, does it increase any risk of investors being willing to trade on other venues with that market maker? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 34 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sure. Listen, I think this is great news, right? We -- when you think about what that represents in terms of new liquidity and new entrants in the credit markets to benefit the overall market and investors in particular, that's just a great outcome from Open Trading. We've had a highly sophisticated market maker that was not really able to make markets in credit until Open Trading really took off here, started with anonymous trading and has become so relevant to clients that they made a business decision that they would like to start going to clients as a direct counterparty and trading on a disclosed basis. That's a great outcome for the market around what all-to-all is bringing to overall market liquidity. With respect to our -- our view is that, look, the market makers are going to be where the investor orders are. And we are highly confident, that when it comes to institutional credit trading, we've had a big lead on the investor orders and that lead is growing. And we are working with all of our market makers to make sure that they have the technology and the pricing models that they need to scale and grow their business with us, and we feel very, very good about that position today. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 35 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Rick, I would just add that really this transition reflects 2 important milestones: one is the power of the network that has been built here at MarketAxess. The client network is truly global. It includes international clients, international asset managers of all sizes and the value of that for a market maker to go out and connect to each one individually is near to impossible, and they really need someone to aggregate and connect that client electronically and then the demand for price as well and organize it in such a way that's sufficient for the end client. So I think it's reflective of the network that has been built here over many years. It's also very powerful for the next market maker in Open Trading. We are seeing higher demand from what I'll call new proprietary market makers coming into Open Trading because they see the value and the opportunity that is presented by Open Trading and will further drive the growth of Open Trading with more unique liquidity, not less. So it's a great outcome for really all parties, the new market maker getting access to close to 1,500 clients instantaneously. For us, the power of our network and then, obviously, the liquidity that's now being enhanced in Open Trading as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher Charles Shutler, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst 36 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Okay. And then separately, if we look at the different TRACE buckets, would you mind just giving us kind of the updated market share that you believe that you have in each of those buckets? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 37 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So Chris, you're asking -- I'm assuming you are asking about U.S. high-grade as opposed to asking about a byproduct? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher Charles Shutler, William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division - Research Analyst 38 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, that's right, Tony. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 39 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes, so just one thing, just in terms of a little bit of color. We continue to believe where we do best. And you know what we do best, which is in non-blocks, $5 million and under. First quarter -- even though overall market share was down first quarter, we did post a healthy increase in non-block market share year-over-year. And on the flip side, and this is more reflective of market conditions year-over-year, where we did not perform as well was in block trade. Now if you go back a year ago, and you think about what happened in the marketplace, there was a lot of central bank activity and positioning. There was a tremendous amount of trading in large blocks of short-dated selling programs, where we did very well. And that just -- it did not repeat itself. And that's why market share, there's a lot of factors that go into market share and around-the-market conditions and the type of flow in the market. And it just did not repeat itself. So on the block side -- on the flip side, block trading, block market share was down year-over-year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 40 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alexander Blostein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Lead Capital Markets Analyst 41 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A question around -- another one around Open Trading. So as the platform continues to grow and scale, can you guys just remind us around your thoughts on self-clearing? How much would it cost you guys to go down that route? How big the platform needs to ultimately get to for you to potentially switch? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 42 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alex, great question. We look at the success of Open Trading -- and remember, Open Trading is a global product. So it's across cleared products, across clearing houses. So the solutions depend on the jurisdiction. But growing our efficiency on how we clear, and how we -- more importantly, how we control the client experience is very important to us. So we continue to look at that. We continue to look at ways to have more efficient clearing both in Europe and in the U.S. And the numbers that we're putting up in Open Trading make the economics of self-clearing quite compelling at this point in time. And just -- they will grow over time as Open Trading grows over time. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Alexander Blostein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Lead Capital Markets Analyst 43 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Got you. And then the second question, little more macro related, but so Tony, I heard you just talk obviously about the spreads and kind of how that impact capture rates, but as you think about the yield curve dynamic that we've been in and the forward potential with lower rates, how does that typically impact your guys' market share and capture rates? So maybe just a reminder there would be helpful on a kind of go-forward basis if the curve stays where it is? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Antonio Louis DeLise, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - CFO 44 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Yes. So 2 things there. And you're right to pick on the 2 items, which is market share and capture rates. If we got to an environment where yields are rising here, or we have a flattening of the yield curve, we've seen -- with the flattening of the yield curve, we have seen the years to maturity come in. So that means duration for us is a little bit lower. But when you look over the past 5 quarters now, that's one factor. The past 5 quarters, our U.S. high-grade fee per million has not moved. So there is -- there are other factors that influence it. If the yield curve continues to flatten, you could see some further decline in years to maturity. On the flip side, on the market share piece of it, we do better across all trade sizes. We do better when -- with shorter-dated paper. And if with the rising yield environment or flattening of the yield curve, clients are tending to trade shorter-dated paper, our market share is typically higher. So we -- all things being equal, if yields go up across the curve, you probably see some dampening in our fee per million. Again, lots of things go into that equation, but you probably see market share go up as well. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 45 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And our last question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher John Allen, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - Analyst 46 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Couple of follow-ups. I guess, one just on the international business. I'm just kind of curious, the inaudible for international clients, the basically share gains you're seeing, the volume gains you're seeing, they'd been driven by new clients coming on or increased business from existing clients? And where -- what do you guys think you are, penetration-wise, in terms of the international client base? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 47 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I'm not sure we have the specific numbers on contribution, but it's obviously a little bit of both. We're really pleased with on-boarding more clients not just in Europe, but in Latin America and Asia as well, that are helping us to drive the international numbers to new highs. But as you would expect, Chris, the lion's share of the secondary volume still comes from the largest asset managers and we are definitely turning some of those in our favor that have been active on other platforms in the past and continue to do more on the MarketAxess system and are clearly benefiting from the broader liquidity model that we have. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher R. Concannon, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - President, COO & Director 48 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And Chris, I would just add that some of that growth has been driven by the diversity of liquidity that is on the platform. The EM local markets, you need local dealers, and we've been adding those local dealers to our platform across the international market, and that's key to some of the liquidity that's being accessed by some of the global institutional investors on the platform. So it is important that you just can't have a valuable network with the largest dealers, you have to have a diversity of dealers to grow across all these international products. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Christopher John Allen, Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division - Analyst 49 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And just a quick one just on market data. Refinitiv agreement, how many incremental users does that open your data up to? And then what are the next sort of opportunities for market data moving forward? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 50 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We have the highly specialized institutional client trading base on our platform. But there are lots of interested parties in quality, real-time credit data around the world for other purposes, and that's really the additive distribution that we expect to see from Refinitiv. And one of the conversations that I had with them when we were contemplating this partnership -- their distribution network is massive, right? They have 200,000 or 300,000 data clients, and we're a small fraction of that in terms of the trading community. And they're truly global, and some things like what we're able to offer in EM have broad application around the world in places we just can't reach on our own. So we think this partnership makes great sense for both Refinitiv and for MarketAxess. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 51 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today. I will like to turn the call back to Rick McVey for his final remarks. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Mitchell McVey, MarketAxess Holdings Inc. - Chairman & CEO 52 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you very much for joining us today, and I'd like to celebrate National Admin Day for all of you out there. We couldn't survive without you. So thanks for your dedicated support to all of us and enjoy the rest of your day. We look forward to catching up with everyone next quarter. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Operator 53 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And with that, ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for participating in today's program. This concludes the conference. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day.
