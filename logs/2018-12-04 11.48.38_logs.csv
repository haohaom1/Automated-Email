The company produces bed linens, towels, pool towels, pool chair covers, bath robes, curtains, terry bags, throw blankets and more. He started his business in Fort Lauderdale’s Oakland Park.

The move was strategic so that Patak could be more readily accessible to his numerous clients in the hospitality industry. With a motto not to postpone anything in life, Patak says, “Don’t delay anything, do it now and do it today because tomorrow is never promised.” He added, “No matter how difficult things get, don’t give up on your dreams and remember to keep those dreams realistic.” And this motto is clearly working well for the businessman as he was chosen in May 2018 as one of the Top 20 under 40 Professionals in Miami.

John,O'Neil,896,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/us-crypto-regulatory-fight-has-everything-but-rules-quicktake/2018/05/14/229ed024-576d-11e8-9889-07bcc1327f4b_story.html,"Analysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events A chunk of Washington has been working to figure out what to make of cryptocurrencies. For some, the question is how to regulate the digital assets; for others, it’s how to cash in on them by influencing the debate. Lawyers and lobbyists have reinvented themselves and new trade associations have sprouted up across town. But Congress has been reluctant to pass new rules, financial regulators are still sorting out jurisdiction and the White House has yet to weigh in forcefully. That’s left confusion and legal risks for U.S issuers and investors. Here are some of the key policy questions: 1. What does the government think cryptocurrencies are? It depends which agency you ask. The nation’s main swaps regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has since 2014 defined virtual currencies as commodities and has asserted jurisdiction over their derivatives. Tax authorities consider them property for tax purposes. But all eyes in the crypto world are on the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has said many coins are likely unregistered securities that violate the law, but hasn’t weighed in on specific currencies or introduced a bright-line test. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department says firms must comply with its anti-money laundering rules under the Bank Secrecy Act. 2. What does the crypto industry think of that? Many in industry have complained that the lack of regulatory clarity is stunting innovation, but many are also lobbying against regulations because it could hit their business models. The standard test for whether something is a security is whether investors are pooling money in a common enterprise in the expectation of profits from the work of others. Crypto promoters say that doesn’t fit the realities of digital coins well, but the SEC hasn’t provided a new test for whether tokens are securities or not, and hasn’t so far agreed to industry calls for a “safe harbor.” The regulator also hasn’t blessed any new type of crypto asset. 3. Does that mean Bitcoin is a security? No, the issue is less gray for Bitcoin, the world’s most-traded virtual coin. That’s because unlike many cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin wasn’t initially used to raise money for a specific purpose or company. That, plus it’s relatively dispersed -- global ownership appears to make American regulators comfortable that it isn’t legally a “security.” 4. How is jurisdiction being sorted out? Through a lot of meetings. SEC and CFTC officials are trying to working out these issues, and a Treasury Department-led council of financial regulators has formed a working group. The upshot has been enforcement actions against crypto players alleged to be involved in wrongdoing, a rash of subpoenas to companies seen as operating in the gray area and stern warnings from SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to lawyers and accountants facilitating potentially sketchy deals. With the absence of a national strategy, states have also stepped in, creating another web of rules. 5. What is the crypto industry doing? Lobbying a lot, and doing even more to sell their wares. Firms raised about $12 billion in initial coin offerings through the first quarter of 2018. Many did so by assuring investors they were selling so-called utility tokens that were not technically securities, because they were designed to be used for goods and services once the startup being funded came into operation. Other firms are selling so-called security tokens, which attempt to comply with securities laws, by limiting sales to wealthy investors. Others are selling agreements to buy future tokens, known as SAFTs. 6. What’s at stake? A lot of money. If the SEC were to classify a large cryptocurrency like Ether as a security its price could plunge, costing retail investors who have been piling in since last year. That’s because none of the biggest U.S.-based cryptocurrency trading platforms are registered with the SEC as securities exchanges. Offering only Bitcoin and un-listing other cryptos could hurt the exchanges’ trading revenue and hit those coins’ prices as fewer people will be able to trade them. Stricter rules could also cause this source of funding for startups to dry up in the U.S., and for firms to seek friendlier jurisdictions. 7. How and when is this all likely to get sorted out? It could be a long while. U.S. regulators haven’t set a specific deadline to make a policy determination on cryptocurrencies, so it might be that institutions pushing to trade these assets, for example in ether futures or ETFs, will help clear up their status. Even if U.S. regulators did sort out jurisdictional questions around what is a security, lawsuits would certainly follow. In general, American regulators have taken a less aggressive stance than some nations where trading has been outlawed, LIKE CHINA??, and businesses have been raided. But, without clear rules, it may that for the foreseeable future cryptocurrency policy will be made largely by looking at whom regulators sue for violating long-standing rules.

John,O'Neil,896,http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/05/14/jeff-daniels-trump-end-republican-party/,"“I also think it’s the end of the Republican party,” Daniels says of Trump’s election. “I thought that in the middle of primaries, and then he gets the nomination. And then he wins. What?” “But I think that’s why these guys are hanging on,” the Dumb and Dumber star says of Republican lawmakers in D.C. “Because if they don’t, if they impeach the President, you’ve got to go talk to that 32% base or whatever it is. Tell them why. Because a lot of those guys go back there and those people are going, ‘Don’t you touch my president.’ When do those guys have the guts to turn to their constituents and go, ‘you’ve been conned?’ I’m waiting for that day.” Daniels is promoting his new Hulu series The Looming Tower, a dramatization of events leading up to the September 11, 2001 terror terrorist attacks. Daniel, who portrays the real-life FBI agent John O’Neil in the critically acclaimed drama, says he’s holding out hope that Mueller or “scorned” female voters or Parkland activists will be the “heroes” that help bring President Trump defeat in the upcoming elections. “But I’m hoping the day will come where that kind of behavior is no longer considered acceptable,” the actor laments of Trump. “Something has to happen. An event. And it may be Bob Mueller. And it may be not just obstruction, or collusion, or this thing in the Southern District of New York with the porn star going to the hearing for Trump’s lawyer. Someone has to do something.” Jeff Daniels plays FBI agent John O’Neil in The Looming Tower (Hulu, 2018) “Who are the heroes going to be? Is Orwell just going to be right, and that’s it? That’s the end of the story? Who are the heroes going to be? Is it going to be Chris Wray? Is it going to be Bob Mueller? Is it going to be Rod Rosenstein? Is it going to be McCabe?” Daniels asks. “Is it going to be all those FBI agents, the CIA, who have been insulted for the last year or so that Trump’s been in power? Who’s going to rise up? And, who is it going to be in Congress? Who are the people that are going to be there in November 2018?” “Are the heroes going to be the women that marched the day after the inauguration? Are they going to be there November 18? Hell hath no fury like a country full of women scorned. Be prepared to duck, orange man,” he continued. “And then you’ve got the kids. An event happened. Parkland, Florida happened. Hardly the first. And those kids have mobilized everyone, I would hope, from voting age 18 and above, around the country,” Daniels says of the gun control activists. “After everything they went through, and everything they’re dealing with in the aftermath of that, that they’re able to go on CNN and put sentences together.” “If all those people show up in November 2018, then maybe this kind of way of the world will make a turnaround. I’m hopeful. I still think there are some heroes out there,” the Emmy-winner added. Elsewhere, Daniels, a Michigan native, argues that Trump beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by tapping “into all those white manufacturing males, and [other] men and women.” “I live there. I live in Michigan. I live around all those people whose car jobs went to China and Mexico when the car companies figured out that the union wasn’t the only option; that they could build a plant somewhere else. And they did,” Daniels said. “And you’ve got a lot of angry white people that were working in mixed company; you know, white, black, Hispanic workers that were all on the same line for years. Now all of a sudden, that white guy, that white woman that worked the line is on the blocks. And white people don’t want to be on the blocks. Blacks and Hispanics are supposed to be on the blocks.” Jeff Daniels has spent months rooting for President Trump’s political demise. In March, the actor told Stephen Colbert that he can’t wait for the day law enforcement officials throw President Donald Trump “in the back of a truck and take him away.” Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson EntertainmentDonald TrumpHillary ClintonJeff DanielsRobert MuellerThe Looming Tower .

Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 10:21 am Wasn’t it a beautiful Sunday to celebrate Mother’s Day? I hope every mother was pampered with love and appreciation and many hugs. I sure was. Bob and I, Michael and Judy went to church with Paul and Jodi’s family to rejoice with them at the confirmation service for Hannah. It was a wonderful service of praise and adoration to our Heavenly Father. Following church, Paul, Jodi, Hannah, Claire, and Jace hosted dinner for Werner Pape, Sharen McCarty, Lori, Corey, Ashlyn, Ethan and Karson Henry, Michael and Judy Twombly, Sherman and Mary Smith, Josh and Selena Smith, Jared and Katie Meng, Bob and me. It was a wonderful day with family and friends. Scott was attending the high school graduation of Liz Everly, daughter of his friend, Stephanie Everly. He spoiled me on Saturday with an early Mother’s Day gift and a nice ride in his Camero to KSU for Scotti Ann’s graduation. Busy weekend, but I loved every minute of it. Granddaughter Scotti Ann Twombly graduated cum laude from Kansas State University with an elementary education degree with an emphasis in science. Family and friends attending the graduation were: dad Scott, brothers Seth, Cameron, and Luke; Bob, Julie, and Brock Hanf, Russ and Blair (Hanf) Finn, John and Kelly Twombly, Morgan Johnson, Taylor and Jesse Marriott, Stephanie, Matt, Colter, and Ketcher Peterson, Grampa Jerry Blevins, Mary Jane Smith, Katie Beth Smith, Judy Twombly, Ross, Hannah, and Liam Libel, Shelly Wilmes, and Gramma Kathleen Twombly. Following graduation, we all gathered at The Liquid Art Winery for a light lunch with many hugs, words of happiness and congratulations to Scotti who will be a third-grade teacher at Hiawatha Elementary this fall. Not many people attend baccalaureate services, but the one held at DWest on May 9, was a wonderful service. The guest speaker was Daniel J. Gronniger who graduated from Midway High School in 1971. Gronniger is Attorney for KVC Behavioral HealthCare in Topeka, KS. I wish I had a recording of his message--it was inspiring and meaningful now and in the days to come. Stetson Diveley sang “He” accompanied by sweet lady Leota Elder at the piano. The event was sponsored by the Western Doniphan County Ministerial Alliance with Pastors Jerry Petering, Andrew Davis, Tom Carter, Cynthia Schnaath, and Father Francis Bakyor participating in the program. Fanning Community of Christ served cookies and lemonade. Gloria Simmons Winder and Melinda Simmons are resigning their volunteer positions at Help Your Neighbor West Food Pantry at the end of May. Highland PRIDE invites all to a Retirement Reception for these ladies from 2-4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 22 at the Food Pantry located in the basement of the Senior Center. Please come to thank these two ladies for their many years of service. Refreshments will be served Highland PRIDE and the Highland Cemetery Association invites the community to our Memorial Day program at Doniphan West MS/HS on Monday, May 28, 2018. Refreshments of coffee and donuts will be served beginning at 9 a.m. with the program at 9:30 a.m. The program will conclude at Highland Cemetery with a gun salute and “Taps.” Please join us. Highland PRIDE is preparing for the city-wide garage/bake sale on Saturday, June 16. Those having garage sales may phone Dorothy Diveley at (785) 741-5201 or (785) 442-3718 to have their location placed on the map. The bake sale will be in City Hall from 7 a.m.-noon. A Memorial Service for Roger Ratcliffe will be at 10:30 a.m.. on May 19 at Fanning Community of Christ. Roger is related to the Jeschkes and Twomblys and spent most summers with them because he and his family liked to visit the “farm.” Roger and family lived in Lafayette, Ind. Following interment at Highland Cemetery, lunch will be served by the church. You are welcome to join the family in reminiscing, hugging, and laughing about times gone by. A short week will end the 2017-2018 school year for DWest students. The seniors have taken their senior trip and graduated on Saturday, May 12. The 8th graders last day was Friday the 11th. Their promotion will be Tuesday evening, May 15. So, my week will be pretty easy, I just have the 7th graders and they are a great bunch of kids. But, before you know it, school year 2018-2019 will begin before the students (and some teachers) are ready. I enjoy being in the classroom again. My hours allow me to keep doctors’ appointments, hair appointments, shopping, and napping when needed. I forgot to wish Kelly Blevins Twombly a “Happy Birthday” on the 13th. Birthdays coming up are Kris Whetstine on the 21st, Justin Clark on the 25th, and Abby Bauerle Strathman on the 27th. Birthday blessings to all. “I’ve learned that to ignore the facts does not change the facts and that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will go elsewhere.” Whenever Joey May posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

Michael,Gordon,894,http://www.afr.com/business/michael-gordon-resigns-from-blue-sky-alternative-investments-board-20180513-h100ov,"Hedge fund target Blue Sky Alternative Investments has lost independent director Michael Gordon, who has resigned from the board citing health reasons. Mr Gordon is former Perpetual executive and has been an adviser to boutique fund managers. His exit is effective immediately. ""On behalf of the Blue Sky Board, I would like to thank Michael for his strong contribution and we wish him the best,"" outgoing chairman John Kain said in a statement to the ASX on Monday. Blue Sky has lost independent Michael Gordon from the board. Supplied Blue Sky has been looking to add independent board members ahead of its annual meeting in October after market confidence in the business was shattered by revelations unearthed in a bruising battle with short-sellers. Mr Kain is stepping back as leader of the board upon no longer being recognised as independent. Earlier this month, Blue Sky withdrew its profit and fee-earning funds under management guidance and confessed that it was relying on undrawn loans to meet its claim of having more than $4 billion in fee-earning assets under management. That claim was undermined by US hedge fund Glaucus in March this year when it published a contested short thesis on the stock. Shares of the asset manager have fallen around 80 per cent since then and closed at $2.77 on Friday. Two potential shareholder class actions are being investigated. Several executives have lost board seats or have agreed to leave the board since April as Blue Sky attempts to correct criticisms of its governance structure, including Elaine Stead (head of venture capital), Nicholas Dignam (head of growth capital), Alexander McNab (former chief investment officer) and Tim Wilson (head of private equity). Kim Morison has succeeded Rob Shand as managing director on acting basis. Lachlan McMurdo (investment director for growth capital) left the board of listed investment company Blue Sky Alternatives Access Fund. Blue Sky has also agreed to review the valuation of every asset it manages across property, real asserts, venture capital and private equity. The Australian Financial Review www.afr.com

Michael,Gordon,894,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/u-s-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-european-companies-in-iran-bolton-says,"Advertisement Published May 14, 2018White HouseDow Jones Newswires Former State Department official David Tafuri on President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and Trump's efforts to help protect jobs at Chinese company ZTE. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned Sunday that Washington is prepared to impose sanctions on European companies if their governments don't heed President Donald Trump's demand to stop dealing with Iran. Continue Reading Below ""Europeans are going to face the effective U.S. sanctions,"" Mr. Bolton said on ABC's ""This Week."" Mr. Bolton's comments are the latest salvo in the Trump administration's campaign to put economic pressure on Iran and America's European allies to accept a new agreement that would impose tougher restrictions on the Iran's nuclear activities, constrain its missile program and roll back its support for militant groups. The new agreement would supplant the Iran nuclear accord, which Mr. Trump formally abandoned last week but which the leaders of Britain, France and Germany have vowed to preserve. European officials have said they looking for ways to help their companies escape the brunt of the U.S. sanctions. France's foreign minister said Friday he had asked for exemptions or longer grace periods for the exit of French companies such as oil-and-gas giant Total SA and car maker Peugeot SA that have returned to the Iranian market since the 2015 nuclear accord. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he is planning to approach European diplomats in the next several days to pursue the new deal, which would dispense with the U.S. rationale to sanction European companies. Advertisement But Mr. Pompeo's diplomatic effort faces obstacles. European diplomats have complained that the Trump administration pulled out of the Iran agreement when they were still eager to continue consultations and without explaining Washington's new nuclear demands on Tehran. The Trump administration's demands that Iran abandon its aggressive posture in the Middle East also goes beyond what many European diplomats believe Iran would accept. On Tuesday, the administration urged Iran to stop its support for Hezbollah, the Lebanese group that has joined Iranian forces in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. It also demanded that Iran cease supplying weapons to the Houthi rebels, who have been at war with Tehran's archenemy Saudi Arabia, end cyberattacks against the U.S. and its allies, stop menacing U.S. military ships in the Persian Gulf and abandon its rhetoric about destroying Israel. In the other areas, U.S. and European diplomats have some shared views on how to approach Iran, which could be carried over if there were a new agreement. In recent months, U.S. and European diplomats have agreed on ways to constrain Iran's missile program and discussed how to strengthen inspections of Iran's nuclear program. ""That work is not going to be for nothing,"" a State Department official said. Despite complaints in European capitals, Mr. Bolton suggested that European allies might agree to new U.S. approach once they digest the Mr. Trump's decision and face the threat of sanctions. ""They're really surprised we got out of it, really surprised at the re-imposition of strict sanctions,"" he said in a separate appearance on CNN. """"I think that will sink in and we'll see what happens then."" The recent talks between the U.S. and European diplomats on how to fix the current Iran agreement foundered on the question of how to address the easing beginning in eight years of the nuclear constraints. The U.S. wanted to reimpose sanctions if Iran began to expand its capacity to enrich uranium at that point. European diplomats complained that approach was too rigid and would rewrite the 2015 Iran agreement they had signed. In his television appearance Sunday, Mr. Pompeo also expanded on his comments Friday that the U.S. would help North Korea achieve economic prosperity if it gave up its nuclear arsenal. Such an effort, he said, would involve ""private sector Americans"" who would help North Korea develop its electrical grid, improve its agriculture and develop its infrastructure. No U.S. government money would be provided to North Korea. Mr. Pompeo said that North Korea's announcement that it would close its nuclear site and destroy its tunnels there was ""good news."" ""This is one step along the way,"" he added. --Chris Gordon contributed to this article. Write to Michael R. Gordon at michael.gordon@wsj.com URL Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

The Couse Foundation of Taos has announced that The Lunder Foundation of Portland, Maine is providing a grant of $600,000 in support of the Taos Society of Artists archive and research center that will be located in the Mission Gallery building at 138 Kit Carson Road.The building, according to the announcement, is being acquired by The Couse Foundation later this year.“After the building is rehabilitated and repurposed it will be known as The Lunder Research Center,” the announcement states. ""Additionally, at the request of The Lunder Foundation and with the unanimous support of The Couse Foundation’s board of directors, the main gallery and reception room in The Lunder Research Center will be named in honor of Dean A. Porter. Mr. Porter is the former Director of the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame and is a nationally known scholar and author who has devoted much of his career to scholarship relating to the Taos Society of Artists. Mr. Porter serves as an Advisory Director for The Couse Foundation.”The Lunder Foundation is a philanthropic organization that has provided major support to Colby College in Waterville, Maine, including the Colby College Museum of Art and The Lunder Institute of American Art, among other beneficiaries.“This grant from The Lunder Foundation is by far the largest single gift in the history of The Couse Foundation,” Carl Jones, President of The Couse Foundation, said in a prepared statement. “It is a significant endorsement of our vision and will ensure the realization of our goal to create a research center of national importance at the Couse-Sharp Historic Site.""Peter and Paula Lunder, principals of The Lunder Foundation, have stated, “We are very pleased to be able to support this project, which we feel is an important addition to the resources available for the study and appreciation of American art.”The Lunder Research Center will be the repository for documents and art created, and artifacts collected, by the 12 members of the Taos Society of Artists and scholarly materials relating to the group. These materials include original documents and personal correspondence, photographic prints and negatives, sketchbooks, original works of art, and Native American ethnographic items. The facility will also be home to a research center and library for scholars, students and authors who wish to conduct research relating to the Taos Society of Artists and its individual members.“The Lunder Research Center will be a major enhancement to the campus at the Couse-Sharp Historic Site and will further elevate the reputation of Taos as an artistic community of international importance,"" the announcement reads. In 1915, six American-born, European-trained artists founded the Taos Society of Artists with the mission to promote the authentically American, Native art and culture of the Southwest. The group grew to include 12 active members and several more associate and honorary members.The Couse-Sharp Historic Site reflects the original goals of these artists and continues to promote their mission, according to information about the site. It site includes the home and studio of Eanger Irving Couse, the garden designed by his wife Virginia, the workshops of his son Kibbey, and the two studios of his neighbor and fellow artist, Joseph Henry Sharp. Couse’s studio and darkroom are maintained in a state very close to how he left them upon his death in 1936.The site also brings to light the contributions of the models from Taos Pueblo and other indigenous groups who sat for their paintings, as well as the Native artists whose work was collected and used by both artists. Sharp’s later studio, built in 1915, was completely restored in early 2017 and now contains a permanent rotating exhibition of his artwork, personal effects, and Native art he collected and used in his paintings. His earlier studio, converted from an 1835 chapel, hosts changing exhibitions of artwork and contextual material related to the TSA.All public areas of the site can be toured by appointment, which can be made on its website (couse-sharp.org) or by calling the site office at (575) 751-0369. .

Andrew,Davis,888,https://thefinancetime.com/ghost-of-overcapacity-haunts-china-steel-shares-again/371/,"Published on By The Smarter way to get your business news – Subscribe to BloombergQuint on WhatsApp (Bloomberg) — Expectations of a rebound in steel production in China, along with signs of softening demand, are combining to cast a shadow over the valuation of listed Chinese steel companies. Steel prices in China have weakened this year following a two-year bull run, with Shanghai-traded steel rebar falling 15 percent from a peak in December amid worries of renewed production growth and tepid demand. Shares of most Chinese steelmakers like Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd, Angang Steel Co Ltd and Maanshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd saw a sharp correction in February and March before staging a minor rebound. Reflecting investor caution over the sector’s outlook, price-to-earnings ratios of the shares of Baoshan, Angang and Maanshan are still hovering around one-year lows. “I don’t see a lot of opportunities in steel sector,” said Pan Jiang, chief executive officer of private investment fund Shanghai V-Invest Co. “The supply-side reform has created a lot of positive effect in the last few years but does not look likely to gain much further momentum this year.” Driven by Xi Jinping’s supply-side reform aimed at reducing industrial capacity and tackling emissions, China closed many illegal and polluting plants across the country in the last two years. The move sparked a major rally in prices of commodities from steel to aluminum as well as Hong Kong and mainland-listed shares of Chinese steel mills, which have long been plagued by overcapacity. Major steelmakers like Baoshan, Angang and Maanshan were the main beneficiaries of the reform as they gained more pricing power. Now rising production and falling steel prices have started to weigh on the profits of steelmakers. China’s iron and steel industry, the biggest in the world, posted a slide in its profits for the first quarter. Baoshan and Angang are expected to see a drastic slowdown in their earnings growth this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Maanshan Iron & Steel is likely to post a drop in earnings. “The overall steel demand is falling from last year. We are relatively pessimistic,” said Yang Kunhe, an analyst with Pacific Securities Ltd, adding that China’s real estate and infrastructure spending are now in a downward trend, and that is unlikely to be offset by a recovery in manufacturing. His industry view is largely in line with what Mysteel Research forecast at the end of last year. The consultancy expected the Chinese market to swing to surplus from deficit this year. It said steel production in China is likely to rise while demand would remain flat as a price rally to the highest in nine years prompts a surge in supply. Citigroup is a bit more optimistic, expecting China’s steel demand growth to slightly outpace production increase. According to an April 15 note from the U.S. bank, China’s steel output is expected to rise 1.4 percent to 855 million metric tons this year, while demand will expand 1.5 percent to 752 million metric tons. –With assistance from Charlie Zhu Andrew Davis and Martin Ritchie To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Winnie Zhu in Shanghai at wzhu4@bloomberg.net.

Phillip,Frost,887,http://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article210792409.html,"By Siobhan Morrissey Special to the Miami Herald May 13, 2018 07:00 AM They warned her she would be ruined if she breathed a word about what they had done to her. When she refused their demands and denounced the two old men for attacking her in her own bathroom, she was the one sentenced to death for adultery. While the incident reportedly happened in Babylon in sixth century B.C. and is recorded in the Old Testament Book of Daniel, Baroque painter Sisto Badalocchio’s depiction of events is just as timely today. One need look no further than the rampant allegations of abuse recently reported by women the world over via #MeToo. In Badalocchio’s ""Susannah and the Elders,"" the victim is seen cowering and clutching a sheet to her naked breast while two fully clothed men hover over her. One holds a finger to his mouth in an effort to make her complicit through her silence, while the other appears ready to carry her off. (Spoiler alert: young Daniel witnessed what happened and after he spoke up, Susannah avoided execution. ) For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The painting, which is on loan from Sarasota's John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, is part of the ""Dangerous Women"" exhibition on view through May 20 at the Frost Art Museum. “It’s very timely,” says Frost Museum Director Jordana Pomeroy. “I actually thought of date rape, since we’re on a campus. This whole idea of she seduced me, she wanted it — this is an age-old story between men and women.” Pomeroy says the idea for the exhibition grew out of a desire to bring Old Masters paintings to Miami. “I can’t afford to borrow works from Europe or The Met (in New York),” she said. So, she called The Ringling. Circus impresario and art collector John Ringling, at the time of his death in 1936, had amassed an art collection then worth $20 million – and was believed to have assembled the finest collection in the world of paintings by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens. Fortunately for the Frost, the curator at The Ringling had the germ of an idea for the exhibition and the artwork became available when the museum underwent renovations. The collection – and exhibition – includes sexually suggestive art, where women often are portrayed as the temptress who overpowers men with sexuality, intellect and beauty. “It’s an old story about sometimes uncomfortable relationships between men and women and sexuality and how it’s played a part in stories told about women in the Bible and in classical antiquity,” Pomeroy says. Throughout history, men have claimed to be overwhelmed by women, blaming their own bad behavior on their attraction to women, further victimizing and stigmatizing women in the process. Often, physical beauty is the least compelling component of the relationship, says Pomeroy. “It's not just that she’s beautiful. She’s powerful. She’s manipulative. Her feminine wiles, which might or might not include beauty, (are alluded to in the artwork on display). She’s distracting me. She got me drunk."" It’s no coincidence that all but two of the paintings and prints featured in the exhibitions were created by male artists. The women artists – Fede Galizia of 16th century Italy and Mickalene Thomas, a contemporary American artist – opted to show their female subjects in control. While the other works portray women with alabaster skin as the sole source of dissonance between the sexes, Thomas’s 2010 ""Portrait of Mama Bush I,"" dispels that notion. The painting is a tribute to her mother, Sandra “Mama” Bush, a former fashion model who battled drug addiction and sickle-cell anemia. Thomas presents her mother as a sensual odalisque, lounging provocatively in a chaise, with her breasts exposed and her right hand languorously propping up her head. It is the only woman of color in the show. Galizia, on the other hand, shows how a man can literally lose his head when smitten by a beautiful woman. Her oil painting from 1596 titled ""Judith with the Head of Holofernes,"" recalls how the Assyrian general Holofernes became besotted with Judith. Holofernes needed to work on his seduction technique, however. He was a little drunk when he invited Judith to his tent. Judith and her maidservant seized the opportunity to decapitate him with his own sword. According to the Old Testament, Judith not only avoided a night of sloppy sex, but also liberated her people in the process. Two other versions of the headless Holofernes appear in the show. Francesco Cairo’s oil painting shows Judith looking straight at the viewer while her right hand rests on the sword that is plunged through the general’s throat. Vincenzo Damini has his Judith looking heavenward while holding the head aloft and exposing a neck gushing with blood. John the Baptist’s severed head also makes three appearances in the show. As the Old Testament story goes, Salome bewitched King Herod with her sinuous and seductive dancing. As a reward, the king, who was also her stepfather, granted Salome one wish. She chose John’s head as her prize. In Bartolomeo Coriolano’s 1631 woodcut depiction, Salome and her mother pose behind a platter where the head rests as if it were an exotic entrée. Palma Vecchio puts Salome’s mother, Herodias, in the forefront of his painting and keeps the young dancer in the shadows, portraying John's death as payback for his criticism of Herodias' marriage to King Harod. Guido Reni, on the other hand, puts Salome front and center, with her right hand firmly grasping John’s hair while a page boy offers up the head on a gold platter. American artist Robert Henri erases any pretext as to naivete on the part of Salome. Henri shows Salome with a bare mid-drift and sheer black maxi skirt, in full stride with the arrogance and elegance of youth. A tribute to Richard Strauss’s opera ""Salome,"" which was based on Oscar Wilde’s play and banned after one show, Henri's 1909 painting highlights Salome's sexuality and cruel indifference. Although unable to see the solo performance, Henri invited the star of the show, Mademoiselle Voclezca, to reenact the Dance of the Seven Veils while he painted her portrait in his studio. While ""Dangerous Women"" on the second floor is the headliner exhibit at the Frost, any visitor would be well served to take in the remaining two shows on the first and third floors. ""Outsider Artists from Havana""on the first floor is a delightful show featuring two Cuban artists recognized for their excellence in outsider art: Misleidys Castillo and Jorge Alberto Hernández Cadi. Art critic Roger Cardinal coined the term “outsider art” in 1972 to reflect those works created outside the mainstream art world, typically by untrained individuals. The artists in this instance is akin to an aeolian harp that seemingly channels creativity from a universal source. “With these two artists, they’re actually fairly well-known both in Havana and elsewhere,” Pomeroy says. In fact, Castillo has shown at NADA during Art Basel. “When you look at it, if you didn’t read the text, it looks like a lot of contemporary art. It doesn’t scream ‘outsider’ or self-taught,” Pomeroy says. Castillo is reportedly deaf, mute and autistic. Hernández, who is known as El Buzo – which, depending on the translation, can mean diver, frogman, scavenger or boiler suit – was reportedly diagnosed as bipolar and schizophrenic. Their show, which runs through June 3, was produced in conjunction with the National Art Exhibitions of the Mentally Ill Foundation, the Frost Art Museum and FIU the psychiatry department. Castillo creates cartoonish figural renderings in bright, cheerful colors. They are instantly recognizable in that often depict body-builders in briefs and the artist uses numerous strips of tan tape to hold the images in place. Hernández, on the other hand, meticulously cuts out heads and eyes from black-and-white photographs. He creates curio boxes that include these pasted images on the covers or tucked away inside. Sometimes he stitches thread around these images or draws a companion image, such as a shadow, devil horns or forked tongues. This show will blow you away. Not only is it the artist’s swan song – she died on April 25 in a California nursing home – but also it is a poignant retrospective spanning some three decades. A fifth-generation Chicana, Aguilar also exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Smithsonian Institution and the International Center of Photography. She was 58. Large, lesbian and Latina, Aguilar captured the essence of isolation in her stark black-and-white portraits, both of herself and others in the LGBTQ community. But as with all great art, her images transcend those portrayed and touch on the universal theme of the need to be connected to others in life. This is a show for anyone who has ever felt remotely alienated in this world. At one time or another, that’s just about all of us. ""Laura Aguilar: Show and Tell"" heart-breakingly showcases people who once felt less than worthy because of the color of their skin, their nationality, their body shape or size, their gender, their sexuality. Included in the more than 100 black-and-white photographs produced over three decades is a video in which Aguilar speaks so openly of the psychic pain caused by the simple yearning for human touch. One is reminded of the elderly or shut-ins that no one visits, the refrain from ""Eleanor Rigby"" regarding all the lonely people or Hank Williams warbling ""I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry."" Aguilar was morbidly obese, and one gets the sense that she believed she lost all value as a person in a society obsessed with outer beauty. Worse, she seemed to have internalized that lack of value. And yet, when Aguilar immersed her naked self into nature, her beauty became unmistakable. As she huddled into the fetal position, her body mimicked surrounding desert boulders. She was one with the earth.

Curated by Michael Gordon, an artist and a Fulbright Researcher, the show was inaugurated by Tom Robertson, Executive Director of Fulbright Nepal. Sacred Survival is a collaborative exhibition of seven contemporary Thangka and Pauba artists—Lok Chitrakar, Muna Moktan, Tenzin Norbum, Bhim Thapa, Sonam Dolma Gurung, Tularam Lama and Karma Rinchhen Gurung. The exhibit focuses on promoting Thangka and Paubha paintings by creating an economically-viable environment for the up-and-coming generation of artists and helping preserve the centuries-long values of the intricate paintings techniques. Speaking about the exhibit, Michael Gordon, the curator of the show said, “Sacred Survival examines the practices of seven contemporary Thangka and Paubha painters working and living in the Valley. Their stories reveal the tension between an art market fuelled by mass consumption and an artistic practice striving to maintain its lineage. The craft of Thangka and Paubha painting maintains an unbroken lineage of cultural and spiritual ancestry. For all of them, the paintings are a means of ‘sacred survival, rewriting the terms of authenticity to reflect an ever-changing present,” he added. According to Gordon, the aim of the exhibit is to promote the culture and values of Thangka and Paubha paintings, which are special, and uniquely intricate. He further mentioned that the artists have formed a strong alliance to promote Thangka paintings and wish to combat the exploitations artists suffer from the sales dealers. The exhibit will be on display at the SAG until May 21. @media(max-width: 468px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/margin-left: 5px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat: no-repeat;margin-top: -9px;margin-left: -2px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}}@media(min-width: 478px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;height: 90px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;margin-left: 15px;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 84%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 79%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 105%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 100%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;width: 90%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 97%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}}@media (max-width:768px){.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{margin: 0 auto;display: block;width: 300px;}}function gaEvent(eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel){ga('send','event',eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel);} Published: 13-05-2018 08:32 Click here for your comments Comment via Facebook Don't have facebook account?

Michael,Gordon,882,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/12/brave-gold-coast-titans-beaten-by-solid-melbourne-storm/,"MATCH REPORT The Melbourne Storm were far from their best but the premiers did enough to beat a brave Gold Coast Titans 28-14 in the opening clash of the double-header at Suncorp Stadium on Saturday night. The Titans led 14-8 until the 50th minute and fought to the end despite having no players left on the bench with more than a quarter of the match remaining. Keegan Hipgrave had a suspected broken wrist and he joined Kevin Proctor (groin) and Will Matthews (HIA) on the sideline. Jarrod Wallace also underwent and HIA but was cleared to return. They also lost Jack Stockwell to concussion in the 67th minute after an attempted tackle on Dale Finucane went wrong. Amazingly, Hipgrave returned with his left wrist heavily strapped as the Titans had no one else who could possibly fill the 13th spot on the field. The Storm finished the match with 12 men after prop Christian Welch was sin-binned for a professional foul for holding back Titans debutant Alexander Brimson when a try may have given Gold Coast a chance to pull off a courageous victory. Round 10 - Round 10 - Saturday 12 May Home Team Storm Away Team Titans Venue: Suncorp Stadium Match broadcasters: Melbourne had begun perfectly but were scratchy at times after that. In the third minute, Curtis Scott crossed the line too easily from a shift to the left. Cameron Smith sent a good long ball to Cameron Munster who face-balled Scott into a glaring hole on the Titans' right edge. Smith converted for 6-0. The Titans struck back in the 24th minute when right centre Brenko Lee crossed on debut for the club. The Titans shifted the ball to the right and Josh Addo-Carr knocked down a pass, giving the Titans six again. On the first, the ball again went right and Ash Taylor took it to the line and found Lee who wriggled free of Munster and Scott to force the ball. The Titans took the lead in the 28th minute when Dale Copley capitalised on some good work by Mitch Rein and Taylor to score in his first match back from a hamstring injury. Gordon was again successful with his conversion and the Titans had gone from eight behind to four in front in a matter of five minutes. A penalty goal soon after saw Gold Coast lead 14-8 at the break and the mood of the game had changed on the back of a string of possession to the Titans. The Storm looked out of sorts with their attack, emphasised by Smith throwing a forward pass from dummy half. But in the 50th minute they clicked into gear when Munster, Cam Smith and Joe Stimson combined to put Felise Kaufusi over. Smith converted to level the scores at 14-14. Smith added a penalty goal with 17 minutes remaining and Munster took them further ahead when he scored on the left, stepping Lee who charged off his line but was ineffective in the tackle. Smith converted for 22-14. The Titans refused to wilt and Brimson almost scored on debut in the 72nd minute when he grubbered through and was likely to be the first to the ball but was held back by Welch, who was binned. However, the Titans squandered the next opportunity when they threw the ball left two rucks after the penalty and a pass from Michael Gordon to Anthony Don was ruled forward 20 metres out. Soon after, Addo-Carr sealed the result when he raced 60 metres to score his 12th try of the season, one ahead of Warrior David Fusitu'a at top of the tryscoring list. Smith's conversion made it 28-14 but it was hardly a true reflection of the contest. And the skipper may find himself in bother after his former Melbourne teammate Kevin Proctor left the field with a groin injury in the 57th minute. It appeared a leg pull by Smith may have contributed to the injury as Proctor's body split in two directions. News & Notes: Will Matthews had to wait an extra week but performed well in his 100th NRL match. He was used to having patience; he is in his 11th season in the NRL since making his debut for the Titans in round 16 in 2008 and then having six seasons with the Dragons... The Titans' completion rate of 94 per cent in the first half (16 from 17 sets) was their best phase of ball control this season, far superior to the Storm's 75 per cent...AJ Brimson had a handy debut at No. 6 for the Titans. He is one of 11 players to debut in the Titans' NRL colors this season behind Michael Gordon, Mitch Rein, Jai Arrow, Will Matthews, Bryce Cartwright, Jack Stockwell, Brendan Elliot, Moeaki Fotuaika, Brenko Lee and Leilani Latu.

The FBI says Charlene Sarieann Harriott, 36, was speeding toward the cockpit of Flight 1033 on Jan. 31 before three American attendants ran her down, then used duct tape and zip ties to restrain her ankles and wrists in a first-class seat. Rather than succumb, Harriott became even more aggressive, an FBI affidavit says. She drew blood after biting one attendant on the forearm, punched another, and kicked a third in the leg and stomach. All three required medical attention before leaving Charlotte Douglas International Airport. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. A week later, Harriott took the unusual step of agreeing to her own detention, court documents show. She's been held in the Mecklenburg County Jail ever since. This week, a filing from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Charlotte indicates Harriott will plead guilty to one count of simple assault within the Special Aircraft Jurisdiction of the federal government, a Class A misdemeanor, for ""striking, beating or wounding"" the flight attendants. She faces a maximum penalty of six months to a year in custody.

NRL Saturday started with the Roosters registering a 32-0 win over the Warriors in New Zealand on the back of a try-scoring blitz early in the second half. Cameron Smith came under scrutiny for an awkward tackle on a former teammate as the Storm defeated the Titans at Suncorp Stadium while the Sea Eagles conjured up a drought-breaking win over Brisbane in the final match of the night. 9.30pm Manly breaks ugly streak Happy days.Source:AAP A two-try performance from Jake Trbojevic spearheaded Manly to a 38-24 win over Brisbane that ended their five-game NRL losing streak. Trbojevic crossed twice in the first half to help the Sea Eagles to a four-point lead on Saturday, before they kicked on after halftime with tries to Api Koroisau and Akuila Uate. A magical Anthony Milford try from Kodi Nikorima’s chip kick in the 63rd minute gave the Suncorp Stadium crowd some hope, but Joel Thompson replied with his second four-pointer of the night to seal victory. Jamayne Isaako scored a consolation try but it wasn’t enough as Trbojevic finished with a game-high 180 metres and 19 carries. Brother Tom and halfback Daly Cherry-Evans also starred by playing a hand in five of their six tries. The crucial win lifts the Sea Eagles from equal last to 12th spot on six points alongside Canterbury, North Queensland and Gold Coast, four points adrift of the top eight. It also ended a run of six straight defeats — and 11 of their past 12 — away from Lottoland. However the win may have come at a cost, with young forward Taniela Paseka limping off with a suspected knee injury following an awkward carry early in the second half. Trbojevic drew first blood early in the contest when he latched onto a Cherry-Evans grubber that was fumbled by both Nikorima and Jack Bird in the third minute. The Broncos hit back through soft tries to Andrew McCullough and Sam Thaiday from close range, however, the Sea Eagles responded with two of their own down their left edge. Thompson first powered his way over before Trbojevic again latched onto an offload from his brother, giving the Sea Eagles an 18-14 advantage at the break. The lead would’ve been bigger if not for a courageous try-saving tackle from Broncos rookie Payne Haas just moments after getting his dislocated shoulder popped back in by medical staff. The 38 points is the most Brisbane have conceded through the opening ten rounds of the year. — AAP 7.25pm Titans ‘filthy’ as Smith rejects accusation Cameron Smith may be disciplined for his awkward tackle.Source:AAP A sloppy Melbourne did enough to secure the points against an injury-riddled Gold Coast in a bruising opener to Brisbane’s NRL double header. Melbourne finished 28-14 winners on Saturday evening at Suncorp Stadium, with three second-half tries saving embarrassment. Christian Welch’s sin-binning for a professional foul that stopped a probable Titans try gave the Queensland side a late sniff. But with the Gold Coast probing, Josh Addo-Carr scooped up a loose pass and raced away to seal the contest with his 12th try this season. Looking to snap a run of four-straight losses, the Titans led 14-8 against the defending premiers before being bit by a crippling sequence of injuries. At one stage, Garth Brennan’s bench was empty after Jarrod Wallace (head knock), Will Matthews (head knock), Kevin Proctor (groin) and Keegan Hipgrave (wrist) were all in the casualty ward. Wallace and Hipgrave returned but another head clash put Jack Stockwell out of action, while Melbourne half Ryley Jacks was also ruled out of the clash with concussion. The rapid rate at which the casualty ward was filling up shocked Fox Sports commentator and former NSW five-eighth Braith Anasta. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. Proctor’s injury came in a Cameron Smith tackle, with the Storm captain going unpunished despite his awkward effort on the New Zealander. Proctor carted the ball up inside Storm territory seven minutes into the second half and Smith latched onto his leg and appeared to pull it in an awkward position. It was described by some as a “wishbone” tackle. CHECK OUT THE INCIDENT IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE Proctor struggled to play the ball then later left the field and was assessed by medical staff, who ruled him out of the rest of the game. Fox Sports sideline reporter Andy Raymond said the Titans were upset at Smith’s tackle. “Kevin Proctor, sitting down here almost in tears,” Raymond said. “The eyes are misty, in a great deal of pain and filthy, along with the Gold Coast Titans, about the tackle that has ended his night. “The Titans (are) furious.” No love lost between former Storm teammates Cam Smith and Kevin Proctor. Proctor in tears on sideline with what looks like a torn groin muscle after Smith wrenched his leg in tackle. Surely gets looked at by MRC? #NRLStormTitans However, Smith said after the game there was nothing sinister about his tackle. “Just to clarify that I didn’t pull his leg, I didn’t try to pull his leg out,” Smith said. “Kev is a really good friend of mine. He’s a good friend of everyone at our club, played many games with him, so there’s no chance I’d be going in there trying to injure the bloke. “Whatever happens out of this game or that tackle I’ve got absolutely no control over. All I can say is I’m not there to try to hurt the bloke. “I thought I was in a good position to get his leg up and get him on the ground, but it didn’t work that way. “We had three in the tackle and he ended up in that position, which is unfortunate. “I spoke to Kevvy after the game, to see how he’s going and I said I had no intention to hurt him at all, and he was very grateful for me to say that.” Kevin Proctor was out for the count.Source:News Corp Australia Melbourne jumped to an 8-0 lead as the NRL’s worst defensive team again displayed plenty of leaks. But, sparked by some big tackling from debutante half Alexander Brimson and some uncharacteristic Storm handling errors, the Titans were able to steady. Ash Taylor relished the stability, taking control at the back end of the half to lay on two tries as the Titans went to the sheds up 14-8. First he went short to Titans debutante Brenko Lee, the Canberra signing barging over in the right corner. A Billy Slater fumble allowed Mitch Rein to dart 30 metres before Taylor found Dale Copley for another four-pointer. Injury spoiled the Titans’ second-half plans as tries to Felise Kaufusi and Cameron Munster edged the Storm clear for their sixth win of the season. — with AAP 4.55pm Roosters run riot in shut-out Dylan Napa was impressive up front for the Roosters.Source:Getty Images The Sydney Roosters dissected an inept Warriors 32-0 in Auckland, injecting life into their mix-and-match NRL campaign. In heavy conditions at Mt Smart Stadium, the Warriors played like they had legs of lead as the visitors shaded them in every department. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves played like a man possessed in front of new Kiwi coach Michael Maguire, but the barnstorming prop was among a host of Roosters to shine. Cooper Cronk laid on their first-half tries to Ryan Matterson and Joseph Manu as the Roosters pushed 14-0 ahead. Blake Ferguson, James Tedesco and Isaac Liu scored slick tries in a second spell which was one-way traffic. Ferguson improved his State of Origin selection prospects, along with a dynamic Latrell Mitchell and a fired-up Dylan Napa. Thudding defensive hits from Waerea-Hargreaves and Napa midway through the first half established dominance for the Roosters, whose start was almost as dishevelled as the Warriors. Waerea-Hargreaves was sent to the sin bin for his role in a late scuffle, while Queensland hard man Napa was placed on report for a tackle on Isaiah Papali’i. A spectacular Napa shoulder charge on Agnatius Paasi in the first half might also come under scrutiny. The result ended a run of alternating win-loss results for the Roosters, who improve to 6-4. The high-flying Warriors (7-3) crashed back to earth with a performance arguably even flatter than their previous listless losses to Brisbane and Melbourne. Guaranteed to drop one place to third, they were blunt without injured playmakers Shaun Johnson and Issac Luke. They also lacked the metres from their big men and the tight ball control that had been a hallmark of their season. It is the first time they have been kept scoreless since a 42-0 drubbing more than two years ago at the hands of the Storm. Young halfback Mason Lino limped off late with a leg injury. This will be an issue if Johnson’s sore ankle keeps him out for an extended period. — AAP 1.30pm Thurston releases statement on NRL ‘protest’ The tape could be seen covering a small p[art of the NRL crest.Source:News Corp Australia COWBOYS superstar Johnathan Thurston has released a statement to deny suggestions he staged a protest during the Cowboys’ Indigenous Round loss to the Wests Tigers on Thursday night. Thurston was spotted on social media lining up for the singing of the Australian national anthem at Leichhardt Oval with a piece of tape stuck across the NRL badge on his chest. The tape was seen covering the letters “RL” on the NRL logo. The conspiracy theories came thick and fast with speculation the 35-year-old may have been trying to send a political message. A statement issued by the Cowboys quoted Thurston declaring he has no “idea” how the tape got onto his Indigenous Round jumper. “I have absolutely no idea how the tape got on to the NRL logo on my jersey last night,” he said. “I want to ensure people it was not a protest and that I am a proud Aboriginal man that is 100 per cent supportive of the NRL's Indigenous Round.” STATEMENT FROM JOHNATHAN THURSTON: I have absolutely no idea how the tape got on to the NRL logo on my jersey last night. I want to ensure people it was not a protest and that I am a proud Aboriginal man that is 100% supportive of the NRL's Indigenous Round. JT's jersey has raised eyebrows... #9WWOS https://t.co/XxVrKwntOK In typical JT fashion, he proved himself to be all class yet again following his team’s loss. One fan at the game spotted Thurston walking to the far side of the ground to hand his protective headgear to a young fan. He did the same thing with another young fan as the Cowboys got on their team bus to leave the suburban venue. This man loves this game. LOVES IT. Win or lose, he’s out there thanking fans and giving them his headgear. Why am I emotional 😭 #nrl @NRL @nthqldcowboys #thurston pic.twitter.com/sAHjGCZ737 1.15pm Brisbane star puts Wayne under the pump He’s been on fire.Source:Getty Images Broncos star Corey Oates has told the club he will test himself on the open market before beginning contract talks with Brisbane. The State of Origin winger is one of 16 players off contract at Brisbane this season and has told The Courier-Mail he has not yet held contract discussions with any team — including Brisbane. Oates has been the best winger in the NRL this season in the eyes of many commentators, increasing the pressure on coach Wayne Bennett to make sure his star speedster isn’t lost. Bennett’s difficult situation is compounded by his need to try and juggle negotiations with Brisbane’s other off-contract stars this season, including Jaydn Su’A, Matt Lodge, Tevita Pangai Jr, Korbin Sims, Tom Opacic and Jamayne Isaako. The report claims Oates can earn more money by leaving the Broncos with rivals reportedly cashed up and interested in the giant winger. “It’s not possible for us to keep them all,” Bennett said on Friday. “We have to make some good decisions about who we keep and who we let go. “I’m confident we’ll keep Corey, but there’s no guarantees. We want him to stay here so we’ll try and work out a deal. “You can’t keep them all. That’s why we’ve had to let players go over the last three or four years, that’s what the salary cap is designed for.” 1pm Mbye confirms cap crunch fears Moses Mbye concedes he could fall victim to Canterbury’s salary cap crunch but refuses to take it personally should he be forced out next NRL season. Despite being one of the Bulldogs’ few shining lights during their lacklustre opening 10 rounds, the playmaker-turned-pivot is reportedly being shopped around to rival clubs. Mbye could neither confirm or deny the reports but admitted there was likely something in the rumours, especially given the Bulldogs’ dire salary cap position for next year is well-documented. “I don’t know where we’re at,” Mbye said. “Normally where there’s smoke there’s fire. I’m sure the call’s been made. “I understand the business side of it, I get that it’s probably an option that the club needs to go in that direction. “I’m not looking to leave this club, I want to stay. “I haven’t had that discussion with anyone, with any other club and our club hasn’t approached me at all.” With 14 players off contract at season’s end, it is believed the Dogs have about $750,000 worth of cap space for 2019. Greg Eastwood has been told to look for another club while Brett and Josh Morris concede they are unlikely to be at Belmore next year. A pragmatist, Mbye refused to kick stones or be bitter. “I get it, I understand where we’re at,” Mbye said. “I don’t know the fine details but I understand we’re not in that good of a way salary cap-wise. “It doesn’t hurt. And the reason it doesn’t hurt is because I understand where we’re at.” Despite scoring a controversial 20-12 win over Parramatta on Friday night, the Bulldogs are still in strife at 3-7. Asked if the constant negative headlines and uncertainty about their roster had affected the group, Mbye said it was water off a duck’s back. “It probably comes down to a tight-knit group being together for a number of years and going through these sorts of situations,” Mbye said. “Adversity builds really strong bonds especially between blokes like us. When you get in these situations, you get really tight-knit with people in similar situations.” — AAP 12.45pm Knights coach calls for captain review Newcastle coach Nathan Brown has renewed calls for the NRL to consider introducing the captain’s challenge as a way to increase fatigue in the game. Brown’s comments come a day after the governing body confirmed the competition committee would look at reducing the interchange from eight to six at the end of the season. It also came after play was stopped for an injured Viliame Kikau for a few minutes early in the Knights’ 29-18 loss to Penrith on Friday night. Brown complained that Kikau was allowed time to recover and continue his assault on smaller Knights five-eighth Connor Watson for the rest of the night. “Why not just let the game go? They were going to get the ball anyway, and there’s a minute’s stoppage already. There’s so many stupid things like that that we’re doing as a game,” Brown said. Brown went on to claim that the NRL hadn’t asked for feedback from the Knights when the captain’s challenge was trialled in a dead-rubber match against St George Illawarra in 2016. He said it not only would further reduce stoppages, but it would be another way to alleviate pressure from match officials. “The video ref never got called into the game at all in that contest and no one really bothered ringing us up and asking us any feedback what we thought about it, so it was a waste of time doing it,” he said. “The reduced interchange would help open the game up so I’d be a fan of it, but we can do other things in the meantime which can help give us more time on the field, get more fatigue in the game as well.” Brown was also scathing of his team’s ill-discipline against the Panthers, including a Watson brain snap that denied teammate Jacob Saifiti a crucial try in the first half. It came moments before Watson also failed to connect with Brock Lamb for another certain try. “I’m not really bothered by the pass. Those things happen. That can happen in the run of the play and he can look at it and think maybe I shouldn’t have thrown it, maybe I should’ve took them on,” Brown said. “I’m more disappointed in the discipline one because we can’t afford to have that.” — AAP Jump back to top The Roosters, Storm and Manly all secured impressive wins on Saturday.

The Malvern Wells club’s seniors completed a double win, beating Worcester Golf and Country Club 6-2 and hosts The Herefordshire 4½-3½. Against Worcester, captain Andy Peet and John Williams won 4&3 against Malcolm Jeffs and Williams’ brother Alan. Stan Jones and Nigel Teale triumphed 5&4, Terry Cox and Sam Macleod one-up, Roger Blackwell and Andrew Colston 2&1, Tim Keates and Tony Cox 3&2 and Ron Gordon and Keith Hitchcock 4&3.

In the ladies’ May medal, Jackie Marks triumphed on countback from Diane Meakin with both recording nett 73 in Division One. In Division Two, countback was again required to separate the top two with Laura Speers triumphing over Kate Cross with 77. The midweek stableford went to Jan Szymanski with 40 points.

David,Marshall,875,http://www.bakercityherald.com/obituaries/6232418-151/obituaries-for-may-11-2018,"Edward Marshall Sumpter, 1940-2018 Edward L. Marshall, 78, of Sumpter, died May 1, 2018, at his home, surrounded by his loving family. Ed was born on Jan. 23, 1940, at Eugene to Edis and Grace (Wilson) Marshall. He attended Springfield High School. On Aug. 19, 1963, he married the love of his life, Constance J. Duhig in Eugene. “Purple Eddy” lived a life full of hard work, adventure and love. He was an award-winning painter, a gold miner, a pilot, a hunter, a country singer, a guitar player, a mayor, a husband, a grandpa, and so much more. His and Connie’s adventures took them from Springfield to Sumpter, Seattle to Anchorage, and back again. Ed was a wonderful example of everything a man should be. He taught the women in his life how they should be treated, always leading by example, and he taught the men to live off the land, from panning for gold and how to shoot a gun, to gathering wood for winter and field dressing wild game. He loved the old country songs, and when he would sing and play them on his guitar you had no doubt that you were witnessing something really special. Ed was a big, strong, tough man with a gentle heart and love in his eyes. He was the best of the good ol’ boys, and he will be dearly missed. Edward is survived by his wife, Connie Marshall of Sumpter; his daughters, Debra Jones of Bend, and Susan Bland of Kennewick, Washington; his sons, David Marshall of Oak Harbor, Washington, Daniel Marshall of Boise, and Rodney Marshall of Bonney Lake, Washington; his sister, Jackie Easton; 11 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his parents, Edis and Grace Marshall. To light a candle in memory of Edward, or to leave a condolence for the family go to www.grayswestco.com John Seaman Bellingham, 1944-2018 John Henry Seaman, 73, died on April 6, 2018, at Bellingham, Washington. John was born on Oct. 27, 1944, at Cincinnati, Ohio, to Al and Flora (Willard) Seaman. On June 11, 1970, he married the love of his life, Sara Lee Morrissey. He attended San Francisco Theological Seminary where he received his Master of Divinity, and his passion for teaching, writing, and educating stayed with him throughout his life. John will always be remembered as insightful, far-seeing, persistent, and joyful. He loved long contemplative walks, deep conversation, puzzles, and practicing Shintaido. He was known for chasing down logical contradictions and pinning them to the ground. John was also a truly talented poet and loved to post his work online and dive into the lively discussions that ensued. He was an inspiration to all who knew him and will be so fondly remembered for his ability to help people grow much bigger than they thought they could. His light will always shine bright in the lives he touched. John is survived by his loving wife, Lee Seaman; and many nieces and nephews: Kate Kruckemeyer, Johann Kruckemeyer, Cassie Morrissey, Colin Morrissey, Jamie Beth Peters and Greg Goodenough.

David,Marshall,875,http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-letters-20180511-story.html,"Clayton Kershaw's arm injury is potential Armageddon. God bless baseball. Where else can the subject of a biceps, elbow or tendinitis be so seriously considered an occurrence of major significance? Konrad Moore San Diego :: It is ironically appropriate that it took four Dodgers pitchers to no-hit the Padres, given that it took four entities (the Dodgers, Time Warner, Spectrum, and MLB) to shut out nearly 70% of their fan base from seeing the game. Bill Waxman Simi Valley :: I bet the Dodgers were the first team to get a combined-no hitter in alphabetical order: Buehler, Cingrani, Garcia, Liberatore. Lolly Hellman Palms :: In light of the Dodgers' combined no-hitter, and all the surrounding excitement, I have to wonder why there is never any excitement after a combined cycle by batters. Andrew Weiss Playa del Rey :: While largely a fan of the Dodgers' front office and manager Dave Roberts, for the life of me I do not understand the absence of Andrew Toles who was the starting left fielder in 2017 before injury and outplayed all the competition in the Spring of 2018. For a team desperately in need of a spark [and someone to fill Seager's Two Hole, how does this sound? Toles Taylor Turner Bellinger Kemp (You fill in the rest) Dick DeCoit Burbank :: Perhaps the poor performance by the Dodgers this season is [because] the team still thinks they are at spring training. After all they haven't left the West Coast since February. Teams from the East and Central have had to slug it out in icy weather, endured delays and rainouts while the L.A. boys of summer have stumbled their way to a sub-.500 record all in the Pacific time zone (not counting Mexico). The good news is the way the Dodgers are playing they'll avoid the cold weather in October as well. William Borland Torrance :: I went to the Dodgers game Tuesday night. Dodger Stadium has become absolute bush league. Never mind the fact that the food is terrible and grossly overpriced (as well as the parking). It is not a baseball experience at all. The main scoreboard, which used to display the batting lineups, statistics and other information had nothing but ads until there were two outs in the bottom of the fourth inning. There were at least two pitching changes that were not announced, nor was the attendance announced. Dodger Stadium used to show some highlights of other games, but not anymore. No mention that a no-hitter was pitched in another game that night. I went to an Angels game last week (to see Albert Pujols get hit No. 2,999) and it is a far, far better baseball experience. Mike Lorraine Simi Valley Down in Anaheim Six weeks into the baseball season and Shohei Ohtani has more wins than Clayton Kershaw, more home runs than Cody Bellinger and a higher batting average than any Dodger. Amazing. Ron Tom Pasadena :: Is this fantasy baseball? We get to watch Babe Ruth (Ohtani), Mickey Mantle (Trout) and a 3,000-hit superstar (Pujols) all on the same team in the same season! This is Angelic! This cannot last. Soon the greed demons will arrive and the Angels will sign a Dodgers TV deal, and 70% of us will fall from heaven. David Waldowski Laguna Woods Hooping it up Maybe the Lakers should forget about signing two All-Stars. Oklahoma City had three All-Stars and Utah had none (although Donovan Mitchell played like one) and which team won that series? Speaking of Mitchell, the Lakers could have drafted him but they passed. Big mistake. Walter Harris Santa Clarita :: Has Bill Plaschke not noticed in his long career the corrosive effect that nepotism can have on morale in any business, including professional sports? Does he believe you can have a ""players only"" team meeting to clear the air while the coach's son is in attendance? Can the Clippers possibly negotiate the best possible trade when Austin Rivers is non-negotiable? Does he believe players are not concerned about losing playing time to the boss' son? Mr. Ballmer, building morale and team spirit is the road to a championship. Trade Austin Rivers (a very good player) before you re-sign Doc. Harold Walter Northridge :: Bill Plaschke praised the extension signing of Doc Rivers. This would end up as the second big mistake for Steve Ballmer (the first was the signing of Blake Griffin per Plaschke). This is an overrated coach who failed to lead the team out of the second round, despite having Paul, Griffin, Jordan, Reddick and Crawford as the sixth man. I know there were some injuries during the playoffs, but the main problem with Rivers is that he promoted the ""crybaby"" mentality of the Clippers. Now he will get the new players to participate in his school of whining Ron Wolotzky Los Angeles :: So the Cavaliers and Celtics each lost Kyrie Irving and both advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. A curious key to success? Bennett Tramer Santa Monica (by way of Cleveland) :: Was it LaVar Ball's fabled homemade pancakes, fresh strawberries, and sausage breakfast that conned Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka into whiffing on the incredibly talented Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum, and wasting a No. 2 draft pick on the frequently injured and horrendous shooting Lonzo Ball last June? Tom Lallas Los Angeles Good Knights The reason for the success of the Vegas Golden Knights is not fate, an anomaly, or a miracle. It is a simple concept called the hard cap. No luxury tax, no penalties, you just have X amount of dollars to fill your team. If baseball, football and basketball wanted to make their product appeal to a larger fan base they would adopt this formula. Instead, in any given playoff in these sports, you know who are the top four contenders. This makes the rich get richer but it doesn't serve the sport, leaves nothing to the imagination of the underdog and doesn't allow small-market teams to stay competitive. George Sagadencky Tarzana Big screens rule Sorry, Randy Harvey, but when I want to watch any sporting event (I can't count the Dodgers because I am a DirecTV subscriber) I turn on my television. Yes us old-timers have computers and IPads but we use that for messages, information and solitaire. I do not want to watch a sporting event on a nine-inch iPad when I have a 60-inch television. Facebook is not my thing nor should it be baseball's thing. If the internet is the sports media of the future I'm glad I won't be around to see it.

David,Marshall,875,https://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/5396436/panthers-open-season-with-scoreless-loss-to-cyms/,"Lithgow Panthers have suffered a disappointing blow in the first round of the women's premier league hockey competition. What seemed like an evenly-matched affair against Orange Cyms, fell away in the second half to a 4-nil loss. Having gone through to the grand finals only to be beaten by Bathurst City last year, there's no doubt the Pantherettes will be looking to hit back hard in 2018. Coach David Marshall said the performance just “didn't happen” for the team’s home ground opener on Saturday, May 12. The Panthers women did make a strong start, securing a penalty corner within the first five minutes of the match. However, sharp shooter Amelia Leard was unable to make the conversion. Circle penetrations were traded by the teams with unsuccessful goal attempts by both sides when, with five minutes left on the scoreboard, Cyms' Libby Smith broke away with the ball. It hit the back of the net off Kennedy Chapman's stick, giving Cyms their first goal of the game. Finding an opportunity to retaliate, Panthers failed to convert a second penalty corner with one minute to go. Cyms drove the opening fifteen minutes of the second half but didn't see results from two penalty corners (saved by Panthers' Jess Luchetti) and a goal attempt ten minutes in, also rebuffed by the Panthers. Cyms' unrelenting pressure in the goal circle paid off when Kennedy Chapman scored her second goal of the game. This was closely followed by a third goal for Cyms as Madison Smith converted a rebound from an initially unsuccessful penalty corner. Panthers tried to claw back control in the last twenty minutes of the game. Despite multiple goal attempts and two penalty corners, they failed to get onto the scoreboard. With ten minutes to go Deborah Orrock made up for an unfulfilled Cyms penalty corner by secreting the ball into the net while Panthers' goalie Jess Luchetti was reacting to a prior attack. Cyms left Panthers scoreless with a four goal lead. SAVED: Panthers' goal keeper Jess Luchetti makes a save. Picture: PHOEBE MOLONEY. Panthers coach David Marshall said the game was lost on the strength of Cyms midfield, commending the control of Cyms' Jade Geotgiou in particular. ""It's disappointing because we've been training very well. It's just that the performance didn't happen on the day. But it's a long season,"" he said. ""Our basic control and our defence wasn't up to scratch today. We didn't mark them close enough and they took full advantage of that. ""Full credit to them, they deserved to win. They are going to be a hard side to beat."" Related stories Cyms coach Peter Shea was more positive in his evaluation of the Panthers. ""They're a good side, they threw a lot at us. It was only 1-nil at half time, so it was close,"" he said. ""They started to drop off in the second half. It's early in the season, fitness and all that. It was pleasing that we didn't have a goal considered against us."" He also commended the work of Geotgiou and 16-year-old goal keeper Kimberly Kiel, who was making her premier league debut. ""Our ability to move the ball through the midfield was extremely pleasing and our defence worked really well today,” Shea said. CYMS: Kennedy Chapman (2), Madison Smith (1), Deb Orrock (1).

David,Marshall,875,https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/assessing-impact-hull-city-players-1556158,"The final player ratings for every Hull City player who featured at least five times this season for the Tigers Hull City’s Championship season concluded last weekend with a 1-1 draw away to Brentford, with Nigel Adkins men finishing a disappointing 18th in the table. A total of 25 players made at least five appearances for the Tigers in the 2017-18 season but ho was hot and who was not? Philip Buckingham assesses how each member of City’s first team performed over the last nine months, with part one focussing on the goalkeepers and defence. You'll find a tool to give your own ratings at the bottom of th story so let us know how you rate the players. Ratings are out of 10 and reflect the impact made on the Tigers’ season as a whole. Appearances: 44; Goals: 0 Hull City’s Player of the Season and few would begrudge McGregor that honour. For all he was beaten 66 times in 44 league games, that tally would have been far greater if not for a string of top performances from the evergreen keeper. Particularly in the first half of the season, when City’s defensive flaws were most alarming, McGregor’s performances were consistently excellent. That David Marshall, once a Championship regular, never really got a sniff of the number one shirt tells you everything about McGregor’s near faultless contributions. Rating: 8.5 Appearances: 5; Goals: 0 If this was supposed to be the season when Marshall found his feet at the KCOM Stadium, he has ended it bitterly disappointed once more. Just five appearances – including three in the FA Cup – came all season as the Scot played second fiddle to countryman McGregor. Marshall, in his own words, has “hated” this campaign and even his first league start – the 4-3 win over Norwich – was not enjoyable when leaking a penalty and a soft goal. The likely exit of McGregor should finally pave the way for more greater opportunities. Rating: 3.5 Appearances: 44 (2); Goals: 1 No City player was involved in more games than Aina this season and for that it must go down as a successful campaign for the Chelsea rookie. A first loan spell has been a steep learning curve, with a number of Championship wingers targeting his positional weaknesses. Aina’s pace was often able to get him out of trouble but he returns to Stamford Bridge as a defensive work in progress. The ability to play either on the left or right of defence was helpful but the promise shown in the early weeks was not quite fulfilled. Rating: 6.5 Appearances: 24 (2); Goals: 0 There is something about the young defender that made you think he had the greatest potential of all the three on-loan Chelsea men but something did not fully click for Tomori during his time at the KCOM. A versatility perhaps counted against him, as did his struggles to command a regular starting spot in an unconvincing defence. Tomori definitely had his moments around the turn of the year when coming into his own but towards the end of the season he was mostly kicking his heels on the sidelines. Rating: 5.5 Appearances: 35 (3); Goals: 1 Another who started out his loan spell with huge promise but has left the KCOM Stadium unsatisfied with his efforts over the last nine months. Hector was brutally honest recently when accepting he had not hit the heights expected of him, with concentration levels inviting too many mistakes. A talented defender with the ball at his feet but in a City defence guilty of shipping far too many goals, it was a chastening time in black and amber. At his best, such as away to Norwich, he was very good. Too inconsistent, though. Rating: 5.5 Appearances: 41; Goals: 3 A fourth and final season with Hull City was undeniably his worst as the standards set in previous times gradually began to drop. Dawson was not always helped when surrounded by inexperience but there were too many uncomfortable fixtures, like Millwall and Birmingham in March, to look back on the season with any great joy. Credit goes to the captain for shrugging off the uncertainty over his future in the final months of the season, tightening up the defence with some influential displays. At home to Aston Villa stood out. Rating: 6.5 Appearances: 11 (4); Goals: 0 If only the one-time Czech international could stay fit. Some of his starts for City were hugely encouraging but a series of hamstring injuries denied him rhythm and a run in the side. The hope is that Mazuch could be a huge player for the Tigers but the underlying fear is that his fitness levels will forever limit his impact. An old-fashioned figure in defence when fit, providing City with more steel at the back. More is needed, however, in 2018-19 if City are to depend on Mazuch. Rating: 5 Appearances: 13; Goals: 0 More ups than downs for the central defender, whose arrival at the KCOM Stadium coincided with City finding the results to pull clear of relegation trouble. The home defeat to Millwall, when replaced at half-time, was the obvious nadir after being singled-out for criticism by Nigel Adkins but there was enough either side of that fixture to suggest the Tigers have landed a competent Championship defender for next season. A figure to build around once he recovers from a dislocated shoulder. Rating: 6 Appearances: 28 (2); Goals: 0 For a youngster who began the season making a debut for his hometown club, it has to be filed away as a very pleasing campaign. Clark was only shifted back to the left of defence during pre-season but made the position his own for long periods of the season. The Hull-born defender had tough moments along the way but his attitude and work-rate could never be faulted. Up until the 5-0 win away to Burton, he was involved in all of the Tigers’ Championship wins. A shame if this summer marks the end for him. Rating: 6.5 Appearances: 10; Goals: 0 A groin injury blighted almost all of Kingsley’s debut season at the KCOM Stadium, limiting the defender to just 10 starts at either end of the campaign. The first half of those came in one of City’s worst spells but there were signs of promise when returning to the side in April. Making any sort of judgement on Kingsley’s ability would be grossly unfair at this stage but it is clear a first season in East Yorkshire has not worked out how he had planned. More expected in 2018-19. Rating: 4 Now we want you to have your say below and let us know your ratings. Part two of our ratings special looking at the midfield and the strikers will be online Sunday morning.

Andrew,Davis,874,http://www.savannahnow.com/news/20180510/savannah-chatham-crimestoppers-works-to-secure-funding-sources-as-it-seeks-independence,"There may be funding trouble in the future for the local crime-solving tip line as Savannah-Chatham CrimeStoppers works to become independent from the city. Chairman Andrew Davis said the organization is working to secure new funding sources for 2019 after the city raised concerns about continuing to house the program. Founded in 1983, Savannah-Chatham CrimeStoppers is a 24/7 organization that allows residents to call in confidentially with information that can help police solve crimes. A board of community volunteers, media representatives and law enforcement officials oversee CrimeStoppers’ awards, fundraising and policies. The CrimeStoppers tip line serves the eight municipalities and police departments within Chatham County in addition to other county, state and federal agencies. “Crimestoppers is a vital piece of the law enforcement fabric that serves to protect our community,” said Savannah Police Chief Mark Revenew. “I have met with their director, Pam Roundtree, and their board and we are working closely together to help them achieve their goal of being an independent and self-governing organization.” The program has been housed under the city’s government as CrimeStoppers worked with the then- Savannah-Chatham police department. But since the metropolitan police department’s split in February, questions have been raised about who should be footing the majority of the CrimeStoppers bill, Davis said. As an independent organization, board members would be able to hire their own staff rather than city employees running CrimeStoppers' daily operations. “There was a question as to whether it would be the county or the city that would end up funding it,” Davis said.“It’s all connected to the police department split. . .The city was obviously going through some of its budget troubles and had questions about nonprofits. We have a 501c3 for the reward fund only and the city was hoping to cut back somewhat. So they were looking to cut CrimeStoppers at one point.” The city and CrimeStoppers have since reached a resolution for 2018 but organization leaders are looking towards operational independence, Davis said. CrimeStoppers rewards are funded through donations. The city has pledged $172,000 toward the costs of CrimeStoppers for the remainder of the year, according to city spokeswoman Michelle Gavin. “The city has committed to the full funding that we’ve paid in the past,” she said. But the nonprofit is still looking for other financial sources including the county and other municipalities to help pick up the tab, Davis said. “We’re just trying to work with everybody for the best,” he said. “No matter what happens, we know that the CrimeStoppers name and brand will continue to help get anonymous tips and help solve crimes out there. We are hoping to build the brand and get an full director within the next six months. That will hopefully help us with fundraising and help us expand what CrimeStoppers is available to do and help us continue to provide the service to the community. We hope that the city and the county and various municipalities will also help us along through funding and support along the way to make sure that that can happen.” Choose the plan that's right for you.

But it was Grand Blanc, which has been exiled out of the KLAA and will be joining the Saginaw Valley League next year, that captured the team title with 105 points in a close battle with runner-up Brighton (95), Novi (93) and Salem (82). Despite winning just two events, the discus and the 800-meter relay, the Bobcats still had enough at the end by finishing second and racking up eight all-important points in the 1,600 relay as Brighton placed third and Novi was sixth. ""The weather obviously played, I think, a bit of a role in it, but we knew it was going to be close between us and Grand Blanc the entire time and we knew it was going to come down the 4 x 400,"" Reid said. ""Our kids tried to close the gap. We had to have a couple of things that have to take place like in any track meet where good is bad and good is bad. But we got points in some places we didn't anticipate. We lost some points in some places where we thought we would get . . . came up a little bit short today, but gave it a good run and you can't ask for anything more than the kids just coming down and giving it their all, and competing in everything to the last second.""

He swept the 1,600- and 3,200 events in 4:19.04 and 9:29.75, respectively. Mudel also teamed up with Matthew Gustitus, Miles Brown and Nathaniel Wood for a victory in the 3,200 relay (7:56.08). ""Gabe was the ultimate team player today,"" Reid said. ""He did a fantastic job. Blake Maday was supposed to be in our 4 x 800, and he was taking an A.P. test and couldn't get here in time, so Gabe stepped into that. He did the mile, he did the two-mile and just dominated all of it. He totally came up big for us, was strong for us. We asked a lot of him today and he's going to have some tired legs tomorrow."" Novi collected the KLAA Gold Division trophy after going 6-0 in dual meets. The Wildcats took third Friday in the KLAA championships at Canton.

Salem got individual firsts from seniors Alex Howie, shot put (51 feet, 3½ inches), Sharriff Dyer, 300 hurdles (39.15); Andrew Davis, 100 dash (11.26). ""I thought did started off very well in the field events,"" Salem coach Jim Crabill said. ""Alex Howie was dominant in the shot put he won by over a foot. He threw well in discus to take fourth in a very competitive field. Jon Bilko has a good day and a P.R. to finish third in the pole vault. Montavion Leeper finish to seventh in the high jump which was a nice surprise jumping 5-1. The Rocks' 4 x 400 relay of Berry Matthews, Hezekiah Williams, Davis and Dyer also took first in 3:28.04. ""On track we missed some big scoring opportunities that hurt our over all finish as a team but still had some good races,"" Crabill said. ""Andrew Davis won the 100. Sharriff Dyer and John Paul DelaCruz went first and third on the 300 hurdles, which were huge points for us. The highlight of the meet was in the last race of the day in the 4 x 400 relay when Shariff Dyer came back and passed the Grand Blanc guy at the finish line to win. Our 4 x 200 relay just got edged out to take second. Josh Pohl and Berry Mathews went seventh and eighth in the 800. I was pleased with our 3,200 guys Ryan Exell and Luke Haran finished sixth ans seventh in a very competitive race.""

Picture: Andrew Davis. Andrew Davis Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. Prof Cathie Martin, a project leader in metabolic biology at the John Innes Centre, and Prof Sophien Kamoun, a group leader at The Sainsbury Laboratory, have both been elected as Fellows of the Royal Society – placing them among the ranks of the world’s most distinguished scientists. In a 35-year career at the John Innes Centre, Prof Martin has been a powerful advocate of applying plant science for human health. She becomes the 29th scientist in the centre’s 108-year history to receive the honour. “This is an honour and I would like to thank the many inspiring colleagues and collaborators particularly from the John Innes Centre and from around the world who have worked with me along the way,” she said. Prof Martin, who was awarded an MBE for services to plant biotechnology in 2014, has researched plant genetics and metabolism to provide new insights into plant developmental and metabolic processes which are beneficial to human health and disease prevention. She has a collaborative research programme in China on Chinese Medicinal Plants, particularly those producing anti-cancer metabolites used for complementary therapies, and is working with research institutes in Kenya and Ethiopia to develop the resilient legume, grass pea, as a high-protein food and forage crop, suitable for sub-Saharan Africa. In an equally-distinguished career, Prof Kamoun, who is also Professor of Biology at the University of East Anglia, has made a major contribution to the understanding of plant diseases and plant immunity at the Sainsbury Laboratory. “I’m humbled and honoured by this recognition especially as I’ve only been in the UK for about 10 years,” said Prof Kamoun. “These days, science is all about teamwork. Behind every individual award stands an amazing team of students and researchers. I’m extremely grateful to the brilliant people I have worked and collaborated with over the years. The thrill of discovery is addictive. Sharing the experience with others is priceless.” Prof Kamoun has pioneered genomics and molecular biology methods to reveal fundamental insights into the biology and evolution of plant pathogens, which has resulted in new approaches to mitigate some of the world’s most serious crop diseases. He received the American Phytopathological Society Syngenta Award in 2003, the Noel Keen Award in 2013, the Daiwa Adrian Prize in 2010, and the Kuwait Prize in 2016. The Fellowship of the Royal Society is made up of the most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists working in the UK and Commonwealth. Past Fellows and Foreign Members have included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking.

""The registration numbers are a reflection of how far away this state has slipped for Republicans,"" said Rob Stutzman, a longtime GOP strategist. The latest blow came from the state's official voter registration report, which showed only 28,649 more Republicans than independent voters as of April 6. Elections officials update state voter tallies at regular intervals before each election; a final report will be issued about two weeks before the June 5 primary. As a crucial primary nears, track the California races that could flip the House » The disintegration of strong party affiliation in California has struck a blow to Democrats and Republicans over the last several election cycles. Independent voters, who technically chose ""no party preference"" on their registration forms, were all but an afterthought as recently as 2002. But in every election for governor since, they've grown in size and importance. ""Democrats are keeping stable. That's not necessarily something to be gloating about,"" said Paul Mitchell, one of the state's leading experts on political data. Even so, their share of the state's electorate has grown a few times in recent years, especially in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Republicans, by comparison, have been on a steady downward slide. Research from Mitchell's for-profit company, Political Data Inc., shows that only about 20% of California voters who registered since 2017 chose to be a Republican. Among the youngest of newly registered voters, between the ages of 18 and 24, the share of Republicans is only 13%. That may be the strongest evidence to date that the party's problem could worsen as there are fewer older voters. Matt Fleming, a spokesman for the California Republican Party, said Thursday that there are opportunities to persuade unaffiliated voters. He suggested the increase in independents is more about voters ""fed up with the status quo,"" which he defined as Democrats who control state government. Still, the state's last Republican governor has embarked on an effort that acknowledges the extent of the problem. Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously told his own state party in 2007 that it was ""dying at the box office,"" has teamed up with a small group of Republicans to promote candidates who can sell a different message to voters. One of the group's leaders, Yucca Valley Assemblyman Chad Mayes, said in March the group is looking to help ""rational Republicans and centrists"" win office in California. It's hard for Republicans to win statewide in California without candidates » Keeping the seats they have, though, is the more immediate problem. Republicans represent only one-third of the state Senate and a slightly smaller portion of the Assembly. They hold just 14 of California's 53 seats in the House of Representatives, and several of those seats are in danger of flipping to Democrats this fall. Republicans don't make up the majority of voters in any congressional district in the state. And even Orange County, the state's most reliable Republican stronghold in the modern era, voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump — the first time the GOP's nominee lost there since 1936. ""The Republican Party has changed, and it's unattractive to a lot of voters in California,"" Stutzman said. The embrace of big-money politics by the major parties is among the reasons that Sara Burns, a retired public school teacher, said she changed her registration to be an independent. ""Both parties play the same game [and] cooperate with each other to keep their political games going,"" said Burns, 60, of Redondo Beach. Thursday's registration report from Secretary of State Alex Padilla reported 18.8 million registered voters in California, about 1.2 million more than the gubernatorial primary four years ago. No state comes close to the size of its electorate. U.S. census data show California now has as many voters as did 20 states combined in 2016. Not all states track political affiliations of registered voters, and California isn't alone in the growing muscle of independents. In strongly Republican Utah, no-party voters outnumber Democrats by more than three to one. In Democratic Massachusetts, there are five voters ""unenrolled"" with a party to every registered Republican. And few states have been as accommodating to voters who want to shed their political party affiliation. California's top-two primary, enacted by ballot measure in 2010 and now in its fourth election cycle, eliminated the barriers that parties often erected for unaffiliated voters to participate in the selection of candidates appearing on the November ballot. Here too, though, Republicans have been resistant to change. The new primary rules don't apply to presidential contests, and state GOP leaders refused to let unaffiliated voters participate in the June 2016 primary that resulted in a decisive Trump victory. Democrats, on the other hand, gave independents the chance to vote for either Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in their presidential primary. But unaffiliated voters are not ideologically neutral, say political strategists and researchers. They generally split along traditional party lines when casting ballots, even though they have a disdain for party labels. The challenge, Stutzman said, is that GOP candidates playing only to the party's ultra-conservative base can create a self-fulfilling prophecy. He pointed to the Tuesday debate performance of the two major Republican candidates for governor, businessman John Cox and Huntington Beach Assemblyman Travis Allen. ""We've gotten to this point where there's an open seat for governor, and two candidates are on stage bending over backward trying to win a majority of 25% of the electorate,"" he said. ""They weren't coming close to a message that can win 51% of all voters."" One of the most heated topics in the debate was immigration, a perennial sore spot for Republicans in comparison to the broader California electorate. Cox and Allen both praised Trump's approach on those who are in the U.S. illegally, a position aligned with GOP sentiments in a March poll by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. Eighty-two percent of Republican voters in California said the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration is a ""good thing"" for the country. By contrast, 55% of self-described moderate likely voters called it a ""bad thing."" Opposition to the president's approach rose to 57% among the youngest voters, 58% among Latinos. What may save Republican officeholders, for now, is that the remaining party faithful show up to cast their ballots more frequently than do either Democrats or unaffiliated voters. In some places, that can temper the otherwise unbridled enthusiasm of GOP critics. For now, though, the party's statewide strength continues to fade as the ranks of unaffiliated voters keep growing. ""This isn't a revelatory moment,"" Stutzman said. ""This is where the numbers have been going for several years.""

Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 9:24 am Michael Gordon Law and Justice Reporter Michael Gordon A Missoula man who in 2014 was found to have been justified when he shot and killed a man outside a strip club faces new felony charges after allegedly firing a shotgun outside his home and threatening to kill his father earlier this week. Michael Gordon has been charged with felonies for assault with a weapon and assault on a peace officer, as well as a misdemeanor for fleeing, stemming from an incident on Tuesday. In September 2014, Gordon shot and killed Christopher Hymel after an altercation in the parking lot of the Fox Club. Gordon had left the strip club before Hymel and was sitting in his truck when Hymel and his group walked in front of the vehicle. According to records, Hymel then attacked Gordon through the window. Gordon took a gun from the center console and got out of his truck after another man pulled Hymel away. When Hymel came at him again, Gordon shot him in the chest. At a coroner’s inquest months later, a jury found Gordon was legally justified in the shooting. In Tuesday’s incident, deputies were called to a home on Primrose Lane for a report of shots being fired. Gordon had left in his truck, and when officers found him and tried to pull him over, Gordon allegedly led them on a chase that reached speeds of up to 100 miles per hour. At a business on Broadway Gordon stopped and got out holding a shotgun, but then dropped it and complied with officers' directions. A woman at the Primrose house said Gordon had been intoxicated and fighting with his father, and also threatened to kill him. The woman allegedly locked Gordon — who was carrying the shotgun — out of the house, then went upstairs. While she was going upstairs, the woman said she heard three shots from outside. Gordon made his first court appearance on Wednesday, where according to prosecutors, acting Justice of the Peace Ryan Phelan set his bail at $51,035. Arrests reported in the Missoula area during the month of May. After several hours of deliberation, a coroner's inquest jury ruled Monday night that a fatal shooting outside a Missoula strip club on Labor … Law and Justice Reporter Crime reporter for the Missoulian.

Michael,Gordon,871,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article210866224.html,"By Michael Gordon And Maria Albrough mgordon@charlotteobserver.com malbrough@charlotteobserver.com May 10, 2018 04:21 PM A Gastonia physician traded powerful prescription drugs for sex with female patients then billed taxpayers for his office trysts, new federal documents say. In their filings, prosecutors say Dr. Michael Alson Smith bartered sex last year with at least seven of his patients at Mt. Holly Family Practice for whom he then prescribed heavily controlled drugs. Smith regularly billed Medicaid and Medicare for reimbursement for patient visits in which sex — but no medical treatment — took place, prosecutors say. The patients who received Smith's fraudulent prescriptions likewise submitted government claims to cover the costs of their drugs. Smith has agreed to plead guilty to illegal drug distribution, health care fraud and aggravated identity theft. The charges carry a maximum combined penalty of more than 20 years in prison and a $750,000 fine. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Smith's attorney, Noell Tin of Charlotte, wouldn't comment Thursday. The physician's next court hearing has not been scheduled. Smith owned and operated Mt. Holly Family Practice and was the only male physician on staff. His clientele included a high number of pain-management and substance-abuse patients, due to Smith receiving federal approval to operate an opioid-treatment program from his family-practice offices, documents say. Prosecutors say the doctor's sex-for-drugs trade began in January 2017 and lasted about 10 months. In an August incident, Smith coerced a woman seeking treatment for opiate addiction into having sex with him in an examination room while the woman's 3-year-old daughter was on hand, prosecutors say. Afterward, Smith increased the woman's dosage of Clonazepam, a powerful sedative and popular recreation drug, without giving her any medical examination. On Sept. 11, the female patient returned. This time she brought her 3-month-old son into the examination room, prosecutors say. After the sex acts, Smith signed over new prescriptions to the patient for Clonazepam and Buprenorphine HCL, a drug used to treat opiate addiction. The next day, Smith submitted a $78.76 reimbursement claim to the N.C. Medicaid program for the woman's visit, prosecutors say. Medicaid paid out another $131.60 for the woman's fraudulent prescriptions. In all, Smith's actions cost government health programs at least $10,000, prosecutors say. In January 2017, Smith propositioned another of his female patients. The woman, whom Smith was treating for addiction and pain management, initially refused his solicitations, documents say. Smith persisted, threatening to cut off her treatment if she did not comply, documents say. The woman gave in, and for the next 10 months met Smith at his office for sex. After each liaison, Smith prescribed the woman drugs ""without performing any medical examination,"" documents say. The amount of drugs he illegally dispensed included 120 10mg Oxycodone Acetaminophen tablets; 1,015 units of Buprenorpine HCL; 1,101 units of Aprazolam, and 630 units of Clonazepam. In September, he used the personal information and Medicaid credentials of one of his victims to commit ""one or more"" unspecified felonies. Smith's medical license was suspended last October for what the N.C. Medical Board described as ""immoral and dishonorable conduct."" He is the latest Charlotte-area physician embroiled in sex scandals. Prominent eye doctor Jonathan Christenbury has been sued by former female employees who say he propositioned and assaulted them in and out of the office and eventually fired them without cause. The case is now bogged down in a pretrial legal fight over Christenbury's personal medical records. Dr. Fidelis Edosomwan of Charlotte is scheduled to go on trial next month, charged with fondling at least nine female patients during routine exams. In February, a jury awarded two of Edosomwan's accusers more than $2 million in their lawsuit against the physician. During his testimony, Edosomwan maintained his innocence and said some of the opposing witnesses suffered from “#metoo syndrome.” Michael Gordon: 704-358-5095; @MikeGordonOBS View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

Michael,Gordon,871,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/arts/saoirse-ronan-courtney-barnett-a-bang-on-a-can.html,"Supported by By The New York Times New TV shows, museum openings, film releases and concerts — it’s a lot to keep track of. Let us help you. For the week of May 13, seven events in New York and elsewhere not to be missed: May 18. At 13, Saoirse Ronan captured her first Oscar nomination as Briony Tallis, an aspiring writer from a wealthy English family who tears her older sister’s life apart, in the 2007 adaptation of Ian McEwan’s “Atonement.” A decade later, the Irish-American actress and the British author are collaborating again — this time in the film version of his novella “On Chesil Beach,” opening Friday, May 18, in New York and Los Angeles. Ms. Ronan — who earned her second nomination as a 1950s immigrant in “Brooklyn” and her third as a free-spirited Sacramento high schooler in “Lady Bird” — stars as Florence Ponting, a violinist deeply in love with the history student Edward Mayhew (Billy Howle) but reluctant to partake of the pleasures of the flesh. Virgins both, Florence and Edward reach an impasse on their wedding night on the Dorset seashore in 1962, as the youthquake prepares to upend the country’s social mores. Tender, yearning and piquantly comic, “On Chesil Beach” is the feature debut from the Olivier-winning theater director Dominic Cooke, who tackled Shakespeare — and Benedict Cumberbatch — for the BBC in “The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK May 18; itunes.apple.com. If #MeToo is indeed a reckoning, there’s no reason that reckoning shouldn’t have a soundtrack. Enter “Tell Me How You Really Feel,” the highly anticipated sophomore album from Australian singer-songwriter Courtney Barnett, whose plain-spoken yet anthemic rock songs earned her a Grammy nomination for best new artist in 2016. Her 2015 debut, “Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit,” featured a collection of songs whose raucous, grungy exteriors belied their crystalline lyrics — lyrics that described a specific, defiant and nonconformist feminism instead of generic girl power. Barnett came out swinging with “Nameless, Faceless,” the first single off “Tell Me How You Really Feel” — specifically, at internet trolls. “Don’t you have anything better to do?” she asks in the song’s opening line, before eviscerating the kind of online rage displayed by the Toronto attacker, who claimed “involuntary celibacy” was a rationale for mass murder. Another album cut is called “I’m Not Your Mother, I’m Not Your Bitch.” Barnett has stated that the song is not specifically about men: what it’s definitely about, though, is the feeling of not being able to take it anymore. NATALIE WEINER May 13; bangonacan.org; stream live at facebook.com/bangonacan. In a small SoHo art gallery on Mother’s Day in 1987, three iconoclastic young composers inaugurated what has become an annual New York tradition: the Bang on a Can festival, a gleefully eclectic marathon concert of contemporary music. For more than three decades, Bang on a Can has roved about the city, but this year the marathon returns to its downtown and Mother’s Day origins, with a free ten-hour concert on Sunday at N.Y.U. Skirball. Characteristically diverse highlights include music by Terry Riley, Galina Ustvolskaya, the Magnetic Fields’s Stephin Merritt, and the Bang on a Can founders Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe. But particularly of note is a trio of three vibrant works by the composer Jeffrey Brooks, a longtime Bang on a Can colleague and the subject of a new recording initiative by the organization. WILLIAM ROBIN May 19-June 29; clubbedthumb.org. There are team-building exercises, and then there are bosses with a flair for drama. When the employees of Tin Cat Shoes close up shop and venture together into the wilderness, their fearless leader is swiftly dragged into a cave by a bear, held captive and possibly mauled. Or is he? Maybe he staged the whole thing, trying to gauge how his crew reacts in a crisis. Such are the goings-on in Trish Harnetiaux‘s comedy “Tin Cat Shoes,” which kicks off Clubbed Thumb’s Summerworks festival, an annual three-course feast of fresh new plays at the Wild Project in the East Village. Directed by Knud Adams (“Aloha, Aloha, or When I Was Queen”) and running May 19-29, the show boasts downtown stalwarts including Donnetta Lavinia Grays — a veteran of Summerworks productions including “Men on Boats” (2015) and last year’s “Of Government” — and the Obie Award winner David Greenspan. From then on, the festival turns Texan, continuing with Angela Hanks’s “Wilder Gone” (June 4-14), a tale of land, sex and female ambition in 1921 Dallas; and Will Arbery’s “Plano” (June 19-29), about three grown sisters and the men they love but never fully know. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES May 15-20; flamencovivo.org. It takes a strong leader to keep a dance company afloat in New York for 35 years. Carlota Santana founded Flamenco Vivo in 1983 with Roberto Lorca; after his death from AIDS in 1987, she kept it going. Women’s leadership will be a theme running through the troupe’s 35th anniversary season at BAM Fisher, which features a new work by the pathbreaking flamenco artist Belén Maya. Her “Mujeres Valientes,” for six dancers, draws inspiration from two Latin American activists who fought for women’s rights: the 17th-century Mexican writer Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz and the 19th-century South American revolutionary Manuela Sáenz. The composer and guitarist Gaspar Rodríguez contributes an original score, to be played live. Sharing the program are new solos by the Spanish choreographers José Maldonado and Guadalupe Torres. Mr. Maldonado will also bring back last season’s “Pa’ Triana Voy,” offering a glimpse into Triana, a neighborhood in Seville known for its vital flamenco culture. SIOBHAN BURKE May 13; pbs.org. It’s been 24 years since Gillian Armstrong put her magical spin on Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women,” starring Winona Ryder as the tomboyish writer Jo March, living in Concord, Mass., with her mother, Marmee, and sisters Amy, Meg and Beth while their father, a chaplain, ministers to soldiers during the Civil War. Now comes the Masterpiece and BBC coproduction, adapted by Heidi Thomas, the creator of “Call the Midwife,” and featuring the marquee players Emily Watson, Angela Lansbury and Michael Gambon. The two-part presentation will air on Sundays, May 13 and 20, on PBS. But the biggest hype is reserved for Maya Hawke, the 19-year old daughter of Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke, who is making her screen debut as the willful Jo — her long hair, as the book tells it, her only beauty. (With parents like that? Hardly.) Ms. Hawke gave up her place at Juilliard to portray the character, near to her heart since reading the novel as a child struggling with dyslexia. She’ll next be seen as Robin, described as an “alternative girl,” on Season 3 of Netflix’s “Stranger Things,” expected out in 2019. KATHRYN SHATTUCK Through Jan. 13; cooperhewitt.org. This exhibition of nearly 200 globe- and millennium-spanning objects is ostensibly dedicated to the science of color. It does politely nod to that ambition, with optics manuscripts from Isaac Newton and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, plates from Josef Albers’s monumental handbook “Interaction of Color” and myriad examples of natural and artificial dyes. But what it’s really all about is the mysteriously magnetic appeal of rainbows and monochromes, from a fourth-century blue glass vase and 19th-century color wheels to our own era’s Pantone cards, pink princess telephones and blueberry iMacs. A few items of higher design, like an intricate green 3D-printed urn by Michael Eden, add a thought-provoking element. On the whole you won’t be there to think about color — you’ll be there to enjoy it. WILL HEINRICH Advertisement

Phillip,Frost,868,https://advisorhub.com/ladenburg-advisory-fees-fall-on-new-revenue-recognition-policy/,"(Adds company’s explanation of forgivable loan costs in 10th and 11th paragraphs.) Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, the parent of five independent broker-dealer firms with about 4,300 advisors, has made a significant change in its revenue-recognition policies that gives a more accurate picture of its profitability. The Miami-based company said on Wednesday that its advisory fees in the first three months of 2018 fell 10% from a year earlier to $114.3 million, despite a 15.2% jump in client assets under administration. The reason: Ladenburg on January 1 adopted a required new Financial Accounting Standards Board policy that no longer lets it report fee income from advisors who do not use it as their primary registered investment advisory firm. It also began recognizing the money it collects from these so-called hybrid advisors for providing technology, custody and administrative services on a net basis, reporting that revenue only after deducting what it pays the advisors. It previously reported the advisory and service fees on a gross basis. “Accordingly, our reported advisory revenue and the independent financial advisors’ compensation in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment is materially lower in 2018 as compared to the prior-year periods, and reported advisory revenue growth may lag behind the overall growth rate of advisory assets,” Ladenburg said in earnings statements released on Wednesday. Ladenburg nevertheless reported a 13.5% jump in total revenue from the first quarter of 2017 to $329.3 million, largely because of insurance commissions that jumped 25.6% from a year earlier to $163.3 million. The firm said that the new accounting interpretation allows it to count all commissions collected from insurance carriers on a gross basis, whereas it previously recognized such revenue on a net basis determined by the insurance companies’ method of payment. The company’s total first-quarter expenses rose 9.1% to $321.7 million, driven by a 5.7% jump in fees and commissions to its independent brokers to $231.3 million. Although Ladenburg’s first-quarter operating profit soared to $5.5 million following a $3.7 million loss a year earlier, it reported a net loss after payment of preferred dividends of $3.0 million, an improvement over its $11.6 million after-dividend loss in the year-earlier quarter. The publicly traded firm is controlled by its chairman, Dr. Phillip Frost. Ladenburg more than doubled its brokerage sales force seven years ago when it bought the 2,500-advisor independent broker-dealer Securities America. It also owns Triad Advisors, Investacorp, KMS Financial Services, Securities Service Network and Premier Trust. “The continued growth in our nationwide network of independent financial advisors to over 4,300 reflects our success in recruiting talented advisors over the past two years,” Ladenburg Chief Executive said in a prepared statement. The company has added about 300 net new advisors across the five firms in the past 12 months, but net recruiting results were flat in this year’s first quarter, according to a Ladenburg spokesperson. Ladenburg, nevertheless spent about $13 million on forgivable loans in the quarter, the spokesperson said. The forgivable recruitment and retention loan notes that Ladenburg amortized from its balance sheet plummeted in the first three months of the year to $76,000 from $1.59 million in the year-earlier first quarter and will go to zero in the future because of the new accounting rule. That is because the company is now capitalizing forgivable loans—its highest recruiting expense—on a new balance sheet line called “contract acquisition costs” that amortizes them over the average life of a broker at each of its brokerage firms. The time periods are significantly longer than the historical 3-to-5 year loan forgiveness period to each recruit, according to Ladenburg. Ladenburg, whose Securities America unit agreed to a $5.8 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April for selling over-priced mutual fund share classes, set aside $2.6 million in the first quarter for pending legal and regulatory charges, up from $143,000 in the year-earlier quarter, bringing its total “accrued liability” reserve to $8.8 million. The company, whose brokers focus on ”underserved” retail investors with as little as $100,000 of investible assets, according to a shareholder letter Frost sent last month, is reviewing its mutual-fund disclosures to clients to determine whether to self-report to the SEC other sales violations related to payments of 12b-1 fees from mutual fund companies, it said in its earnings release. The regulator in February announced a Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative that it said will likely result in “favorable” settlement terms to investment firms that self-report by June 12. Shares of Ladeburg were up 9 cents, or 2.6%, to $3.61 a share in early afternoon trading on Thursday. Accounting Standard Update # 2014-09 is effective for ALL publically traded corporations as of Jan 01, 2018. This rule will become effective for ALL companies in the USA using GAAP accounting as of Jan 01, 2019. The professor that taught the 16 hour class on this rule told me “this will cause many corporations to be much more honest about their ‘true’ revenue and that a large portion of american businesses will see a dramatic reduction in their reported earnings. For those of you that understand International Financial Reporting Standards–basically what this ASU # 2014-09 does is ‘insert’ the IFRS rules for revenue recognition into the GAAP rules. It will change the P & L for a vast number of companies in the USA. It appears from this article that this company decided to follow ASU 2014-09 ‘now’ rather than delay it until 2019. smart move!

Aidan Connor's exit from the ITV soap was broadcast this week across special episodes on Monday and Wednesday - with many calling for actor Shayne Ward to be reconsidered for this year's British Soap Awards. Following the character's death, many organisations and charities dealing with depression and support have commended the storyline and how it has been sensitively presented by the beloved programme.

Shayne Ward has also revealed that, since the scenes aired, people have got in touch to say his performance inspired them to talk to someone and seek help.

Terri Sathees-Kumar: ""As someone who has recently suffered a similar loss I found it emotional to watch but I am glad they are doing this storyline and showing what happens to the families who are left behind. ""I hope it helps someone, even just one family not to suffer like we have is a blessing."" Adeleine Stubbs: ""I thought it was the best episode of Corrie I've seen for a long time."" Sam Priestess: ""It was very well written and acted in the manner it was intended. Very emotional but very real."" Dawn Watson: ""They did a great job with this story. It's really happens. Hope this will help others seek help."" Emma Louisee Bellerby: ""Cried for two hours after watching."" Agnes George: ""It was very emotional. Well acted by all."" Karen Cummings: ""I was in bits it just hits home that no matter what you see on outside you never know what’s going on on the inside. Well done to Corrie and Shayne Ward."" Diane Burton: ""They did it well, I was no good, makes you think how easy it can happen, so very sad.""

Posted: Thursday, May 10, 2018 10:30 am A fierce look at the angst that can lead to murder by Mark Lord, qboro contributor Queens Chronicle | 0 comments In the nearly 20 years since the massacre at Columbine High School, so much has changed, yet so much remains the same. This reminder comes courtesy of a powerful, often shattering production called “columbinus,” running through May 13 at The Secret Theatre. Suggested by the incident, in which 15 people died, including the two perpetrators who shot up their school on a spring day in 1999, the play, by Stephen Karam and PJ Paparelli, incorporates excerpts from conversations with parents, survivors and other members of the community, along with additional dialogue culled from the authors’ imaginations. Told in a nontraditional style, via monologues, conversations with disembodied voices and rapid-fire verbal interplay, the play covers a wide range of topics including alienation, social pressures, the search for one’s true identity and the like. The nameless characters represent the various “types” one might encounter in a typical high school: the jock, the loner, the nerd. Savannah Mazda makes a brave and, ultimately, auspicious directorial debut with this production, and she has been blessed with a company of actors who, for the most part, play their respective roles to the hilt. Much of the play’s nearly three-hour playing time is absorbing and, to its credit, emotionally draining. From the powerful opening, interactions among the ensemble — and they are truly that — are fast and furious. The second act begins with a focus on the two young men responsible for the attack, each portrayed as intelligent and having great potential. As they plot their course of action, we get inside their heads — a rare glimpse into the minds of the deeply troubled who walk among us. The feeling is all too realistic and oftentimes downright uncomfortable. The scene is as effective as it is because of the two actors on stage, Sean McCoy and especially Caleb Donahoe, who come equipped with seemingly unlimited theatrical resources. The rest of the cast, each of whom deserves praise, consists of Olivia Hoffman, Carly Dieck, Eli Denson, Justin Andrew Davis, Jordan Lemmon and Kendra Holloway. Only in the play’s final minutes does the energy lag, the result of an overly long epilogue in which the voices of too many of those affected by the incident are heard. The nearly-silent conclusion that follows is the dramatic capper to a powerful evening in the theater. Portions of sales will be donated to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.

MUSICBEETHOVEN’S EROICA ★★★★Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall and Robert Blackwood Hall, May 10-12 Leaving imminently for a whirlwind tour of China, the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra gave its home audience the opportunity to hear some major components from the three programs it will present in cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Beijing. Under Sir Andrew Davis, the MSO will support Moye Chen in the Liszt Piano Concerto No. 1 as well as offering Beethoven’s Eroica Symphony No.3. Both works featured on this pre-tour demonstration, but Thursday night opened with a remarkable score by the MSO’s composer in residence, Carl Vine. Written for the West Australian Symphony Orchestra in 2014, his Concerto for Orchestra is a splendid, light-filled showpiece that gives each group of players – and some first desk principals – a moment in the spotlight, notably some powerful passages for brass and percussion. It’s an eminently approachable construct, polished in detail and built on clever, undemanding melodic cells. Chen gave an excellent account of the Liszt concerto, a repertoire regular that taxes every pianist but here found an accurate, emotionally responsive interpreter. Those soulful roulades and clangorous double octaves that alternate throughout this sample of Romantic virtuosity held no fears for Chen who set you at ease with his confident mastery. Davis directed a sturdy reading of the great E flat Symphony, the MSO strings and woodwind given room to enunciate their lines clearly. The first Allegro came over with plenty of spacious vitality, setting the foundations for a solid, sensibly-shaped interpretation of this direct-speaking cornerstone in Western art.

Pete,Rouse,863,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gykpgy/why-did-att-novartis-pay-michael-cohen-corruption-influence-dc,"Left Image: Michael Cohen. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images). Right Image by Alex Cook A close confidant of a powerful political figure invites representatives of a Fortune 500 company over to his office. The company has business the political figure could help with—legislation they desire, regulatory matters they’d like to see resolved. So its reps approached the confidant, ostensibly to gather information about how to navigate the political scene. But really, in effect, the company is there to pay cash tribute—six or seven figures worth—hoping that, down the road, the confidant will remember the bounty and use his clout to help fix the company’s problems. I could be talking about any banana republic around the world. But I could also be talking about Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s ambulance chaser of a lawyer who took just these types of meetings with telecom giant AT&T and pharmaceutical firm Novartis before pocketing as much as $1.8 million into the same shell company coffers out of which he paid off a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the president. But I could also be talking about ""strategic affairs"" groups inside Washington law firms, where former lawmakers or staffers set up shop to debrief corporate clients about government activities. Here’s one at Perkins Coie, featuring former Obama chief of staff and ""101st Senator"" Pete Rouse. Or this one at McGuire Woods, led by former Congressman Lewis Payne. Or this one at Squire Patton Boggs, led by former Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott. In fact, Squire Patton Boggs had help securing clients last year from none other than Michael Cohen. It’s true that the Trumpworld version of this old, old Washington tradition reflects influence peddling at its most flagrantly corrupt. Cohen, a fixer who has reportedly bragged about Russian mob ties, doesn’t have deep understanding of US health care or telecom policy. Seeking ""insight into Trump’s thinking,"" as a source close to AT&T has claimed they were doing, is known to be a futile enterprise to anyone with a Twitter account. Novartis, meanwhile, admitted realizing Cohen was essentially conning them after just one meeting, but ended up paying out a 12-month, $1.2 million contract anyway, reportedly because they were afraid to anger Trump. So the game Cohen played was just that: a con, an exchange of cash for the hope of access and favorable treatment, which AT&T, now in an antitrust lawsuit over its proposed purchase of Time Warner, didn't even get. Cohen wasn't shy in his pitch, either: CNN reported he told companies, ""I don't know who's been representing you, but you should fire them all. I'm the guy you should hire. I'm closest to the President. I'm his personal lawyer."" If these aren’t solicitations for bribes, we might as well retire the bribery statute in America. But because Cohen appears to have lied about his clout—because he may even have defrauded those who paid for access or insights or whatever they want to call it—he might have gotten away with it. The only problem was the cash got intermingled with Russian oligarch funds and hush money payments. (The fact that Cohen was a deputy finance chairman for the Republican National Committee should also draw law enforcement questions. Did the party get a piece of this action?) Cohen’s grift was not unusual among Trump hangers-on who didn’t enter the White House. But it also existed long before that rogue’s gallery ever hit Washington. As one lobbyist explained to CNN, the reason Cohen’s aggressive pay-to-play scheme could work was that corporations ""had all of these Hillary (Clinton) consultants lined up and realized when Trump won, they had nobody."" This consulting, this lobbying that isn’t technically lobbying, is legal under current ethics statutes. It exists off the books of lobbyist disclosures. It includes public relations firms and law firms and trade associations and what look like ""independent"" policy organizations paid out of corporate coffers. Lee Fang explained this shadow lobbying best in 2014 in the Nation, citing an estimate that more than twice as much is spent on influencing government as is being officially reported. ""The growth of the influence industry has created a new generation of millionaires while reshaping the region in its wake,"" Fang wrote about Washington. There’s an entire other industry known as political intelligence, where Wall Street firms and other corporate clients pay for snatches of information they can use to make trading bets or change their business strategies. None of that is public either, but the middlemen who thrive off it can make millions leaking tips. Political intelligence firms were poised to face registration requirements under the law banning members of Congress and their staffs from insider trading back in 2012, but that provision got yanked at the last minute. What makes Cohen’s scheme feel sleazier—and the corporations' casual admission of the would-be bribes as well—is that it's just a louder, more explicit version of what happens daily in virtually every office tower in DC. Most people in politics wait to cash in after they complete their tenure in public service; Cohen didn’t even wait until his pal Donald Trump was inaugurated to turn on the money spigot. Obviously, that should be investigated, and if necessary, prosecuted. But the more subtle, more technically legal forms of this game pose a serious problem of their own. As a recent report from the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute on political corruption indicated, the only time the government seems to crack down on it comes in a time of huge scandal. Fortunately, we’re in that moment right now. Hopefully, policymakers won't narrow their focus to the obvious corruption served up by Michael Cohen, but the entire influence industry, which rewards the highest bidders and subverts democracy.

Michael,Gordon,862,https://www.westport-news.com/news/article/School-Start-Time-Committee-closing-in-on-June-12904696.php,"By Justin Papp WESTPORT — Some schools’ opening bells could ring as late as 8:55 a.m. during the 2019-20 school year if the Board of Education chooses to adopt one of several plans presented by the School Start Time Committee. Preliminary suggestions by the School Start Time Committee were discussed at the Board of Education’s meeting on Monday. “The science behind sleep and the benefits of sleep is very convincing and is certainly very important,” said Westport schools’ Director of Pupil Services Mike Rizzo. “We need to make sure that whatever recommendations we make take into account the science and the entire system of which we are a part.” Rizzo is part of the 21-member committee that includes teachers, administrators, public officials, members of the public and a student, tasked with examining the effects — logistical, financial, traffic and otherwise — of making a shift. In one of two options, based on the logistics of bus routes laid out at the committee’s March meeting by School Bus Consultants, Bedford Middle School and Saugatuck Elementary School would open at 7:45 a.m. and close at 2:30 p.m. Staples High School and Coleytown Middle School would open at 8:20 a.m. and close at 3:05 p.m. and the remaining four elementary schools would open at 8:55 a.m. and close at 3:40 p.m. No new buses would be required, and the school could possibly save on its bus contract depending on the length of shifts, according to the consultants. The second option would have both middle schools opening at 7:45 a.m. and close at 2:30 p.m. Staples and Saugatuck Elementary School would be open from 8:15 a.m. to 3 p.m. Greens Farms and Kings Highway elementary schools would be open from 8:40 a.m. to 3:25 p.m., and Coleytown and Long Lots elementary schools would be open from 8:55 a.m. to 3:40 p.m. In this model, two to five additional buses might be needed. “I think we have a real possibility to effect change,” said Vik Muktavaram, a board member on the committee. The committee will issue a parent survey of the options and, using those results, hopes to present several scenarios to Superintendent of Schools Colleen Palmer in June. “We were really hoping to gather lots of information from different vantage points so that we knew some of the areas of concern, as well as some of the arguments for looking at a change in start times,” said Christine Wanner, K-12 health and physical education coordinator at Westport schools. Palmer is expected to make a suggestion to the Board of Education in June, and the board is expected to vote in the fall for adoption in the 2019-20 school year. Board of Education and committee member Candi Savin said the decision to change start times was an important one and worried the board was rushing the matter. Asked by board Chairman Michael Gordon if a suggestion could be made by the June deadline, Rizzo was careful but confident. “I think we’re going to be able to make a recommendation. I’m cautious about how firm that will be,” Rizzo said. justin.papp@scni.com; @justinjpapp1; 203-842-2586

Rick,McVey,859,http://www.caswellmessenger.com/news/article_0e22d20a-53ba-11e8-9e33-43ba31df577b.html,"Kenneth Travis Posted: Wednesday, May 9, 2018 2:51 pm $36.5 million school bond approved By ADAM POWELL Caswell Messenger Editor caswellmessenger.com During Monday morning’s Caswell County Commissioners meeting, the elected officials approved in a series of contested votes the terms of the county’s proposed bond referendum that will go on the November ballot for renovations to Bartlett Yancey High School and security improvements systemwide. The Commissioners agreed to submit an application for a bond resolution not to exceed $36.5 million. Five of the six Commissioners present at the meeting voted in favor of a bond not exceeding $36.5 million, with Kenneth Travis providing the only dissenting vote. “The figure that we discussed in the previous workshop was $36.5 million, which includes $1.5 million for security for the other schools in addition to Bartlett Yancey,” Commissioner Sterling Carter said. “That is the figure that we concluded by consensus (would be needed).” There was considerable debate over whether to make the bond a 30-year or a 40-year loan. The Commissioners have been debating for several weeks on whether to issue a longer-term loan, which will create shorter payments in the near term, but will make larger payments decades down the line. “I’m not in favor of this 40-year loan. I understand they’re trying to make it easier on the taxpayers (in the short term). But also understand you’re paying $8 million more in interest when you do a 40-year loan. That money is gone,” Commissioner Rick McVey said at last week’s joint work session with the Board of Education. “I know we’ve talked about paying it off early - and I hope we can do that,” McVey continued. “But I want you all to understand that will be $8 million out the window if you do a 40-year loan. You’re cutting your interest down so much when you do a lesser amount of time. I hope we pay it off early. I hope someone has the principle to do that.” During Monday’s session, Commissioners David Owen and Jeremiah Jefferies debated the terms. Owen agrees with McVey that 30 years is the way to go, while Jefferies supported a 40-year bond length. “Just for your information, we need to realize that this is going to cost Caswell County an additional $8 million. At least, at minimum, an additional $8 million over that ten extra years,” Owen said. “That’s if we use the ten years,” Jefferies responded. “We can pay off a 30-year loan early and save (as well). This county has never paid off anything that I know of,” Owen said. “I just want the public to be aware $8 million additional dollars, this county is gonna spend. I would rather that $8 million be spent on infrastructure, or something here in the county. We have enough of our own issues. But I just want everyone to be aware - $8 million dollars.” “You don’t have to use 40 years to get the money. We might pay it off early,” Jefferies said. “Mr. Jefferies was the only one that voted against the 30 year (loan term when a vote was initially held),” Sterling Carter stated. “I was bringing that back up for consideration, because based on previous workshops, and last week in particular (the joint session between the Commissioners and the Board of Education), we have some Commissioners that now want 40 years. And I’m adding my name to that list of Commissioners that will request the 40-year term.” Carter motioned to make the referendum 40 years, which Jefferies seconded. The vote on the proposed 40-year term was split, with three Commissioners - Sterling Carter, William Carter, and Jefferies - in favor of the 40 years. Three others - Owen, McVey, and Travis - voted against the measure. With a 3-3 split - Board Chair Nathaniel Hall was not in attendance - the motion could not move forward. William Carter proposed using approximately $3 million in county funds earmarked to help pay down the total $36.5 million debt for immediate security concerns across Caswell County Schools. “I know security is of utmost importance to our schools. There’s nearly $3 million for security in all the schools. That could be something we could have, and get it going right away,” Carter said. “To use the $3 million as a down payment, I just feel that should go to security for the schools. That money is best suited for the security of the schools instead of a down payment on the financing. I just want you to realize that $3 million could be put for the security of the schools.” Although Carter had the support of fellow Commissioner Kenneth Travis, his motion to earmark the $3 million for immediate security concerns was beaten by a 4-2 vote. The $3 million will instead go towards debt service against the total $36.5 million bond. Moments later, Jefferies proposed the 40-year loan as a motion for a second time. But William Carter, who had been in support of the 40-year term previously, switched back in favor of a 30-year term after losing the vote on addressing immediate security needs in Caswell County Schools. With Carter’s vote, there was a 4-2 majority rejecting the 40 year term, effectively ensuring the term would be 30 years. Owen successfully motioned to make the terms of the bond 30 years, which was approved by a 4-2 vote. Commissioners Jefferies and Sterling Carter voted against the 30-year bond length. In total, the bond will issue $33.5 million to Caswell County for the school repairs ($36.5 million minus the $3 million debt service payment), with an eventual tax increase of 7.75 cents per 100 dollars of assessed value. That tax increase will begin in approximately five years. With the Commissioners’ vote, Caswell County officials will formally apply the Notice of Intent for the bond referendum to the LGC (Local Government Commission) for processing.

They received their awards during the School of Nursing's annual pinning ceremony. USC Aiken nursing graduate Sharon Seufert said she was surprised Wednesday afternoon to receive the Spirit of Caring Award from her classmates. “I actually voted for somebody else,” Seufert said and laughed after the School of Nursing's annual pinning ceremony in the Etherredge Center. “I was very encouraged and just overwhelmed by the love that my classmates have shown to me. I guess by loving them they showed me that they love me back, too, and they have all throughout school. I really, really appreciate my classmates for this.” The Spirit of Caring Award is given to the student who consistently has displayed caring behavior to patients and classmates. Members of the graduating class cast secret votes to choose the winner. Seufert said she has applied for several positions and is waiting for responses. Her goal is to become a pediatric emergency nurse and, eventually, go to graduate school to become a pediatric nurse practitioner. “I'm excited to become a nurse, and I'm excited that all my classmates are, too,” she said. “I'm excited to finally be able to do what I love and not have to worry about a test afterward. I just enjoy nursing and caring for people.” The nursing students honored Dr. Vicki Long with the Lamp of Learning Award. Before presenting Long the award, nursing graduate Kristy Ghrist said of her, “She strives every day to push her students to become the best nurses they can be and encourages them to never stop learning and excelling to the next level of their careers.” After the ceremony, Long, who is retiring, said the award from the students is especially meaningful because the have worked hard. “It's a pleasure to teach these students. It's not work,” she said. “They've got so much potential.” Long, who retired from private practice as a nurse midwife after 30 years before starting a second career at USCA in 2012, said retirement will be another chapter in her life. “It's hard to leave teaching, but when you're a nurse, you're always teaching no matter what you're doing,” she said. The tradition of the nursing pin in the U.S. dates back to 1880 when the first Nightingale school, named for Florence Nightingale, was established. Nightingale is generally considered the founder of modern nursing. In addition to receiving their nursing pins, graduates lit a candle and recited the Florence Nightingale Pledge during the ceremony, held the afternoon before commencement Wednesday night. ""The lighting of the candle is symbolic and reminds students that they have dedicated their hands to nursing and human caring,"" said Dr. Thayer McGahee, dean of the USCA School of Nursing. ""Our nurses pursue excellence and believe excellence is a personal code of conduct. Pursuing excellence in nursing daily means that you strive to give better care today than yesterday, and you allow each day to teach you something useful for tomorrow. ""Congratulations to all these nurses who are equipped and ready – and committed – to excellence in nursing.""

Robin Williams. “I genuinely believe that having [members of the spouse community] around you who understand where you’re coming from or understand military life in general, those are the people who are going to help you the most,” said Reyna. (Courtesy photo) see less | View Image Page SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, Ill. – Minutes after receiving the phone call that brought news that her wife would be deploying, Reyna Williams explained how she would find the most support and comfort in the Scott Air Force Base spouse community. “I will honestly be calling everyone just to be like, ‘Okay, I need you guys,’” she said. “Nobody will understand that like another spouse.” Because of the unique challenges that military families face such as having a spouse deployed, military spouses lean on each other as if they were family. Whether it be helping to alleviate everyday stresses or helping each other through a time of grief, spouses play a crucial role in taking care of Airmen and their families. To show these spouses that their role is valued, all military branches are celebrating Spouse Appreciation Day on May 11, 2018. The day honors military spouses’ vital role in helping the military members perform their missions. 2017 Military Spouse of the Year Felicia Davis, who is married to Tech. Sgt. Andrew Davis, Air Force Space Command Cyberspace Support Squadron, said that “as a spouse, you always need to lean on someone for moral support.” Davis also spoke about how, when military members and their dependents are stationed away from any family, the spouse community steps in and fills that role. Davis is a member of the Scott Spouses’ Club, an organization whose goal is to organize educational, charitable, and social activities to benefit the base and its surrounding community. Additionally, the group helps support each other and other spouses during times of hardship and stress, helping create the feeling of being part of a family. “Your military families around you, you all become one big family,” said Davis. “My girls call [our neighbors on base] auntie and uncle, and their girls do the same vice versa.” When Davis’ husband wasn’t able to make it to their family spring break trip due to work, her neighbor, also a military spouse, filled in his place at the last minute. “We all made it a big friend trip,” Davis said. Williams, who is married to Air Mobility Command administration craftsman Master Sgt. Robin Williams, also stressed how the spouse community acts like family away from home. She has grown close with other spouses at Scott as a member of the Key Spouse Program, an official Air Force program that fosters relationships between spouses and unit leaders. “[Spouses] are your family, in a sense,” Williams said. “They are able to help you in ways that your family, who is four states away, can’t.” One of the ways they can support each other and their military spouses is by providing necessary support during times of grief and hardship. When her wife was stationed in Yokota Air Base, Williams witnessed the spouse community band together like family to help an Airman whose in-laws passed away back-to-back. “We would help with, ‘Hey, can we bring you food? Do you need a break and want us to watch your daughter for a bit?’” said Williams. Their efforts ultimately helped to relieve some of the stress that family was experiencing. At Lackland Air Force Base, Davis also witnessed spouses aiding in the grieving process after a service member was killed in an on-base shooting. She said that spouses protected the victims’ families from media trying to invade their personal space during their time of grief. “When the media hears things, they become hounds,” said Davis. “We had spouses standing guard on their block.

Moments earlier, Wright, who was in Iraq to cover the 2007 surge in U.S. forces there, had just had his conversation with two special assistants to Gen. David Petraeus *85 *87 interrupted. What’s more, the teenager responsible for horning in on the conversation looked a lot like Harry Potter — “from the early movies,” Wright recalled. The Potter look-alike was Wesley Morgan ’11, then still a blogger for The Daily Princetonian. Wright didn’t stay annoyed at him for long. “He had an incredibly detailed knowledge of force dispositions across the Mideast,” Wright said. “He knew, like, everything.” How did this ecosystem of bases — and endless violence — come to be? Answers to Morgan’s most basic questions were hard to come by. Soon, Wright sought to take advantage of Morgan’s knowledge by consulting him before interviews — to ensure he had a complete picture of whomever he was preparing to meet. A self-described “military history nerd,” Morgan grew up in Watertown, Mass., where his high school lacked a student newspaper. He joined the Prince as a freshman. An interview that year with Petraeus, a Wilson School graduate who was then the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, turned into a summer embedded with troops. There, Morgan demonstrated to war reporters, including Wright and longtime New York Times military correspondent Michael Gordon, that he had a willingness to go wherever the stories led him. On one occasion, Morgan volunteered to go with troops struggling to defend against a type of explosive designed to penetrate armored vehicles, recalls Wright, who tried to stop his young colleague. Morgan refused. He didn’t want to be in Iraq and not follow certain stories, he told Wright. That desire to follow the story brought Morgan back to Iraq in 2008 and then, with some time off from school, to Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. With its jagged peaks and green valleys, veterans say Afghanistan’s northeastern Kunar province resembles Colorado or Alaska. Mountains mark the border with Pakistan to the east. And bisecting the province lengthwise is the Kunar River, a major tributary of which is called the Pech. Despite its beauty, the Pech River valley — like its more well-known Korengal valley neighbor — was also incredibly deadly. U.S. troops held the remote territory through a series of outposts, one of which was notorious for being the most frequently attacked in eastern Afghanistan, said Morgan. How did this ecosystem of bases — and endless violence — come to be? Answers to Morgan’s most basic questions were hard to come by, as each unit’s memory only extended to the unit it succeeded. Osama bin Laden, Morgan would learn, had a lot to do with U.S. involvement in the Pech — at least, initially. The Al-Qaeda leader was said to have passed through the area after his escape from the Tora Bora caves and the U.S. was keen to pick up his trail. But what started as a counterterrorism operation cycled back and forth into full-fledged counterinsurgency for years. Morgan wanted to know, among other things, whether it was all worth it. The remote valley was of questionable strategic importance and, with its lack of infrastructure, supplying it was exceedingly difficult. Realizing, however, that working as a teenage freelancer without a college degree was perhaps not the most sustainable lifestyle, Morgan first sought to answer his questions in a senior thesis that would allow him to graduate. In his thesis evaluation, adviser Michael Reynolds noted that the subject of recent U.S. military operations in a remote area of Afghanistan “does not lend itself easily to research,” but that Morgan “succeeded admirably.” Morgan, however, was far from done. Years later, now a defense reporter at Politico, Morgan is nearing completion of a book on the Pech River valley. In it, he also pulls in the perspective of Afghan Army troops, with whom he embedded, as well as the memories of Soviet veterans. “People will talk to you for things in a book that they won’t for a story coming out tomorrow or next week,” Morgan said. “There’s a longer flash-to-bang.” Among those people is Col. William Ostlund, director of military instruction at West Point, who served 15 months in the area. He said Morgan will be producing a “lifetime of lessons” from the Pech. Joseph Holliday ’06, who served in Kunar as an intelligence officer with the 101st Airborne Division, also hopes Morgan’s “longer arc perspective” will help the U.S. parse the lessons it learned in Afghanistan. “People like to say we haven’t learned from previous experience, but that’s not true,” said Holliday, whom Morgan consulted for the book. “The work done by historians was applied — and applied constructively — to how we dealt with Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe it will be so for these latest wars as well.” Jeremy Nobel ’77 on loneliness; Theater director Lileana Blain-Cruz ’06; Civil-rights fall break View Current Issue Jeremy Nobel ’77 on loneliness; Theater director Lileana Blain-Cruz ’06; Civil-rights fall break View Current Issue Tell Us What You Think Use our simple online form to share your views with other PAW readers Jeremy Nobel ’77 on loneliness; Theater director Lileana Blain-Cruz ’06; Civil-rights fall break In This Issue From The Editor Download PDF Parents and non-alumni can receive all 14 issues of PAW for $22 a year ($26 for international addresses).

Michael,Gordon,852,http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-ad-campaign-20180509-story.html,"Deb Gabor was watching television recently when a Wells Fargo & Co. commercial caught her attention. The ad was part of a new campaign, called Re-Established, that the banking giant began rolling out this week to help it move past its massive fake-accounts scandal and reassure customers. The commercial opens with the bank's origins in the Old West, references the scandal and fast-forwards to depict dedicated bank employees and happy customers as a narrator assures viewers: ""It's a new day at Wells Fargo."" The spot made Gabor perk up because she's chief executive of Sol Marketing in Austin, Texas, whose services include corporate-crisis help, and because she's also a Wells Fargo customer. But the commercial left her wanting. ""This ad campaign leaves me scratching my head and wondering if Wells Fargo is strong enough as a brand that it can withstand this kind of crisis,"" said Gabor, who felt the ad came across as ""really insincere and inauthentic to me, like they were trying too hard."" The scandal surrounding the San Francisco bank stemmed from its aggressive ""cross-selling efforts,"" in which employees created millions of new accounts in customers' names without their consent, such as new credit-card accounts, to meet sales goals. The tactics were first uncovered by the Los Angeles Times in 2013, and the scandal mushroomed in September 2016 when the bank agreed to pay $185 million to settle investigations of the cross-selling practices by federal regulators and Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer. Amid the scandal, John Stumpf abruptly resigned as Wells Fargo's chief executive. He was replaced by longtime Wells Fargo executive Timothy Sloan, who's trying to thoroughly restructure the bank to avoid repeating its past mistakes. The new ad campaign ""marks a turning point by expressing how we are fundamentally a different company today,"" Sloan said in a statement. ""While we have made solid progress, we recognize there is still work to be done."" The campaign's advertising is being run nationwide on TV, in print publications, on digital platforms and mobile channels — a campaign analysts said will probably cost millions of dollars. Its first one-minute commercial, called ""Trust,"" recalls Wells Fargo's origins in the 19th century as a trusted carrier of gold and other goods by stagecoach, noting that ""we always found the way — until we lost it,"" a reference to the scandal. The commercial's narrator goes on to say Wells Fargo is making ""a complete recommitment to you, fixing what went wrong, making things right, and ending product-sales goals for branch bankers so we can focus on your satisfaction."" ""We're holding ourselves accountable to find and fix issues proactively, because earning back your trust is our greatest priority,"" the narrator says. Sloan and other Wells Fargo executives are expected to elaborate on the bank's overhaul Thursday when they meet with institutional investors and analysts. A webcast of the conference will be available to the public. But the campaign faces head winds, including that customers continue to read and hear about Wells Fargo's scandal. For instance, the bank agreed Friday to pay $480 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by shareholders who accused Wells Fargo of securities fraud related to the scandal. Wells Fargo denied the allegations but said it settled to avoid the cost and disruption of further litigation. And last month, federal regulators hit Wells Fargo with a $1-billion penalty for other abuses that harmed mortgage and auto-loan borrowers, one of the largest fines levied against a U.S. bank that was not related to the financial crisis. The Federal Reserve even took the rare step in February of ordering the bank to cap its growth in assets at $1.95 trillion while it works to improve its corporate governance for what the Fed called ""widespread consumer abuses and other compliance breakdowns."" Stephen Beck, founder of cg42, a management consulting firm that's researched the Wells Fargo scandal, said he doubts the campaign will be effective, noting the bank already had run ad campaigns aimed at repairing its image with customers before the latest enforcement actions. ""It's always easy to run an ad campaign,"" Beck said. ""It's hard to change a culture, and consumers are smart enough to know that advertising is not to be trusted."" In the prior campaigns, Wells Fargo ""trotted out the stagecoach just like they're trotting out the stagecoach here,"" Beck said. Now, the bank's posture is ""let's say this time that we've learned and we're reestablishing,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that, when the fake-accounts scandal was going on, if you downloaded their mission, vision and values, they're not dramatically different than they are today,"" Beck said. ""They were false and hollow then, and what's to make the consumer believe that these aren't false and hollow now?"" Gabor said she also thought Wells Fargo would have been better served by having Sloan in the commercial, noting other cases in which executives have made ads more effective. One example: Auto executive Lee Iacocca appeared in TV commercials in the 1980s that helped Chrysler rebound from near extinction. ""I was looking for someone from Wells Fargo, like a human being, to say, 'We accept responsibility, this is our plan, I personally own this plan and I'm going to hold myself responsible,' "" Gabor said. ""I might have liked to have seen Tim Sloan himself be part of the apology."" But others lauded Wells Fargo's campaign. ""I thought it was an artful, smart ad in that it acknowledges the scandal but very clearly talks about how they are doing things differently, of how the foundation of the company is and will be strong,"" said Michael Gordon, chief executive of Group Gordon, a corporate and crisis-communications firm. Still, Gordon agreed that ""an apology is only as good as the actions that follow. What's more important to the consumer is the action. They don't want to see the same mistakes repeated again."" james.peltz@latimes.com Twitter: @PeltzLATimes

Phillip,Frost,851,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180509005617/en/Ladenburg-Reports-Quarter-2018-Financial-Results,"Highlights: MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very encouraged by our first quarter 2018 results which exhibited robust growth in revenues, profitability and client assets. Favorable market conditions and an increasing interest rate environment, coupled with solid execution by our management team, contributed to our strong performance. We remain laser-focused on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.” Richard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All of Ladenburg’s businesses performed well in the first quarter, with revenues of $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from the prior year period, and a 169.2% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $20.2 million. The continued growth in our nationwide network of independent financial advisors to over 4,300 reflects our success in recruiting talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $166.2 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $73.6 billion, up 15.2% and 22.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to drive further margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.” Adoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (""ASC 606""). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Table 3). For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $31.1 million, a decrease in total expenses of $34.4 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $1.7 million, and no change to diluted loss per common share of $0.02. First Quarter 2018 First quarter 2018 revenues were $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from revenues of $290.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 25.6% to $163.3 million from $130.1 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity and mutual fund products and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 9.9% to $114.4 million from $127.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 154.1% to $16.5 million from $6.5 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to improved market conditions. Also, service fees revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 34.2% to $24.9 million from $18.6 million, due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs. Net income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.5 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $3.0 million or ($0.02) per basic and diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $11.6 million or ($0.06) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The first quarter 2018 results included $2.2 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.2 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $1.9 million of interest expense. The first quarter 2017 results included $0.8 million of income tax benefit, $8.9 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.6 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense. Recurring Revenues For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.4% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment. EBITDA, as adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.2 million, an increase of 169.2% from $7.5 million in the comparable 2017 period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue. Also, our Ladenburg segment EBITDA, as adjusted, was higher as a result of increased investment banking revenues. Client Assets At March 31, 2018, total client assets under administration were $166.2 billion, a 15.2% increase from $144.3 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.6 billion, including approximately $4.2 billion participating in our cash sweep programs. Stock Repurchases During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 534,697 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 285,400 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.23. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $58.1 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.14. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,864,385 shares under its current repurchase plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.

Sanford Stadium’s privet hedges, which cover about 5,000 square feet around the playing field have survived disease, winter weather and more than one move. The hedges are not just cosmetic there is a low chain-link fence running through the branches to aid in crowd control. It didn’t help on Oct. 7, 2000, when Georgia fans destroyed the hedges as they stormed the field to celebrate Georgia’s first win over Tennessee since 1988. The privet Ligustrum hedges were temporarily removed from the west and south sides of the field after the 2017 season — and were stored for months at secret locations — to accommodate a construction crane on the field, but they were replanted in their original positions in time for the 2018 G-Day game. It is not the first time the hedges have been removed. They were moved out to make room for a soccer field during the 1996 Olympics and replanted before football season. The hedges were less-than-lush for Georgia’s spring game after an aggressive pruning, but UGA officials expect them to be rejuvenated by the start of the 2018 season. From 1929 to 2017, the Bulldogs are 346-106-9 between the hedges. No better place to be than betweeeeeen the hedges! #TraditionTuesday#GoDawgs pic.twitter.com/G34OlxLVr8 © 2018 Cox Media Group

Farmington's Nolan Mohr took fourth place in the long jump with 20 feet, 10.25 inches, at the second annual New Balance Invitational track and field meet hosted by Farmington High School.(Photo: Dan Dean | hometownlife.com)Buy Photo Outside of a late-meet glitch, the second annual New Balance Invitational track meet was declared another positive event. The boys and girls meet, hosted jointly by Farmington and Salem high schools and held May 5, proved to be a high-quality affair featuring 41 schools. While it was a long day — field events and prelims started 11 a.m. and the final event ended by 9 p.m. — there was no shortage of exciting races. ""We're pleased overall. We had one snafu (a seeding sheet failed to get updated, which caused a 15-minute delay), but that won't happen again,"" said Farmington head coach Chip Bridges, who was co-meet manager along with Salem assistant Steve Aspinall and his assistant Kim Adams. ""Other than that, everything went pretty smoothly. More: Salem track teams run strong at New Balance meet More: Super soph McNamara leads Northville girls at Golden Triangle meet ""The feedback we've gotten has been positive,"" he added. ""We want this to be a high-quality meet where people can come here and say, 'Hey, we can go run a time' and leave here with confidence going into their league meets and stuff like that. We want to provide that kind of experience."" Salem's boys team captured the team championship for the second straight season with 97 points. Lake Orion won the girls meet with 78.5 points, while Salem took runner-up honors with 52.5 points. There were some excellent individual performances that had the crowd cheering loudly, none more so than Evanston (Ill.) High School distance runner Enyaeva Michelin. The senior lapped multiple runners in the 3,200-meter run and cruised to a 51-second victory over West Bloomfield's Kyla Christopher-Moody in 10:16.58. Michelin's time would have won last year's Michigan state championship meet by three seconds. In other local girls results, Bloomfield Hills senior Olivia Lopez produced a stellar showing the the long jump. The Michigan State-bound Lopez won in a meet- and school-record leap of 17 feet, 9½ inches. Olivia Lopez (Photo: Marty Budner) ""At first I was kind of skeptical, because I hadn't been feeling good this past week,"" said Lopez, who also holds six other school track and field records. ""But I think what helped was the weather and the pit was really nice. So I was able to get a lot of bounce on the board. ""I think with all the work I've done the past two or three years, everything just came together today,"" she added. ""It's been a good four years all-around for me."" Bloomfield Hills head coach Nick Stration indicated Lopez, a two-year team captain, has certainly made her mark in the Black Hawks program. ""There are 16 track and field events and, when you have seven records, that tells you she is a very valuable piece to our program,"" Stration said. ""This is the fifth year for our school, so some of the records are still just kind of coming along. But those records she has are very competitive ones. They would stack up at any school. ""Since her freshman year, she's improved on the versatility of the events she's in,"" he added. ""She really kind of specialized in the 400 as a freshman to qualifying for states in the 200, long jump, 4-by-100, 4-by-200 (relays) and, with all those records, it shows you she has a lot of range."" Farmington freshman Valadian Pallett also had an outstanding performance, winning the shot put with a toss of 42-7. She was second in the discus at 131-6. Birmingham Seaholm junior Makayla Rawls took the discus with a toss of 133-4. ""She won the shot put, but her big throw of the day was in the discus,"" Bridges said about Pallett. ""I believe the discus was a school record. And she already owns the shot put record."" Plymouth junior Reghan Draper took the 100-meter dash in 12.29 and the school's 400-meter relay team won in 49.73, just breaking the tape ahead of Bloomfield Hills (49.88). Plymouth junior Reghan Draper (left) wins the 100-meter dash, followed by Clinton Valley's Reynei Wallace at the second annual New Balance Invitational track and field meet hosted by Farmington High School. (Photo: Dan Dean | hometownlife.com) Seaholm's 3,200-meter girls relay won in 9:28.16, more than nine seconds ahead of second-place Lake Orion (9:37.35). Salem freshman Macayla Harris won the high jump (5-2). On the boys side, Salem's winners were Andrew Davis (100), Sharriff Dyer (300 hurdles) and the 800, 1,600 and 3,200 relay teams. Churchill's Martell Cooley won the long jump (21-0), Canton's Evan Carter took the pole vault (13-0), Seaholm's Ben Barton won the 400 (50.29) and Groves sophomore Ralph Donaldson won the 200 (personal-record of 22.89). ""Going into (the 200), I felt a little nervous not knowing what was going to happen,"" Donaldson said. ""It was kind of shocking that I won. I was looking at some of the times and they were all so close. I don't know what I was expecting, but it was my best race of the season."" The field athletes of the meet were Southfield's Jalen Edwards (discus winner at 147-4) and Waterford Kettering pole vaulter Jessica Mercier (winner in 13-3). The track athletes of the meet were Salem's Davis and Evanston's Michelin. Bridges said the New Balance meet is timed so that teams can prepare for the upcoming league and state championship meets. The goal is to make it as high quality as possible. ""New Balance does great sponsorship with their Athlete of the Meet awards and medals that they have,"" Bridges said. ""We hope it's stuff that the kids appreciate which will want them to come back year after year after year. ""Our hope is to have a third one,"" he added. ""We want to provide a quality experience, for sure."" Contact Marty Budner at mbudner@hometownlife.com. Follow him on Twitter: @MartyBudner.

Andrew,Davis,848,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Trans-protections-Dykes-on-Bikes-death-leather-district-/62811.html,"Dykes on Bikes announced that founding member Soni Wolf, ""an inspiring mother of the movement for lesbian pride and dignity"" died April 25 of natural causes at age 69, according to a National Center for Lesbian Rights press release. NCLR Executive Director Kate Kendell said, in part, ""Soni was a fierce advocate whose life exemplified the power of visionary courage, freedom, and feminist solidarity. We've been immeasurably enriched by knowing her, and next month at Pride, we'll see Soni's legacy live on."" The National Center for Lesbian Rights ( NCLR ) and the Brooke Oliver Law Group represented Dykes on Bikes in an action to register its name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Supervisors in San Francisco have unanimously approved a resolution authorizing a gay and leather cultural district in the city's South of Market neighborhood, The Washington Post reported. Supervisor Jane Kim said before the May 1 vote that legislation to designate a cultural district has been more than a decade in the making. The neighborhood remains home to gay and kink bars and the popular Folsom Street Fair, which draws thousands of people every year to celebrate ""leather sexuality."" Lesbian couple Ashley and LaNisha Davis of Purvis, Mississippi, were set to pick up their foster child from Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg on March 3but the legal system stopped them from doing so, the Clarion Ledger reported. ( The biological mother had signed away her parental rights, Ashley said, and the Davis' caseworker told them they could start the adoption process immediately. ) The problem for the couple is that Forrest County Youth Court Judge Mike McPhail wanted the baby to stay in Forrest Countybut LaNisha is active-duty military, and the couple planned to move to New Mexico in May. A gay man who marched in heels in his city's Veterans Day parade last year was elected mayor of his town, LGBTQ Nation noted. Bruno ""Ralphy"" Lozano, 35, is a U.S. Air Force veteran and is now the mayor-elect of Del Rio, a town in southwestern Texas along the border with Mexico. Del Rio has a population of 41,000, and the unofficial election results show that about 3,500 people voted in the electionwith about 65 percent of the vote going to Lozano over incumbent Robert Garza. NMAC has announced that legendary HIV activist/writer Larry Kramer will speak at the United States Conference on AIDS ( USCA ) on Sept. 7, , in Orlando, a press release noted. ( USCA will run Sept. 6-9, according to NMAC's website. ) Since 1987, NMAC has advanced its mission through a variety of programs and services, including: a public policy education program, national and regional training conferences, a treatment and research program, numerous electronic and print materials, and a website: NMAC.org . Following some comments he made about Vice President Mike Pence, Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf found himself on the receiving end of intense online attacks from right-wing activists, including threats on his life, NewNowNext.com noted. During a recent segment of Tucker Carlson's show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, the right-wing TV host centered on comments that Wolf has made against Pence. On the show, Wolf discussed the vice president, saying that he would put LGBT people in ""concentration camps hoping to pray the gay away"" if Pence became president. ( Wolf later tweeted that he meant ""conversion"" instead of ""concentration."" ) The state of California is suing an El Cajon gym over allegations that it denied a transgender woman access to the women's locker room there for almost a year, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which enforces state civil rights laws, sued Crunch Fitness on Jamacha Road in mid-April, alleging intentional discrimination against Christynne Wood ""on the basis of her sex, specifically her gender identity and gender expression."" Among other things, the suit asks that the gym be required to provide appropriate training to all managers and employees on obligations under the Unruh Act, with special emphasis on gender identity and the prevention of harassment, according to an ACLU press release. The complaint is at https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/aclu_socal_wood_20180502_complaint.pdf.� Failed Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama filed a new lawsuit against some of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, claiming they were part of a ""political conspiracy"" to derail his 2017 campaign, Time.com noted. Moore's attorney, Melissa Isaak, said at a news conference in Gadsden that the accusations raised against Moore shortly before the special Senate election are ""false."" She also said that his accusers, and others, hoped to see him lose the Dec. 12 ballot. Ex-LGBTQ activists held a rally this weekend in Washington, D.C., that a grand total of 36 people attended, LGBTQ Nation noted. The ""Freedom March,"" organized by Voice of the Voiceless, was held at the National Sylvan Theater. ( Voice of the Voiceless is an ex-LGBTQ group that has advocated for conversion therapy on college campuses. ) The rally had several speakers, including ex-transgender activist Jeffrey McCall, Pulse shooting survivor Luis Ruiz and ""Activist Mommy"" Elizabeth Johnston. Iowa's predominantly Republican legislature passed a bill that would prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detecteda significant step toward enacting one of the most restrictive laws of its kind in the United States, The Washington Post reported. The ""heartbeat"" bill, which would ban abortions as early as six weeksaround the time women generally feel early signs of pregnancy and before many even realize they are pregnantpassed through the Iowa House by a vote of 51-46 on May 1. The state Senate passed the bill 29-17 on May 2, sending it to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has said abortion is ""equivalent to murder."" A Brooklyn teacher was arrested following allegations that he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old male student, ABC News reported. Andre Braddyan eighth-grade math teacher at PS 235 in East Flatbushallegedly had multiple sexual encounters with a student in a school bathroom. Braddy, 34, faces charges of sex abuse, engaging in a criminal sex act and committing an act in a manner injurious to a child. Openly gay student Adam Bell, 18, voted prom king at South Carolina's Powdersville High School, has taken social media by stormbecause this king wore a dress, LGBTQ Nation reported. To win the honor, Bell received 49 percent of his classmates' votes in the school of 840 studentsa strong statement in the northwest South Carolina community. The prom outfit was a white top from Victoria's Secret and a green velvet skirt from House of CB, he told Teen Vogue. At its annual developers conference, F8, Facebook announced a new dating feature, CNNMoney reported. Users can set up a dating profile with their first name, which the company said won't be visible to friends and will not appear in News Feeds. The feature is opt-in and users will not be matched with people they are already friends with, according to Facebook. People close to U.S. Sen. John McCain have told the White House that the ailing Arizona Republican does not want President Donald Trump to attend his funeral and would like Vice President Mike Pence to come instead, NBC News reported. McCain, 81, has been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer for nearly a year, and is back home in Arizona after he underwent surgery last month for an intestinal infection. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush plan to be eulogists at McCain's funeral service, which is to be held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Navy has halted its practice of announcing the names of commanders relieved for poor performance or misconduct, USA Today noted. It's a move that comes in the wake of one of the worst bribery scandals in Pentagon history. U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier of California, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, criticized the Navy's change in practice. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his resignation just hours after four women accused him of physically abusing them, New York Magazine reported. In a report from The New Yorker's Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow the four womenthree of whom had romantic relationships with Schneiderman, and a fourth who rebuffed his advancesaccused him of choking and slapping them, and engaging in other controlling, demeaning and threatening behavior. Schneiderman had positioned himself as a champion of the #MeToo movement, as he filed a civil rights suit against Harvey Weinstein and his company. The embattled chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives has won his job back just hours after sending a scalding letter to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that accused a top Ryan aide of telling him ""something like 'maybe it's time that we had a chaplain that wasn't a Catholic,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, forced the Rev. Pat Conroy to tender his resignation last month, sparking a firestorm. Ryan has said he was dissatisfied with Conroy's pastoral care to lawmakers. An additional 27 women have accused journalist Charlie Rose of a wide array of sexual misconduct, TheWrap reported, citing a Washington Post article. Fourteen women who worked with Rose at CBS accused him of misconduct, while and additional 13 said they were harassed at other companies. In a statement to the Post, CBS said, ""Since we terminated Charlie Rose, we've worked to strengthen existing systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work.""

Michael,Gordon,847,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/08/gold-coast-titans-coach-garth-brennan-drops-bryce-cartwright-konrad-hurrell-with-aj-brimson-to-make-nrl-debut/,"TITANS Four successive losses have prompted Garth Brennan to make his first team shake-up in his young Telstra Premiership coaching career, dropping his ""favourite player"" Konrad Hurrell and blooding 19-year-old five-eighth Alexander Brimson. It is a big call for Brennan to throw Brimson into Saturday's double-header clash with Melbourne at Suncorp Stadium where he will oppose Storm star Cameron Munster. He becomes Ash Taylor's third halves partner this season behind Kane Elgey and Bryce Cartwright. Brimson joins another teenager, 18-year-old prop Moeaki Fotuaika, who made a surprise debut in the front row off the bench against Canberra's monster pack last Saturday, in the top 17. When asked whether pitching Brimson, who has been playing fullback for feeder team Tweed Heads Seagulls, into the cauldron of a double-header in Brisbane against a ruthless Storm side desperate to strike back after a 20-point loss to the Dragons, Brennan confessed: ""In the NRL there is no easy week."" The reality is he had to act to end his team's slide. Cartwright, who has been named on the interchange bench against the Storm, has been hesitant in defence and lacking commitment to take the line on with the ball. Brennan, who has been defending Cartwright's form and effort, admitted he had to lift his game when asked to respond to criticism from Fox Sports commentator Michael Ennis, who claimed Cartwright's defence was sub-standard and he was not taking on the line enough. ""I don't think it is unfair [Ennis' criticism],"" said Brennan. ""Mick is a great judge of a game and players and I don't think he is too far wrong. ""Bryce needs to step up, but I haven't helped him by playing him out of position. He did that [played five-eighth] for the team more so than his own personal goals and aspirations."" Hurrell again made crucial errors against the Raiders and with Dale Copley returning from injury and Brenko Lee match-fit after returning from a knee injury suffered in the trials, the hard call had to be made. NSW hooker Nathan Peats has been chosen in the 21-man squad and will play if he can prove he is ready to return from a rib injury. Queensland Origin hopeful Jai Arrow has been rested because of a rib injury. Brimson has been preferred to Elgey who played strongly when sent back to Tweed in the Intrust Super Cup but has had only one match with the Seagulls having a bye last weekend. ""It's a case that he gives me what I'm looking for,"" Brennan said of teenager Brimson. ""He's a strong defender, quite solid in his build. And he's a runner, there's no doubt about that. ""It's not ideal. It's our third halves combination this year. I knew this year was a bit of trial to see what the best way for us was going forward. ""It's exciting. He's one of our local juniors and I've held him back but I thought it was time for him to go in there and see what he can do. He's excited and when I asked him if he thought he was ready he virtually said 'what took you so long'."" Brennan made the call to give the in-form Arrow a break after the middle forward left the field distress in Canberra and was taken to hospital for tests. Lee has had three matches for Burleigh Bears since recovering from his knee injury. He becomes the 11th player to debut for the Titans in the first nine rounds behind Arrow, Cartwright, Brimson, Fotuaika, Michael Gordon, Mitch Rein, Will Matthews, Leilani Latu, Jack Stockwell and Brendan Elliot. Copley set for round one after serious AFL-style hamstring tear 'Concierge' Roberts says he can't afford to slip up at Titans James and fellow Titans join the workforce Titans: 2018 season by the numbers James: Titans will embrace Meninga's cultural revolution

Michael,Gordon,847,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/05/08/melbourne-storm-v-gold-coast-titans-round-10-preview/,"MATCH PREVIEW Can't help but get the feeling the Titans are going to be thrown to the lions this week. After starting the season with three wins from their first five games, Gold Coast have lost four in a row and are about to face a Melbourne Storm team that was walloped by the Dragons last week. Titans coach Garth Brennan has his work cut out this week as he tries to formulate a game plan to get his team ready to play the reigning premiers. Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy openly admitted the Storm didn't measure up against the ''benchmark'' of the competition last week. He said it at the press conference and you can bet he used even more pointed words when he told his team where it stands in relation to the Dragons. It is exactly the kind of challenge the Storm have a great record of responding to and sure to have them intensely focused on returning to the winner's circle this week. If the Titans don't come to play it could get ugly quickly. Round 10 - Round 10 - Saturday 12 May Home Team Storm Away Team Titans Venue: Suncorp Stadium Match broadcasters: Key match-up: Once again a lot of responsibility will fall on the shoulders of senior players Ryan James and Kevin Proctor to get the Titans believing they can pull off an upset. The Dragons exposed the Storm at times in the forwards and James and Proctor need to show teammates that the Titans are capable of finding similar chinks in the Melbourne armour with big games against the likes of Felise Kaufusi and Nelson Asofa-Solomona. For the Storm to win: Some might say they just have to show up, but the premiers have given up a home game to be part of the Indigenous Round double-header at Suncorp Stadium. The Storm will be looking to superstars Cam Smith, Billy Slater and Cameron Munster to get them off to a strong start and probably plan on having the game put to bed by half-time. For the Titans to win: It will take something very special for the slumping Titans to get over Melbourne in this one. They have lost four in a row and can't get anything consistent from their halves. If the Titans can hold Melbourne up front and Ash Taylor picks this week to have a blinder, they might be able to keep it close. Storm stat attack: Melbourne have won nine of their past 10 games at Suncorp and four of their past five against the Titans. Winger Suliasi Vunivalu has scored six tries in his past four games at Suncorp. Titans stat attack: In their previous two trips to Suncorp Stadium the Titans have racked up 64 points. Journeyman fullback Michael Gordon would probably prefer to never face the Storm, losing 13 of the previous 14 games he has played against them. And another thing: The Titans have ridden a roller coaster of highs and lows in their brief existence. After entering the NRL in 2007, the club finished third and fourth in '09 and '10 respectively before bottoming out with the wooden spoon in '11. Storm: 1 Billy Slater, 2 Suliasi Vunivalu, 3 Will Chambers, 4 Curtis Scott, 5 Josh Addo-Carr, 6 Cameron Munster, 7 Ryley Jacks, 8 Christian Welch, 9 Cameron Smith (c), 10 Nelson Asofa-Solomona, 11 Felise Kaufusi, 12 Ryan Hoffman, 13 Dale Finucane Interchange: 14 Brandon Smith, 15 Kenny Bromwich, 16 Joe Stimson, 17 Sam Kasiano Melbourne are 1-17, with Centre Curtis Scott (ankle) returning in place of last week's debutant Justin Olam. Dale Finucane starts at lock with Kenny Bromwich reverting to the bench. Brodie Croft and Tui Kamikamica were omitted from the squad on Friday night, while Olam and Patrick Kaufusi were cut an hour before kick-off. Titans: 1 Michael Gordon, 2 Anthony Don, 3 Dale Copley, 4 Brenko Lee, 5 Phillip Sami, 6 AJ Brimson, 7 Ashley Taylor, 8 Max King, 9 Mitch Rein, 10 Ryan James (c), 11 Kevin Proctor, 12 Will Matthews, 13 Jarrod Wallace Interchange: 14 Bryce Cartwright, 15 Keegan Hipgrave, 16 Jack Stockwell, 17 Moeaki Fotuaika The Titans are also 1-17. Coach Garth Brennan lost patience with last week's underperforming team and made a host of changes. Bryce Cartwright was dropped to the bench with AJ Brimson coming in for a debut. Jai Arrow (ribs) is out with Jarrod Wallace moving to lock, Ryan James shifting back to the front row and Will Matthews (concussion) returning in the second row. Konrad Hurrell and Nathan Peats were cut an hour before kick-off. Melbourne Storm v Gold Coast Titans, Saturday 5.30pm at Suncorp Stadium Head-to-head: Played 17; Storm 11 wins, Titans 6 winsMatches at venue: Played 1; Titans 1 win2017 result: Titans won 38-36 at Suncorp Stadium in round 10Points per game: Storm 25.1; Titans 17.4Points conceded per game: Storm 16.1; Titans 26.6Televised: Live on Fox League Steve Turner's prediction: The Storm know what's required to be the best after a disappointing loss to the ladder-leading Dragons. The staff and the playing group will be quick to turn things around and get back to playing the Melbourne Storm style of football. The Titans are struggling. Key players are down on confidence, there are injuries and finding their next win seems so far away. I'm afraid it won't happen this week.

James,Forese,841,https://financialstrend.com/citigroup-inc-nysec-considers-saudi-expansion-as-banks-aim-to-captalise-on-reforms-46431.html,"Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) has announced plans to seek a full banking license in Saudi Arabia. The move comes in the wake of several western banks that are eying the kingdom. Recently HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE:HSBC) announced that it had secured a number of mandates for several acquisitions in the country. Several other western banks are currently operating in the country. Many have been attracted by the country’s economic reforms that are aimed at shifting Saudi Arabia from over depending on oil revenue. Citi moved out of Saudi Arabia in 2004 after the sale of its 20% holding in Samba Financial after a five-decade presence in the country. However, the company in 2015 secured a licensing allowing it to directly invest in the country’s local stock market. Early this year, the company got approval to start investing in the country’s banking sector. In a statement, James Forese, the president and CEO of the bank’s institutional clients said they are exploring the investment chances in the country. He was speaking after attending a conference in Riyadh. Apart from Citi, other banks that are seeking license in the kingdom are Goldman Sachs, which has been cleared to trade equities and Credit Suisse. The banks are anticipating to have a say in Saudi Aramco’s awaited public offering. The offering will float around 5% of the company, a move that could make one of the largest in the world by market capitalization. Citi has been an active player in Saudi Arabia’s financial sector, having recently helped the country raise $11 billion in a secured bond last month. The country has launched plans to privatize several state corporations in a move aimed at generating around $10.7 billion in oil revenues by 2020. The privatization is also expected to add 12,000 jobs to the market. Saudi Arabia’s privatization plan HSBC has secured approvals to run several privatizations, which it says will be launched in the near future. This was announced by Samir Assaf, the chief executive of global banking and markets of HSBC during the conference. He added that the company is playing a very big plan in the privatization plan.

NAS United Healthcare Services, a UAE-based third party administrator, has decided to deploy Sensely’s virtual health assistant technology to boost engagement and communication channel with its members. Under the terms of the three years agreement, NAS will use Sensely’s software development kit (SDK) to launch unique patient navigation solutions across both mobile and web platforms to 1.2 million members. Locally appropriate variants will be built for the Middle Eastern market for which content will be made available in both English and Arabic. The platform will features a number of member-facing functions such as symptom checker, provider search, appointment booking and prescription refill. The symptom check feature includes clinically-validated algorithms developed by Mayo Clinic, and directs the member to the suitable action plan based on the reported symptoms. Patient navigation tools deployed at scale can produce increased efficiencies in a safe, reliable, and secure manner by directing resource recommendations algorithmically, according to Sensely. NAS CEO Joe Boulos said: “The new member services platform will extend our ability to deliver what our insurance customers and members always ask for, which is an accurate and reassuring way of directing patients through their healthcare journey.” NAS is considering rolling out the platform to its customer base that comes from over 50 health insurance firms and self-funded insurance plans in the Arabian Gulf region.

Photo credit: Elian Lopez Nicte Hernandez Nicte Hernandez PATH Scholars peer coach Elian Lopez spent a weekend in March at the state capitol with the National Association of Social Workers lobbying three different bills. Photo credit: Elian Lopez Nicte HernandezMay 7, 2018Filed under Blogs, Columns, Mobile Headlines, Opinion, Showcase There are many minorities on campus that seem forgotten at times. Whether it is due to lack of awareness, size of the group or complications with the systems in place meant to help them smoothly integrate into society. Numerous groups on campus have expressed frustrations as not enough diverse resources are offered here at Chico State or they lack sufficient funding and attention. One of those organizations is Promoting Achievement Through Hope, or commonly known as PATH Scholars a foster youth program who feels almost discouraged by the college system and its lack of support to their unique group. In my opinion, we must not forget that we all come from different backgrounds and that not all of us had an easy transition into the higher education system nor does it get any easier to stay enrolled. According to USA Today, 10 percent of foster youth enroll in college and of that only 3 percent actually finish and graduate. This is due to the lack of help available to them. Many might not understand that certain minorities might need more guidance then say a student whose parents both graduated university. However many of these students are not only trying to figure out the higher education system but also trying to figure out the government system that is in place. A study has shown that 61 percent of children entering the foster care system test positive for developmental delay. This alone can hinder their success rate, however, for most this is not the only struggle they may face as they prepare to exit foster care at age 18. Here at Chico State, we do have a grant-funded program specifically for helping former foster youth and unaccompanied homeless youth. PATH Scholars offers students peer coaches who connect them with financial aid services, counseling, advising and tutoring services as well as connecting them with resources on campus and in the community. However, peer coach Elian Lopez at the organization feels that the university has forgotten about their struggles and her students feel the same way. “We have one semester meeting with President Hutchinson but she has been very uninterested in what the students have to say and even left early,” Lopez said. “We even set a meeting with the Vice President and he didn’t even bother to show up.” This can be so discouraging for the students Lopez explained as a lot of them are struggling to stay motivated and keep pursuing higher education. In order to ensure the success of students with these kinds of backgrounds, we must fund and promote organizations like PATH. There are so many obstacles these students face that additional resources like these are needed to help guide them. Former foster youth Andrew Davis has explained how hard it was for him to return to school. Davis entered college back in 2009 but ended up dropping out since there was no PATH back then nor any other similar resources to help guide him through the university system. He has now returned and is in junior standing. Davis is very involved with PATH and has even gone on to make his own clothing line Original Pineapple Gang. “You can succeed academically but can work towards your passion also,” Davis said when asked about his clothing line. “I want to be a testament that regardless of where you come from or your background you can still set goals and work towards achieving your dreams.” Davis is an example of how programs and resources like PATH are extremely beneficial for students who do not have any other support system. We must continue to fund organizations like these that help students with diverse backgrounds succeed in college. Without this extra help most of these students will end up dropping out, but it is also up to the university to make their success a priority.

Alec Hadley takes his cuts for the Trjoans Thursday. Hadley, a sophomore, went on to hit a home run for the Trojans in the fifth inning. YUCCA VALLEY — The Yucca Valley High School Trojan baseball and softball teams tightened their holds on De Anza League titles as they beat the Desert Mirage Rams in two games shortened by the mercy rule Thursday. The varsity softball game seemed to be over in the blink of an eye, as junior pitcher Haley Smith threw a complete shutout on the way to the Lady Trojans’ 14-0 victory in five innings. Smith allowed just one hit, a single in the first inning, and struck out 10. No one walked on her watch. Alexis Smith, starting her first game as a senior, went three for three and took a hit by a pitch. Sophomore Rylie Rohr led on offense, going three for four and driving in six runs on a single, double and triple. With sole possession of first place in the De Anza League on a 12-1 record, the girls have two games left, against Coachella Valley Tuesday and Thursday. The junior varsity Lady Trojans won 23-2 Thursday. The Trojan varsity baseball team beat the Desert Mirage Rams 18-7 Thursday, putting them in a tie for first place in the league with Twentynine Palms. Both teams are 9-4 with two games to play in the regular season. The Trojan boys had opened up a 5-0 lead by the end of the second inning, capped off when Christian Elias, who singled, stole second, stole third and then stole home plate. Kaden Koedel, Clay Smith, Anthony Gutierrez and Elias all drove in runners to give the Trojans an 11-2 lead coming into the top of the fourth inning. The Rams should have been disheartened, but instead, they mounted a five-run frame that put them within four points of a tie. Yucca Valley came back with a vengeance when sophomore Alec Hadley hit the first home run of his Trojan career, sending Andrew Davis across home plate in the bargain. The Trojans took the win when Gutierrez took a chance swinging on a high pitch and drove it into the outfield, sending Elias and Eli Lynch across the plate. “It was a great performance outside of the fourth inning, but they came back and shut it down,” coach Josh Griswold said. He singled out Hadley for his first home run and Smith for hitting three triples. The boys are tied for first place with Twentynine Palms, who are both 9-4 with two games to play in the regular season. They play Coachella Valley High School (8-5, second in league) Tuesday and host the same team at 3:30 p.m. Thursday. “If we win those games, we’ll be in good shape,” Griswold said. “We need to clean up the defense, but the offense just needs to keep rolling. We need good, clean, fundamental baseball.” Gutierrez thinks he and his teammates can do it. “If we all play baseball the way we know how to play, we’ll get dubs.” The JV boys beat the Rams 16-2, putting them 8-4-1 on the league.

Michael,Gordon,836,https://mediaweek.com.au/australian-book-industry-awards-jimmy-barnes-2018/,"Publishing sensation Jessica Townsend was the big winner of the night. The 2018 Australian Book Industry Awards (ABIAs) were announced late last week at a gala dinner at the Sydney International Convention Centre, hosted by ABC TV’s Ben Jenkins and Zoe Norton-Lodge.

Michael,Gordon,836,http://www.breitbart.com/2018-elections/2018/05/06/ice-detains-illegal-migrant-who-killed-two-americans-after-2015-release/,"The Washington Post reported: Roberto Garza Palacios, 28, was taken into custody at his residence, said Justine Whelan, a spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He had been living in a two-story Gaithersburg home in the 400 block of Belle Grove Road, according to court records and residents of the house. Garza Palacios, a native of Guatemala, is “unlawfully present” in the United States, Whelan said. He was charged with overstaying and violating the terms of a work visa that had expired in 2009, Whelan said. His status in U.S. Immigration Court could not be immediately learned. The arrest follows an effort by ICE nearly three years ago to take Garza Palacios into custody in Montgomery County. In August 2015, ICE learned he had been arrested, and asked Montgomery jail officials to place a hold on him. The request was not honored, and Garza Palacios was released, county and federal officials said. The two Americans were killed when Palacios hit them late at night on the 270 Highway north of Washington D.C. FBI agent Carlos Wolff had stopped his auto to help Sander Cohen, an arson investigator. But both were killed when Palacios hit them at high speed. Palacios was cited for negligent driving. According to Fox 5: Investigators said Palacios was driving his Honda Accord in the left lane and attempted to get over to the right lane but was blocked by traffic. Palacios then swerved to the left of the two vehicles and struck Wolff and Cohen, who were both thrown over the median, according to police. Before being hit, Wolff had been involved in a crash on southbound I-270 and Cohen stopped to help him on the side of the road. Palacios remained at the scene and investigators determined alcohol, drugs and speed were not factors in the crash. Palacios met with state police in Rockville in April and was issued a citation for negligent driving. Two years earlier, Palacios had been detained on evidence that he smashed windows at a construction site. He was released back into the population of roughly 11 million illegals by the Democratic-run county government, despite a detainer request from ICE. The director of the Montgomery County’s Department of Correction and Rehabilitation, Robert Green, told the Washington Post that Palacios was released in 2015 because of instructions from the state Attorney General. In 2015, Maryland’s Attorney General was Brian Frosh, a Democrat who still holds the office. After he was released in 2015, Palacios helped lower wages for Americans by working as a construction worker and as a landscaper until his arrest by ICE. Read the Washington Post article here.

Andrew,Davis,833,https://www.gladstoneobserver.com.au/news/good-weather-brings-in-the-big-fish-to-hookup/3407683/,"LIVE fish catches were down initially at this years HookUp as fine weather enticed boaties to hit the reefs longer. HookUp member, Andrew Davis, said the good weather and small tides were a big factor in the number of large, dead fish being presented for weighing. ""We normally weigh in more live fish than dead each year, but this year that's been reversed because of the good weather."" The biggest dead fish HookUp committee member, Andrew Davis, can recall being weighed was a Spanish Mackerel that tipped the scales at 33kg. ""We've got one in the fridge at the moment which weighs 28kg,"" he said. The statistics were reversed on Sunday when strong breezes blew up forcing most competitors to seek sheltered waters. By midday on Sunday, the live fish measuring and weighing team were kept busy recording the steady stream of live fish being presented. Fish measurer, Matthew Muller, said his hands were like pincushions. Judging from the number of bream, whiting, flathead and Mangrove Jack most of the fishermen have been hitting the estuary's today. Infofish statisitics revealed the following numbers for live fish presented to the weigh-in team. Friday 104, Saturday 202 and Sunday 199. Another interesting statistic was provided by HookUp President Jenny McGuire. ""In the last three years the number of junior entrants in the competition has grown from 200 to over 700, and we're seeing a lot more girls fishing now too,"" she said.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Ryan Aud, Wilson Memorial High School(Photo: Ken Bosserman/The News Leader)Buy Photo FISHERSVILLE - It doesn't take long to discover that Ryan Aud is a special young man. For instance, how many youngsters do you know who were playing in adult divisions of tennis tournaments by the seventh grade? Or, who do you know that can solve the Rubik's Cube in about a minute? Well, Aud has done both. The Wilson Memorial senior is quite talented in many areas. And for his numerous successes, his school has selected him as its spring nominee for the City/County Student-Athlete of the Year award, sponsored by the News Leader. ""He was an easy nominee,"" Wilson athletic director Craig Flesher said. ""I've been at Wilson four years and have watched him grow. He has excelled in both the classroom and on the tennis court."" When it comes to sports, it's all tennis for Aud. ""Both my parents played it in high school, and I started playing around the age of six,"" he said. ""When I was younger, I tried all sports, and tennis was the only one that stuck."" Aud has had quite a successful career so far in the sport, beginning with youth tournaments around the fourth grade. His first taste of adult play came when Chad Reed, the tennis coordinator and head pro at Augusta Health Fitness, teamed up with him for doubles play. ""I remember playing with him when he was a little guy,"" Reed recalls. And that has continued into adulthood. Even today, they still team up as doubles partners. Growing up, it was under Reed's tutelage that Aud developed some of his skills in the sport. Reed said that he was impressed from the start at how articulate his young player was. ""And I knew he was talented. I groomed him early, and he was one of my hardest working kids. ""He's just good all-around,"" Reed added. ""I don't know anybody who doesn't like him."" Aud joined the Wilson tennis team as a freshman, and was immediately No. 1 on the Green Hornet ladder, a position he has continued to hold. This year, Wilson finished the regular season undefeated at 15-0, and enters district tournament competition this week. ""Our goal as a team is to win the state this year,"" Aud said. Individually, Aud would like to start out with a district championship, the same goal that Stuarts Draft senior Michael Gordon has. Both have been No. 1 on their respective team's ladder for four years. Besides excelling on the tennis court, Aud also is an accomplished student in the classroom, holding down a 4.3 grade point average and ranking No. 5 in a senior class of around 180 students. Of his classes, biology is his favorite. ""I like to learn about the common things we experience in life, like diseases and body processes,"" he said. Aud attends the Shenandoah Valley Governor's School where he takes AP chemistry, AP statistics and dual enrollment molecular biology. Back at Wilson, it's dual enrollment English and AP government. Despite a demanding load both athletically and academically, the Wilson senior is involved in numerous extracurricular activities, including being a member of the National Honor Society and holding the job of student council president. Last year, he was its secretary. Previously, Aud attended Boys State at Radford, and has been a member of the wellness club and Latin club. As SCA president, Aud has been involved in improving the school climate. ""We had a lot more freedom to come up with events and carry them out,"" he said. ""We smashed an old car at homecoming and had powder puff games in both football and volleyball, something we hadn't done in years."" Outside school, Aud is a tennis instructor under Reed at Augusta Health. He also was involved with an exchange program with a student from Romania during his junior year. ""A boy came over and stayed with us in October, and went to school here,"" Aud said. Asked what his exchange student was impressed about, Aud said ice in our water and large portions of food. In the spring, Aud went to Romania for 10 days and stayed with his exchange student's family in Bucharest, the country's capital. ""They have their own sense of European style, taste and the way they learn,"" Aud said. ""When you walk down the street, you can tell who the tourists are. It was cool to visit, but I like America too."" The Wilson senior has also solved the Rubik's Cube. ""I was at a tennis camp, it was raining, and I had a Rubik's Cube. It took me two days, but I kept practicing. Now I can do it in about a minute. It's just a bunch of algorithms that you have to memorize."" With graduation around the corner, Aud plans to attend Randolph-Macon College and play tennis. That's the same school where his sister, Landon, attends. A sophomore, she is No. 1 on the women's tennis team ladder in both singles and doubles. Aud plans to enter a pre-med program, and has been awarded a full-tuition scholarship. ""I would like to be some type of a surgeon,"" he said. ""I will have a fellowship at Randolph-Macon and will get to work with a lot of doctors. It's an opportunity to go places during breaks and the summer."" Meanwhile, Aud thinks he can enter the Randolph-Macon men's tennis ladder somewhere in the middle. And as a bonus, he will be with his sister playing on the women's team. ""They have quite a tight bond between them,"" Reed said ""And Ryan will benefit by having more quality kids around him,"" said Reed. ""He should do just fine in college.""

The second annual New Balance Invitational track and field meet hosted by Farmington High School May 5, 2018.(Photo: Dan Dean | hometownlife.com)Buy Photo A long day of track proved very beneficial for Salem High School Saturday. The undefeated (5-0) Salem boys team ran to its second straight New Balance Invitational championship at Farmington High School. The Rock girls placed second in the high-quality 41-team meet which began with prelims at 11 a.m. and ended with the girls 4X400-meter relay finals at 9 p.m. Salem's boys won three relays and a pair of individual events to finish with 97 points, outdistancing runner-up Southfield Arts & Technology which netted 53 points. Livonia Chuchill (51.5), Canton (48) and Lake Orion (44.5) rounded out the top five.

We just wanted to come and compete and I think at this point this was our best meet of the year,"" said head coach Jimmy Crabill, a longtime assistant who took over the program this season. ""I think this year we were trying to go after it more. I think last year was more of a surprise. ""This year we knew we had a good team,"" he said. ""We were trying to get some good times today and that was the main focus. And, it happened that we won it. I didn't think we would win by that much because there are some good teams here."" Salem's relays were on fire. The foursome of freshman Hezekiah Williams, senior Andrew Davis, senior Sharriff Dyer and junior Berry Matthews combined to win the 4X400-meter relay in 3:23.82. Williams, Matthews, Josh Pohl and Nolan Teodori won the 4X100 relay in 42.82. The Rocks took the 4X200 relay (Davis, Dyer, Pohl and Ryan Young) in 1:29.61 and placed second in the 4X800 with a season-best time of 8:05.03.

""As a team, we always have a positive outlook,"" he said. ""It was a full team effort, every one doing their best. We did good last year so we wanted to keep it going."" Salem senior Alex Howie was second in both the shot put and discus, while junior Luke Haran ran a PR in the 3,200 (9:38.60) to place second. The Rocks 4X800 relay took runners-up honors to Rochester Hills Stoney Creek. Seniors John Paul DeLa Cruz (third in the 300 hurdles), Jonathan Bilko (fourth in pole vault) and Young (fifth in the 200) were Salem's other top-five performers. Livonia Churchill senior Martell Dooley won the long jump (21-feet even) and Canton junior Evan Carter topped the pole vault field (13-feet even). The male field athlete of the meet was Southfield A&T senior Jalen Edwards who took the discus (147-4) and placed third in the shot put (49-10.5). Lake Orion from the Oakland Activities Association dominated the girls field and won with 78.5 points. Salem placed second with 52.5 points to slip past district rival Plymouth which placed third with 49 points. ""I thought from top to bottom we had a lot of athletes who had exceptionally good days,"" said Salem's fourth-year head coach Patrick Ignagni, whose team is 5-0 in dual meets. ""I think the strength of our team is depth and it was great to see all of our girls in all of our events compete in such an exceptionally high-level field.

Andrew,Davis,828,https://news.uga.edu/new-graduates-have-georgia-on-their-minds/,"Commencement speakers extol the virtues of education and the power of a UGA degree. On a brilliant spring evening between the hedges in Sanford Stadium, more than 4,500 University of Georgia undergraduates were serenaded into alumni status with a performance of “Georgia on My Mind” by keynote speakers David Haywood and Charles Kelley of Lady Antebellum. More than 5,800 students received their undergraduate or graduate degrees in Commencement ceremonies on May 4. They heard words of wisdom from the guest speakers about the importance of education and were urged to follow their dreams and passions. (Photos by Andrew Davis Tucker, Dorothy Kozlowski, Peter Frey and Chad Osburn/UGA) Haywood and Kelley, Terry College of Business alumni and members of the multiplatinum and award-winning trio Lady Antebellum, shared how the lessons they learned in the classroom helped them chase their dreams outside the classroom. (Full speech.) Haywood spoke about how they started writing music together while pursuing their degrees. When they graduated in 2004, they each took jobs in the business world but continued to find time to write together. It was Charles’ brother, Josh, who encouraged them to make the move to Nashville to write music professionally. “It was a bit of a risk for us to go to Nashville,” Haywood said, “but at the same time, it wasn’t really that big of a risk at all” because they had their UGA degrees. Kelley also reminded the undergraduates about the importance of being open to things they haven’t even dreamed of yet: “There is more than one clear path and direction.” Haywood and Kelley concluded with a performance of the 1930 classic “Georgia on My Mind” made famous by Georgia native Ray Charles. Prior to that, student guest speaker Hunter Glenn Smith, who received his bachelor’s degree in political science, reminded the new graduates that education also comes from untraditional means. “We are a community of stories,” he said to the 4,576 undergraduates who became the 215th graduating class from UGA. “It is the lessons taught outside the classroom that most help us learn to live, grow and lead.” Earlier in the day at the graduate ceremony in Stegeman Coliseum, Denise Spangler, the new dean of UGA’s College of Education, also spoke about the importance of education. “I hope that your time at Georgia has been filled with opportunities to learn,” she said to the estimated 265 doctoral candidates and 993 master’s and specialist degree students. “Academics, yes, but also to learn about yourself and others, especially those who are different from you. For many of you, graduate school is the best opportunity people ever have to engage deeply with new ideas and with people who are different from you. “I hope that we have challenged you and caused you to re-examine what you know and believe and on what basis you know or believe it,” Spangler said. “I hope that you will take with you a propensity to ask questions, to interrogate assumptions, to speak up, to act to improve the world around you.” Spangler spoke of the sacrifice made by students and their families and congratulated students on persevering despite the challenges they have faced during graduate school, whether that was full-time or part-time work or moving across the country or the world to come to UGA. “You have an education. A graduate education. You are, indeed, a very special group of people,” she said. “You can use your privilege, because that’s what an education gives you. Regardless of your race or gender, your education puts you in a place of privilege.” The Class of 2018 committed to removing barriers and opening doors by breaking the UGA Senior Signature class gift record with 2,342 signatures and $125,000 raised to go toward student scholarships. The initial goal was to match last year’s record of 2,164 signatures and $110,000. The plaque was unveiled at the annual Senior Send-Off event April 25 and is now hanging in Tate Plaza.

Andrew,Davis,828,http://filmthreat.com/reviews/she-came-from-the-woods/,"Featured Anyone who is at least familiar with 1980s slasher films and vanilla 1990s anthology television series will know what to expect in She Came from the Woods; which feels exactly the point. Coursing with vibes reminiscent of Friday the 13th meeting Are You Afraid of the Dark, a gaggle of counselors cleaning up after the last day of summer at Camp Briarbrook decide to share a local legend around the campfire. Carson and Erik Bloomquist pull numerous nostalgia-drenched elements from those bygone eras in campy terror, delivering an earnest project hallmarked by fantastic production design and strong performances; though it is ultimately a lukewarm horror short. So as we “meet the meat” taking a break while wrapping up the last details of camp following the departure of the kids, they exchange a local legend of Ester, psychotic nurse who once worked at the camp. Very much like Bloody Mary, the story concludes with a ritual (shedding blood and saying Ester’s name aloud) which sets seemingly supernatural gears in motion. As these gears grind away, our camp counselors learn the true error of their ways. “…a gaggle of counselors at Camp Briarbrook decides to share a local legend around the campfire.” In such a fleeting 12-minute runtime, it is thoroughly impressive that the Bloomquists effectively shoved in so many horror tropes (think Scream condensed, set against the backdrop of Sleepaway Camp). However, this film plays less like a self-contained short, and more like an abridged version of a larger story; or that this short is designed to be a pilot/pitch to create a feature project. This impression is mainly due to its ominous tension throughout the opening arc concluding too abruptly and lackadaisically. Though this sudden shift could have also been a nod to the campiness of some 80s horror, it feels out of place and middles the effectiveness of the ending. Acting like a scrapbook of the genre, She Came from the Woods is a brief sentimental stroll through traditional horror motifs; it’s nothing new, yet it is certainly still a fun ride. She Came from the Woods (2017) Directed by Carson Bloomquist, Erik Bloomquist. Written by Carson Bloomquist, Erik Bloomquist. Starring Ehad Berisha, Justin Andrew Davis, Peyton and Michelle Edwards.

If you’ve ever been to Crater Lake in southern Oregon, you know all about its grandeur. The United States’ deepest lake, its brilliant, pure waters are often obscured by clouds. But when it peeks out from beneath the fog, the lake’s unforgettably blue waters are a reminder of nature’s most potent wonders. Now those marvels have been captured in song by composer Michael Gordon, whose symphony “Natural History” was inspired by and performed next to Crater Lake. It took Gordon a year to compose the work, which evokes the lake’s unique majesty and tumultuous story. Crater Lake was formed about 7,700 years ago when Mount Mazama, a volcano, collapsed into a massive circular crater. Then, rain and snowfall filled the bowl with water, creating a kind of scientific curiosity. Because Crater Lake has no inlets or outlets, it’s nearly pristine. That makes it an incredible lab for scientists who use it to study its diverse plants, its unique geological features and the endangered species that make it their home. Gordon drew on that natural heritage when writing a symphony designed to bring out the lake’s natural sounds. In 2016, his work was conducted by Teddy Abrams and performed on the lake’s edge by more than 130 classical musicians. Joining them were drummers from the Klamath people, who have long celebrated the lake as a spiritual place. The work was commissioned by the Britt Music & Arts Festival to celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service. “Symphony for Nature: The Britt Orchestra at Crater Lake,” a documentary that tracks Gordon’s composition and shows the concert, is airing on select PBS stations. It’s also available through PBS Passport, which provides on-demand access to public television programs. The film offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how history, science and culture come together in a musical piece that manages the seemingly impossible: giving voice to a body of water.

Andrew,Davis,818,https://www.twice.com/retailing/gramophone-playing-a-new-tune,"The catchphrase “Follow the money” entered the lexicon with “All The President’s Men.” Now, an acclaimed Washington-area A/V specialty chain is taking the cue quite literally by branching off into a rich new category for the home. Gramophone, a regional destination for premium audio, video and custom installations founded 42 years ago by principal Brian Hudkins, bought out a local kitchen and bath design business and added shading, smart home, voice control and lighting solutions to further brighten its prospects. Located in the Baltimore suburbs of Hunt Valley/Cockeysville, the new Kitchen Design Center of Maryland (KDC) also brings to the table — in this case the kitchen table — the talent and tech expertise of CEO Andrew Davis and his staff of 70. A complete design center for consumers and the trade, KDC offers a full assortment of contemporary cabinets, countertops, furniture, bathroom fixtures and flooring, plus the CI acumen to install them. “Over the years we have gotten involved in more and more projects where we were installing technologies such as Seura mirror televisions in baths and advanced design lighting solutions in kitchens,” noted Davis. “As a result, we’ve been more involved than ever before in the incorporation of technology in these spaces considered so important by our clients.” Davis described the move as a natural extension of its CI business that will allow its team to get involved even earlier in the residential design process, and enhance those projects with popular entertainment, control and networking technologies. To that end, KDC created a state-of-the-art “Lighting Lab,” where homeowners, designers and decorators can learn about the impact of different color temperatures; review ways to replicate the daylong movement of the sun inside the home; consider a layered approach to lighting design; and shop a wide assortment of premium fixtures. Lighting brands include Ambiance, DMF, Feiss, Lutron’s Ivalo, Pure Edge, Soraa and WAC, with Crestron and Lutron providing the wireless threads for whole-home control. The hybrid approach is in line with a new initiative by Gramophone’s longtime buying group turned trade consortium Home Technology Specialists of America (HTSA), which is promoting the adoption of high-end lighting and associated design and installation services. See: HTSA Shines A Light On LED Lighting HTSA executive director Jon Robbins noted that KTC “allows Gramophone to offer clients an alternative presentation of technology in areas of the home — kitchens and baths — that many hold near and dear to their hearts, but are generally unaware of the amazing influence that a well-designed lighting plan and other technology enhancements can deliver for even greater enjoyment.” The company has planned a grand-opening celebration for the new showroom on May 31, and has extended an open invitation to the public and the trade.

Michael,Gordon,817,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article210296119.html,"By Jim Morrill And Michael Gordon jmorrill@charlotteobserver.com mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 03, 2018 08:45 AM In one of first forays into electoral politics, a civil liberties group is spending $175,000 in Mecklenburg County's sheriff race with ads accusing incumbent Irwin Carmichael of working with ""Trump's deportation force."" The American Civil Liberties Union, a non-partisan group, is targeting Carmichael's 287(g) program ahead of Tuesday's Democratic primary. The program partners sheriff deputies with federal immigration officials to identify undocumented immigrants charged with crimes and process them for possible deportation. A new report shows those held under the program last year included murderers, other felons and 111 people charged with DWI. There were also less serious offenses like traffic violations and, in one case, possessing undersized fish. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Carmichael faces fellow Democrats Antoine Ensley and Garry McFadden, who both say they would end the program. With no Republican running, Tuesday's winner is virtually guaranteed a four-year term. In addition to 287(g), the ACLU ad also takes aim at the practice by which teenaged inmates can end up in isolation if they exhibit disruptive behavior toward a jail staff or fellow inmates. ""Our current sheriff, Irwin Carmichael, has kept teenagers locked in solitary confinement,"" a narrator says. ""The NAACP calls it torture.... That's not all. Sheriff Carmichael works with Trump's deportation force. Detaining people for deportation. Tearing families apart."" Carmichael disputes the characterizations. He said inmates are kept in what he calls a Disciplinary Detention Unit only if they've threatened guards or other inmates. They're still provided mental health, education and other services, he said. Rabbi Judy Schindler, a member of group that protested conditions at the jail Thursday, also criticized the sheriff's partnership in federal immigration enforcement. She says 287(g) is also making the community less safe because immigrant victims of crime no longer contact police out of fear of being swept into the deportation pipeline, she said. ""Anyone who is undocumented is subject to detention and deportation,"" she said. ""Mothers, fathers, sons and daughters are being deported. Tearing families apart is not an American value."" Carmichael said 287(g) has been around for 12 years, three sheriffs and three presidents, including Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama. ""Nothing has changed with this program in 12 years, so I don’t get where they're coming from,"" Carmichael said. Mecklenburg is one of six North Carolina counties that participate in the program along with Gaston, Cabarrus, Henderson, Nash and Wake counties. Only Texas has more law enforcement agencies in the program. Carmichael says access to the federal database can help identify inmates who might have a record in their home country. ""The whole purpose,"" he has said, ""is safety and security."" Supporters of the program say people are in it for a reason: they broke the law. Spokesman Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American ImmigrationReform, which opposes illegal immigration, has said, ""All you have to do is be in violation of federal immigration laws."" According to the sheriff's office, there were 455 inmates identified through the program and held for ICE, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Of those, 158 (35 percent) faced felony charges, including murder; 190 (42 percent) were arrested for misdemeanors, and 107 (23 percent) were picked up for traffic violations. Felony charges included murder, rape and drug trafficking. Among the misdemeanor cases, more than 40 percent of the individuals were charged with assault on a female. Almost three-quarters of the driving arrests involved driving under the influence charges. On the other hand, one man was charged with keeping five undersized fish. Most of those detained and held are from Mexico and Latin America. It's not clear how many people were ultimately deported. Carmichael acknowledged that some of the charges that bring people to jail are relatively minor. That's not the point, he said. ""We’ve got to know who they are, what about if they commit murder in another country?"" he said. ""We would never know that without that program."" McFadden, a former detective with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, has said the 287(g) program ""destroys families"" and hurts law enforcement. Ensley, a former CMPD sergeant and small-town police chief who's now a human resources manager for the city of Charlotte, said he would end the program in order to protect families left behind. ""Strong families make strong communities,"" he said at one forum. Some critics agree. ""The reason we've always been opposed to the 287(g) program is that encourages racial profiling and the targeting of people on how they look,"" said Mike Meno, a spokesman for the left-leaning ACLU. ""That's something that’s happened across North Carolina and across the country.” Carmichael said his opponents ""would like a sanctuary city,"" which he opposes. ""We're not doing anything but identifying who's in our community and who’s in our jail,” he said. Carmichael is the race's top fundraiser. New reports show he raised $180,000 through the first quarter. McFadden pulled in $66,600 and Ensley raised $11,500.

Michael,Gordon,817,http://www.watoday.com.au/rugby-league/canberra-raiders/croker-urges-raiders-to-seize-the-day-20180504-p4zdbo.html,"Canberra Raiders captain Jarrod Croker urges his team to make the most of this NRL season, which could be their last together as a number of off-contract stars weigh up their futures. His call comes as the Green Machine look to remodel themselves from an attacking beast into a more defensively minded unit - or from a flashy Ferrari into a hard-working ute. They're looking for their fourth win in five games when they take on the Gold Coast Titans at Canberra Stadium on Saturday. Raiders captain Jarrod Croker urged his teammates to make the most of their season together.Credit:LUKAS COCH Ten of their 19-man squad to face the Titans are off-contract at the end of the season, with Junior Paulo, Shannon Boyd and Josh Papalii all linked to big-money deals at Parramatta, Gold Coast and either South Sydney or Cronulla respectively. Sia Soliola's been linked to a move to re-join Nathan Brown at Newcastle, while Luke Bateman's close to re-signing for two years and the Raiders have tabled offers to Wigan forwards Ryan Sutton and John Bateman. Croker said it hadn't been a distraction and praised the way his off-contract teammates had handled themselves so far this season. The Raiders were just one win outside the top eight going into the round and face the team one spot below them on the NRL ladder. Croker said it would be ideal to have all the contracts sorted as quickly as possible, but it was more important they take advantage of the group they've got at the moment. ""Very rarely are you going to have the exact same team year-in, year-out so you've got to make the most of the boys that you're with every year, boys come and go,"" he said. This Raiders team exploded into the most potent attack in the NRL in 2016 as they surged to within a few points of the grand final. They averaged 28.67 points a game and conceded 19.00 during that home-and-away season. So far this year they're averaging 21.88 points for and 21.75 against. But if you just look at the last four games when their defence has massively improved they're only conceding 15.5 points per game and just 6.7 if you remove the big loss to South Sydney. Again, defence will be the focus when the Green Machine rolls out against the Titans. ""We certainly don't train to be the side that scores the most points and doesn't worry about defence,"" Croker said. ""We want to be a good defensive side, every side does. You need good defence to win comps. ""Three of the last four games we've done it really well, we had an off game against Souths, which was pretty ordinary. ""We need to start well and start well defensively. If we can do that we put ourselves in the game."" The Raiders gave up an 18-point lead in round one to lose to the Titans through a last-gasp Konrad Hurrell try. It was the first of three narrow losses that looked to set to derail the Green Machine before their season had barely begun. But they've managed to grind out three gutsy wins since then, including last week's 18-8 victory over the North Queensland Cowboys to end a 12-year losing streak in Townsville. Croker felt they'd definitely improved since they faced the Titans about two months ago. ""We've come along and won a few close games after losing the first couple of tight ones,"" he said. ""Defensively we've definitely gotten stronger and hopefully our attack can keep flowing off that. ""It's a game of possession at the moment and we weren't that great last week, but our defence backed it up."" NRL ROUND NINE Saturday: Canberra Raiders v Gold Coast Titans at Canberra Stadium, 3pm.

Michael,Gordon,817,https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/he-s-been-to-everest-but-simon-balderstone-still-has-mountains-to-climb-20180425-p4zbmp.html,"“I can’t look at people on the beach in the same way anymore,” Simon Balderstone says, glancing at the smattering of Sydneysiders lucky enough to be here midweek on the sands of Little Manly Beach. The shimmering bay is at its most seductive and bare limbs and torsos bake in the midday sun. But we sit resolutely beneath shade cloth as we wait for our order of battered flathead, fat chips and rocket salad to arrive from the beachside cafe. The sun has become the enemy since melanoma came galloping back into his life last October. At the time Balderstone, 64, was as about as far away from an Australian beach as it was possible to get. He was leading a trekking party through a remote valley in the Lower Solukhumbu region of Nepal, south of Everest, showcasing the work of the Australian Himalayan Foundation, which he chairs and co-founded 15 years ago. Simon Balderstone, chairman of the Australian Himalayan Foundation.Credit:Louise Kennerley His trekking groups raise funds, via sponsors, for the foundation, which in turn supports Nepalese schoolchildren in the poorest parts of the country, building and refurbishing classrooms, training local teachers and providing scholarships to the kids of local farmers whose families would otherwise have to send them out to work. So far the project has helped nearly 40,000 children, and it has become one of the great passions of Balderstone’s life. But on day two of last October’s trek, he found himself in unaccountable agony after a two-hour jeep ride over heavily rutted roads. The group had just visited a school at Garma, where the foundation had rebuilt several classrooms destroyed by powerful earthquakes in 2015. ""We’d arrived during the Dashain national holiday,"" he recalls. ""A lot of schools were closed but they held an ‘unlocking’ ceremony for the new classrooms, there were speeches, and a lot of dancing.” By the next morning, his back had worsened. A tough day’s walking lay ahead, down slippery, steep slopes. By day five, the pain had made it impossible for him to keep going. ""I didn’t know what I had done,"" he says. ""All I knew was that it was hurting like stink."" He flew to the CIWEC clinic in Kathmandu - a medical centre renowned among mountaineers - where scans revealed a compression fracture of the spine. But how he’d broken his back riding in a jeep remained a mystery. The puzzle was solved once he was medevaced back to Sydney: stage four melanoma, which had metastasised to his spine and other bones. The news was a shock. In 2016 doctors had previously diagnosed a small, colourless lump on his back as melanoma, but thought they'd caught it all with an operation to remove both the lump and the lymph glands down the left side of his body. Looking back, Balderstone thinks many long days in the sun as a child, growing up with three siblings on farms in the western district of Victoria, may have given the cancer a head start. “I loved that existence, just wandering around in the paddocks with my dogs or helping out on the farm,” he says. As a boarder through high school he would bring friends home in the holidays, so they could learn “which end of a sheep was which”. From his parents, Bob and Judy, Balderstone absorbed a love of the land and the natural world and a healthy dose of egalitarianism. Bob eventually moved into cattle farming, developing a successful breed of Angus Shorthorn and becoming head of the Royal Melbourne Agricultural Show. But Balderstone says his father “never lost the ability to drink at both the top [graziers’] pub and the bottom [workers’] pub in Mortlake. He was one of the few who could do that, he got on with absolutely everyone.” At university Balderstone took a year off to go rouseabouting with a shearing team through country Victoria and South Australia. After graduating he joined The Age newspaper in 1977, and soon moved to its Canberra bureau, where he began a lifelong friendship with Michael Gordon, later a towering figure in Australian journalism. Simon Balderstone, back row left, with some of The Age's Canberra bureau, including his great friend Michael Gordon, far right, in 1982. Balderstone kept up his life of adventure on the side. In 1980, Christine Gee’s Australian Himalayan Expeditions made its debut and Balderstone eagerly signed up. During his holiday breaks he led treks into Kashmir and Nepal and by 1984 had befriended the men who would become some of Australia’s best-known mountaineers - Tim Macartney-Snape, Greg Mortimer and Lincoln Hall among them. The friends Balderstone made on his first Everest climb became the core of the group with which he set up the foundation.Credit:Alamy In 1984, at their invitation, he became the resident journalist for the first Australian party to scale Everest. ""We were on the mountain for 68 days,"" Balderstone says. “I went to about 23,000 feet. We had a very small budget; in those days there was virtually no one on the mountain at any given time, but there was one American group on the other side. We used to go over from our base camp and say hello, because we knew we would get a good feed from them.” Mortimer and Macartney-Snape reached the summit on that trip, but Hall had to turn back, as did Andi Henderson, who lost fingers on both hands to frostbite. (In 2006, Hall would make a second attempt at Everest and succeed, but nearly at the cost of his life: he was found disoriented by another expedition after he’d spent a night on the mountain without shelter, oxygen, food or water.) “I can still remember whole days of that 1984 expedition very clearly,” Balderstone says. “The Himalayas are inspiring, magnificent; but it’s also one of the poorest regions in the world. We were all just trekkers and climbers who loved the Himalaya and its people and wanted to give something back.” The “incredibly close lifetime friends” he made on the mountain became the core of the group with which he set up the foundation in 2003. Other founding members were deputy chair and author Garry Weare, Christine Gee, Peter Hillary (son of Sir Edmund Hillary) and Hall, who was followed onto the AHF board by his widow, Barbara, when Hall died of mesothelioma in 2012. Balderstone, restless, found it hard to settle back into mainstream journalism after Everest. He wrote a book on Kakadu, then joined the Australian Conservation Foundation and helped drive its ""Fight for the Forests"" campaign which ran through the 1987 federal election and helped propel Bob Hawke to a third term as prime minister. The campaign forged links between Balderstone and a senior adviser in Hawke’s office, Craig Emerson (later a cabinet minister under Julia Gillard), who recommended Balderstone to incoming environment minister Graham Richardson. “People either love or hate Richo, but in the late 1980s we were on a roll,"" Balderstone says. ""We had so much happening: Kakadu, the Tassie forests, Shelburne Bay, the PM’s big environment statement. There were really big fights to be had and Graham was up for the fight.” Balderstone later joined Hawke’s office, and then Paul Keating’s when Keating replaced Hawke: “Depending on whether you thought it was bastardry or dexterity, I was the only senior adviser to stay on in Paul’s office when he took over.” Fate or fortune soon offered another opportunity. Balderstone was in Monte Carlo with the Keatings for the announcement that Sydney had won the 2000 Olympic Games. Not long afterwards, he moved into a senior position with the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, and once that sporting carnival was over, built a consultancy business advising the International Olympic Committee. In 2011 he “crossed to the dark side, the bidding side” to advise Tokyo on its successful Olympics bid. “I have been so lucky,"" he says. “The books I’ve been able to write, working for those three extremely effective federal politicians, Everest, the Olympic work, and now giving something back through AHF … Part of it was luck, but I was open to walking through doors.” In 2007, he was made a member of the Order of Australia for services to the environment, the Olympic movement and Indigenous affairs. Balderstone's long been involved with Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, and sits on the board of the ITNewcom Foundation, which supports tertiary scholarhips for Indigenous students. In February this year, Michael Gordon - “Micky” as Balderstone calls him - died suddenly during an ocean swim in Victoria. Gordon’s death was a hammer blow, coming so soon after his own cancer diagnosis. But he has grounds for hope. Working with the Sydney-based Melanoma Institute, Balderstone is just one of 20 people worldwide trialling an immunotherapy treatment which combines a new drug with the better-known Keytruda. His tumours are shrinking, and he has become pain free. ""It's early days,"" he says. ""I do understand that a lot of people who are on Keytruda are cured, but a lot aren’t. I’ve got to be realistic about that while keeping my head together and my attitude positive. The cancer and Micky’s death has heightened my sense of mortality. I’m bringing a few plans forward, seizing the day.” Some of those plans are personal - a walking holiday in Europe with his wife Jenny, a fellow government staffer in the Hawke years. His biggest ambitions are for the foundation. He hopes to lead another trek in December, alongside Peter Hillary and AHF supporters and donors. “We are on track to have finished nearly 90 classrooms now. We’ve been involved with around 300 schools. We have smaller projects going in Bhutan and in northern India. We are providing what is needed most to those who need it most in that part of the Himalayas. And I’m pretty proud of that.” This story was amended to include the name of Garry Weare as an AHF co-founder. Deborah Snow is a senior writer with The Sydney Morning Herald and a former federal political reporter for the Australian Financial Review. She has also served as foreign correspondent for ABC-TV in Moscow and London, and as a reporter on Four Corners. Copyright © 2018

Paula,Lunder,813,https://www.colby.edu/news/2018/05/04/colby-college-names-tanya-sheehan-as-distinguished-scholar-and-director-of-research-at-the-lunder-institute-for-american-art/,"May 4, 2018 Tanya Sheehan WATERVILLE, Maine—Colby College has named Tanya Sheehan the distinguished scholar and director of research at the Lunder Institute for American Art. A leading scholar in the field, Sheehan is currently the William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art at Colby. In her role at the Lunder Institute, Sheehan will forge links between the American art curriculum at Colby and scholarship in the field of American art. In addition to teaching courses that support the mission of the Lunder Institute, she will create a variety of innovative research opportunities for Colby students that may include visits to institutional peers, participation in symposia and publications, and engagement with visiting scholars and artists. She will also support the scholarly program of the Lunder Institute by engaging in research collaborations with artists and scholars in residence and by mentoring the institute’s junior fellows; contribute expertise to the institute’s scholarly programs, including symposia and a summer program; and pursue partnerships with major institutions that support scholarship in the field. “Tanya Sheehan is uniquely qualified to play this essential role at the College,” said Margaret McFadden, provost and dean of faculty at Colby. “She is both a superb teacher and a field-changing scholar whose work is widely admired around the world. Our students and faculty will benefit enormously from the opportunities that she will create, and the vibrant scholarly discourses that she will help to foster, both on campus and in the wider field of American art.” “We are building a dream team for the Lunder Institute, and I am thrilled to have Professor Sheehan on board,” said Carolyn J. Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “Her commitment to American art as a researcher and teacher is unparalleled. She will be a force in advancing the scholarly ambitions of the institute.” On the Colby faculty since 2013, Sheehan teaches the history of American art, race and representation, and art and science. She is the author of Doctored: The Medicine of Photography in Nineteenth-Century America (2011) and Study in Black and White: Photography, Race, Humor (2018). Her edited books include Photography, History, Difference (2014), Photography and Its Origins (co-edited with Andres Zervigon, 2015), Grove Art Guide to Photography (2017), and Photography and Migration (2018). She has recently contributed essays to The Image of the Black in Western Art series, A Companion to American Art, and the journal American Art. Since 2015 she has served as editor of the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art Journal. Sheehan earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in art history from Brown University. “I am thrilled to be working with Lee Glazer, Theaster Gates, and the museum’s team in establishing Colby College as a center for research on American art,” said Sheehan. “We have at Colby a unique opportunity to cultivate innovative scholarship in the field and connect it to undergraduate teaching and learning. I look forward to expanding our network of partners and collaborating with an international community of scholars.” This marks the third leadership appointment for the Lunder Institute, which was established by a remarkable gift from Life Trustee Paula Crane Lunder, D.F.A. ’98 and Life Overseer Peter Lunder ’56, D.F.A. ’98 in 2017. Last month Colby announced that renowned artist Theaster Gates will be the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives at the Lunder Institute, followed by Smithsonian curator Lee Glazer’s appointment as the founding director.

Peter,Lunder,812,https://www.colby.edu/news/2018/05/04/colby-college-names-tanya-sheehan-as-distinguished-scholar-and-director-of-research-at-the-lunder-institute-for-american-art/,"May 4, 2018 Tanya Sheehan WATERVILLE, Maine—Colby College has named Tanya Sheehan the distinguished scholar and director of research at the Lunder Institute for American Art. A leading scholar in the field, Sheehan is currently the William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art at Colby. In her role at the Lunder Institute, Sheehan will forge links between the American art curriculum at Colby and scholarship in the field of American art. In addition to teaching courses that support the mission of the Lunder Institute, she will create a variety of innovative research opportunities for Colby students that may include visits to institutional peers, participation in symposia and publications, and engagement with visiting scholars and artists. She will also support the scholarly program of the Lunder Institute by engaging in research collaborations with artists and scholars in residence and by mentoring the institute’s junior fellows; contribute expertise to the institute’s scholarly programs, including symposia and a summer program; and pursue partnerships with major institutions that support scholarship in the field. “Tanya Sheehan is uniquely qualified to play this essential role at the College,” said Margaret McFadden, provost and dean of faculty at Colby. “She is both a superb teacher and a field-changing scholar whose work is widely admired around the world. Our students and faculty will benefit enormously from the opportunities that she will create, and the vibrant scholarly discourses that she will help to foster, both on campus and in the wider field of American art.” “We are building a dream team for the Lunder Institute, and I am thrilled to have Professor Sheehan on board,” said Carolyn J. Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “Her commitment to American art as a researcher and teacher is unparalleled. She will be a force in advancing the scholarly ambitions of the institute.” On the Colby faculty since 2013, Sheehan teaches the history of American art, race and representation, and art and science. She is the author of Doctored: The Medicine of Photography in Nineteenth-Century America (2011) and Study in Black and White: Photography, Race, Humor (2018). Her edited books include Photography, History, Difference (2014), Photography and Its Origins (co-edited with Andres Zervigon, 2015), Grove Art Guide to Photography (2017), and Photography and Migration (2018). She has recently contributed essays to The Image of the Black in Western Art series, A Companion to American Art, and the journal American Art. Since 2015 she has served as editor of the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art Journal. Sheehan earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in art history from Brown University. “I am thrilled to be working with Lee Glazer, Theaster Gates, and the museum’s team in establishing Colby College as a center for research on American art,” said Sheehan. “We have at Colby a unique opportunity to cultivate innovative scholarship in the field and connect it to undergraduate teaching and learning. I look forward to expanding our network of partners and collaborating with an international community of scholars.” This marks the third leadership appointment for the Lunder Institute, which was established by a remarkable gift from Life Trustee Paula Crane Lunder, D.F.A. ’98 and Life Overseer Peter Lunder ’56, D.F.A. ’98 in 2017. Last month Colby announced that renowned artist Theaster Gates will be the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives at the Lunder Institute, followed by Smithsonian curator Lee Glazer’s appointment as the founding director.

Cloudy with occasional showers overnight. Low 44F. Winds ESE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 70%. Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 8:33 am Calaveras lost to Summerville 15-6 May 3 in San Andreas. Calaveras senior Blake Wilson scores in the bottom of the third against Summerville. Logan Weatherby makes a play from third base. Casey Copulos tags out a Summerville runner in the bottom of the fourth inning. Freshman Karson Cook pitched in relief for Calaveras. Calaveras lost to Summerville 15-6 May 3 in San Andreas. For Calaveras to reach the playoffs, it needed to play perfect baseball down the stretch. In a must-win game against Summerville, Calaveras was anything but perfect. Defensive miscues and poor pitching resulted in a 15-6 defeat Wednesday, May 2 in San Andreas. The loss most likely cost Calaveras a spot in the postseason. Calaveras committed six errors and hit seven Summerville hitters in the blowout. “It’s really frustrating,” said Calaveras head coach Tom DeLappe. “We work on that stuff all the time and they just don’t seem to get it. The defense has been pretty bad this year and it’s not just in the physical errors, there have been a lot of mental errors. It’s stuff that we go over all the time.” The afternoon got off on the wrong foot, as Calaveras starting pitcher Zack Nordahl hit the first batter of the game. The next batter Nordahl faced smacked a triple down the right field line for Summerville’s first run. The Bears scored once more on a sacrifice fly and led 2-0 after the first half inning. Calaveras senior Blake Wilson scores in the bottom of the third against Summerville. Calaveras was able to take advantage of Summerville’s shaky defense in the bottom of the first. Freshman center fielder Clayton walked and stole second. Logan Lamborn struck out on a ball in the dirt, but advanced to first on the past ball. Senior Casey Copulos walked to load the bases with zero outs. Junior third baseman Logan Weatherby hit a sharp grounder to short, which bounced off of the glove and went into left field. Moore and Lamborn scored to tie the game 2-2. Calaveras added one more run in the first and led 3-2. Nordahl calmed down on the mound and didn’t allow a run to score in the second or third inning. In the bottom of the third, Calaveras added to its lead with an RBI double off the bat of Nordahl, which scored senior first baseman Blake Wilson, who singled earlier in the inning. Casey Copulos tags out a Summerville runner in the bottom of the fourth inning. Calaveras led 4-2 heading into the top of the fourth, but that’s when the wheels fell off. Summerville scored seven times on three hits. Calaveras pitching hit three batters and the defense committed two costly errors. “We had a number of games this year where it didn’t look like we showed up to play and this is one of them,” DeLappe said. “We haven’t played well defensively all year and we don’t have the pitching. Our pitching depth is zero. We’ve got a lot out of guys who have never pitched before, but we don’t have the pitching to be able to shut things down.” Trailing 9-4, Calaveras got a leadoff double from senior Andrew Davis to start the bottom of the fourth. With one out, Lamborn singled to put runners on the corners. Both runners advanced as a result of a balk, which cut the Summerville lead to 9-5. Wilson drove in Lamborn with an RBI single and the inning ended with Calaveras trailing 9-6. Logan Weatherby makes a play from third base. The Bears got both of those runs back in the top of the fifth and Calaveras could not answer in the bottom of the frame. “We just didn’t show up to play,” Wilson said. “The moment we got here, you could tell that everyone was lackadaisical. This is what happens when you show up like that. I don’t think we were playing not to lose, I just don’t think we cared enough and it showed.” Summerville scored four more times in the top of the seventh and shut down Calaveras in order in the bottom of the inning for the 15-6 win. Wilson finished the day going 2 for 4 with a run batted in and a run scored. Moore went 1 for 3 with a run scored, a stolen base and a walk. Lamborn scored twice and had one hit. Copulos walked and scored a run. Nordahl had an RBI double and Davis went 2 for 3 with a double and a run scored. Freshman Karson Cook pitched in relief for Calaveras. Calaveras pitching gave up 14 hits, six doubles, two triples, hit six batters, while walking two and striking out six. Calaveras (7-17, 7-9) has two regular season games remaining. On May 4, Calaveras will head to Sutter Creek to take on Amador. And on Monday, May 7, it will wrap up its season with a home game against Linden. Both games begin at 4 p.m. “We had a pretty good season with what we had,” DeLappe said. “Even to be sniffing playoffs this late in the year is pretty good for us. Hopefully we can finish out strong and go 9-9 in league.” Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request.

In a tweet, she wrote, ""i'm queer. not bi, not straight. i'm attracted to women, men, REALLY attracted to queer men, non binary people, intersex people, trans people. lil poly pansexual papi hello good morning. does that answer your questions?"" ( She then wrote that she's the least attracted to straight men. ) When asked why she retracted the tweet, she responded, ""i retracted my queer tweet because i am being corrected about the way in which i listed the gender spectrum and i'm super super sensitive to being offensive especially when i'm only trying to appreciate."" She recently announced that she paired with Fashion Nova to donate $50,000 to various LGBTQ organizations across the United States, Gay Star News noted.

Openly gay rapper Jurnee also made the final 10 ( by also being saved by the judges ), putting two LGBTQ people of color in the select group, Human Rights Campaign noted. Evan Rachel Wood replied to a troll on social media who questioned her acting talent, Just Jared noted. A troll tweeted while watching Westworld, ""Why is Dolores still the only 'robot' on #Westworld without a personality? Oh. I know why. It's because @evanrachelwood can't actually act anything but 2 emotions."" Wood responded, ""Hmm. Maybe you should put on the corset in 113 degree weather, spend time away from your family, risk your life on horse-back, cry at the drop of a hat and relive your traumas over and over and over, be dragged and beaten till all hours of the night, sacrifice your childhood to work and take acting classes 5 times a week, and work your entire life fighting through criticism and sexism to make it on this show, THEN show me how its doneBu.""

Miller. On April 9, the former Silicon Valley star was arrested after calling in a bogus bomb threat March 18 while traveling aboard an Amtrak train. ( No explosives were found. ) In addition, in 2016, Miller was arrested for allegedly assaulting an Uber driver in Los Angeles over a disagreement about Donald Trump. The following year, he and his wife, artist and actress Kate Gorney, were ejected from a casino in Monte Carlo. Seven months later, he went on a tirade after transgender acquaintance Danielle Solzman pointed out a transphobic joke on his website. Speaking with Attitude magazine for its cover story on him, singer Troye Sivan said that as a 17-year-old living in Perth, Australia, he was looking for love in order to try and fit in, Billboard noted. Sivan said he ended up getting a fake ID and a Grindr profile in order to try and participate in gay nightlife: ""[I] started to try to meet people who were like me, but you sort of are forced a little bit into these hyper-sexualized environments, and even though that's awesome when you're 17. ... I didn't know what else to do."" Part of that experience meant that Sivan had regular encounters with older gay men, with Sivan adding that, more than anything else, these trysts left him feeling afraid. Early in his career, fashion maven Andre Leon Talley was horrified to learn that he had a reputation for being a fashion groupie, Page Six reported. the former Vogue staffer said after a screening of a new film on his life, The Gospel According to Andre, ""Because I was so busy in Parisembracing the great Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Karl Lagerfeldmy editor came to me and said, 'You've got the worst reputation in town. You have slept in every designer bed there is.'"" However, Talley insisted at the Tribeca Film Festival screening that he's made it because ""what I project is originality. ... The sexual orientation was not pronounced. Ashley Judd has filed a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein alleging that his pattern of retaliation, defamation, and sabotage against women who refused his sexual advances damaged her career, according to Deadline. The claims partly hinge on the recent news reports about Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh wanting to cast Judd in their Lord of the Rings movies back in 1998. The suit say that as retaliation for Judd rejecting Weinstein, he ""torpedoed Ms. Judd's incredible professional opportunity"" when he told Jackson and Walsh ""that [his] studio had had a 'bad experience' with Judd.

Bob,Diamond,809,https://therealdeal.com/2018/05/03/ronn-torossian-buys-at-zeckendorfs-520-park/,"520 Park Avenue and Ronn Torossian Ronn Torossian, the controversial public relations executive who has represented the who’s who of the real estate world, is the latest buyer at Zeckendorf Development’s 520 Park Avenue. Torossian, the founder of 5WPR, is in contract to buy a full-floor unit in the Robert A.M. Stern-designed building, the New York Post reported. It’s not clear what Torossian paid for his new digs, but StreetEasy currently lists only two full-floor units with asking prices of $20.5 million and $31.65 million. The PR man is now perhaps best known for his dealings with those in President Trump’s orbit. Last month, Torossian penned an op-ed announcing that he testified before a Washington grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller about his involvement with Paul Manafort. His firm also represented Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest television station operator in the U.S. that has recently been in the spotlight for requiring its anchors to read pro-Trump scripts. Politico recently ran a profile of Torossian, which detailed his association with former Bayrock Group CEO Felix Sater and Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen. In 2011, he was accused of extorting Kabbalah rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto by threatening to leak damaging financial information to the press if he wasn’t put on retainer, though he was never charged with a crime and denied the claims. In 2015, an Israeli court convicted Pinto on bribery charges, and he served a year in prison. Torossian has also represented a number of other real estate figures, including Michael Shvo and Elie Hirschfeld. And for a time, he represented The Real Deal. Other residents at 520 Park include billionaire Frank Fertitta, former owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship; former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Dyson company founder James Dyson.

Phillip,Frost,808,https://features.miami.edu/2018/frost-science-and-engineering-building/,"In the two minutes it took University of Miami biomedical engineer Ashutosh Agarwal to explain his organs-on-a-chip research to a reporter, five people in the United States had suffered a heart attack. By the time UM organic chemist Jean-Hubert Oliver had concluded his five-minute presentation on new methods to capture energy from the sun and other sources, millions of batteries had found their way into landfills across the nation. But heart disease, environmental waste, and other challenges need not be the bane of the world. Scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical advances that only a few years ago were regarded as the stuff of science fiction are now making such seemingly intractable problems solvable. Thursday, on an occasion described as “the dawn of a bold new era” for UM, the University took a giant step forward in advancing such research, breaking ground on its new Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building, an iconic structure that will house an intertwined network of institutes aimed at boosting STEM across its campuses. “Today, we ignite the spark that will ensure that the light of discovery and innovation will shine at the U far into the future,” said Jeffrey Duerk, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. Both the facility, which UM President Julio Frenk said will “put science on display,” and the network of institutes, which are known as the Frost Institutes of Science and Engineering, are made possible by a landmark $100 million gift from the namesake UM benefactors whose legacy at the University is well known in the form of a gift that named the Frost School of Music. Noting that the future Frost Science and Engineering Building links the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Engineering, Duerk said it is fitting that the Frost Institute of Chemistry and Molecular Science, established last year, is the first of the individual institutes to be created. “Chemistry is the central science—everything in the physical, life, and applied sciences intersects with chemistry,” he said. “It touches on everything from biology to engineering, and from medicine and health sciences to oceanography.” UM, he said, needs to act boldly if it is to be a leader in interdisciplinary STEM research and education. “The Frosts’ gift makes that possible, and the impact will be felt not only at the U but also throughout the greater South Florida community and beyond,” he explained. The groundbreaking ceremony, held on a green space that is envisioned as a scientific quad on the Coral Gables campus and complete with an exploding mound of dirt that spewed orange and green foam, comes almost a year to the day that the Frost Museum of Science opened in downtown Miami. In a move to enhance an existing relationship between the University and the museum (the coral reef research of UM marine biologist Andrew Baker has been featured at the museum), the University and the downtown facility will collaborate on a range of STEM education- and research-focused programs and activities, Frenk announced at the ceremony. “We want to cultivate an interest in science in the museum’s youngest visitors and, we hope, inspire many of them to pursue their educations in the STEM disciplines at UM,” he said. The University of Miami took a giant step forward in advancing STEM research at the U, breaking ground on its new Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building. Enjoy a this recap of the groundbreaking. Those disciplines are already thriving at UM, and Thursday about 300 invited guests got an up-close look at what’s taking place in UM’s cutting-edge labs. This includes the work of Agarwal, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, whose organs-on-a-chip research simulates the activities, mechanics, and physiological response of entire organs and organ systems, leading to a less time-consuming and more effective way to test new drugs. And the work of assistant professor of Chemistry Oliver, whose research in capturing energy from sources other than batteries, could lead to clothes that charge your smartphone as you walk. Graduate and undergraduate students are responsible for a good portion of STEM research at UM, as well. Rachel Besser, a research assistant in biomedical engineering who works in Agarwal’s lab, is collaborating with a Miller School clinician in an investigation of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, using organs-on-a-chip technology to create an out-of-body platform to study the cells of patients who have the neurological disorder. Crystal Nattoo, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, is helping to create sensors that can detect different concentrations of oxygen and differentiate solvents—work that has major implications for the medical field, she said. “For future institutes, we will continue to galvanize our scientists, researchers, and students to delve into the big problems that matter, be they in neuro-engineering, smart cities, data science, or any of the other disciplines that will shape the future of our planet and our society,” said Duerk. Indeed, of the Frosts’ $100 million gift, $30 million is designated to the creation of at least 13 chairs in STEM fields, with $3 million set aside for graduate student support. The creation of the Frost Institutes, patterned after the National Institutes of Health, is the backbone of STEM@UM, one of the nine transformational initiatives to propel the University toward its greatest aspirations by its centennial in 2025, allowing for STEM growth, a stimulation of interdisciplinary research collaboration, and engagement with greater Miami as a hemispheric innovation hub. Richard Fain, chair of UM’s Board of Trustees, praised the Frosts for their gift. “The Frosts could support whatever causes they want,” said Fain. “But for them to support Miami and the University of Miami is truly amazing, and we’re lucky to have them.” But Phillip Frost, a UM trustee for 35 years, deflected Fain’s praise, saying “we are all emissaries and are all visionaries.” Said Frost, “It’s up to us to either give what we can or convince other people to get involved in good causes.” Copyright: 2018 University of Miami.

Check out Trent Copeland’s tips for taking home the big bucks. SuperCoach editor Tom Sangster talks through his buy, hold and sell options for round 9, 2018. Dallin Watene-Zelezniak of the Panthers.Source:AAP DO you like money? I certainly do! If you love SuperCoach NRL — presented by hipages — you’ll love Perfect 8. Especially now there is up to $360k in prizes. We’ve also upped the ante by introducing a $1,000 WEEKLY PRIZE! Here is a rundown on how easy it is to play! It literally takes two minutes, and I mean, think of what you could do with all that cash… Onto trying to win the massive $270k this week… Broncos vs. Bulldogs - Thursday 7.50pm at Suncorp Stadium Tevita Pangai Jnr FRF | 2RF (Broncos) - TPJ has insanely high upside if he sees the 55-60 minutes we’re all praying for and the muzzle on the offload is taken off. Perfect 8 is a great way to throw a line in on that upside. 58 points in 49 minutes last week is a great sign he’s building back up after that twang of the hammy. Other options: Anthony Milford, Jamayne Isaako, Raymond Faitala-Mariner, Moses Mbye Tevita Pangai Junior has a high ceiling.Source:AAP Knights vs. Rabbitohs - Friday 6.00pm at McDonald Jones Stadium Ken Sio CTW (Knights) - Ok, so the likelihood of this coming to fruition is slim, but if you weren’t aware Sio added the goal kicking duties to his armoury last weekend (and did a very good job of it), and is coming up against rookie Campbell Graham on the left edge Kalyn Ponga has made so damaging this season. I love any of Sio, Lachlan Fitzgibbon or Ponga himself for that reason. Other options: Kalyn Ponga, Lachlan Fitzgibbon, Angus Crichton, Damien Cook Panthers vs. Cowboys - Friday 7.55pm at Carrington Park Dallin Watene-Zelezniak FLB | CTW (Panthers) - In my hometown of Bathurst, I’m backing the new Panthers’ No.1 to continue a great scoring run of fullbacks against the Cowboys. DWZ has a very solid SuperCoach history at fullback averaging over 55PPG there in his career and we know how good he is as a finisher when given the chance. The Bathurst game last season against the Raiders produced a mammoth point scoring total and both fullbacks that day went bonkers! James Maloney is also the highest projected scorer of ANY player in SuperCoach this week - according to SuperCoach Stats - with 89 points. Other options: James Maloney, Viliame Kikau, Johnathan Thurston, Michael Morgan Dallin Watene-Zelezniak has moved to fullback.Source:AAP Raiders vs. Titans - Saturday 3.00pm at GIO Stadium Jai Arrow 2RF (Titans) - My word this guy is a stud! Corey Parker 2.0 may even be under clubbing on current form, as Arrow has even been talked about as a likely starter in Queensland’s Origin I side. In a SuperCoach sense, he scored 86 points in 57 minutes last week, and is averaging 71PPG so far this season. Barring an outside back like Rapana scoring a couple of tries, I think Arrow is a huge chance of being the man in this game. Other options: Josh Papalii, Nick Cotric, Ash Taylor, Michael Gordon Warriors vs. Tigers - Saturday 5.30pm at Mt. Smart Stadium Esan Marsters CTW (Tigers) - It’s a tough one given the likes of Shaun Johnson, Simon Mannering and Tohu Harris are also on display here at home but Marsters is possibly the hottest player in SuperCoach right now. 92 points against the Eels last week, and an average of 65.13PPG this season without a SINGLE try shows just how high the scoring floor is, but also how high he could go if he finds the try line. Mannering and Kata are solid defensively on his side though as one potential detractor. Other options: Luke Brooks, Mahe Fonua, Shaun Johnson, David Fusitua PODCAST!!! It was a HUGE teams day — and most of the news was bad for SuperCoach. Tom Sangster and Tim Williams survey the wreckage. Sharks vs. Eels - Saturday 7.35pm at Southern Cross Group Stadium Clint Gutherson FLB | CTW (Eels) - One of my favourite players to watch in the NRL has made a very solid comeback from injury and it’s no surprise it has coincided with the Eels now winning games. Whilst Gutho hasn’t gone massive yet, I believe it’s only a matter of time for a guy who averaged 67.4PPG last season. Other options: Mitchell Moses, Kurt Capewell, Andrew Fifita, Jesse Ramien Dragons vs. Storm - Sunday 2.00pm at Jubilee Oval Gareth Widdop 5/8 (Dragons) - Widdop has traditionally struggled against his former club, and that surely comes as no surprise as the Storm are one of the best defensive teams in the competition. But Widdop has gone to new heights this year and he has a ridiculously good average at this venue in the past 10 matches. Get on! Other options: Josh Addo-Carr, Cameron Smith, Ben Hunt, Nene MacDonald Roosters vs. Sea Eagles - Sunday 4.10pm at Allianz Stadium Marty Taupau FRF (Sea Eagles) - I’m all in on the big KAPOW this week after the massive 96 points in 62 minutes last week, all basically in base stats (for him), as well as the Roosters’ history of leaking massive offload tallies to opposition big-men. I mean, the Burgess brothers (NOT SAM!) tore the Roosters middle third apart two weeks ago. Expect a biggie, whilst everyone focuses on the Turbos! Other options: Shaun Lane, Tom Trbojevic, Jake Trbojevic, James Tedesco Good luck! Will this be the week where someone takes home a huge wad of cash? Let’s hope so.

Michael,Gordon,806,https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/21526/gbpnzd-exchange-rate-news-and-five-day-currency-predictions-forecast.html,"On 2nd May, the Pound to New Zealand Dollar exchange rate opened trading in the region of 1.9437 but later closed down lower around 1.9404. This deterioration came despite the UK construction sector PMI showing above-forecast growth in April with a rise from 51.7 points to 52.8. In the background, demand for the Pound gradually fell as GBP traders considered the ongoing political clash over the UK remaining in the EU customs union after Brexit. The crux of the issue is that pro-Brexit MPs want the UK to leave the customs union as well as leave the EU, despite the economic risks this could entail. The House of Commons seems to have split down the middle on the issue, which has created a perception of instability among Pound traders and lowered confidence. Better news came out of New Zealand on 2nd May, when it was reported that the Q1 2018 unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since December 2008 at 4.4%. This was the fifth drop in a row for the quarterly jobless rate, although not everyone was convinced that this would lead to higher wages and interest rate hikes. Among the cautious economists was Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon, who said; ‘Notably, the share of workers receiving no pay increase at all has been trending higher in the last few years, and is now at its highest since 2010, which was in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis’. The Pound (GBP) has struggled against the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) today, falling by -0.5% in the pairing. This deterioration has been triggered by April’s services sector PMI reading, which has risen but not by as much as expected. Commenting on the disappointing data, IHS Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson said; ‘The three PMI surveys collectively showed only a muted rebound in business activity after being disrupted by heavy snowfall in March, failing to regain February’s pace of growth to suggest that the underlying performance of the economy has continued to deteriorate’. Closing with a suggestion that there may even be a Bank of England (BoE) interest rate cut instead of a hike in the future, Mr Williamson stated; ‘Any further slowing will also raise questions as to whether the November rate hike may have been ill-timed’. New Zealand Dollar traders have had a comparatively quieter day of data today, with the only major announcement being that NZ commodity prices have risen for the fourth month in a row in April. This was mainly down to rising dairy prices, despite the most recent -1.1% drop in global dairy prices reported on the Global Dairy Trade price index. As New Zealand is a major exporter of dairy products, rising dairy prices are naturally beneficial to economic growth. Looking ahead, there could be extreme Pound to New Zealand Dollar (GBP/NZD) exchange rate turbulence in the coming week, when the Bank of England makes its interest rate decision on 10th May. Some economists are still forecasting a rise from 0.5% to 0.75%, but others believe that this is highly unlikely after the latest run of disappointing data. If BoE policymakers do raise UK interest rates, the Pound could rally against the New Zealand Dollar and hit monthly exchange rate highs. On the other hand, an interest rate freeze might spark widespread disappointment and lead to GBP/NZD exchange rate losses. There will also be a Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate decision next week, coming a day earlier on 9th May. This will likely be a quieter affair than the BoE event, as there are no real expectations for policy adjustment. The New Zealand Dollar could still appreciate against the Pound on the day if RBNZ officials suggest that the unemployment rate drop could bring near-term monetary policy tightening.

More than a dozen foreign banks have licences to operate in Saudi Arabia, battling for business resulting from the kingdom’s efforts to wean itself off reliance on oil revenues. US bank Citi ended a five-decade presence in Saudi Arabia in 2004 with the sale of its 20% stake in Samba Financial, but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and in January 2018 gained approval to launch investment banking operations in the state. “We’re looking at whether or not we should expand our activities here into a full banking licence,” James Forese, the president and CE of the bank’s institutional clients group, said at a business conference in Riyadh. Other banks seeking a Saudi licence include Credit Suisse, while Goldman Sachs plans to expand its services in the kingdom after being cleared to trade equities there. The banks are vying for a role in Saudi Aramco’s planned initial public offering, which could float up to 5% of the state oil group and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. Citi has played an active role in Saudi Arabian finance and was one of the banks that helped to arrange the government’s $11bn bond issue in April. The kingdom is now working on a privatisation pipeline aimed at generating up to about 40-billion riyals ($135.5bn) in nonoil revenue by 2020 and creating up to 12,000 jobs, according to an official document published in April. HSBC had been mandated for several of the planned privatisations and would announce them soon, Samir Assaf, HSBC’s CE of global banking and markets, said on Wednesday.

Andrew,Davis,803,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Gus-Kenworthy-Joy-Reid-transgender-troops/62780.html,"The Daily Beast will suspend future columns from Joy Reid due to the fallout over anti-gay comments she made on an old blog a decade ago, TheWrap reported. Although she apologized for content on her old blog The Reid Report back in December, the MSNBC host has denied the latest revelations reported by Mediaite, saying that her the long defunct website was hacked. Things continued to spiral for Reidand MSNBCover the story, which has now moved beyond the revelations reported by Mediaite to whether Reid was being honest about claims of hacking. On April 28, Reid opened her show on MSNBC with a mea culpa about past homophobic remarks and admitted cybersecurity experts haven't been able to prove her former blog was hacked. Six former U.S. surgeons general have signed a statement disputing Defense Department assertions about the medical fitness of transgender troops, according to a Palm Center press release. Former U.S. Surgeons General M. Joycelyn Elders and David Satcher originally released the statement last month� in response to a Pentagon proposal to reinstate the transgender ban. In part, the letter ( with Elders, Satcher, Richard Carmona, Regina Benjamin, Vevek Murthy and Kenneth P. Moritsugu as signees ) says, ""We underscore that transgender troops are as medically fit as their non-transgender peers and that there is no medically valid reasonincluding a diagnosis of gender dysphoriato exclude them from military service or to limit their access to medically necessary care."" Washington, D.C., police homicide detectives learned from at least two witnesses that a 35-year-old District man arrested for the March 24 shooting death of gay D.C. resident Sean Anderson, 48, was invited by Anderson to Anderson's apartment on the night of the murder to have sex in exchange for crack cocaine, The Washington Blade reported. Jerome Wilson has been charged with second-degree murder while armed in connection with Anderson's death. A Superior Court judge ordered Wilson held without bond and scheduled a preliminary hearing for the case for May 18. Funeral services were recently held for Crae Pridgen Jr., 53, who attracted nationwide attention as an outspoken witness in the 1993 Mickey Ratz assault case ( involving a downtown Wilmington, North Carolina, gay bar ), StarNewsOnline.com reported. Pridgen died March 2 at Florida Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He had been an outspoken witness against three Camp Lejeune Marines over a Jan. 30, 1993, incident at Mickey Ratz, a private club. In April 1993, District Judge Jacqueline Morris-Goodson acquitted the Marines on assault charges, after six days of testimony. Joe Wattsa figure who was the king of Houston gay theater from the early 1980s to the 2000sdied March 12 after a battle with cancer at age 76, the Houston Chronicle reported. In 1985, during an extremely anti-gay period in Houston's history when many gays were deep in the closet, he founded one of the city's first gay theater companies, The Group Theater. Later, in the mid-1990s, he went on to found another queer theater ensemble, Theatre New West, in Montrose. Hawaii lawmakers approved a ban on so-called ""gay conversion therapy"" treatments conducted on minors, Hawaii News Now reported. LGBT-rights advocates say the practicelargely discredited by healthcare professionalsdoes more harm than good to those who are subjected to it. Several states, including California, Oregon and New Jersey, have already passed similar laws; Maryland passed legislation banning the practice in April. Hawaii is now the 12th state to ban the practice. Journalist Thomas Roberts has announced plans to make a $25,000 donation to the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC )indirectly from President Donald Trump, The Washington Blade reported. While accepting HRC's Leadership & Visibility Award at its Maryland Summit recently, Roberts reminded the audience that he emceed the 2013 Miss Universe competition in Moscow. The former MSNBC anchor explains that he decided to host the event, ""because I wanted people to know that members of the LGBTQ community are not a threat to you."" His appearance earned him $25,000, but Roberts announced he wants to donate the money to HRC. An Indiana pizzeria that came under scrutiny several years ago for refusing to cater gay weddings has shut downpossibly for good, Gay Star News reported. According to the South Bend Tribune, a sign posted on Memories Pizza in Walkerton, Indiana, indicated it closed sometime in March. Owners Kevin and Crystal O'Connor stated their restaurant would never cater a same-sex wedding; their position came in support of the state's Freedom Restoration Act. After receiving backlash, the spot temporarily closed its doors; however, after a cash infusion, it reopened. Now, reportedly, the owners want to retire. Houston doctor Joseph Varon said he has witnessed discrimination in every corner of the medical professionfrom doctors and nurses, in clinics and hospitals, and in teaching environments, Outsmart Magazine noted. The ally said this discrimination has been particularly flagrant toward LGBTQ patientsa fact that gnawed at him. Varon proceeded to design a 30-question anonymous survey and send it to 12,000 professionals; he said, ""Roughly one in five reported treating homosexuals differently from straight patients, based on their moral or religious beliefs. That's 20 percent."" Varon presented the preliminary results of his survey at the fall annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians in Toronto. The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ), Equality Kansas and the ACLU of Kansas took out a full-page ad""Keep Kansas Open To All""in the Topeka Capital-Journal and the Wichita Eagle, an HRC press release noted. The ad highlights the overwhelming opposition from the business community to HB 2481legislation currently pending before the Kansas House of Representatives that would create a license to discriminate with taxpayer funds against LGBTQ foster or adoptive parents, single parents or other qualified families. In Texas, Austin man James Miller has avoided going to prison by claiming the man he stabbed to death had come onto him, NewNowNext.com noted. Miller will serve 10 years probation after being convicted of criminally negligent homicide in the killing his neighbor Daniel Spencer in September 2015. The night of the stabbing, Miller testified, Spencer became angry when he spurned his sexual advances. Transgender Law Center's Positively Trans project has launched #ACApositivea campaign to shift the conversation about health are and the Affordable Care Act toward a focus on the life-or-death stakes for transgender people living with HIV, a press release noted. Launching just a week after news broke that the Trump administration plans to attack the Affordable Care Act's protections for transgender people, the campaign aims to amplify the experiences and voices of transgender people of color living with HIV in federal health care policy. See https://transgenderlawcenter.org/acapositive. The U.S. Senate confirmed Kyle Duncan, an anti-LGBT candidate, for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by a vote of 50-47, a Lambda Legal press release noted. Lambda Legal CEO Rachel B. Tiven said, in part, ""Kyle Duncan has made a career for himself targeting LGBT children and families. The idea that Mr. Duncan will cast aside his bigoted beliefs overnight, and miraculously transform into an impartial judge, is ludicrous and reckless. His career has been one long grudge match against women and LGBT Americansnow the Trump/Pence Administration is making him a referee."" Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Trump's pick to lead the Veterans Affairs Department, has been accused of creating a hostile work environment, drinking while on duty and improperly prescribing drugs to staff during his time as White House doctor to two administrations, NPR reported. Montana Sen. Jon Tester detailed the allegations in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered, saying more than 20 military employees disclosed the as-yet-unsubstantiated allegations to senators ahead of a hearing to debate his nomination to lead the VA. The Hispanic National Bar Association ( HNBA ), the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association ( NAPABA ) and the National Bar Association ( NBA ) released a statement in response to the recent decision made by the Judge John D. Bates of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia regarding the Trump Administration's attempt to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program, a press release noted. ( Bates stayed his decision for 90 days, granting the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) the opportunity to provide a well-founded justification for terminating the DACA program. ) In part, NAPABA President Pankit J. Doshi said, ""We cannot continue to leave the lives of these vulnerable members of the immigrant community in limbo. NAPABA continues to stand in support of the DREAMers."" Kanye West turned his attention to prominent activist and Parkland school shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez, who he called his ""hero"" on Twitter while publishing a photo of her, Vulture.com noted. However, Gonzalez chose to forgo acknowledging West in favor of copying the format of his tweet to celebrate her own hero: James Shaw Jr.the man who made the news for stopping the Waffle House shooter. That very same minute, West posted a selfie of himself with his head shaved with the caption ""inspired by Emma."" For years, Cassandra Bankson became a master at the cover-upbut it wasn't until the model and beauty vlogger finally cleared her skin that she realized she was using her chronic cystic acne to conceal another reality: she's lesbian, Yahoo! Lifestyle reported. ""This has been my deepest secret,"" says Bankson, who candidly chronicled her skin-care journey with her 824K followers on YouTube. ""Once I started coming out to friends and familywhich I did individually, one by onemy acne started to get better."" On a recent episode of his show, Bill Maher asked out journalist Ronan Farrow if #MeToo has gone too far, bringing up men like former U.S. Sen. Al Franken and Master of None's Aziz Ansari, EW.com noted. ""I think that our culture has actually been pretty good on the whole about self-regulating,"" Farrow said. ""That blog about Aziz Ansari came out, it was clearly a single-source narrative about a date gone wrong and there was a debate about how far gone wrong it was, but I don't think anyone saw that and said, 'He's Harvey Weinstein. This is a multiple rapist.' I think people have separated these things clearly."" Former NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw has been accused of sexual harassment by former NBC anchor Linda Vester, TheWrap reported, citing Variety. Vester said that Brokaw tried to force her to kiss him on two separate occasions, groped her in a NBC conference room and showed up at her hotel room uninvited. Two friends of Vester corroborated to Variety that she told them about the encounters at the time, and she shared her journal entries from the time period with the news outlet. Brokaw ( who has denied Vester's allegations as well as those of another woman ) has never before been publicly accused of sexual harassment in the past. However, in a related development, more than 100 women have signed a letter defending Brokaw, CNNMoney reported. Among the names defending Brokaw are some high-profile personalities, including MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Mika Brzezinski, White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell, chief foreign affairs correspondent Andrea Mitchell and NBC special anchor Maria Shriver. Chicana photographer Laura Aguilarwhose retrospective at the Vincent Price Museum of Art in Monterrey Park, California, now on view at the Frost Art Museum at Florida International University in Miami, made her one of the breakout stars of the Getty Foundation's recent Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA initiativehas died at age 58, ArtNews.com noted. In her series ""Latina Lesbians"" ( 1986—90 ), she photographed gay Latina women, with her subjects gazing directly into the camera's view; below the images, each of which is mounted on white paper, are captions ( some include spelling errors ) that detail these women's opinions of what it means to be a woman, a lesbian, and/or a Latina. Phoenix city officials have approved changing a couple crosswalks to celebrate gay pride, the Seattle Times noted. The city council voted to allow two crosswalks in central Phoenix to get a makeover with rainbow designs to celebrate the LGBT community. One crosswalk will be in the city's Melrose District, which is anchored by several gay bars; another will be close to the downtown headquarters of several LGBT organizations. Several cities have rainbow crosswalks, including San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C. On May 10, the University of Virginia is hosting a healthcare conference on caring for LGBT patients, WVTF.org reported. Ken Whitean associate dean of nursing at the university who happens to be openly gaysaid he knows many health care professionals who are even more uncomfortable with transgender men and women. ""They don't know what to say,"" he explained. ""They don't want to make a mistake, so they don't say anything, and that makes patients feel isolated."" See https://www.nursing.virginia.edu/media/5-10-18-LGBTQSymposium.pdf. Home-furnishings brand Mitchell Gold + Bob Williams is conducting a CEO search, a press release noted. CEO/Chairman Mitchell Gold, who co-founded the company with President of Design Bob Williams, said, ""Bob and I built this company from the ground up with an incredible team, and now we want someone to take the reins, work with us to transition the company to the next generation of leadership, and allow me to focus on my strengths, including new strategic partnerships for both our products and our ethos."" Regional bartending champions from 14 U.S. and Canadian cities will vie for mixology mastery June 6-10 in the final rounds of the Stoli Key West Cocktail Classic, a press release stated. The top two bartenders are to receive a combined total of $20,000 for charity, with a portion given to a Key West organization of their choice and the rest to a favorite hometown charity. See Out.com/keywestcocktailclassic. Controversial alt-right media figurehead Milo Yiannopoulos was shouted out of NYC bar Churchill Tavern, Eater New York noted. Members of the Democratic Socialists of America chanted, ""Nazi scum, get out"" at Yiannopoulos until he did just that. He then took to Instagram to say the group ""shoved and screamed at"" himalthough a video of the incident showed a relatively peaceful scene.

Michael,Gordon,800,https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/103553800/jobless-rate-falls-to-the-lowest-level-in-nearly-a-decade,"© 2018 Stuff Limited Unemployment has fallen for the fifth quarter a row, as the economy continues to add almost 1000 jobs a week. Statistics New Zealand figures showed unemployment fell to 4.4 per cent in the three months to March 31, down from 4.5 per cent at the end of 2017. Unemployment has not been that low since the end of 2008. The figures showed the number of people employed rose by 15,000 in the first three months of the year. As well as more people having at least some work, there are signs that fewer people are seeking more hours. READ MORE: Unemployment drops to 4.5 per cent as NZ adds thousands of jobs The seasonally adjusted underutilisation rate fell to 11.9 per cent, down from 12.2 percent in the December 2017. Across New Zealand, Statistics NZ estimates that 340,000 people are in a position to take on more hours and would like to, however this fell by 5000 over the quarter. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said the labour market was becoming tight. ""Firms are finding it increasingly difficult to find new workers, as the pool of available workers has narrowed over time."" However Gordon said wage growth was ""missing in action"", with the labour cost index climbing by just 0.3 per cent in the quarter, below what economists were expecting. Annually, the labour cost index climbed by 1.9 per cent, however if the aged-care worker settlement was excluded, the index would have risen by just 1.6 per cent. ""Notably, the share of workers receiving no pay increase at all has been trending higher in the last few years, and is now at its highest since 2010, which was in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis,"" Gordon said.

Michael,Gordon,800,https://www.ifa.com.au/news/25471-asic-bans-morgans-financial-adviser,"ASIC has permanently banned a Brisbane-based adviser licensed by Morgans Financial for taking funds he borrowed from clients to put into his own personal investments. The corporate regulator has permanently banned Queensland financial adviser Michael Gordon McIlwraith Taylor. From 2007 to 2015, Mr Taylor borrowed approximately $1.2 million from 16 clients to fund his own investments, and in doing so ""took advantage of his professional relationship with those clients"" and ""exposed them to high financial risks,"" said an ASIC statement.

Forese said there had been a normalisation of interest rate policies but the global market was still accommodative to companies seeking to raise funds. Speaking at a business conference in Riyadh, he added that Citigroup was considering expanding its activities in Saudi Arabia into a full banking licence.

U.S. bank Citi ended a five-decade presence in Saudi Arabia in 2004 with the sale of its 20 percent stake in Samba Financial but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and in January this year gained approval to begin investment banking operations in the kingdom. “We’re looking at whether or not we should expand our activities here into a full banking license,” James Forese, the president and chief executive of the bank’s institutional clients group, said at a business conference in Riyadh. Other banks seeking a Saudi license include Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to expand its services in the kingdom after being cleared to trade equities there. The banks are vying for a role in Saudi Aramco’s IPO-ARMO.SE planned initial public offering, which could float up to 5 percent of the state oil giant and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalization. Citi has already played an active role in Saudi Arabian finance and was one of the banks that helped to arrange the government’s $11 billion U.S. dollar bond issue last month. The kingdom is now working on a pipeline of privatizations aimed at generating up to 40 billion riyals ($10.7 billion) in non-oil revenues by 2020 and creating up to 12,000 jobs, according to an official document published last month. HSBC (HSBA.L) has been mandated for several of the planned privatizations and will announce them very soon, Samir Assaf, HSBC’s chief executive of global banking and markets, said at Wednesday’s conference. The bank is “very much contributing to the privatization program”, he said. HSBC Saudi Arabia is already acting as an adviser on the sale process for the kingdom’s flour milling sector and the Saudi Stock Exchange’s planned flotation. It also has an advisory role on the proposed Aramco listing. ($1 = 3.7502 riyals) Editing by David Goodman All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

James,Forese,798,http://www.arabnews.com/node/1295366/business-economy,"ISTANBUL: Turkey on Wednesday lashed out at a debt downgrade by ratings agency S&P as dubiously timed less than two months ahead of elections and based on lackluster analysis. S&P on Tuesday dropped Turkey’s foreign currency debt ratings to a speculative ‘BB-/B’ for long- and short-term issues respectively, citing deteriorating finances and rising inflation. Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek, the government’s pointman on the economy, accused S&P of deliberately bringing forward a ratings assessment initially planned for August to before June 24 polls. “It is clear that the decision was brought forward to an earlier date,” he wrote on Twitter, accusing the agency of “incorrect timing.” “The analysis of S&P is also inadequate,” he added. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has announced snap presidential and parliamentary elections on June 24 instead of November 3, 2019 to fully legalize a new executive presidency boosting the powers of head of state. A potentially worsening economic climate is seen as one of the reasons behind Erdogan’s abrupt move although this has been rejected by government officials. The country posted a strong growth of 7.4 percent last year but the data failed to douse fears over the underlying health of the economy, in particular that it is overheating with high inflation, a weak currency and wide current account deficit. S&P said: “Our downgrade reflects our view that there is a risk of a hard landing for Turkey’s overheating, credit-fueled economy.” But Simsek said overheating fears were “a story of 2017” as the increases in credit volumes slowed down in 2018, financial conditions were tighter and the central bank had also acted by raising rates. He said the deterioration in the current account deficit was likely to be temporary and vowed reforms would be accelerated after the elections. Markets responded positively to the elections being brought forward from the original date of November 2019 which has reduced the political uncertainty, he said. The robustness of Turkey’s economy has always been a political ace of Erdogan since his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) first came to power in 2002. Erdogan credits himself with rescuing the country from the chaos that brought it to near financial meltdown in the 2000-2001 crisis to create an “Anatolian tiger” with thriving industry and services. GIZA: Uber is launching a new minibus service in traffic-mad Cairo, Egypt’s capital and the ride-sharing US giant’s fastest-growing market. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was to hold a news conference on Tuesday with the famed Giza pyramids in the background to elaborate on the plans. Microbuses — such as the ones Uber plans to use — are notorious in Cairo. Often over-packed, speeding and veering across traffic lanes with little concern for traffic safety and other drivers, the vehicles are the only affordable method of travel for millions of people in Egypt, where public transport is chronically overloaded. Uber drivers have come into conflict with taxis in Egypt, as in other countries. But many in the country of 100 million people say the service provides cleaner vehicles and driver accountability.

Jeffrey,Rothschild,796,https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2018/5/1/residential-colleges-vanderbilt-donors,"photo: Paul Brady Photography/shutterstock With the American higher education system besieged by rising costs, escalating tuition, and a metastasizing student loan crisis, many experts are arguing for more affordable and accessible approaches to post-secondary education. Alternatives to four years of quad life include faster competency-based credentialing and models that stress online learning. At least a few donors are on board, like Chicago financier Larry Gies and his wife Beth. The couple recently gave $150 million to the University of Illinois to ""use technology to democratize"" education, among other things. By exploring how online courses can lower costs and remove barriers to entry, the Gieses are among the few mega-donors addressing the root causes of the student loan crisis. More typical are donors who have fond memories of their campus years and are determined that future generations be able to enjoy the same kind of experience—or better. Recent news out of Tennessee reminds us that many donors remain committed to the immersive benefits of a residential college experience. Vanderbilt University board of trust chairman Bruce R. Evans and his wife Bridgitt committed $20 million to support university initiatives focused on the ""undergraduate living-learning experience."" The gift also includes support for leadership positions in the School of Engineering and an unrestricted bequest for future use. While many colleges are giving online courses a second look, Vanderbilt is doubling down on its residential model. In January, the school announced a $600 million capital project that calls for replacing aging residence halls with ""innovative residential colleges"" over the next five years. ""Four-year residential college systems exist at only a handful of American universities, most notably at Harvard and Yale,"" the press release read. ""Vanderbilt is the only American university undertaking a project of this scale and scope today."" Support from Reliable Education Funders Bridgitt Evans is the co-founder and president of VIA Art Fund, a national nonprofit supporting the contemporary visual arts. (You can check out my 2016 interview with her on the state of arts funding here.) Before founding VIA, she worked as a real estate investor and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and a B.S. from Miami University. Bruce, meanwhile, earned his MBA from Harvard Business School, and is a former managing director and current chairman of the board of Summit Partners, a Boston-based investment firm that is currently managing $14 billion in capital. The couple established the Evans Family Foundation in 2000 with a focus on the arts and education. Previous grantees include Bowdoin College, Boston College, and Roxbury Latin School. They've also created an endowed scholarship fund at their respective undergrad alma maters to help students attend Harvard Business School. Additional support to Vanderbilt includes undergraduate scholarships and leadership positions in the Vanderbilt Career Center and the university’s innovation hub, the Wond’ry. Commenting on their most recent gift, Bridgitt said, ""We are deeply committed to investing in a residential college experience where future leaders can harness the unique, collaborative spirit on this campus to solve problems and drive innovation."" Understanding the ""Undergraduate Living-Learning Experience"" While the school's press release didn't articulate how the Evans gift will specifically support its ""living-learning communities,"" a read of its Undergraduate Residential Experience website and previous gifts to the school provide some clues. ""We believe proximity matters—science, arts, medicine, the humanities, engineering, and more exist within steps of one another on our campus,"" the site reads. Vanderbilt alumnus and board of trust vice chair-elect Jeffrey Rothschild and his wife Marieke are believers as well. In 2016, the couple made a $20 million gift for the development of the College Halls, a living-learning initiative designed to ""build community, support student success, and extend educational opportunities beyond the classroom."" ""The College Halls program enables dialogue among a diverse mix of students—along with faculty involvement, which is important,"" Marieke Rothschild said at the time. ""You need to have that cross-pollination among students. And it's not just about gender or race, it goes for majors as well. The College Halls bring engineers together with history majors with artists to live side by side."" A year later, the College Halls received a $10 million gift from an anonymous donor. While Vanderbilt may be somewhat of an outlier in terms of the scale of its residential college model, the idea itself has attracted donor support elsewhere. A couple of years ago, University of Southern California (USC) trustee David C. Bohnett made a $15 million pledge to endow and name the David C. Bohnett Residential College, which will focus on the principles of ""social justice and community service"" and form part of a student community that ""integrates living and learning"" for up to 320 students as well as faculty-in-residence and student support staff. ""It’s my hope and aspiration that the Bohnett Residential College will afford USC students with a richly immersive college experience and help prepare them to be actively engaged members of the community throughout their lives,"" Bohnett said in making the gift. A year later, USC Trustee Shelly Nemirovsky and her husband Ofer made a gift of $15 million to endow and name another residential college at USC. ""Knowing that all USC students will now have the opportunity to continue conversations beyond the classroom, in the spirit of collaboration, is thrilling for me, and I believe that I am privileged to witness this seminal moment,"" Shelly said. An Enduring Appeal The line of thinking espoused by the Evanses, Rothschilds, Bohnett, and the Nemirovskys explains why donors remain bullish on the integrative residential college experience. College, by definition, should be integrative, collaborative and communal, especially given the growing body of research suggesting that the liberal arts can complement STEM education. E-learning cannot replicate this kind of cross-disciplinary learning environment. Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos made that point in announcing Vanderbilt's ambitious capital campaign earlier this year. ""In a time when long-distance learning and online courses make getting a degree quicker and easier, Vanderbilt is choosing to invest deeply and broadly in an intensive, in-person experience,"" he said. The campaign's $600 million price tag is hefty, but demand is strong for Vanderbilt's ""intensive, in-person experience."" As of 2016, its acceptance rate was 10.7 percent. The total cost of attendance at Vanderbilt last year was $67,392. The school's endowment, meanwhile, stands at $4.1 billion. Contrast this picture with the University of Illinois. Wracked by ongoing budget cuts, enrollment at many of Illinois' public universities dropped in 2017. University officials have had no choice but to embrace technology to reduce costs. Fortunately, the school found an ally in the Gieses. In a way, this is another tale of two Americas. In some flush universities, where times are good, the ideal of the immersive residential experience remains strong and finds the support of deep-pocketed donors. Maybe that model is, indeed, unsustainable over the long term, but you wouldn't know it by watching the flow of donor dollars. As we've so often noted, plenty of campus patrons are eager enablers of a gold-plated higher ed model that entails sky-high tuition costs and, for many grads, decades of student debt. In theory, campus donors concerned about the student debt crisis could help end it by using the power of their purse to impose more discipline on higher ed institutions or to bankroll new experimentation with leaner models. In practice, they're often the best friends that free spending universities have—after private lenders and the federal government. Want to get inside funders' heads? Sign up for our email updates.

Karen,Cummings,795,https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/foodanddrink/mono-lunch-trend-same-every-day-a3829126.html,"Minister Dominic Raab has the Pret special every day — and he’s not alone. Samuel Fishwick orders a mono lunch or register with your social account Already have an account? Log in Controversy at the despatch box might be Westminster’s bread and butter, but lunchbox scandals are new here. Last week’s scandalous allegation #367 contained an arguably more inflammatory footnote. A secretary accused of meeting men via a ""sugar daddy"" website while working for Parliament told the Daily Mirror that the housing minister, Dominic Raab, eats the same lunch every day. ""He has the chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and the vitamin volcano smoothie, every day"", she is reported to have said. ""He is so weird. It’s the Dom Raab Special."" Et tu, chicken baguette? Raab is not alone. One in six workers admit they have eaten the same lunch for at least two years, according to a poll of 2,000 people by New Covent Garden Soup. We should sympathise with this slavish conformity. Londoners are prone to decision fatigue, a phenomenon whereby the more choices we make throughout our day, the harder each one becomes for our brain. The same sandwich every day frees up bandwidth. It’s also comfort food. ""Particularly in times of stress or uncertainty, people seem to cling to the familiar,"" says psychotherapist Hilda Burke. ""I’ve noticed this in clients who are going through painful break-ups. They develop rituals of getting their coffee from a certain place or eating a particular food. Once they feel better the ritual falls away."" The furious march of progress is to blame. Midday meals have become simpler since the Fifties. ""Most people used to eat with their families or other household members, but longer commuting times and suburbanisation, more women in the workforce and shorter breaks mean that cooked meals are very uncommon,"" says Luke Yates, a lecturer in sociology at Manchester University. ""That’s led to the quite spectacular rise of the sandwich in our diet."" The top five most common dishes for weekday lunches are all sandwiches, while the ham sandwich, the most common weekday midday meal (23 per cent), is also the second most common weekend meal after a roast. Yet the destructuring of meals has alarmed social scientists and commentators for some time now — whether it’s increasing numbers of people eating alone, people eating at different times of the day or diets becoming more varied and random. Nutritionist Karen Cummings-Palmer specifically advises her clients not to eat the same meals over and over again because they create intolerances. Furthermore, Yates says, we’ve tipped from working lunches to prioritising dinners. ""Lunches being simpler, quicker and something we’re more likely to eat alone might explain Raab not bothering with variety. Our respondents tended to have cereal for breakfast on weekdays, and I’d be surprised if that was a different cereal every day."" Yet there are those willing to defend the mono-lunch as a simple pleasure born out of necessity. Writer Tyne O’Connell told The Guardian last year that she has eaten a steak tartare at the Wolseley in Mayfair every day since 2003. ""People find it extraordinary that I eat the same meal every day, but I don’t have the kind of palate that yearns for change,"" she said. Artists Gilbert & George eat the same meal at Mangal 2 in Dalston, daily, to reduce decision fatigue. Staff at Gelupo, Jacob Kenedy’s artisan gelateria in Soho, claim that since launching their floral-inspired flavours in mid-April, one man visits after his workout three to four times a week. One patron has been visiting No 11 Pimlico Road since it opened in 2012 and now goes to No 32 The Old Town as she has moved there. She eats a double eggs Florentine with hollandaise on the side pretty much every day. There’s also a theory that because you become bored of the meal, you eat smaller portions as a result. We need not be trammelled by our repetitious lifestyles. Change is all well and good, but one thing we really can believe in is a sandwich. Bread of heaven If you’re going to stick to a single sandwich daily, at least upgrade your options. Pret’s Spring menu isn’t limited to the Raab special — there’s a new vegan chilli flat bread. Or you could try a hot sandwich from eat. The mozzarella, tomato and pesto toastie is particularly moreish. For a more gourmet experience, Hawksmoor’s sarnies feature sliced rib-eye steak and soft Graceburn cheese, in Seven Dials, Piccadilly and Knightsbridge. Or get a protein fix by sinking your teeth into Quo Vadis’ grilled sourdough under a tower of smoked eel and Dijon mustard. Wrap it up The wrap is a lunch staple. In Soho, Bun House’s new hatch serves jianbing wraps to go, deep-fried wonton skin and a sauce made with fermented beans, sesame paste, cilantro and peanut butter. Mildreds boasts stellar vegetarian options in Soho, including black beans and red rice wrapped with tomatillo jalapeno salsa, and more of the usual suspects. Jacket of all trades The jacket potato with topping is the fourth most popular lunch in the UK, and the Potato Project in Soho sells spuds with a twist. Toppings include smoked ham hock with cheddar and piccalilli and prawn and bourbon Marie Rose sauce. They’re also on Deliveroo. Bowled over The new mono-lunch on the block is the poké bowl. Honi Poké in Soho and Fenchurch Street offers a healthy option with a choice of raw fish and rice base. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here. Are you sure you want to submit this vote?

Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of the Presidency’s Department of the Public Service, Reginald Brotherson on Tuesday lashed back at the Guyana Trades Union Congress’ (GTUC) Women’s Advisory Committee (WAC) member, Karen Vansluytman-Corbin for publicly charging favouritism at that government entity. “You just don’t go up on a podium and malign people like that. You just don’t wake up and get in the public domain and make wild, wild accusations” Brotherson told Demerara Waves Online News. The Permanent Secretary said he was not worried about a probe, saying that he has so far given 36 years of public service and so he was taken aback by the allegations of Vansluytman-Corbin. “I’m at a loss. It’s laughable,” he said. He called on the WAC member to produce evidence of her charges of cronyism at the Department of the Public Service. “Whatever evidence she has on that, let her produce it,” Brotherson added. He strongly believed that the WAC member does not understand the difference between the Department of the Public Service and the Public Service Commission which is responsible for employing persons on the fixed pensionable establishment of the public service. Brotherson stressed that since he has been at the Department of Public Service, public service matters were being dealt with in a “more transparent manner”. Among the steps taken so far, he said, is the transferal of more than 4,000 contracted government employees to the regular public service which functions under the rules of the Public Service Commission. He said wherever necessary public servants are receiving acting allowances. Earlier Tuesday at a May Day Rally, she said the Department of Public Service “ought to be functioning in the benefit of all public servants. It is not happening.” She charged it is instead, “functioning for some public servants, the friends and cronies of a few and I’m saying it and I have the evidence to support it…I’m asking our national leaders to please look into that because it is happening…please look into that.” Her call for a probe into the Department of the Public Service was issued in the presence of Ministers of Government, Basil Williams SC., Keith Scott, Karen Cummings, Annette Ferguson and Simona Broomes among other union leaders and public servants.

Karen,Cummings,795,http://demerarawaves.com/2018/05/01/no-salary-increases-for-teachers-as-yet-recommendations-with-finance-minister-granger/,"Posted by: Gary Eleazar in Education, News May 1, 2018 0 President David Granger being escorted in the Guyana Teachers’ Union compound, Woolford Avenue, Georgetown. Teachers will now have to await word from the Ministry of Finance, on any increases in wages and salaries and other remuneration to be afforded public school teachers. This was confirmed on May Day-Tuesday, May 1- by Head of State, President David Granger, when he met with Guyana Teachers’ Union (GTU) President, Mark Lyte, General Secretary Coretta McDonald and other senior teachers on the first stop of his May Day visits to union headquarters across the City. GTU had proposed an initial 40 per cent across the board, increase for last year and 50 per cent increases annually up until 2020 for all categories of teachers. It is unclear what recommendations were submitted by the task force—currently with the Ministry of Finance. Arriving at the GTU’s Woolford Avenue, Headquarters at about 13:30hrs, President Granger was greeted by Lyte, McDonald, a bevy of government Ministers -Minister of State, Joseph Harmon; Junior Minister of Social Protection (responsible for Labour), Keith Scott; Minister of Social Protection, Amna Ally; Junior Minister of Public Health, Karen Cummings and Junior Minister of Public Infrastructure, Annette Ferguson- and hundreds of euphoric teachers. Minister of Education, Nicolette Henry was not seen among the group of ministers. The GTU President ahead of a short meeting with the President Granger and the GTU Leadership, said the excitement among teachers was a result of word of an announcement to be made by the President. President of the Guyana Teachers’ Union, Mark Lyte leads his contingent on the May Day march through the streets of Georgetown. “The teachers are very enthused about your presence here…last year we had a similar turn out but they were a little mixed with their emotions, I think this year they seem to have high expectations of something being announced shortly, I guess that is the reason for all this excitement this afternoon,” Lyte told President Granger to which he responded “My brother you know my heart is in the right place.” After hesitating somewhat, the President was asked pointedly by Demerara Waves, on the status of the negotiations regarding teachers’ wages and salaries. According to President Granger, “the recommendations are with the Ministry of Finance.” Pressed for further details of the recommendations by Demerara Waves, President Granger said, “right now they are at the Ministry of Finance” and deferred further questions on the matter to that Ministry. Granger said too he was unable to, at the time, provide a timeline on when any of the recommendations could or would be implemented. According to President Granger, the Ministry of Finance is examining the outcome of the Presidential Task-force. After the GTU walked out of pay talks with the Minister of Education on October 26, 2017 and announced that teachers were going to strike, one day later government had said that the pay offer of between half a percent and eight percent had been an interim offer and a task force had been established by President Granger. After several meetings, that task-force presented its final recommendations handed to the Minister of Education on April 6 last. The Guyana Trades Union Congress to which the GTU is affiliated is on record as saying that the presidential intervention in the pay dispute is not in keeping with the collective bargaining process between the union and the Ministry of Education between whom there is a Collective Labour Agreement for the avoidance and settlement of disputes.

John,O'Neil,794,https://girltalkhq.com/actress-jenny-paul-on-the-looming-tower-john-oneill-the-surge-of-woke-men-in-the-metoo-era/,"By Jenny Paul When I auditioned for ‘The Looming Tower’, I had no idea what kind of show it was or even that it was going to be about 9/11 (the show auditioned and shot under a psuedonymn). After I was hired to play CIA Agent/”Manson Sister” Maureen and fully realized what the show was going to be about, I dug in my heels and read as much information as I could get my hands on– including “The Looming Tower” (the Pulitzer Prize winning novel the series is based on) and the episode scripts as they trickled into my inbox. One of the first things that struck me about the television pilot was the representation of the lead character FBI Special Agent John O’Neill (played by Jeff Daniels). In the pilot, it is made clear that John’s character is very redeemable and perhaps the show’s protagonist in regard to his job– a good guy and fair boss– protecting the people in his department and, it is assumed, the people of the US as much as he is able. In the same breath, we learn that John is quite the philanderer and is involved in a very tangled web of committed relationships with multiple women. It is clear that each of these women thinks she is his only lover (possibly with the exception of his devout Catholic wife, mother of his twin daughters, who, based on her attitude toward him, may suspect his infidelity). Apparently, I am not the only one that noticed John O’Neill’s character duality, but as it turns out others had a much stronger opinion than I did. In the wake of the release of the series, much to my surprise, I have been consistently made aware of one overriding judgment about John O’Neill’s character– that he is being received as a “really bad guy.” But the most interesting thing about these opinions aren’t just that they exist or the strength of their conviction, but who the opinions are coming from: millennial men. A large number of my millennial male friends that have watched the show have mentioned to me that John O’Neill’s character is “a skeevy dick,” “ just, like, a gross stereotypical white male,” “a douchebag,” “he’s an asshole– that’s the point of his character, right?” all delivered to me with a clear sense of urgency, unease, and with a vague question mark underriding the comment. As if they were saying, “he is really bad, right?” After a few separate instances of these encounters– very intent and specific opinions delivered to me as a cast member from the show– all from men– and all entirely unprompted, I thought to myself, that’s funny, shouldn’t it be the women having that reaction? But we’re not– or we’re not to the same degree. The women in my circles hadn’t, to that point, said much of anything at all regarding that character. They liked the show and had lots of things to say about the action packed parts of the show, the elements of tragedy, the talented cast, and specifics about some of the show’s characters, but not specifically much of anything about John O’neill’s character. Curious after hearing a number of strong male opinions, I asked a millennial female friend what she thought about John O’Neil’s character. She said, “whatever, it’s fine.” And another “meh…well…” And another “what about him?” And another “he’s kind of skeezyish, but clearly he’s supposed to be the good guy in the show, so…” Fascinating. Are these women that desensitized to these issues? Am I? I hadn’t really given it a second thought until the men started saying something to me about it. But they were right. I immediately started backpedaling and thinking about why I hadn’t had a strong reaction. I finally came to a hard thought conclusion: I realized that I’m so accustomed to that kind of character on TV, that it didn’t occur to me to even bother developing a strong opinion about his moral character based on just his infidelities. Now that my attention had been called to it, I did indeed have a strong opinion. He’s a total jerk for doing that to those women. They all love and trust him, making it that much worse. The opinion is not really actionable, but it’s there. I’d be willing to bet that the other women, if prompted to dig deeper, would feel similarly. But the real story here, an even more fascinating one to me at least, was the guys’ response. Each of the guys seemed to be of the opinion that John’s behavior wasn’t acceptable, but each guy was independently convinced enough of the character’s wrongdoing that he was willing to ‘put it out there’ and look for agreement from another person (in this case, me). They felt the need to weigh in and have someone else corroborate their already existing feelings of disapproval. I wonder if the same set of guys would have thought something like that 10 years ago. 5 years ago. Or even a year ago. And if they did think it, would they have been compelled to say it out loud? I’ve been with my fiancee for almost 4 years now and we’re getting married in May. He and I have watched hundreds of shows together at this point, including a documentary about the wrestler Ric Flair. Ric doesn’t just talk about, but jokes about his dozens if not hundreds of infidelities. “When will women learn? You cannot tame Ric Flair. Woooo.” My fiance didn’t have anything to say out loud about how gross that was. Knowing him, he probably thought it. I certainly thought it and hated it. But he felt strongly enough about John O’Neill’s character to be one of the people to say something to me and with conviction. What changed from a few months ago to now? Maybe #MeToo, #TimesUp, and this current wave of women and human rights’ movements are actually working. Maybe our men are finally getting woke.

She is currently playing recurring character “Maureen” on Hulu’s ‘The Looming Tower’. My husband and I tried to watch this show and unfortunately, John O’Neill’s character is what made us stop watching this show! Not only was his character a jerk and seriously just gross, I felt the personal side of his character really brought down quality of the show to a level which made my husband and I disinterested in it, which is a shame. As a #millenialwomen, I think it’s also dangerous to lump all of us in as a group and estimate that because a handful of millenial women had no strong reaction, it was due to desensitization (sp?). Perhaps it was more of a mellow reaction because some of us are not going to give men like that their time or even the time of day, so didn’t pay much attention to his character as a result. I also watched the Ric Flair show and yes, was grossed out, but also disappointed in how much the producing team highlighted his sexual behavior as a point of pride, rather than show how gross and misogynistic the man was and is, because he clearly has not grown up or learned about his experiences. I think something which should be highlighted among our Girl Talk space, the #METOO movement, and media covering gender inequalities in general, is how boys and men are not raised to be #woke by any means, and it is actually not easy to raise an aware, gender-sensitive and culture-sensitive boy even in 2018. At the Girlboss rally in L.A. this past weekend, Sarah Sophie Flicker spoke to this topic well and speaks to it in many arenas of influence. I mean, take a look around us, girls and women are bombarded with how-to’s on how to act a certain way, how to lead as a women and you can “still win” (I’m in a course like this with Cornell right now, and frankly, it’s a little ridiculous!), and how to tackle these issues head-on, even in the face of gross inequities and a broken system designed to keep women and POC in their place. Can we talk about how to teach men, from a young age, how to not cave to the systems that surround them? I’d be happy to help find resources on this! This is incredibly valid, and I’d be interested in those resources as well! Very heartening to read millennial mens’ reaction to the Jeff Daniel’s character. We’ve become inured to reacting to bad behavior on screen when it mirrors what we experience in “real” life. Very interesting and thought provoking read. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

John,O'Neil,794,https://pcherald.com/node/244,"Invited guests gather for lunch and presentations from community leaders before the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Pickens County College and Career Center. BY GENA HUFF, Editor In prelude to the ribbon cutting of the much-awaited Pickens County College and Career Center in Carrollton, a Community Conversation Luncheon was held for over one hundred invited guests and dignitaries. After being welcomed by Tony Junkin of First National Bank and Carrollton Mayor Mickey Walker, Lyle Dease of the Pickens County Baptist Association gave the invocation and a lunch catered by “Blessings” was enjoyed by all. Speakers from all walks of life and backgrounds, but all with important community involvement, were lined up to give a brief overview and update of community happenings, as seen through their respective involvements and undertakings. Patti Fuller of the Pickens County Extension Office began the list of speakers by introducing Shawn McDaniel, Chairman of the Board at Pickens County Medical Center (PCMC). “We do something unique down in PCMC that is not done in any rural hospitals,” McDaniel began. “It used to be done a lot. Our doctors come back and visit our patients at the hospital. So now, if you are admitted to PCMC by your physician, you will have the opportunity to have your physician visit you. You may think, ‘What does that matter?’ But it means a lot. Because they know your medical history and you have a relationship with them.” McDaniel also mentioned the retirement of long-time and well-loved PCMC surgeon Dr. Jim Gentry. “We greatly appreciate Dr. Gentry. At this time, we are in the approval (process) of a surgeon and that’s a wonderful thing,” he said. Also mentioned was the hiring of the new President and CEO at PCMC, John O’Neil. “As I want to describe John, and I know he doesn’t like this,” said McDaniel, “he’s the Nick Saban of hospitals. He’s the guy we need for the job. He’s been doing a wonderful job and I want to encourage you to support our hospital, continue to work with us, and to be a part of that. And we will continue to serve and do the best job we possibly can,” he concluded. Next was Joseph Brown with Alabama Power Company, a vital member of the team for the revitalization of PCMC. Brown joked the one thing he would change about the new center was a bigger parking lot. “I had to park all the way down the block,” he laughed. Brown mentioned the grant recently received by PCMC to participate in the Delta Regional Community Health Systems Development Program. Only nine rural hospitals in the United States were chosen to receive this grant and PCMC was one of those nine. Brown recognized Gordo Mayor Craig Patterson as being key in the process of a letter-writing campaign which was vital to the medical center’s acceptance in the program.

Temps nearly steady in the mid 30s. Winds NW at 5 to 10 mph.. Cloudy skies. A few flurries or snow showers possible. Low 27F. Winds W at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 11:31 am A 47-year-old former Scott County man was convicted on four child-porn counts Friday, with the jury recommending an 80-year prison term. The jury deliberated about 2-1/2 hours before returning the guilty verdicts against Glen Andrew Davis, now of Louisville. The panel then recommended 20-year sentences on each count, to be served consecutively. The jury took 15 minutes to decide on the sentencing recommendation. Scott County Circuit Judge Paul Isaacs set formal sentencing for 10 a.m. July 17. The panel acquitted Davis of charges of sexual abuse involving a female relative under age 12, second-degree rape and incest with a female relative. The jury’s decision came at the end of two days of testimony, during which Davis testified in his own defense. The charges date from September 2013, when Davis was charged with 19 sex offenses. The offenses for which Davis was convicted occurred in 2010. The allegations regarding sexual abuse were claimed to have happened in December 2012 and January 2013. Georgetown Police Assistant Chief Robert Swanigan told the jury that as a GPD investigator in 2013, he performed an examination of the hard drive from a laptop computer in the Davis home. The examination recovered three full images and a thumbnail image of a nude prepubescent girl. Someone had tried to delete the images, but the computer had not yet overwritten them, Swanigan testified. Under questioning by Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Pat Molloy on Thursday, the female victim’s mother described how in early 2012, Davis told her he wanted a divorce. She took her daughter to her estranged husband’s apartment over a three-day period when the girl had been diagnosed with strep throat, she said. She needed him to watch her while she went to work, her mother testified. It was after that, and in early January 2013, that her daughter’s attitude became bad, followed by self-harming behavior, her mother said. It got so bad, she said, she had the girl committed for a period at The Ridge, a psychological treatment center in Lexington. At the end of January, she said, her daughter told her things about her father. Molloy cautioned her mother against repeating exactly what her daughter said. But her mother said it prompted her to immediately call police. Under questioning by defense attorney Bryce Caldwell, her mother spelled out the reason for the divorce: Davis told her he wanted to pursue relationships with other women. Caldwell and fellow defense attorney Brent Caldwell argued Davis was the victim of a scorned woman who was manipulating her daughter to ruin her estranged husband’s life. “The older child is aware the respondent is interested in pursuing relationships” with other women, Caldwell read from a document in the divorce file. (The divorce is still pending.) Several times, Caldwell emphasized the girl was angry with her father. He also suggested her mother was taking steps to win a portion of her estranged husband’s retirement account from his job at Toyota. She responded that she does not know how much is in that account, but she was trying to secure her children’s financial future. Dan Adkins can be reached at dadkins@news-graphic.com.

Andrew,Davis,793,http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc--nws-pa-escaped-prisoner-death-20180501-story.html,"A prosecutor says law enforcement officers weren't responsible for the death of a handcuffed prisoner who broke away from them and later was found dead in a Pennsylvania creek. Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman said Monday that 24-year-old Andrew Davis Good ""made his choices not to comply"" with orders to get in the officers' car, to stop fleeing and to come out of the water before losing his footing. Authorities say Ephrata officers were sent to a hospital parking lot April 14 to help a county sheriff's deputy struggling with Good, who was slightly injured in a warrant arrest. They say Good ran into Cocalico Creek handcuffed with a chain restraint belt and officers tried to rescue him but rescue crews found his body about 90 minutes later.

Michael,Gordon,791,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article210160539.html,"By Michael Gordon mgordon@charlotteobserver.com May 01, 2018 04:14 PM The criminal reach of what prosecutors describe as a notorious East Coast gang will be on display this week in a Charlotte federal courtroom. Starting Wednesday, according to court documents, two of the highest-ranking leaders of United Blood Nation will go on trial, accused of running an organized-crime network with extensive ties to the Carolinas — from their prison cells in New York state. The defendants include Pedro Gutierrez, who prosecutors say is the ""godfather"" or ""chairman"" of the 15,000-member gang. The New Yorker, who goes by the UBN nicknames of ""Magoo,"" ""Inferno"" and ""Light,"" has been held in an undisclosed North Carolina location for the past year. Sitting beside him in the coming weeks will be James Baxton, described in court documents as one of Gutierrez' top lieutenants. He's known in gang circles as ""Frank White"" or ""Grown."" For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The pair will be joined at the defense table by a North Carolinian. Prosecutors say Cynthia “Lady Bynt” Gilmore of Raleigh made regular trips to the New York prisons to discuss business with the UBN bosses, delivering directives for an array of crimes. All three are cited frequently in a 133-page federal indictment in 2017 that led to the arrests of 83 reputed UBN members across Charlotte, the Carolinas and states stretching from Florida to New York. The federal complaint, which covers alleged criminal activity stretching back a decade, says the gang was responsible for at least six killings, a sprawling narcotics and illegal weapons trade, along with bank fraud and other white-collar crimes — all in violation of the federal organized-crime statute known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO. That the indictment says several of the gang's top leaders remain in maximum-security prisons but still signed off on most major gang operations illustrates the difficulty authorities have had suppressing the ring. UBN is now the largest gang in North Carolina. According to a government filing in the Gutierrez case, federal prosecutors plan to call a N.C. Department of Correction officer to testify about UBN's footprint in the state's prisons and the influence the gang has over inmates and guards. The 2017 indictment details a flow of UBN contraband streaming into Pasquotank Correctional Institution in Elizabeth City. The indictment says Gutierrez and Baxton met regularly with North Carolina visitors at Wende Correctional Facility in New York state, where Gutierrez was serving a sentence for second-degree murder. Gang members also funneled an unspecified amount of monetary dues to Gutierrez, Baxton and fellow top lieutenant Omari ""Uno B"" Rosero, who were all imprisoned at the time. Rosero has pleaded guilty to a criminal conspiracy charge connected to the case. If convicted of racketeering conspiracy, Gutierrez, Baxton and Gilmore face prison sentences of 20 years to life and $250,000 fines. Gutierrez' attorney, Brett Wentz of Wilmington, declined comment Tuesday. Baxton's attorney, Matt Joseph of Charlotte, did not immediately respond to an Observer email Tuesday. However, Gilmore's attorney, Aaron Michel of Charlotte, said his client is the mother of five children who has worked as a registered nurse's aide since 2007. Alluding to Gilmore's racketeering charge, Michel said, ""The racket is the government using our poor to promote their interests in the military, industrial, Wall Street complex."" He said the case against Gilmore is ""like prosecuting an NFL ticket holder for the pattern of racketeering activity (murder, robbery, fraud) by players and owners."" Security at the federal courthouse surrounding the trial is expected to be tight. Government attorneys have also filed motions to limit testimony on the identity and location of potential witnesses and the steps taken to protect their safety. The case will be heard by presiding U.S. District Judge Frank Whitney of Charlotte, a frequent jurist in gang-related cases stretching back for a decade. Three years ago, Whitney recused himself from a UBN murder case after his name appeared on a potential threat against three court officials. It was discovered in the Mecklenburg jail cell of one of the gang's Charlotte leaders. According to the New York Daily News, Gutierrez’ criminal career started early. By 17, he was already a member of Trigger Finger Posse when he was arrested for armed robbery. Gutierrez was arrested five more times, including once on a murder charge when he shot four people and one of them died. He was convicted of second-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to 26 years to life. While awaiting an assault trial in Rikers Island, Gutierrez was caught seven times with weapons and stabbed or slashed four other inmates. According to the Daily News, he received what was then a record 1,040 punishment days in the jail’s segregation unit. Prosecutors don’t say when or why Gutierrez joined UBN, which was started by several African American inmates in Rikers Island to protect themselves from a Latino gang that was dominating the jail, the indictment says. Soon, UBN moved south, establishing operations state by state through penitentiaries and via its drug and weapons trades. Charlotte and North Carolina are painfully familiar with the gang’s ability to operate from behind bars. ▪ A 2012 UBN indictment in Charlotte revealed that both the gang’s top North Carolina leader and a member of its national council in New York continued to direct the gang’s day-to-day operations while in prison. “It’s troubling for this court that incarceration did not stop you,” federal judge Whitney told Daryl “OG Powerful” Wilkinson, who was serving a murder sentence in New York when a Charlotte grand jury indicted him for racketeering, according to a transcript from Wilkinson’s 2014 trial. ▪ In 2014, an imprisoned UBN leader using a contraband cellphone sent more than 100 texts to direct the kidnapping of the father of the Raleigh prosecutor who put him in prison. ▪ That same year, Jamell “Murda Mel” Cureton of Charlotte, then an inmate of the Mecklenburg jail, ordered and helped plan the UBN murders of Doug and Debbie London of Lake Wylie, South Carolina, to keep them from testifying against Cureton and two other gang members who tried to rob the couple’s mattress company. Cureton and confessed hit man Malcolm Hartley pleaded guilty to murder charges to avoid a possible death penalty. They are serving life sentences. Local crackdowns against the gang have been going on for years. In 2009, more than a dozen reputed UBN members were charged with running drugs and weapons in the Beatties Ford Road corridor of west Charlotte. In 2013-14, more than two dozen gang members were sent away for sentences of up to 30 years. In 2015, 12 reputed gang members were arrested in connection with the Londons’ deaths. Most have either pleaded guilty or been convicted, and have begun serving prison terms.

Michael,Gordon,791,http://www.watoday.com.au/rugby-league/canberra-raiders/lui-uses-contract-as-motivation-ahead-of-raiders-return-20180501-p4zcpn.html,"It helped motivate Dunamis Lui through the tough times - getting back on the field and earning himself another NRL contract. He hopes that's with the Canberra Raiders. Lui's been one of the Green Machine's best forwards so far this season in his return from a knee reconstruction. Raiders prop Dunamis Lui used being off-contract as motivation during his rehab. Going into their round nine clash against the Gold Coast Titans at Canberra Stadium on Saturday, the 28-year-old was the Raiders' fourth-ranked forward for run metres behind Josh Papalii, Shannon Boyd and Junior Paulo. He's yet to make an error and has given away just three penalties. Lui wrecked his knee in round 13 against Manly at Brookvale Oval to end his 2017 season and he came back this year off-contract. He came to Canberra to resurrect his NRL career after stints with Brisbane, the Sea Eagles and St George Illawarra. Lui used earning another contract as motivation during the tough times. ""That's one of the things that was in my mind last year going through rehab - just coming out this year and really trying to put together a good season and try and work out a contract,"" he said on Tuesday. ""But right now I just want to play footy and not really think about that. I spoke to my manager, I said, 'I trust them [the Raiders], you can sort all that out, I'm just going to focus on footy and play'."" He played just seven games last season and is five games short of bringing up his 100th NRL game in his second year with the Green Machine. Lui hoped to extend his time in lime green. ""I love it here, my family's enjoying it here as well so I'd love to stay,"" he said. Manly launched an investigation into the spate of knee injuries that has hit the beleaguered NRL club this week, with three of their players - including former Raider Lachlan Croker - tearing their anterior cruciate ligament at Brookvale Oval this season. Lui suffered the same fate there last year, but he was unsure whether the ground played any role. He spent two seasons with the Sea Eagles, playing 38 NRL games for his former club. ""It's just unfortunate. I know that ground is a bit heavy, but I can't really say much,"" Lui said. NRL ROUND NINE Saturday: Canberra Raiders v Gold Coast Titans at Canberra Stadium, 3pm.

Steve,Cummings,787,http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/keep-calm-and-carry-on-dimension-datas-sorry-season-so-far,"Aldag on squaring low budget and African focus with basic need for WorldTour points The five Cervelo bikes leaning against the Dimension Data team bus at the Tour de Romandie are a sorry sight. On board, Rolf Aldag is doing his best to rally the troops, explaining to them that if they do the basics right then the race can be deemed a success. The message to the riders is simple; stick together, look after each other, and the results will follow. Given the circumstances, it's the best Aldag can hope for, although after almost four months of this it must feel like he and the rest of the team are going through the motions.Related ArticlesMeintjes: Coming back to Dimension Data has always been part of the planCavendish suffers brutal crash in Milan-San RemoO'Connor gives Dimension Data something to celebrate at the Tour of the AlpsCummings keeping calm in the eye of the stormDoug Ryder determined to strengthen Dimension Data and keep Mark CavendishDimension Data all behind Mark Cavendish at Tour de France Team leader Steve Cummings has left due to illness and Nicolas Dougall missed the time cut in the uphill time trial on stage 3. The Tour de Romandie has encapsulated Dimension Data's season, with bad luck, ruled-out leaders, and the shortcomings of a young squad unable to step up leading them to just two wins this year. However, as Aldag explains, all is not lost. The African team has a long-term vision that will set them up for 2020, with new talent central to their future. Their current leader and talisman, Mark Cavendish, will be back in action soon, and the Giro d'Italia is around the corner, providing a fresh start. Being close to the bottom of the WorldTour rankings in April will quickly be forgotten if the team can get their riders back in action. As Aldag steps off the bus, having given his pep talk to the riders ahead of stage 4, he admits that the current situation has taken its toll. Injuries, crashes and illness has ripped through the Dimension Data team this year with all of their team leaders either on the sidelines or on the comeback trail. In a career spanning four decades, Aldag hasn't seen anything like it. ""I've not been involved in a run of injuries like this before - not in all my time in cycling. I remember the Giant-Alpecin car incident a few years ago when they were hit by a car in training, but nothing like this in terms of so many riders, with so many injuries,"" Aldag tells Cyclingnews. ""Cavendish is coming back but Eisel had a fall, was ill and had surgery. Dougall injured his hand, [Julien] Vermote his shoulder, [Scott] Thwaites his back, [Mekseb] Debesay his hip, Cummings is sick, Edvald [Boasson Hagen] has his surgery and Reinardt Janse van Rensburg hasn't raced since the Worlds."" Mark Cavendish exits the Abu Dhabi Tour after a crash on the opening day One would be forgiven for throwing in the towel but Dimension Data, and Aldag in particular, would never consider raising the white flag. So, instead of just going through the motions he has instructed the riders to get the maximum out of each race. If they can't win, then the next best option is to learn. For a team stacked with so many young riders from around the world, there can be no more important a task. Aldag doesn't use the term but what he's referring to could be described as building blocks. Bring in young talent and harness their abilities, but also ensure that they have the basic skill-set needed for racing in Europe. The results may not be visible now but in the future the hard work will pay off. ""The situation with injuries makes our life more difficult, and it leaves us doing some learning exercises for the young kids. We can't expect them to step up and give the same results as team leaders,"" Aldag says. ""It's clear that we don't have the same depth that a team like Sky has, where riders might think that if a leader is out then they have a chance. That's not what we have - we know that, and it would be unfair to expect otherwise. ""What we do expect is that they get the basics right, so the things you don't concentrate on if you're only focused on results and when things are going well. Here in Romandie it's as simple as riding as a team and staying together. Then, when the big guns are back, all that hard work pays off because the younger riders have improved. At the moment, though, a broken collarbone would almost be acceptable, given the tough injuries our guys have had."" Yet, part of the team's predicament does come down to recruitment. Team boss Doug Ryder has an almost-impossible task: balancing the desire to bring through African talent with the need for instant success. The former is admirable, and a wonderful endeavour within professional cycling, but the reality is that WorldTour points are not handed out on moral grounds. No; WorldTour points are a hard-earned commodity based on nothing but results. In some cases they are bought by the highest bidding team, not bothered by age or youth development, but by the here and now. No other team looks to Africa for talent in the same way Dimension Data do, and while Ryder has been criticized for letting some talented African riders slip through the team, they are still home to some 13 riders from the continent. South African Louis Meintjes spearheads the team's Grand Tour ambitions Over the winter the team re-signed Louis Meintjes for a reported 1.3 million Euros a season. That's a reasonable sum for a rider who has collected a number of top-10 results in Grand Tours, and is still under the age of 27. The South African, however, is not a prolific winner, and while the team are building around him in the hope of a Tour de France challenge in 2020, they have lost ground in other areas. Nathan Haas was replaced by Tom-Jelte Slagter, while Omar Fraile was never truly covered after he jumped to Astana. It's the middle of the team that has weakened as a result. ""I think that's fair but our team was created so that young African talent could be developed,"" Aldag says. ""Could we get more from our budget if we didn't care as much for African cycling? It's very likely, but that's never been our ambition. It's about creating value, and it's not just about winning. You need to win, you need to be competitive, because if Cavendish wins a stage in the Tour then you see peaks for Qhubeka and that's what we're committed to. ""Is the middle a little bit lost in the team? Yes, I think that's obvious. If our leaders are out with injury or sickness, then it is hard for us to keep winning, but they will come back. Once they're back we'll be back on track. We just can't lose our routine."" For Aldag and Ryder, it's about vision. Dimension Data cannot compete with the likes of Team Sky or some of the other superpower teams in the market, so their long-term strategy is focused on signing up young talent and developing those riders. It's a slightly different approach to the one that saw them hire Cavendish - along with his lead-out - and Cummings at the start of the 2016 and 2015 seasons, respectively, but it requires patience. At the team service course, Aldag says that the term 'Project 2020' is often used. ""Doug created the team as an African team and he took them through the ranks, all the way to WorldTour. Now there's this African rider in Louis who we can really trust to do something. So, the question is about how you set things up around him. We need to give him the maximum support and let him grow into that role as a leader. You can support a rider like that in different ways. If you have a huge sponsor then you fire off pay-checks. That's really easy. That's what Lance Armstrong did at Postal, with [Roberto] Heras and [Floyd] Landis for example. Then we've seen Sky with their [Mikel] Landa situation, where the only guys who could attack Chris Froome were on his team. So, either you do that - but you need a 40 million Euro budget - or you look for experienced guys who can be road captains and sign them alongside young riders who can develop alongside Louis. ""So, if you take Scott Davis. In 2020 will he be able to step up for a potential TTT? Absolutely. And will he be able to get over the big climbs? Absolutely. Another example is Ben O'Connor. He's going to be key for us but we need to sign him early because if we had waited until 2020 then it would be a completely different pay-check. We have to go our own way, develop our own riders and talent. They might not be big names or competitive now but they will be in two years from now. We can't afford to just buy in structures."" Doug Ryder has one of the most challenging jobs of any WorldTour team manager At the end of the season Ryder and Aldag will be faced with a number of important decisions. Cavendish and his lead-out entourage are out of contract, and while there are close ties between the rider and the management, and both parties believe in the team's clear ethos, a contract still needs to be provided and signed. Boasson Hagen and Cummings are also up for renewal, so the next few months, with the Giro and the Tour, will be vital. To make matters more complex, there's also the UCI stalling over the WorldTour points structure of 2020, which leaves all teams - not just Dimension Data - with a level of uncertainty. ""We had a brilliant year with Cavendish in 2016. We had a rough 2017 and a rough start to 2018, but overall, he's been good with the team and he feels good in the team,"" says Aldag. ""We have lots of contracts ending and there's a lot of money bound up in that sprint group. It's up to Doug to have the decision on what to do in terms of strategy. The big next landmark is the Giro with Louis and then to get Mark back on track for California. It's the Giro and Tour that we will be measured against."" Although Dimension Data are in the midst of a difficult period, they do have the riders to turn it around. As Aldag says, the message to the riders is simple: stick together, look after each other, and the results will follow.

Good drowned after walking into Cocalico Creek. Andrew Good District Attorney Craig Stedman at a Monday press conference reviews footage that shows fugitive Andrew Davis Good fleeing from a deputy in Ephrata. Good drowned after walking into Cocalico Creek. Andrew Good Authorities committed no crimes leading to the death of a 24-year-old prisoner who fled police custody and drowned in the Cocalico Creek, the Lancaster County district attorney said at a press conference Monday. Andrew Davis Good was wearing shackles and a chain-restraint belt when he escaped from a deputy sheriff outside WellSpan Ephrata Community Hospital and ran into the creek on April 14, police said. He was taken into custody earlier that day on an outstanding bench warrant, according to previous reports. He was taken to the hospital because of a possible injury sustained when he was arrested, police said. The county coroner ruled Good’s death accidental, caused by freshwater drowning. District Attorney Craig Stedman reviewed the incident to determine if a crime was committed that resulted in Good’s death. All deaths that occur while a person is in the custody of a law-enforcement agency must be reviewed, he said Monday. To make his ruling, Stedman said he reviewed video footage, reports and information provided by Lancaster County detectives and Ephrata police. “Did law enforcement do something that resulted in his death?” Stedman asked. “We have found no evidence of that.” Good, Stedman said, “made his choices not to comply” with orders to get in the car, to stop fleeing and to come out of the water before losing his footing. “This wasn’t a difficult conclusion to come to,” he said. “This didn’t have to happen.” Stedman said he makes no determination on the appropriateness of officers’ actions during the incident. However, Good was being escorted by a single deputy when he escaped. Stedman said his office's policy is to use two county detectives during a prisoner transport. He referred questions on the handling of Good’s transport to county Sheriff Christopher R. Leppler. The sheriff is an elected official, Stedman said, and answers to voters, not the district attorney’s office. In a statement released later Monday, Leppler said the sheriff's office started an internal investigation after the drowning and expects it to be finished soon. The deputy has been on administrative leave during the investigation, which is standard procedure, Leppler said. Stedman said he and county detectives met with Good’s family on Friday to review the findings. The conversation was “difficult,” he said, but “they were very cordial with us. ... I think they understand where we’re at.” Court records show Good has fled from police on previous occasions. On April 14, he was taken into custody by police in Akron. He attempted to flee but was tased and apprehended, Stedman said. He later complained of pain and asked to be taken to a hospital. The man who escaped police custody Saturday night and drowned after running into a creek in Ephrata Borough showed a pattern of trying to elud… Success!

Stedman shared footage that shows Good leaving the hospital with the deputy, refusing to enter her vehicle and ultimately fleeing. Good ran across the parking lot, down a steep embankment and across a roadway where he was able to hide in the woods. At some point in the pursuit, one of the shackles comes loose on Good’s leg. Stedman said officials have not been able to determine if it was improperly locked or if it malfunctioned as he ran. While fleeing, Stedman said, Good shrugged off the effects of two Taser hits by the deputy. Several Ephrata police and hospital security officers aided in the search, which started at around 7:45 p.m. Officers located Good about 15 minutes later at the creek, where the fugitive — still handcuffed — backed into the chilly water. “As he backed further and further into the creek, the water became too deep for him to stand,” according to Stedman’s report. “Officers reported Mr. Good struggling to stay afloat in the water and calling for help. ... Good’s hands were still cuffed and secured to his belt, so he would not have been able to use his arms to tread water.” The creek was more than 8 feet deep and about 66 feet wide in the area where Good drowned, Stedman noted. The water was 55 degrees at the surface, he said. Three officers entered the water but lost sight of him in the dark, Stedman said. He was found dead more than an hour later. A toxicology report on Good is still pending.

Andrew,Davis,784,https://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Worcester-Regional-Airport-Plans-for-Future-481298991.html,"Worcester Regional Airport Plans for Future Link to this video Embed this video Replay More videos (1 of 9) Worcester's airport is small, but it has big hopes for the future. But will flights to New York and Philadelphia be enough? Excitement is building at Worcester Regional Airport as JetBlue’s direct flights to JFK start Thursday, followed by American Airlines flights to Philadelphia in the fall. Julio Baez-Velez of Worcester said, “Now I don’t have to go all the way into Boston.” Miguel Pabon of Worcester added, “It’s easier, less traffic, it’s right up the street.” As a high altitude/low visibility airport, Worcester had been limited in the past with two flights daily to Orlando and Ft. Lauderdale, that were sometimes diverted due to fog. But more than $100 million dollars in investments from MassPort since it took over the airport from the city in 2010 – including the addition of a Category III landing system – is a potential game-changer. Worcester Regional Airport Director Andrew Davis said, “We’re investing in the airport for the long-term, and just the activity we’ve seen in just the last year is showing the dividends, we’re starting to see that increase of service.” Even though the airport is still losing millions of dollars, experts think the future is bright for Worcester Regional Airport. Worcester State Economics Professor Bill O’Brien said, “I think it’s a gamble that will pay off, whether it pays off next year, two years, three years down the road, I think it will and that means more flights.” Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Tim Murray says he believes as other airlines see the success they will want to compete in the Worcester market, too. “With the success that JetBlue has had, we’ve seen commercial aviation in terms of corporate jets and things we’ve seen that grow, we’ve seen Jet Blue now expand flights,” said Murray, “I think it’s going to be a good year and hopefully there’ll be some new announcements in store.” And that first flight to JFK will take off at 6 a.m. Thursday with a small ceremony at the airport to celebrate.

Phillip,Frost,780,https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/teva-shareholders-to-vote-newer-leaner-board-june,"These 20 women are 2018's Fiercest in the life sciences industry. Read 2018's Fiercest Women in Life Sciences report! Looks like another scale-down is coming to Teva’s board. The Israeli drugmaker’s slate of directors, which has changed extensively in recent years at activist investor urging, will shrink by two spots after the company’s annual meeting in June, according to a regulatory filing. Galia Maor, Gabrielle Sulzberger and Dan Suesskind have decided not to stand for reelection, the generics giant said. Tel Aviv University professor Ronit Satchi-Fainaro, who leads the university’s Cancer Research and Nanomedicine Laboratory, is Teva’s only new nominee, which means the board will contract to 11 members from its current 13. “We sincerely thank them for their contribution, leadership and critical efforts on behalf of Teva throughout their respective terms of service. The Board will miss their insight and perspective in its deliberations and hope they will remain close to Teva for years to come,” a spokeswoman said of Maor, Sulzberger and Suesskind in an emailed statement. Teva’s board has all but turned over within the last few years. Other than Maor, who is on her way out, there’s only one director left in the boardroom who was around before activist investor Benny Landa rallied in 2014 for a smaller board with more experience in global pharma. That’s Amir Elstein, who at one time looked primed to succeed departed chairman Phillip Frost—that is, before Landa decried the potential pick. RELATED: Teva rebel investor Landa's gearing up for a proxy fight—and he can win, he says After Elstein, Teva’s longest-tenured director is Jean-Michel Halfon, a Pfizer veteran Frost brought in circa 2014 in response to Landa’s campaign. “We continue to evaluate the size and composition of our board of directors to ensure it maintains dynamic, exceptionally qualified members and that the mix of talent and experience on the board reflects all the challenges that the company faces,” Teva told Reuters in a statement. RELATED: Teva overhauling boardroom as top-level revamp continues Last year also saw a slew of board arrivals and departures as part of an exodus of Teva’s old guard. Under the watch of Celgene veteran and chairman Sol Barer, Teva added former Regeneron CFO Murray Goldberg; former GlaxoSmithKline R&D official Perry Nisen; Roberto Mignone, a managing partner at healthcare-specializing hedge fund Bridger Management; and Chemi Peres, a managing partner of Pitango Venture Capital, which has invested in healthcare. The newbie on the roster? Kåre Schultz, the company’s CEO, who joined the company last fall and has since ensured that Teva’s board isn’t the only part of the company seeing major change. To pare down a crushing debt-load, he initiated 14,000 layoffs last year, a move that sparked labor protests around Teva’s home country but earned praise from analysts. © 2018 Questex LLC.

Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 11:36 am Partners in Chesterfield County-based Virginia Asset are Chris Williams (from left), Mike White, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Tripp Leonard. The financial planning and services firm helps businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. Partners in Chesterfield County-based Virginia Asset are Chris Williams (from left), Mike White, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Tripp Leonard. The financial planning and services firm helps businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. The top executive at the Children’s Museum of Richmond needed guidance regarding benefit options. Shannon Venable approached financial services firm Virginia Asset Management for assistance. “They were really good at understanding what we were trying to do,” said Venable, the museum’s president and CEO. “They came in person to meet with our leadership team, and that was invaluable. They were very knowledgeable.” Virginia Asset Management has a variety of offerings, including individual financial planning for business owners, investments, retirement plans and employee benefits design and planning as well as insurance products. The company also helps business owners value their businesses and develop succession plans. The Chesterfield County-based financial planning and services firm works with businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. “Our sweet spot is one to 500 employees,” said Mike White, the firm’s president and CEO. “We do all the planning businesses need. We include their legal and tax advisers in the process.” The company’s customers are spread out across the country, but the majority are in the Mid-Atlantic. Affiliated Dermatologists of Virginia is one of the firm’s clients. “We did things in baby steps,” said Anne Wolff, Affiliated Dermatologists’ administrator, who called Virginia Asset Management when she was looking for financial advice for the medical practice. “We had a year to see if Virginia Asset Management was going to follow through with what they said. They were consistent and did follow through. They gave us some great advice,” Wolff said. Virginia Asset is widening its services and territory through mergers with similar financial businesses. The company, for instance, has merged with five small financial firms over the years, which includes its latest merger in February with Henrico County-based Chancery Advisory Concepts. “We have been talking to Chancery for about a year. They took a hard look at whether our firm had the expertise they were looking for to add additional services to their clients,” said White, who owns Virginia Asset with Tripp Leonard, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Chris Williams. White founded the company in 1986 with two partners, Buddy Whitlow, who is still at the firm, and the late Betsy Woolfolk. “We did mostly insurance products back then,” White said. “Now, we are a robust fee financing firm that specializes in working with closely held business owners. We have extensive expertise in working with 401(k) plans for business owners.” Virginia Asset continues to expand its services and expertise. “The future for us is to focus on being the premium planning firm for business owners,” White said. The company also puts on workshops in colleges and universities for business owners through its Business U program. It has conducted workshops at Virginia Commonwealth University, North Carolina State University, James Madison University and John Tyler Community College, to name a few. “We do the same thing for CPA and law firms and their clients and community banks and their customers,” White said. “We educate businesses on all the things they need to be thinking about in building, running and selling a business.” In addition to its offices in Chesterfield, Virginia Asset Management has offices elsewhere in Virginia — in Norfolk, Fairfax and South Hill. It also has offices in Raleigh and Pinehurst, N.C.; and in Pittsburgh; Philadelphia; and Minneapolis. The company’s revenue grew 10.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2017. Bobby Fulcher, owner of Aeration Plus in Powhatan, has been working with Virginia Asset for about seven years. “They are very easy to work with. They have everything under one roof. You don’t have to go to other companies to get what you need,” he said. “It’s the best company we have ever worked with in their industry.” Lynn Gabay, practice administrator for Advanced Wellness Centre in Richmond, finds Virginia Asset Management provides quick answers to all her questions. “When I email them a question, I have an answer usually in less than an hour,” she said. “Insurance is tricky. I appreciate their guidance and expertise. They have guided us through lots of insurance and benefits situations. They tirelessly search each year to get the best level of insurance for us.” What is it?: Financial planning and services to individuals and business owners Headquarters: 130 Wylderose Drive in Chesterfield County Employees: 110, including owners Owners: Mike White, Tripp Leonard, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth, Chris Williams Contact: (804) 330-0711 or www.vamllc.com Your comment has been submitted.

Picture: Kaupo Kikkas AFTER making a thrilling BBC Proms debut last year sax sensation Jess Gillam has been invited back for the 2018 season. Jess will be the youngest ever female soloist in the prestigious Last Night of the Proms at London's Royal Albert Hall, on September 8, plus she will also perform in the BBC Young Musician Prom on July 15 to celebrate 40 years of the high profile young musicians competition. Jess says she was extremely honoured to have been asked to perform at such a prestigious event and can't wait for the concert: ""I felt there was such an incredible atmosphere at the Proms last year - the audience were so attentive, the atmosphere was electric so I can’t begin to imagine how the Last Night will feel."" ""I found out about being asked to perform at the Last Night a few months ago and it has been very difficult to keep it quiet. I’ll also be performing at the BBC Young Musician Prom to celebrate 40 years of the competition and I’m really looking forward to being a part of that as the competition has been such a brilliant platform for me."" On the Last Night, Jess will perform Scaramouche by Darius Milhaud with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under the baton on Sir Andrew Davis. ""It consists of three quite contrasting movements,"" explains Jess. ""The first being lively and bright, the second very beautiful and gentle while the third is fantastically energetic and very reminiscent of a carnival. I first began playing saxophone at the age of seven 7 in the Barracudas carnival band and it will be fantastic to perform music of a similar spirit at a concert like this. The piece was written to be performed at the Théâtre Scaramouche, which is where the name originates from. Theatre Scaramouche specialised in plays and productions specifically for children. The piece is an absolute joy to play and I am very excited to perform it."" Another exciting development for the popular Ulverston saxophonist is a nomination for the Classic Brit Awards' new Sound Of Classical Poll, which champions emerging new artists and ones-to-watch in classical music. Aged 30 or under and tipped for a great future, the winner will be chosen by an expert panel and revealed at the glittering Royal Albert Hall awards ceremony on June 13, broadcast on ITV. Entries are open for the poll until May 20. For further information visit classicbrits.co.uk. Meanwhile, wearing her concert promoter's hat, Jess brings Snake Davis and his fabulous eight piece soul band the Suspicions back to Ulverston's Coronation Hall for another night of Northern Soul, Atlanta and Motown classics on Friday, June 1 (7.30pm).

Michael,Gordon,776,http://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-newspapers/central-north-island/sport/sport-region-6459/103464178/Josh-Dugan-injury-sours-Cronulla-Sharks-dramatic-late-win-over-Gold-Coast-Titans,"Cronulla Sharks enforcer Andrew Fifita charges the ball up against the Gold Coast Titans on Saturday night. A last-minute injury to NSW State of Origin star Josh Dugan has soured Cronulla's dramatic 10-9 NRL win over Gold Coast. Halfback Chad Townsend stepped up to sink a 79th-minute field goal to seal a rare win over bogey side the Titans in a scrappy Saturday evening clash at a wet Cbus Super Stadium. But the Sharks will be sweating on Dugan. He went down with a suspected leg injury moments before Townsend potted his second field goal to ice back-to-back wins for Cronulla. Cronulla are already reeling from a star-studded injury list.

The match looked set for golden point when Titans halfback Ash Taylor kicked a 77th-minute field to level the scores at 9-9. But Townsend capped a fine match with his second one-pointer to ensure Cronulla (4-4 record) stayed in touch with the top eight with a three-tries-to-one win. It was the third-consecutive loss for Gold Coast (3-5), while Cronulla recorded just their third victory in eight games against the Titans. Gold Coast threatened to maintain their hoodoo when hooker Mitch Rein burrowed over from dummy-half in the 44th minute to cut Cronulla's lead to 9-8. Cronulla grabbed a 9-2 halftime buffer after winger Valentine Holmes continued his stunning try-scoring run. After Titans No 1 Michael Gordon spilled a Townsend bomb, Holmes scored in the 12th minute â his fifth try in four games this year and seventh in as many matches against Gold Coast. Townsend and Dugan combined to put Edrick Lee over in the 33rd minute before Townsend booted his first field goal right on halftime. Gold Coast back-rower Will Matthews failed a concussion test and did not play in the second half, while Cronulla's Scott Sorensen suffered a late head knock. - AAP Property market: Soft landing, not burst bubble National sevens teams vie with All Blacks to be rugby team of the year Coroner calls for increase of alcohol purchasing age following death of drink-driving teen Video captures moment US family fled their home when huge Alaskan quake struck Inland Revenue loses track of thousands of Kiwi student loan debtors in Australia What it will take to die: setting a straight path down the 'slippery slope' Firefighters battling blaze at prominent Timaru building Man dead following incident in private spa in Rotorua Derelict house fire believed to be deliberately lit Cargo plane checked over following 'call of concern' at Auckland Airport Auckland Council's move to toughen sediment controls 'game-changing', Okura group says Mail, including contracts and cheques, blows out of post box Kiwi pensioner sets off to Hollywood for next stage of career A $50 million summer for Wellington with high-profile event line up An irremediable life: The rare plight of a woman who wants to be allowed to die PETA slams Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas for using animals in their wedding Brother of Australian cricket star arrested, refused bail over 'terror hit list' Nelson cafe owner vows to stand by his child ban until Kiwi kids are 'educated' Video captures moment US family fled their home when huge Alaskan quake struck Firefighters battling blaze at prominent Timaru building 'Hell of a bang': Lightning strike kills cows on Waikato farm Charity group: Don't donate white pants Karel Sroubek's estranged wife is 'afraid for her life' Corbel Construction fails after apartment owners win claim Why do some aircraft fly empty?

Michael,Gordon,776,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2018/04/29/roberto-firmino-agrees-new-five-year-deal-keep-liverpool-20231/,"Follow your club now for first access to all our news, views and analysis Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino has given Jurgen Klopp the perfect start to one of the biggest weeks of his reign by agreeing a five-year deal at the club. Firmino will sign a contract worth about £9 million a year prior to his club’s Champions League second leg tie in Rome, making him Liverpool’s highest-paid player. Most importantly, he has committed his peak years to Anfield following prolonged negotiations with club owner Fenway Sports Group. The deal, paying £180,000 a week, retains Firmino until the summer of 2023. “It was an easy decision,” said the Brazilian. “The club have taken me in in an incredible way and I’ve grown a lot here with my work with the support of the whole team. I am very happy here. Everything fits in the best possible way. “My team-mates are fantastic and I am grateful to be able to play with them at this club. I love to play for Liverpool FC. The fans are excellent and fantastic in how they support us all the way.” ❌👀🤝 Roberto Firmino agrees terms on new long-term #LFC deal: https://t.co/rvxJ30Ochp pic.twitter.com/sUsuABAkrx Firmino was a priority signature with Michael Edwards, the sporting director, and Michael Gordon, FSG president, stepping up the frequency of talks with the player’s representatives in recent months and weeks. Following the sale of Philippe Coutinho in January, Liverpool were determined to ensure their other prized assets were protected, thus avoiding the break-up of one of the most exciting squads in Europe. It is likely other star players will be similarly rewarded before the start of next season. The timing of Firmino’s extension could not be better as Liverpool prepare to head to face AS Roma on Wednesday. He has been crucial to Liverpool’s European success with 10 goals in the run which has taken them so close to the final. The 26 year-old moved to Liverpool from Hoffenheim for £29m in the summer of 2015, when Brendan Rodgers was still manager. Initially, he struggled in a deeper midfield role but, since Klopp’s appointment, Firmino has been transformed into one of the most complete strikers in world football, his combined performance with work rate, assists, tackles and goals making him fundamental to the team’s success. Liverpool know other European clubs have been looking with envy at Firmino, but Klopp was always confident the player would recognise the role the club has played in elevating his status. As part of an attacking ensemble with Salah and Mane, Liverpool believed Firmino would recognise his future was best served remaining on Merseyside. Firmino has 27 goals in all competitions this season and, but for Salah’s extraordinary run, he would have been earning more accolades. Firmino’s pledge to Liverpool comes with Klopp’s side dashing in Europe but stumbling towards the Premier League finish line. They may exceed expectations this season, but are also in danger of falling short of finishing in the top four. No matter how hard Klopp tried, or how often the players reiterated that the only focus was Stoke last weekend, Liverpool could not escape the spectre of Rome. It was there in Klopp’s team selection, the multiple changes ensuring the rhythm and vivacity of four days earlier was gone, even if Salah and Firmino played at 60 per cent power. It was there in the lacklustre performance, Liverpool’s players physically weakened by their exertions. Paul Lambert could not have hoped for a better time to visit. It was there in the crowd. Every time there was a tackle, The Kop shuddered and sat silent. They gave the impression they wanted this to be over without any casualties. And it was in the post-match questioning. It says much about the lack of entertainment that a quip from Trent Alexander-Arnold was the lingering memory. Asked to consider the barrage of messages he has received since Liverpool’s first leg win over Roma, he revealed one stood out. “I had loads of things saying I have now played more Champions League games than Everton,” said the teenager. “That was quite funny. I enjoyed seeing that.” It was pointed out that is not quite correct. He needs one more to go past Everton’s European Cup appearance record. “Oh, equal is it? Oh, well, hopefully I play on Wednesday then. If I am picked, I guess it will be a good one to say,” said the defender. Unless Liverpool avoid defeat to Chelsea, their efforts to reach next year’s Champions League will extend to the final game at home to Brighton. Despite the point, Stoke still looked doomed. Lambert protected a proud unbeaten run at Anfield as a manager. He is unlikely to get a chance to extend it in the league next year. © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

The exhibit explores themes of impermanence, abstraction, and the potential for spontaneity. Most works on display are composed of found materials making the city both the subject of the works and the medium for expressing them. Upon entering the gallery space it is hard to miss the cluster of shoes in the corner that were picked up and collected by the artists while walking the city. Found objects come with their own history and bare the mark of time and use from before they were repurposed as a work of art. As such, they are replete with meaning that can be manipulated according to the context of the show, which is why a heap of discarded shoes can refer to untold journeys and inevitable loss. Similarly, a sofa frame with no upholstery, only some springs and strings for decoration makes for a curious work. The sofa frame is put up on the wall as you would a painting and the object’s reconfiguration within a gallery space makes it so it avoids easy recognition. Upon recognition you tend to wonder where it comes from—perhaps a living room, maybe an office or a hotel?— who had been on it and what might they have done there? Impelling these meandering thoughts is really the purpose of the work because such thoughts always wind back to you, the viewer. The sofa frame is a skeleton for situations and how you build on it [what you find in it or don’t] is up to you. There is also the story of the ‘instrument’ Manandhar had built from scrap. He had taken the xylophone looking thing around Kathmandu like it were an ice cream trolley, playing it for or with interested passerbys. Unfortunately, the thing was stolen on its very first excursion. Fortunately, the story of this instrument, from conception till theft is documented in a series of photographs included in the show, which make for a comical testament to the transience of things. Gordon had described his medium, found objects, as “morsels of reality” and the works he created with Manandhar as “offerings to impermanence.” He likened the works to photographs in that they do not represent an objective reality and are instead subjective framings of moments as well as invitations into them. According to Gordon, framing the concept of impermanence itself and creating a conversation around it is a form of resistance to rampant consumerism and the materialist ethos that drives it. Thus, the thought of ephemeral art works facilitating enduring conversations is what underpins the hopes of both Manandhar and Gordon. Manandhar is a Kathmandu based artist and an alumnus of KU where he is presently an artist in residence. Gordon is an American artist, currently a Fulbright Student Researcher in Nepal examining the socio-economic, cultural, and artistic landscape of contemporary Buddhist art. Gordon is also an artist in residence at the Kathmandu University Center for Art and Design. The exhibition will run until May 3. @media(max-width: 468px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/margin-left: 5px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat: no-repeat;margin-top: -9px;margin-left: -2px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;/*background-size: cover;*/background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_mobile_25sep_320X100.gif');min-height: 100px;background-size: contain;background-repeat:no-repeat;}}@media(min-width: 478px){.esewa-wrap{width: 100%;height: 90px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;}.esewa-wrap-ad-the-kathmandu-post{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 70%;background-size: cover;margin-left: 15px;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-saptahik{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 84%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nari{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 79%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 105%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-tv{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 100%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;width: 90%;}.esewa-wrap-ad-kantipur-radio{background-image: url('http://jcss-cdn.ekantipur.com/common/images/ads/esewa_pasal_desktop_25sep_970X90.gif');min-height: 97%;background-size: cover;margin-bottom:15px;}}@media (max-width:768px){.esewa-wrap-ad-nepal{margin: 0 auto;display: block;width: 300px;}}function gaEvent(eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel){ga('send','event',eventCategory,eventAction,eventLabel);} Published: 29-04-2018 08:58 Click here for your comments Comment via Facebook Don't have facebook account?

Bob,Diamond,773,https://whmi.com/news/article/new-gas-station-mugg-bopps-marion-township,"A popular gas station and convenience store chain is opening another branch in Marion Township. Mugg and Bopp’s is setting to open their 19th store in the area on D-19 in Marion Township, at the current site of Bella’s Market. At Thursday night’s meeting of the Board of Trustees, Todd Lekander of Mugg and Bopp’s was present for final site plan review and a needed special use permit. The gas station will house 5 fuel stations with a canopy, with 7-feet of brick columns as per the township’s request. The site plan was approved based on fulfillment of recommendations from the township’s engineer. The special use permit proved to be a bit trickier. A broken pipe on Lekander’s property belonging to neighboring property owner Bob Diamond has been malfunctioning for years and causing flooding issues. Lekander said in discussions with Diamond, Diamond believes the county's road and drain commissions are responsible for repairs. Those two entities, it was said, believe that Diamond is responsible. Township officials just want this lingering problem fixed before it gets too great. Lekander said from the start of the meeting that he was willing to facilitate whoever was willing to fix it if they wanted to do it during construction. He agreed to give an easement to whichever party ends up fixing the problem. Lekander said they plan on beginning construction in the summer and should be ready to open in the fall.(MK) Back to WHMI for Complete List of Current News
