Michael,Gordon,b'1487',https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/bang-on-a-can-have-yet-to-find-a-boundary-they-wont-cross-20180823-h14dap.html,0.0,1.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.9305830170261243,0,2018-08-24 12:48:14,True,"When young music graduates Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe moved to New York in the 1980s, fresh from Yale, they found a city divided along arbitrary lines. Uptown, there were supercilious academics and hallowed institutions for whom classical music was sacrosanct. Downtown, there were ragtag punks and rockers doing whatever they wanted. The trio was somewhere in the middle; classically-minded musicians who liked to play electric guitars and experiment with screechy body percussion. Bang On A Can All-Stars in performance. So they rented a SoHo art gallery and put on a 12-hour marathon of new music, including performances by Steve Reich and John Cage, with a name that made them laugh: the first annual Bang on a Can festival. But it turned out many others were looking for the zone the trio occupied between rock, jazz, classical and folk; a zone where new forms of music could be explored and enjoyed. Where a classical violinist could collaborate with an Appalachian fiddler or an electronic DJ. Where audiences could listen to Afrobeat drumming one minute and be floored by a choral oratorio the next. Members of the Bang On a Can collective. ""In the beginning, we were aware our college friends would go see new dance or experimental film, but they weren't crossing the divide to the world we came from,"" Wolfe, 59, said as she sat at a sun-drenched table in her Tribeca loft. ""We welcomed these people in thinking if we had this good experience with this piece of music anybody could and that worked. In the first year ... about 400 people crowded in."" Three decades on, Bang on a Can has snowballed from an annual concert into a global movement. The New Yorker said they had redefined what a composer can be in the 21st century. The San Francisco Chronicle called them the ""country's most important vehicle for contemporary music"". The collective comprises a record label, a summer camp, an All-Stars sextet that performs around the world, a marching band, a commissioning fund for composers and a program to help under-privileged communities create global music. At its heart is still the annual marathon festival, like the one they will headline in Sydney on Saturday. The Bang on a Can All-Stars, formed in the 1990s to take the group's music on the road, will perform as part of Extended Play at the City Recital Hall, a 12-hour mini-festival traversing new music in every format. From noon to midnight, 20 local and international artists will transform each corner of the venue into a hub of sonic exploration. That such concerts are being staged by others – this one by Australian composer Lyle Chan – is a testament to Bang on a Can's impact. The group has spawned alumni collectives, including a solid Australian network (Australia is the biggest Bang on a Can base outside the US, they say) and has seen genre-bending experimental ensemble music become almost mainstream. Wolfe won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2015 for Anthracite Fields, a haunting choral and instrumental composition about the coal mining community of her native Pennsylvania. And while the boundaries around genres may have blurred, the group is tackling some cultural and geographic barriers that have replaced them. Their concerts have welcomed diverse groups such as a percussion ensemble from Uzbekistan and have often prioritised local input. The Melbourne performance will include a piece by local musician Kate Moore, while all three Australian shows will present Anabiosis, a piece by Australian singer and composer JG Thirlwell (of Foetus and Zola Jesus fame), part of a program stretching from Lang's 1995 percussion riot Cheating, Lying, Stealing to Gordon's 2012 composition Gene Takes a Drink. ""Some of what we did was that polemic ... we really wanted to break down those [genre] barriers,"" Lang said. ""The big question with music now is who can participate. The world of classical music needs to go through this kind of soul-searching about how it makes itself part of the general musical spectrum. It's lived this long by building a bunch of walls around it."" He hopes the spark of exploration and optimism they lit in the 1980s still burns strong. ""When we were young composers, people told us, 'this is the size of the world that you're going to live in' and we didn't like that,"" Lang said. ""I don't think young composers or performers feel that. They think the size of their world is boundary-less and we hope we have been a part of that."" Bang on a Can All-stars perform at City Recital Hall, Sydney, as part of Extended Play on August 25; Melbourne Recital Hall, August 28; and Home of the Arts, Gold Coast, August 30.

Senior News Corp journalist Phil Rothfield reported earlier this week the Roosters are set to make a big play for the 23-year-old State of Origin and Kangaroos star. North Queensland is believed to be keen on luring Munster “home” to Townsville if they fail in their pursuit of Valentine Holmes, and the Broncos have been rumoured to be interested. But all those clubs face a stiff fight from the Storm, who are no doubt prepared to fork out plenty of cash to retain their premiership talent. Brennan is well aware the Titans will struggle to compete with the money on offer from Melbourne and the Roosters.

With Billy Slater about to retire and Cameron Smith’s future in the game unknown, the Storm will have plenty of money to entice Munster to stay in the southern capital beyond 2019. Adding to his value is the fact he can play in the halves and at fullback just as effectively. With the Titans likely losing veteran custodian Michael Gordon after next season, Brennan knows the club will have at least one spot in the spine to fill. He said Munster could slot in at five-eighth or at fullback with ease, completing a spine that already boasts young stars Ash Taylor and AJ Brimson. The Titans are also on the verge of extending hooker Mitch Rein’s contract. Rein is currently off contract but has an option to extend, and will do so in the coming weeks.

Sheik Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan is part of the ruling Abu Dhabi family and was said to have met Liverpool's owners Fenway Sports Group over a period of months in late 2017. He was then said to have proposed a huge £2billion takeover of the club, according to the Daily Mail. That deal would have made it the most expensive takeover in the history of football. The report goes on to say he was ready with a £2billion valuation - taking on a minority Chinese investor and more money from a hedge fund. This valuation was placed on the club before the reached the Champions League final. Liverpool are adamant that the club is not for sale, although they ARE looking for a similar investment deal to the one Manchester City made with Chinese consortium CMC. That investment was for £265million and bought CMC a 13 per cent stake in City. However it seems the deal broke down when a £25m down payment on the proposal was not paid last December - with Liverpool way of a lack of funds. The club released a statement and insisted the deal broke down before Sheik Khaled and FSG's majority shareholders John W Henry or Michael Gordon met. It read: ""FSG have been clear and consistent: the club is not for sale. ""But what the ownership has said, again clearly and consistently, is that under the right terms and conditions we would consider taking on a minority investor, if such a partnership was to further our commercial interests in specific market places and in line with the continued development and growth of the club and the team."" Sheikh Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan established Bin Zayed Group of Companies in 1988, a leading conglomerate of business. While not having the billion dollar wealth of the likes of Sheik Mansour, he is said to be a leading entrepreneur in the region. He is a member of the World Economic Forum, Vice Chairman of Human Appeal International and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Dubai Economic Council. Last October Liverpool owners reportedly turned down a £1.5billion offer to buy the club from a consortium led by Amanda Staveley. Staveley and here PCP Capital Partners Group have been heavily linked with a takeover bid for Newcastle United in recent weeks. But this was only after FSG turned down a bid for the Reds. Reports in Dubai say that they were involved in negotiations with FSG for more than a year, according to The National. The report claims that the sale was called off at the eleventh hour, with FSG confident that they could seal a better price for the club in the club in the future given the rosy economic outlook for the Premier League. PSG then denied the report."

Johnson Matthew Polenzani (with Nadine Sierra) sings the title role of Mozart’s “Idomeneo” October 13- November 2 at Lyric Opera. Photo: Marty Sohl / Metropolitan Opera 2018-19 is shaping up as one of the least adventurous seasons on Chicago’s classical scene since CCR launched nearly a decade ago. It almost seems as if many of the large organizations and presenters are engaged in a private tournament to see who can provide the most familiar and least interesting repertoire. Sad! Fortunately, the local music beat is varied and expansive enough that one can still come up with intriguing Critic Picks for this season. The following nine events stand out amid the sea of safety-first programming. The Collaborative Works Festival. September 5-7 The landscape for serious vocal recitals is even more barren than usual in Chicago’s upcoming season. Fortunately, the Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago is once again expertly filling the void with its Collaborative Works Festival. Vocal artists this fall include CAIC cofounder, tenor Nicholas Phan, soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano and baritone Tyler Duncan. The festival’s 2018 rep casts an even wider and more adventurous net than usual: a commissioned world premiere by Missy Mazzoli, alongside song cycles by Brahms, Schoenberg, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Leos Janácek. caichicago.org Handel’s Serse. Haymarket Opera. September 29-October 2 Haymarket Opera has gone from strength to strength in its recent productions of Ariane et Bachus and L’Orontea, and the time is right for the company to finally tackle an evening-length Handel work with Serse. Mezzo Suzanne Lommler takes the title trousers role of the amorous King of Persia, backed by a cast of company regulars including Angela Young Smucker, Erica Schiller, Ryan de Ryke and David Govertsen. One of Handel’s richest works, the three-act serio-comic opera contains much indelible music, not least the celebrated “Ombra mai fu”—the most beautiful aria ever sung to a tree. haymarketopera.org Mozart’s Idomeneo. Lyric Opera. October 13-November 2 Matthew Polenzani is at the top of his game these days and having the American singer tackle the solo part in Mozart’s greatest tenor role is self-recommending. With Andrew Davis conducting and a supporting cast that includes Erin Wall and Janai Brugger, this is easily the best bet at Lyric Opera this season. lyricopera.org Charpentier’s Acteon and Rameau’s Pygmalion. Opera Atelier. November 15-16 In a bounteous fall for Baroque opera, the Toronto-based Opera Atelier makes its Chicago debut at the Harris Theater with a double bill of French Baroque masterworks. These performances will be sumptuously staged with a corps de ballet, and the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra in the pit. harristheaterchicago.org Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. Music of the Baroque. November 25-26 Declan McGovern, Music of the Baroque’s new executive director, has a stated goal of bringing new audiences into the hall for MOB concerts. In his first programmed season, that populist outreach is evident: MOB will make its Pritzker Pavilion debut on Sept. 12 with a program of excerpts from favorite Baroque and Classical works; and the fall season contains ample box-office bait, like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, Bach’s Second Orchestral Suite and the Mozart Requiem. MOB’s best bet for 2018-19 is Bach’s epic Christmas Oratorio (complete). After music of Mozart, Jane Glover is at her best in large-scale Baroque vocal works such as this. baroque.org Jake Heggie’s “Moby-Dick” will have its Chicago premiere April 25 and 28 at Chicago Opera Theater. Photo: Dana Sohm Massenet’s Cendrillon. Lyric Opera. December 1-January 20, 2019 A wild card pick since Andrew Davis has tapped Siobhan Stagg, a virtually unknown Australian soprano, to make her company debut in the title role of Cinderella. Massenet’s gorgeous, neglected score seems to finally be waltzing in from the shadows with a well-received Met production last year, which will travel here. Alice Coote is Prince Charming and Marie-Eve Munger, the Fairy Godmother. These holiday-new year performances mark Cendrillon’s belated Lyric Opera premiere. lyricopera.org Strauss and Bartok. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor. March 28-April 2 Esa-Pekka Salonen’s concerts with the CSO are invariably season highlights. The Finnish conductor is only booked for a single week this season but his program promises to be a striking one: Richard Strauss’s brilliant tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra, and Bartok’s bleak, atmospheric opera Bluebeard’s Castle with soloists Michelle De Young and John Relyea. cso.org Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick. Chicago Opera Theater. April 25 and 28 For many, Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick is the finest American opera of recent decades; kudos to Chicago Opera Theater for bringing this important, belated Chicago premiere to local audiences. Heggie’s tightly wrought setting of Herman Melville’s sprawling, complex novel manages to hit all the book’s high points as well as the lurking subtexts in music that is memorable and theatrically effective. Thomas Studebaker takes on the role of the obsessed Captain Ahab, with Aleksey Bogdanov as Starbuck, Vince Wallace as Queequeg, Andrew Bidlack as Greenhorn and Summer Hassan as Pip. Lidiya Yankovskaya conducts, with a well-received production from Utah Opera. cot.org Verdi’s Aida. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Riccardo Muti, conductor. June 21-25 Riccardo Muti’s concert performances of Verdi operas have been consistent high points amid the repetitive, Eurocentric programming that has largely characterized his CSO tenure. These season-ending concert performances of Verdi’s Aida promise to be in the same grand tradition with Krassimira Stoyanova in the title role, Francesco Meli as her lover Radames, Anita Rachvelishvili as Amneris, and Kiril Manolov as Amonasro. cso.org Posted in Articles Message:"

Annan, the first Black African to lead the United Nations, had also chaired The Eldersa humanitarian group of a dozen leaders and activists of worldwide stature Nelson Mandela formedsince 2013, CNN added. In 2006, while he was secretary-general, Annan called for gay men to be recognized in the fight to end HIV/AIDS, PinkNews reported. ""We need to be realistic,"" he said at the time. ""We will not succeed by putting our heads in the sand and pretending these people do not exist or do not need help."" A transgender person was fatally shot in the city of Peshawar in Pakistan, PinkNews reported. The victim, identified as Nasir Naso, was killed near Bara Gate after being tortured, authorities said. Officials said the victim was discovered in a sack in the area. Two suspects have been arrested, one of whom is the owner of the victim's house. A man in India has confessed to chopping his same-sex lover into pieces after they had sex, PinkNews reported. The 29-year-old murderer, who lives in Tamil Nadu in the south of the country, invited a 68-year-old French tourist to his home in the village of Avikottai, where the pair had sex before the victim was killed. According to The Hindu, the murderer was named Thirumurugan and the victim was named Pierre Bernard Robert Rene. A 27-year-old man was sentenced to two years in prison ( six months conditionally suspended ) for attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault by the court in Amsterdam, NLTimes.nl noted. He was part of a group of four who attacked two gay men on the Damrak in Amsterdam in June 2017. The three other perpetrators in this attack were tried and sentenced in March; two of the other suspects were sentenced to three years and four months, and two years and four months in jail. After facing intense scrutiny regarding hundreds of alleged child sex-abuse cases involving priests in Pennsylvania, Washington Archbishop Cardinal Donald Wuerl has pulled out of a scheduled appearance in Ireland, Fox5DC.com reported. Wuerl was supposed to deliver a keynote address at the Vatican-organized gathering at the World Meeting of Families, a Vatican-organized gathering in Dublin. Wuerl has now withdrawn his appearance after a report from a Pennsylvania grand-jury report that detailed more than 300 priests sexually abused more than 1,000 children. The Rainbow Laces campaign recently returned to English cricket to celebrate LGBT players and fans at every level of cricket, ICC-Cricket.com noted. Run by the English Cricket Board ( ECB ), professional and amateur clubs nationwide sported rainbow laces for the second consecutive year. Malaysian police have raided a gay bar in the country's capital of Kuala Lumpuran act that authorities have said was carried out to ""mitigate the LGBT culture from spreading into our society,"" PinkNews noted. National newspaper Berita Harian reported that authorities raided The Blue Boy club. It is reportedly the first time the club has been raided in its 30-year history. Singer-songwriter Ariana Grande broke down in a recent interview when she opened up about the impact of the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, PinkNews noted. In an emotional interview, the star discussed the background to her new song ""Get Well Soon,"" which she said is partly about the terrorist attack, to Ebro Darden on Beats 1 Radio. Grande, 25, has previously said that she has suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder since the terrorist attack. In Canada, Trinity Western University will stop making students promise not to have sex outside of an opposite-sex marriage, DailyXtra.com noted. Trinity Western's proposed law school ran into difficulty after several law societies said they would refuse to accredit the university's students because of the community covenant. The covenant will still apply to university staff, however. Stormy Danielsthe adult film actress and nemesis of U.S. President Donald Trumppulled out of a British reality-TV show at the last minute after a dispute with producers, a USA Today item noted. Daniels was due to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, which locks contestants in a house under constant surveillance. But she failed to join housemates such as actress Kirstie Alley and psychic Sally Morgan for the first episode. Speaking of Celebrity Big Brother, LGBT plastic-surgery devotee Rodrigo Alves ( known as ""The Human Ken Doll"" ) is under fire for twice using a racial slur. At one point, Alves is shown saying of another contestant, ""I like, like, a [n-word] boy. Do you know what I mean? He's too white for my sake."" The following morning, Big Brother called Alves into the diary room to give him a warning for his use of language. Many are calling on the show's producers to go further and remove Rodrigo Alves from the house altogether. E! Entertainment in the United Kingdom is moving into original commissions with a bisexual dating series fronted by Celebrity Big Brother winner Shane Jenek, also known as Courtney Act, Deadline noted. The NBC Universal-backed broadcaster has ordered ten-part series The Bi Life from Monkey, the David Granger and Will Macdonald-run production company that is part of NBC Universal International Studios. The show will see a group of bisexual, pansexual and fluid or questioning British single individuals sent on an adventure to find love abroad."

A school district in southern Oklahoma was forced to shut down for two days after parents used a Facebook group to threaten violence against a transgender seventh-grade student, Time.com reported. Superintendent Rick Beene closed Achille Public Schools after parents posted claims on a Facebook group, ""Achille ISD Parents Group,"" that the student, who identifies as a girl, was looking over the stalls in the girls' bathroom. Beene said he instituted the closings on the advice of local law enforcement. On Thursday, Aug. 23, at 7 p.m. CT, Logo will be premiering Quiet Heroes ( www.quietheroes.net/ ), a documentary that focuses on two lesbian medical professionals whoduring the peak of the AIDS crisis in Salt Lake Citybecome some of the only doctors willing to see AIDS patients in all of Utah, a press release noted. To connect the film to the modern-day HIV/AIDS epidemic, MTV has created a short PSA with five HIV-positive young people that highlights the modern-day ""heroes"" who, despite stigma and fear, are supporting their friends and loved ones living with HIV. The PSA is at youtu.be/dLQiZV6L84g; more on supporting HIV-positive individuals is at hero.MTV.com . Entrepreneurs from all over the world convened in Philadelphia for the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce Business and Leadership conference Aug. 14-17, and organizers honored Martha Stewart as a longtime ally, KYWNewsradio.com reported. At the Aug. 16 luncheon plenary, Stewart talked about her entrepreneurial expertise, triumps over setbacks, and connections to the LGBT community. Other events at the conference ranged from a trans-inclusive town hall to various networking receptions to a marketplace expo, according to the organization's website. Of the trio of out candidates seeking seats this year on the San Francisco Board of Education, it appears two have failed to secure the support of either of the city's two main LGBT political clubs, The Bay Area Reporter noted. While transgender advocate Mia Satya earned an early endorsement of her candidacy from the Harvey Milk LGBTQ Democratic Club, she appears to have failed to earn the endorsement of the more moderate Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club. Transgender bisexual man Martin Rawlings-Fein and gay man Phil Kim have yet to secure an endorsement from either organization. Lambda Literary will hold its second annual Lambda LitFest Los Angelesa week-long, LGBTQ literary festivalon Sept. 29-Oct. 6, a press release noted. Held at 25 venues across Los Angeles County, the festival features community-curated performances, talks and low-cost writing workshops. The festival will close at Plummer Park in West Hollywood with a live taping of the LA Review of Books ( LARB ) Radio Hour Podcast with Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. See LambdaLitFest.org . Jane Clementiwhose son, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide after getting bullied onlinerecently revealed that after his death at age 18, she also considered suicide, CNN.com reported. When Tyler was a student at Rutgers University, his roommate used a computer webcam to film Clementi in an intimate act with a man; the video was then shared online to many of Tyler's peers. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Jane said she blamed herself after Tyler's death. A Portland man threatened to bomb an apartment complex housing people with HIV or AIDS, KOIN.com reported. Scott Wayne Smith has been charged with one count of intimidation. In an affidavit signed by Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Melissa Marrero, Smith is said to have used a homophobic slur against two residents of Hopewell Apartments. Smith, who is currently in custody, also reportedly threatened to ""kill all you people."" While most news outlets reported on the historic nature of a transgender candidate being nominated for governor by a major political party, several hosts and guests on Fox News attacked groundbreaking candidate Christine Hallquist because of her gender identity, a Victory Fund press release noted. On Tucker Carlson Tonight, conservative journalist Chadwick Moore claimed Hallquist won because of ""transgender privilege"" and that she can ""get away with many, many things by being transgender."" That statement followed an incident earlier in the day, when host Ainsley Earhardt referred to Hallquist as ""that transgender."" Idaho has received nearly 30 applications from people requesting changes to their birth certificates to properly reflect their identities since a federal judge ruled rejecting applications was illegal, The Idaho Statesman noted. The judge's decision stated reissued birth certificates can't include a record of the gender having been changed. Idaho was one of fourincluding Kansas, Ohio and Tennesseethat prohibited transgender people from changing their birth certificate to reflect their gender identity. The University of Texas athletics department waved a big rainbow flag recently, marching in the Austin Pride Parade, Outsports noted. Using the tagline ""Hooked on Diversity and Inclusion,"" 12 student-athletes and 13 staffers reportedly joined Texas Cheer and Pom membersincluding the school's costumed mascot, Hook 'Em. With a cut lip and a bruised nose, gay-porn star Wesley Woods explained in a video that on Aug. 8, he and a friend were attacked in what appears to be a gay-bashingin West Hollywood, California, Out.com noted. The goal of his video was to impart a cautious reminder to his queer followers to be vigilant, even in places they think they're safe. Comedian Kathy Griffin took a shot at Tomi Lahren, mocking the Fox News pundit's intelligence after she tweeted remarks suggesting ""hate speech"" wasn't real, TheWrap.com noted.
