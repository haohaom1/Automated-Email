Const. Sara Burns, 43, is shown in this undated police handout photo. HO/The Canadian Press In the middle of raising three boys, Sara Burns decided to go back to school and chase her dream of becoming a police officer. At 35, the Fredericton native decided to get a criminology degree, and then leave her husband and sons for six months of intensive training at the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. The driven recruit arrived in 2015 with a maturity that was uncommon among her 60 or so peers – most of whom were about 21 years old – and she was soon named the leader of the cohort for that year, according to Edgar MacLeod, who retired in January as the academy’s long-time executive director. Story continues below advertisement In an interview at the time with the Journal Pioneer, a local PEI newspaper, Ms. Burns explained her reasoning for joining law enforcement. “[Policing] is something that I think challenges you physically, mentally and socially; you need to be aware of those components. It’s a really challenging field and to survive you need to keep all of those in check,” she said. “To do well, you obviously need to maintain a certain standard, and here at the school they provide a lot of the theory and the skill to do that.” Mr. McLeod, a former president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, remembered her as physically capable and in possession of all the skills needed to enforce the law in dangerous situations. “But, beyond that, we also want to train our police officers to be compassionate and understanding of people, be patient with people – that sort of thing – and boy, she had that part down in spades,"" he said. “You could tell she would treat everybody with respect, not a showboat, she didn’t have an edge.” On Friday, friends and colleagues mourned Constable Burns after she and a fellow officer were killed in a quiet residential neighbourhood of Fredericton. Two civilians were also killed and a 48-year-old local man was in police custody on Friday evening with serious injuries. In 2016, soon after graduating from the academy, Constable Burns was hired by her hometown force, of which she had been an auxiliary member.

Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was charged Saturday morning with the deaths of two Fredericton police officers and two civilians, according to a news release from Fredericton police. The officers, identified Friday, are Const. Sara Burns, 43, and Const. Robb Costello, 45. Police confirmed the identity of the other two victims Saturday morning: Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Robichaud and Wright were in a new relationship, according to his cousin, Sean Callahan. He said they had just gotten together at the beginning of August. Callahan said there was “nothing bad you can say about” Robichaud. “When I got a message yesterday asking me if Donnie got shot, I was like, who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?” he told the Star in an interview. Callahan said he joined Robichaud’s mother and other family members at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital on Friday morning. An RCMP officer confirmed with them around 6 p.m. that Robichaud was one of the victims, Callahan said. Robichaud, a father of three, lived alone on Brookside Dr., according to his cousin. The shooting occurred at that address around 7 a.m. Friday. Just 12 hours after a shooting that shocked the city of Fredericton, more than 100 people packed into a local church Friday night to mourn the victims. St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church is less than a kilometre away from the site of the shooting. Citizens of the small New Brunswick city gathered to sing hymns, sit in silent prayer and light candles. “I’m so sad,” said Mei Yong, who brought her 2-year-old son, Nova Lin, to the vigil. Yong said she was there to show her support to Fredericton police, who helped her in a time of personal need. Even though she didn’t know the two officers who were killed, she said she was grieving with those who did. Costello, 45, had served for 20 years with Fredericton police. “He loved being a police officer and he lived for being a police officer,” his common-law partner, Jackie McLean said. “He is the only police officer who I have ever known who could write someone a ticket and have the person thank them after.” Burns, 43, was with Fredericton police for the past two years as an officer, and two years before that as an auxiliary officer. Fredericton is a city of less than 60,000, and its residents are tightly connected. One of those residents, retired United Church minister Brian DeLong, began getting calls just after 4 p.m. Police had just released the names of the officers — the first to respond to the call — who had been fatally shot, and people were badly rattled by the news. One of the victims, Const. Burns, was the daughter-in-law of two members of his congregation. “People from my congregation called me and said, ‘Did you know?’ ” DeLong said before the vigil. He rushed to join the vigil at St. John the Evangelist, where he read a scripture in dedication to Burns’ family, and all those grieving. The vigil was open to the whole community, its doors propped open to let in the evening breeze as the sun began to set. Fans moved the air around in the small gym where people gathered, but it remained hot after another stifling summer day.

Several blocks around the site of the shooting remained blocked off by police and New Brunswick RCMP on Friday evening, with several officers and a forensic investigation vehicle parked outside a four-building apartment complex at 237 Brookside Dr. Apparent bullet holes were visible in a second-storey window of one of the buildings at the complex. “It’s unbelievable in Fredericton,” Yong said. “It’s safe here, it’s not Toronto, so I just can’t believe it.” With files from The Canadian Press Taryn Grant is a reporter for StarMetro Halifax.

The rally in Salem was part of a series of rallies around the country hosted by Students for Life of America, a youth organization dedicated to abolishing abortion in their lifetime. The organization, which considers themselves a ""post-Roe organization,"" also provides education on abortion and promotes student leadership at a local and national level. Rallies around the nation were either organized by a regional coordinator or student leaders. Nichole Bentz, the Pacific Northwest regional coordinator for Students for Life of America and Salem rally organizer, said the purpose of Saturday's event was to show Oregon Senators Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) that there is support for Kavanaugh in the state. ""We're organizing this rallies to call Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed because he is a solid court nominee,"" Bentz, 24 of Corvallis, said. ""He has a strong record on religious liberty, free speech and protecting the pre-born."" Kavanaugh is President Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, following Justice Neil Gorsuch who was confirmed in 2017. Kavanaugh's confirmation could change the direction of the court to a more conservative side for decades. Bentz spoke at the rally, along with Jessica Stanton, a public affairs official from Oregon Right to Life, and Marcos Sanchez, a student leader for Students for Life of America. ""After Justice Neil Gorsuch was placed on the Supreme Court, we could only dream of another opportunity to have such major influence for the pro-life movement,"" Stanton said. ""We must show our support and raise our voices for our U.S. Senators to confirm the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh."" Abby Luschei can be reached at aluschei@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6747.
