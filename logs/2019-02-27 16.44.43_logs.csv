Doug Reville with Enterprise Fleet Management pitches cost saving practices through the use of his company as Sheriff Tony Durden (left) and Chief Deputy Scott Holbrook (center) look on. On Friday, Feb. 22, the Caswell County Commissioners held a special meeting to address the possibility of leasing with Enterprise Fleet Management as an alternative to purchasing vehicles every year for the Sheriff’s department. According to Doug Reville with Enterprise, Caswell County ordered five police vehicles during last year’s budget cycle. They’re built and ready for delivery at a cost $150,000. Enterprise could, with commissioner approval, purchase the vehicles from the dealers instead of the county and lease them to Caswell at a fraction of the cost, enabling the county to receive more than the original five cars for the same $150,000. Currently, the Sheriff’s fleet is approximately 44 vehicles, most of which have over 100,000 miles not counting time spent idling, which also wears engines down. Enterprise could also purchase those vehicles and lease them back. Through leasing, Caswell County could better maintain an overall healthier fleet, said Reville. With fleet management, usage data for each vehicle is tracked to recommend repairs, oil changes, and best time to sell. The commissioners were already considering creating a maintenance job position to do this function and with Enterprise in place they wouldn’t have to. The entire fleet could become managed by Enterprise. Newer trucks, Reville said, often retain value and may be sold at profit. Commissioner Steve Oestreicher said it all sounded like magic and wanted clarification on the math. Enterprise has working relationships with dealerships, factories, and other organizations to purchase vehicles at a cheaper price, Reville explained. Local repairmen and vendors were used whenever possible. To get on the list for Enterprise consideration, the local business would need to contact the county. Oestreicher said it sounded good, but he wanted to err on the side of caution and not put all eggs into one basket. With approval of the motion, Enterprise will monitor all law-enforcement vehicles and track their usage data and lease up to 17 vehicles to the county to meet this and last year’s vehicle demands. The vote was 5-0, unanimous in favor of using the service. Commissioners Sterling Carter and Nate Hall were absent for the vote and meeting. Commissioner Chairman Rick McVey asked if Enterprise had a similar program for ambulances and firetrucks. They may in the future, Reville said, but the police program is still new. The other vehicles in question have heavier requirements and the company isn’t there yet. Enterprise Fleet Management is a sister company to Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

Rick,McVey,2423,https://www.thetradenews.com/open-trading-sees-record-volumes-marketaxess/,"Monthly trading volumes on the Open Trading platform set a new record in January, shortly after reaching a new quarterly record at the end of the 2018. Fixed income electronic trading specialist MarketAxess has said its Open Trading platform reached a new monthly record in January, shortly after reporting record quarterly activity at the end of last year. Open Trading set a new monthly trading record of $45.5 billion in January, while overall trading volumes at MarketAxess also set a new record of $176.5 billion in the first month of the year. Open Trading’s monthly record follows its quarterly record, set in the fourth quarter of 2018, where volumes surged 96% year-on-year to $118 million. “The record January trading volumes are a great sign that market participants are finding increased value from the platform in a variety of market environments,” said Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess. “Market conditions reversed in January from the fourth quarter with investors increasing exposure to credit products and credit spreads narrowing,” Open Trading is an all-to-all platform that allows buy- and sell-side firms to connect anonymously through a central network to improve liquidity and reduce transaction costs. Speaking to investors on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call, Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess, said that Open Trading volumes grew rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients “embrace the platform” as an important source of new liquidity. Also on the earnings call was industry veteran Chris Concannon, who recently departed Cboe Global Markets and was appointed chief operating officer at MarketAxess. He told investors that the fourth quarter was challenging for clients in credit markets, which is one of the reasons market participants were leaning on the Open Trading platform. “That execution quality that MarketAxess is delivering is an opportunity to drive more business to the company’s platform as clients become more educated about the superior execution quality. The prices that clients are achieving are setting the standard for best execution in the fixed income market,” Concannon said. New monthly records were also set in US high-grade, US high-yield, emerging markets and Eurobond trading volumes at MarketAxess in January. « FactSet expands data ecosystem with IHS Markit March 6, 2019Webinar

Michael,Gordon,2369,https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Bang-on-a-Can-to-Present-2019-Peoples-Commissioning-Fund-Concert-20190129,"On Wednesday, March 6, 2019 at 7:30pm, Bang on a Can will present the 2019 Bang on a Can People's Commissioning Fund (PCF) concert, one of the most anticipated and reliable launching pads for composers in New York and beyond. The performance is presented as part of Kaufman Music Center's Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Hall (Kaufman Music Center, 129 W. 67th St.) and a New Sounds Live co-presentation with host John Schaefer, streamed live at www.newsounds.org. This year, Bang on a Can's PCF invites all of North America to dance, with world premieres by four composers from Canada, Mexico and the United States - Nicole Lizée, Josué Collado Fregoso, Henry Threadgill, and Trevor Weston. Each composer was asked to make his or her own idiosyncratic form of dance music, to redefine what it means to create music for dancing. The second half of the concert features three classics from Bang on a Can history by Annie Gosfield, Arnold Dreyblatt, and Glenn Branca, with a rare performance of Branca's massive ""three dimensional"" Movement Within, written specifically for the Bang on a Can All-Stars, in his unique tuning system and on his own original instruments. Nicole Lizée explains of her new work, Dancist (Season 1: Episode 1), ""In the spirit David Lynch's Twin Peaks, Rabbits or the Black Mirror series, the work is constructed as a quasi documentary or an episode of a fictional TV drama where a scene is set up and subsequently enhanced and manipulated by the performers. This episode tells a story of one person's quest to learn about dance music, with unexpected results."" Of the genesis of Joie de Vivre, Josué Collado Fregoso notes, ""When I was contacted to write this piece for the Bang on a Can All Stars, it was some of the best news I've received in my career, followed by the worst news I've received in my life: two weeks later my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The commission proposed dance as the central concept for the piece. I inherited the passion for dance from my mother side of the family, and always associated it with joy, cheerfulness and light-heartedness. Each of the characteristics that I admire from my mom. I decided then to write a piece dedicated to her. When I was writing Joie de Vivre, the piece became a personal symbol for resilience and hope in adverse conditions."" Hailing from Plainfield, New Jersey, the same hometown as Parliament Funkadelic, Trevor Weston recalls, ""Growing up in NJ in the 1970's, dance music meant Funk Music. We would not have Disco or Hip Hop without Funk. It is the fundamental genre of dance music in America after the 1960s. Dig It will distill essential elements of Funk Music in a contemporary context."" As a composer and improviser, Henry Threadgill sees artistic process and product as inseparable, the essence of jazz. The unpredictable results are jazz's ""sound of surprise"" updated for the 21st century. Threadgill was named a 2016 Pulitzer Prize Pulitzer Laureate for In For A Penny, In For A Pound, the latest album by Zooid, his unconventional sextet (reeds, acoustic guitar, cello, tuba, bass guitar, drums). Other honors and awards include the 2016 Doris Duke Artist Award; 2015 Doris Duke Impact Award; 2008 United States Artist Fellowship; 2003 Guggenheim Fellowship; and a Copland House Residency Award. The last time Bang on a Can co-founder Michael Gordon heard Glenn Branca's music was at the 2015 Bang on Can Marathon, where the performance was so loud that the merchants at the Winter Garden complained. In a tribute Gordon wrote for New Music Box in 2018, he recalls, ""We've been there for ten years, and they've never complained. Branca is too much. We get kicked out of the venue for good. Branca was the last act we did there."" Gordon further reflects, ""Are we going to hear this music again? I thought that then, that night in 2015, and I think that now. The Symphonies were created, and sometimes recorded, in a process that isn't easily recreatable. Many of the musicians were taught by rote. Were scores left? Is anyone going to take this on? Even if they do, can anyone channel the energy that Branca summoned during a performance? Are these like great buildings, designed, built, destroyed? Is all we have left a picture?"" Glenn Branca came to world attention with his massive symphonies written for re-tuned electric guitars. He developed a unique sound palette, and with it a unique tuning theory based on the natural harmonic series up to the 128th partial. In order to play his music, Branca built a series of guitar and keyboard instruments with these special tunings. Movement Within (1998) features six of these instruments, three keyboards and three guitars. Bang on a Can All-Stars are the first ensemble other than Branca's own to perform his microtonal music on his original instruments. Of her work The Manufacture of Tangled Ivory (1995), Annie Gosfield says, ""In my compositions, I generally start with the keyboard first. Then I often do improvisational work with percussionist Christine Bard and guitarist Roger Kleier, and parts of this piece were developed in our trio. As to the title, The Manufacture of Tangled Ivory, refers to the keys of the piano. And tangled was a way of describing the detuned and altered piano sounds that I've been exploring for a long time. The notes are actually displaced on the keyboard. In this piece, I tried to increase the density and layers of these sounds and see what kind of contrast I could bring out. In the beginning solo keyboard part, some parts are rubato and others sound like a player piano, fast and mechanical. In fact, the piece incorporates metallic, factory sounds, like some of the music of the Russian avant garde composers from the early part of this century. That's where manufacture comes from. I was also thinking somewhat about my grandmother. She moved from Poland to the lower east side in New York at about the same time these composers were working in Russia. And she worked in sweatshops and factories. I've been in New York for three years, and I'm about in the same neighborhood. But the differences between her experience and mine are so vast. Arnold Dreyblatt notes, ""This performance of Escalator (1995) for the Bang in a Can All-Stars is one of the few occasions where my music has been played by an ensemble other than my own. The piece had its beginnings in a duet performance piece with percussionist Pierre Berthet in Belgium in 1988, and it has been performed in various transformation by The Orchestra of Excited Strings over the years. In 1986-87 I began working on a ""digital dynamic processing system"" for a commission at ""Ars Electronica"" in Linz in 1987 and further developed this in a residency at STEIM in Amsterdam in 1989. This system was triggered with recorded machine tracks and interacts with acoustic instruments. It's basis are recordings of the rhythms produced by a number of malfunctioning escalators on the Blvd. Ansbach in Brussels which I made in 1987. In this version of ""Escalator"", composed in 1995, I notated repetitive rhythmic patterns found in these recordings and scored them for cimbalom, prepared electric guitar and cello, later adding layers of percussion, saxophone and prepared ""excited strings"" bass in collaboration with the musicians. About the People's Commissioning Fund (PCF): Created in 1997, PCF is a radical partnership between artists and audiences to commission works from adventurous composers and is one of the first pre-social media, crowd-sourcing art-creating platforms. The fund began when Bang on a Can co-founders Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe recognized a need to go beyond the usual sources of support to create new, groundbreaking music. Each year, Bang on a Can pools together the contributions of hundreds of individuals to fund the commissions. Donations range from $5 to $5,000. To date, over 50 new pieces have been created through PCF, and over $300,000 has been raised. The pieces often become part the Bang on a Can All-Stars' permanent repertoire, and these works go on to make debuts across the U.S. and throughout Europe and Asia. Past commissions have gone to composers including Nik Bärtsch, Eve Beglarian, Oscar Bettison, Nick Brooke, Jeffrey Brooks, Jace Clayton, Anna Clyne, Dan Deacon, Bryce Dessner, Sussan Deyhim, James Fei, Ben Frost, Yoav Gal, Annie Gosfield, Erdem Helvacioglu, John Hollenbeck, Cynthia Hopkins, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Karsh Kale, Carla Kihlstedt, John King, Glenn Kotche, Lukas Ligeti, Annea Lockwood, David Longstreth, Alvin Lucier, Rene Lussier, Keeril Makan, Ingram Marshall, Miya Masaoka, Paula Matthusen, Marc Mellits, Kate Moore, Thurston Moore, Virgil Moorefield, Richard Reed Parry, Joshua Penman, Tristan Perich, Dan Plonsey, Ed Ruchalski, Caroline Shaw, Matthew Shipp, Gabriella Smith, Christine Southworth, Lok Yin Tang, Jim Thirwell, Ken Thomson, Toby Twining, Stefan Weisman, Daniel Wohl, Zhang Shouwang, and Pamela Z.

Since its first Marathon concert in 1987, Bang on a Can has been creating an international community dedicated to innovative music, wherever it is found. With adventurous programs, it commissions new composers, performs, presents, and records new work, develops new audiences, and educates the musicians of the future. Bang on a Can is building a world in which powerful new musical ideas flow freely across all genres and borders. Bang on a Can plays ""a central role in fostering a new kind of audience that doesn't concern itself with boundaries. If music is made with originality and integrity, these listeners will come."" (The New York Times) Bang on a Can has grown from a one-day New York-based Marathon concert (on Mother's Day in 1987 in a SoHo art gallery) to a multi-faceted performing arts organization with a broad range of year-round international activities. ""When we started Bang on a Can, we never imagined that our 12-hour marathon festival of mostly unknown music would morph into a giant international organization dedicated to the support of experimental music, wherever we would find it,"" write Bang on a Can Co-Founders Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe. ""But it has, and we are so gratified to be still hard at work, all these years later. The reason is really clear to us - we started this organization because we believed that making new music is a utopian act - that people needed to hear this music and they needed to hear it presented in the most persuasive way, with the best players, with the best programs, for the best listeners, in the best context. Our commitment to changing the environment for this music has kept us busy and growing, and we are not done yet."" Current projects include the annual Bang on a Can Marathon; The People's Commissioning Fund, a membership program to commission emerging composers; the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who tour to major festivals and concert venues around the world every year; recording projects; the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival at MASS MoCA - a professional development program for young composers and performers led by today's pioneers of experimental music; Asphalt Orchestra, Bang on a Can's extreme street band that offers mobile performances re-contextualizing unusual music; Found Sound Nation, a new technology-based musical outreach program now partnering with the State Department of the United States of America to create OneBeat, a revolutionary, post-political residency program that uses music to bridge the gulf between young American musicians and young musicians from developing countries; cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects with DJs, visual artists, choreographers, filmmakers and more. Each new program has evolved to answer specific challenges faced by today's musicians, composers and audiences, in order to make innovative music widely accessible and wildly received. Bang on a Can's inventive and aggressive approach to programming and presentation has created a large and vibrant international audience made up of people of all ages who are rediscovering the value of contemporary music.

In the video, Orjan Buroe and his 4-year-old child, Dexter, both sport Disney princess costumes as Elsa, the frosty queen in the 2013 animated musical. The pair staged a choreographed dance to ""Let It Go,"" the popular tune sung by Idina Menzel and written by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez. In Melbourne, Australia, openly gay sports photographer Matt Johnson said he was shaken when a fan yelled a gay slur at him at a recent pro soccer game, Outsports reported. Johnson, 25, was covering the A-League soccer match ( the nation's top soccer league ) between Melbourne Victory and Newcastle Jets in Melbourne on Jan. 12. As the match ended, a fan shouted out to Johnson, ""Hey gay boy … hey gay boy. Did you enjoy the game?"" Later, Johnson urged LGBT people and allies to call out this type of behavior whenever they hear it. Chinese model Zuo Yewho was involved in Dolce & Gabbana's controversial advertising campaignhas claimed that the Italian brand had ruined her career, The Daily Mail noted. The luxury fashion house was forced to cancel a high-profile runway show in Shanghai and apologize after a trio of promotional videos called ""Eating with Chopsticks"" and derogatory remarks allegedly made by designer Stefano Gabbana were widely condemned as racist last November. Yewho was filmed struggling to eat a pizza, pasta and a cannoli with a pair of chopsticks in the videossaid she had questioned the director at the shoot during ""the silly and embarrassing act.""

Phillip,Frost,2422,https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/908785,"No Results No Results Nick Mulcahy February 07, 2019 A big issue in prostate cancer is differentiating patients with an aggressive tumor that needs immediate treatment from patients with lower-risk disease that may never spread and can be managed with active surveillance. One test that addresses this problem is the 4Kscore (Opko Health), a blood test that predicts the likelihood of having a high-grade prostate cancer after an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result. However, this test has received a ""noncoverage"" determination from a Medicare administrative contractor, according to a report in the South Florida Business Journal. The Medicare contractor, Novitas Solutions, said they found flaws with clinical studies of the test. Opko will appeal the decision with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the report added. More than 12,000 practicing physicians have ordered the 4Kscore test, according to the company. 4Kscore is an assay panel that combines three PSA measures (total, free, and intact) with another prostate-specific measure, human kallikrein 2, in an algorithm that takes into account a patient's age, digital rectal examination result, and previous biopsy status. The test reportedly helps distinguish men who are at higher risk for aggressive disease from those at lower risk, possibly aiding in personal decisions to undergo biopsy. Novitas, which acts as stand-in for Medicare and makes coverage decisions in 10 states and Washington, DC, issued a proposed ruling that Medicare should not reimburse for the 4Kscore in May 2018. Last week, the test manufacturer said that Novitas set March 20 as the date that the noncoverage determination goes into effect, according to the South Florida Business Journal. ""We remain committed to our goal of widespread and affordable access to 4Kscore,"" said Phillip Frost, CEO of Opko. In an apparently unrelated matter, Frost recently agreed to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case related to ""lucrative market manipulation schemes"" worth $27 million, per CNBC. The new Medicare ruling may come as a surprise to clinicians who have followed the story of the blood test. In 2014, 4Kscore investigator Daniel Lin, MD, from the University of Washington in Seattle, told Medscape Medical News that ""this is a test that can personalize the risk of having a clinically relevant prostate cancer that deserves diagnosis."" In 2015, Medscape urology expert commentator Gerald Chodak, MD, highlighted the fact that the American Medical Association has issued a CPT (current procedural technology) code rating of level I for the test, ""which means that it is likely that insurance companies and Medicare will find the test more acceptable for reimbursement in the future."" Chodak said the 4Kscore test ""clearly is better"" than traditional PSA testing in identifying men at risk for high-grade disease before biopsy. However, he also said that one of the test's shortcomings is that ""it misses in the range of 10% to 18% of potentially high-risk cancers.""

John,O'Neil,2399,https://bromsgrovestandard.co.uk/lifestyle/the-seagull-at-birminghams-crescent-theatre-is-well-worth-a-trip-out-on-a-cold-night-to-see-11258/,"27th Feb, 2019 CHRISTOPHER Hampton’s 2007 adaption of Anton Chekhov’s The Seagull – a classic tale of unrequited love and the bohemian antics of ‘those theatricals’ – is an excellent choice for inclusion in this Crescent season. It has freshness to it and Hampton makes the text ‘blossom’ not ‘get lost’ in his translation. Chekhov, unlike many of his contemporaries, wrote great parts for women and in The Seagull they are there for the taking. Karen Leadbetter plays Irina Arkadina as a gloriously affected actress and self-centred woman who treats others as mere trappings, except that is for her son for whom she shows a fondness but not exactly motherly love. Hannah Birkin as Nina drives the would be-actress and writer groupie with a joyous passion that leaps across the curtain line and takes us with her on her journey of naivety, search, disillusionment and finally tragedy. In the opening scene Nina has to endure ridicule as she is forced to perform a piece of gibberish written and produced by Irina’s son Konstantin on a stage specially erected by the lake on the Sorin family estate. Konstantin, who is in love with Nina, brings down the curtain in anger and humiliation at the audience reaction. He is played with believable intensity by Jacob Williams offering us a neat ‘Noel Gallagher of his time’ approach to his work. Here is a troubled writer, who knows deep down he lacks the talent to pursue a literary career. Really his mother should be telling him to join the Russian army or something where he could let the adornment of a military frock give him the admiration he craves. Instead he is destined to alienate those around him so that they chose to avoid him whenever possible. Nina tires of Konstantin’s teeth grinding shenanigans and becomes attracted instead to her mother’s lover, the successful writer and unwitting libertine, Trigorin – he is played with a gentle modesty by John O’Neil who gets my heads up for the best speech of the first half when he beautifully describes the obsession that is unique to writers and is both their drive and their nemesis. Within the male cast two stand-out performances are given by Colin Simmonds and Dave Hill. Simmons plays the Doctor, Yevgeny Dorn by name and delivers his lines like gentle waves lapping your toes on a warm beach. Hill plays Sorin as your favourite old uncle – both actors offer up a master class in the use of pace and space. The major roles are well-supported by the minor – non moreso than John McErlean who brings a’ Stan Laurel’ moment to that art of opening a door whilst holding a bevy of suitcases and a fishing rod. Director Andrew Brooks undoubtedly understands the text but there are times when his action needs refinement. It is sometimes uncomfortably bunched together. He is not helped by an over large acting space to fill and a set and lighting which doesn’t quite gel together. Generally it is too bright and too white. I wanted to see people emerging from shadows and dark places which harmonise with the way the story peels away layers as we travel from frivolity to tragedy. The sound effects were excellent including a wonderful storm. Undoubtedly this production is well worth braving the cold night air for. If you’re new to Chekhov you’ll find it’s very accessible and if you’re a Russian romp aficionado then you’ll enjoy the passion this production offers in abundance.

Key Quotes “Balance: -$914m (Westpac f/c: -$500m, Market: -$300m) Exports: $4,403m (Westpac: $4,600m, Market: $4,800m) Imports: $5,317m (Westpac: $5,100m, Market: $5,000m) Annual balance: -$6,358m (last: -$6,106m)” “New Zealand’s trade deficit for January was much larger than expected, reaching close to a billion dollars. There was also an unusually large $158m downward revision to the December surplus. The annual deficit is now at its widest since October 2006.” “Most of the surprise was due to weaker exports, which were down 7.8% in seasonally adjusted terms.” “Imports were largely in line with our forecast, except for the purchase of a large plane worth around $200m (we expected this to be recorded in the February figures).” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

And late last week, former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and his wife Jennifer dropped $30.1 million on another penthouse, Mansion Global reported. The closings come amid several recent buys at the 33-unit condominium that started closing last September. In January, an anonymous buyer shelled out $32.4 million for a penthouse that spans roughly 4,600 square feet. The purchase price represented a 23 percent discount from its offering. But another closing that month marked one of the priciest deals to kick off the year. Another anonymous buyer, “CJFGK, LLC,” bought a duplex for just over $64 million. Other prominent buyers include James Dyson, founder of the vacuum company that bears his name, who bought a penthouse for $73.8 million. Meanwhile investment banker Ken Moelis snapped up another in November for $62 million. The developer recently moved to split the tower’s $130 million triplex penthouse in two, falling in line with other developers that have done the same in the past. The simplex’s offering price is $40 million, and the duplex’s is between $80 million and $100 million.

Bob,Diamond,2409,https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/former-barclays-boss-bob-diamond-closes-on-30m-penthouse-120936,"Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond is the latest in a long line of big names to snap up a multi-million dollar penthouse at Manhattan’s 520 Park Avenue tower, according to city records filed on Friday. Mr. Diamond, 67, had been one of the rumored buyers at the Midtown Manhattan limestone building, and he, along with his wife, Jennifer, have now closed on their $30.1 million purchase. More: Billionaire Steve Cohen Lists Second NYC Mega-Condo in a Month No details on his new condo were readily available. The tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern and developed by Zeckendorf Development, is becoming one of the most exclusive condominiums in Manhattan, as its big-ticket closings gradually reveal the host of high-net worth individuals that have bought apartments in the 54-story building. In fact, the most expensive sale in Manhattan in 2018 was in the tower, according to StreetEasy data. The $73.8 million penthouse reportedly sold to British billionaire inventor James Dyson in November. In the same month, prominent Wall Streeter Ken Moelis snapped up another penthouse in the building for $62 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile last week, a $64.25 million duplex penthouse sold at the building to an unknown buyer. From Penta: Is Whiskey a Legitimate Investing Opportunity?

It has over 15,000 square feet of amenity space, including a club room, a fitness center with a pool, exercise rooms, a treatment room, a sauna and steam rooms and a children’s playroom. Guest suites, wine cellar and storage are also available for purchase, according to the building’s website.

Assessing the employment data, “The labour market has gradually tightened over the past year, but the pace of improvement is slowing,” Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac, said. ""The Quarterly Employment Survey increased the risk of a weak December quarter GDP result.” Additionally, the risk-off environment today weighed on commodities and risk-sensitive currencies to keep the selling pressure on the kiwi intact throughout the day. On the other hand, the greenback carried its rally into a sixth day today and made it even more difficult for the pair to erase its losses. Despite a lack of fundamental drivers that could support the USD's upsurge, the US Dollar Index reached its highest level in two weeks at 96.67 with investors staying away from European currencies, which suffer from disappointing macroeconomic data releases from the euro area and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit. At the moment, the DXY is adding 0.2% on the day at 96.58.

(Photo: MCSO) A Montgomery man remained in jail Thursday facing a litany of charges following a three-day crime spree for cigarettes that began Saturday morning, according to court records. Gerald Andrew Davis, 56, faces a combined $100,500 bond on eight charges, according to court records. Davis' alleged misdeeds began about 4:40 a.m. Saturday when he ""unlawfully entered"" and took cigarettes, cigars, and headphone sets valued at $1,000 from a Dollar General on Vaughn Road in Pike Road, according to an affidavit written by a deputy with the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. Deputies charged Davis with third-degree theft and burglary in the Dollar General incident. The next day before 1:30 a.m., Davis damaged a glass door at the Legrand Star fuel station on U.S. Highway 331 and ""attempted to pry another door open to unlawfully gain entry into the business,"" according to records. After unsuccessfully breaking into the convenience store on U.S. Highway 331, Davis then moved to the Corner Store Fuel Station on Hobbie Road. There, he allegedly took more cigarettes, assorted Swisher Sweet cigars, and assorted Black and Mild cigars estimated to cost about $2,500. Davis was charged with attempted third-degree burglary, third-degree burglary and first-degree theft. On Monday, Davis allegedly entered the Trader's Island Store on Troy Highway in Pike Road between 2:40 a.m. and 2:50 a.m. and took even more tobacco products valued at $2,000. Around noon on Monday, Davis then allegedly threatened to shoot a Home Depot employee at the store on Eastern Boulevard while committing theft, according to court records. Davis put his hand in his pocket and purported to have a firearm while threatening the employee. According to an affidavit written by Montgomery Police, a welder, estimated at about $300, was damaged during the incident. Deputies subsequently charged Davis with third-degree burglary, second-degree theft, while police charged him with first-degree robbery. Davis was arrested on the eight charges on Tuesday about 1:30 p.m. Contact Montgomery Advertiser reporter Kirsten Fiscus at 334-318-1798 or KFiscus@gannett.com. Follow her on Twitter @KDFiscus

Andrew,Davis,2370,http://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/422299,"ON AIR NOW Lars Larson 12:00pm - 3:00pm Listen Live Posted: 2019-01-30 09:46:00 by Heather Roberts BEND, OR -- Bend’s newest City Council was sworn in to office, Wednesday morning, during a special meeting at City Hall. But, Chris Piper's term starts under protest by community groups, who say another candidate should’ve been chosen for the vacancy. Michael Funke was one of the organizers of a rally that took place just before the meeting, ""There was actually a huge outpouring of broad community support for another candidate, Kerani Mitchell. When I say ‘huge,’ I want to point out that City Councilor Bruce Abernethy actually told me that the amount of emails that they got in support of Kerani Mitchell was really a lot, by their standards."" He tells KBND News he opposes Piper's appointment because of what he says was undue influence by the Central Oregon Association of Realtors, Bend Chamber of Commerce and Central Oregon Builders Association. He believes Mayor Sally Russell, who initially supported Mitchell, was swayed after conversations with the business groups. Funke says it’s nothing personal, ""I don’t know Chris Piper. But, I think it’s worth pointing out that these three organizations heavily financed two candidates in the November election, Andrew Davis and Sarah McCormick; those two candidates were defeated. And now, the Council has turned around and told these three organizations that even though your candidates were rejected, we’re still going to appoint your candidate to this vacancy."" He acknowledges a rally wouldn't influence anything, in the short term, ""It’s unlikely that they’re going to change this particular appointment; we’re looking down the road. They pass up a candidate who was a person of color. It would’ve been a profound statement – a profound positive statement to people of color throughout the city, if they had chose her. And, she was very, very qualified. I would say more qualified than Chris Piper, actually.""

John,O'Neil,2412,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190205/judge-orders-temporary-halt-to-ogunquit-recall-process,"OGUNQUIT � A judge has ordered the town of Ogunquit to stop the process of scheduling a recall election for three Select Board members until legal challenges filed by a group seeking to block the recall effort are heard in court. The Select Board was slated to set the date for the recall election at Tuesday night�s board meeting. The court�s decision comes in the midst of a months long debate over the future of three members of the Board of Selectmen, Chairman Charles �Bunky� Waite, Selectwoman Madeline Mooney and Selectman Bob Winn. Residents who initiated the recall process did so following a public appeal hearing on Oct. 9 where the three board members voted to support the termination of former fire chief Mark O�Brien by Town Manager Pat Finnigan. Selectmen Rick Dolliver and John Daley voted against upholding O�Brien�s termination. O�Brien has since filed a complaint against the town in York County Superior Court appealing his firing. Four Ogunquit residents filed the lawsuit last Monday asking the court to rule on legal challenges to the recall petition process initiated by several residents from the citizen�s group Take Back Ogunquit, as well as order a temporary injunction to stop an election from being held before the court could rule on the legal challenges. York County Superior Court Judge John O�Neil granted the temporary injunction but ordered an expedited timeline. In the lawsuit, residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn asked the court to order the town to stop moving forward with the recall citing numerous problems with the way the petitions were handled by both circulators and at Town Hall. The lawsuit seeks a ruling from the Superior Court to force the recall efforts to be abandoned altogether. In his decision handed down Tuesday morning, O�Neil said that all parties agreed that the stay was not a concession by either side but rather an administrative move to allow the court ruling to come before the process moves forward. O�Neil ordered a status conference with all parties involved to be scheduled within the next week. One of the petitioners seeking the recall, Jerry DeHart, filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit in an effort to move the recall process to election. DeHart�s attorney, Leah Rachin of Bergen Parkinson law firm participated in Monday�s legal conference and said her client objected to the election not being set according to the timeline set forth in the town�s charter. In his ruling O�Neil said he will consider DeHart�s motion at the next scheduled court date. ""The court concludes that due to the nature of this dispute it has the authority to issue injunctive relief in the nature of a stay. This order does not eradicate the Charter provisions but rather places them on hold and stops the running of the clock,"" O'Neil said in his order. ""However, since the Charter has relatively expedited time frames regarding the calling of the election, the duration of this order shall be brief."" Stephen Langsdorf, an attorney for Preti Flaherty representing the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said his clients are pleased with O'Neil�s ruling. �My clients are very pleased that the court has granted a stay to allow the significant legal issues to be resolved without the possibility of canceling an election that has already been scheduled,� Langsford said in a statement. Supporters of the recall effort say the lawsuit is just a stalling tactic. Mark McLeod, representing members of Ogunquit United, an offshoot of Take Back Ogunquit, said the group intends to pursue the recall process as detailed in the town charter. On the Ogunquit United Facebook page, McLeod urged supporters of the recall effort to attend Tuesday�s Selectmen�s meeting to keep up with the process, even though no action from the board is expected.

The temporary stay issued Tuesday in York County Superior Court halted the Ogunquit Select Board from voting Tuesday night to set the date for a recall election targeting Chairman Charles “Bunky” Waite, Madeline Mooney and Robert Winn Jr. The stay was ordered in response to a lawsuit filed by residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn. The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the town from moving forward with the recall election because of what they cite as a number of problems with the recall petitions and the way the process was handled by town officials. The lawsuit seeks a temporary injunction to stop an election from being held, as well as a declaratory judgment ordering the town to take no further actions related to the recall. Justice John O’Neil wrote in the order that both parties presented to him “an agreed upon order staying town administrative proceedings related to setting up and holding the election until the court process can play out on an expedited basis.” “The court concludes that due to the nature of the dispute it has the authority to issue injunctive relief in the nature of a stay. This order does not eradicate the Charter provisions but rather places them on hold and stops the running of the clock. However, since the Charter has relatively expedited time frames regarding the calling of the election, the duration of the order shall be brief,” O’Neil wrote. The order temporarily stops all administrative proceedings related to the recall election. It also temporarily prevents the use of a provision in the town charter to have a notary call the election if the Select Board does not. A status conference will be held next week to determine a schedule to address the lawsuit.“We’re very pleased that the judge recognizes there are some significant legal issues to be resolved and it doesn’t make sense to move forward with the election while those are pending,” said Stephen Langsdorf, the Preti-Flaherty attorney who represents the plaintiffs. “It’s our goal to get this resolved as quickly as possible.” The group Take Back Ogunquit launched the effort in October to recall Waite, Mooney and Winn, all of whom had voted to uphold the town manager’s termination of the fire chief. The group later released a detailed list of complaints about the board members that accused them of a number of things, including abusing their positions by opposing a new version of the town’s Comprehensive Plan and mismanaging the termination of Fire Chief Mark O’Brien. Jerry DeHart, a member of Take Back Ogunquit who circulated recall petitions, on Monday filed a motion with the court to join the lawsuit as an intervenor. In his order, Justice O’Neil noted that the existing parties indicated they would likely have no objection to the motion, but the court will not take action on it until the next conference on the lawsuit. DeHart said Tuesday that he felt he had to rush to court so a voice for the recall would be involved in court proceedings. “We want to follow the charter. We’re the only people who seem to want to follow the charter,” he said. “We have had delay after delay from the other side. We’re very disappointed a judge has decided to get involved in the town of Ogunquit’s charter.” Town Clerk Chris Murphy determined the petitions contained 257 valid signatures to recall Mooney, 259 signatures to recall Waite and 253 signatures to recall Winn. Take Back Ogunquit was required to submit 215 signatures for each Select Board member it seeks to recall. Under the town charter, the Select Board had until Tuesday to set the date for the election. After Murphy certified the petitions, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, who are all members of the Ogunquit Residents Alliance, filed the lawsuit to stop the election. According to the lawsuit, the town clerk issued more petition forms than allowed under the town charter and the person who prepared the affidavit attached to each petition was not a registered voter. The lawsuit also alleges Murphy and the town’s deputy clerk signed a circulator’s oath on the petition left at Town Hall even though they did not personally witness each signature. A petition form left at the clerk’s window was also inadvertently taken from Town Hall by a resident and the clerk cannot confirm that no additional signatures were added during that time, according to the lawsuit. 6 Digital Drive, Biddeford, Maine 04005 (207) 282-1535 jtcommunity@journaltribune.com Our Hometown DMCA NoticesNewspaper web site content management software and services

Michael Gordon Cox, a 52-year-old man who lives on Sandidge Hollow Road in Surgoinsville, didn’t wait for an indictment. He pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with four counts of voter fraud. Criminal Court Judge John F. Dugger imposed a $4,000 fine. When Cox registered to vote in 2015, he did not disclose he had been convicted in Pennsylvania three incest-related crimes and 27 counts of indecent exposure in 1994, according to Teddy Collingsworth, a criminal investigator with the district attorney’s office. Cox voted in an election in 2015, two elections in 2016 and a fourth election last year, according to Collingsworth, who says Cox left Pennsylvania for Tennessee shortly after he was released from prison. “I think he just wanted to get out of the state,” Collingsworth said this morning. When Cox was convicted of the sex crimes a quarter-century ago, Pennsylvania law did not require that he register with local law enforcement as a sex offender, according to the criminal investigator. He says Donna Sharp, register-at-large for the Hawkins County Election Commission, learned Cox was a convicted felon and notified law enforcement in September 2018. Cox has been working for the Shepherd’s Center, a Rogersville-based Christian housing ministry and thrift store, according to Collingsworth, who says part of Cox’s responsibilities involved securing housing for young people who helped renovate substandard housing.

Market data services specialist MDX Technology has become the first real-time market data distributor to join the institutional investment ecosystem established by OpenFin. The move allows clients of OpenFin, which provides application-agnostic operating systems created specifically for finance, to consume multi-vendor data feeds and connect desktop applications to various real-time market data feeds through a single API, for uniformed access to data. “As a market data connector, [MDX Technology] is able to offer the growing number of companies in our ecosystem – including buy-side, sell-side firms and vendors – real choice in the data consumed by their desktop applications. Data is distributed directly to web applications and app builders can now subscribe to market data via MDXT through the OpenFin Services framework,” said Steven Wood, global head of enterprise deployment at OpenFin, and Deutsche Bank’s former global head of market data services. OpenFin added that due to the application interoperability of all desktop applications built on its operating system, the ecosystem of institutional investors and FinTech firms operating on OpenFin can consume entitled and controlled data from all of the major third-party providers via MDX Technology. “By making our extensive library of market data interfaces available via the OpenFin operating system, MDXT opens up access to a wider potential audience of OpenFin users requiring market data in their applications,” Richard Gissing, chief technology officer at MDX Technology, commented. Last month, OpenFin provided US-based block trading venue Luminex Trading & Analytics with technology to upgrade its platform to allow for future updates with minimal disruption to users.

Michael,Gordon,2363,https://www.orilliamatters.com/local-news/channel-cats-get-150k-grant-for-new-equipment-1213610,"Sign In Register The Orillia Channel Cats Swim Club is diving deeper into the 21st century thanks to a hefty grant. The club recently learned it will receive a $150,000 capital grant from the Ontario Trillium Foundation. The money will be used to purchase electronic timing and scoreboard equipment that will be installed in the new recreation centre. “It’s super-exciting news and a great success for the Channel Cats,” said Michael Gordon, the club’s treasurer. The Channel Cats have been swimming at the YMCA for years, and they’ve had to take portable timing equipment with them. Also, the pool lanes at the YMCA aren’t long enough to accommodate the touch pads that provide the most accurate results for swimmers. The lanes at the recreation centre will be. “Without that, and without the capacity that the new facility has, we’re not really able to host any substantial swim meets in Orillia,” Gordon said. “If you don’t have touch pads and the electronic timing equipment, it’s not the same.” The swimmers are excited about the new equipment, including the “enormous video display scoreboard,” Gordon said of the five-by-three-metre board. It won’t be used only for competition, but also for training and during time trials. The Channel Cats and the City of Orillia collaborated on the grant application, and there will be opportunities for members of the public to get some use out of the new scoreboard — which is much more than a scoreboard. “It’s basically a TV screen,” Gordon said, adding one idea being considered is a “float and flick night,” when people could float on tubes in the pool and watch a movie. The Channel Cats aimed high and applied for the maximum amount. “The project is over $200,000. We thought it was very worthwhile,” Gordon said. The club has been planning for the upgrade, knowing new equipment would be needed for when it starts calling the recreation centre home, so it has been saving money. It is also considering some fundraising options. About the Author: Nathan Taylor So, where are you from? Vote Results > Archives > © 2019 OrilliaMatters.com

Michael,Gordon,2425,https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/24597/new-zealand-dollar-suffers-single-worst-day-in-more-than-a-year-after-weak-nz-employment-report.html,"The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) remained on the back foot through Thursday’s session. The GBP to NZD exchange rate hit an overnight one-week high of NZ$1.92469 and was last seen trading at NZ$1.91444. Against the US Dollar (USD/$), price action was more subdued with the NZD sliding marginally through Thursday before edging higher against the Greenback into Friday. - New Zealand dollar tumbles 60 pips in seconds - Quarterly employment change posts meagre 0.1% change - Unemployment rate misses forecast, prints 4.3% - Labour costs growth slows to 0.5% The New Zealand Dollar’s had a rough time in recent session, first tracking the Australian Dollar’s declines then coming under further pressure in the wake of underwhelming labour market statistics prompting some of the largest intra-day Kiwi depreciation in over a year. The Pound Sterling to New Zealand Dollar (GBPNZD) exchange rate spiked 0.86% in the five minutes immediately following the labour market data release seeing out Wednesday’s session up 1.66%. Against the US Dollar, the Kiwi declined markedly with the NZD/USD x-rate ending the session down 1.74% and extending declines into Thursday trading. The change in quarterly employment fell sharply from a previous 1.0%, missing forecasts of a 0.3% increase in the employment rate and printed a meagre 0.1% rise in employment. Meanwhile the unemployment rate edged higher, printing 4.3% in contrast to forecasts of 4.1%. Rounding off the trio of misses, the labour cost index release - which tracks the change in price that businesses pay for labour (excluding overtime) and is seen as a leading indicator of consumer inflation - edged lower, printing a quarterly change of 0.5%. Senior Westpac economist, Michael Gordon, commented on the implications the latest data holds for Q4 2018 growth, “The figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year… oft jobs growth and hours worked increase the risk of another weak economic print in the December quarter.” Commenting on the market reaction to the labour stats, BK Asset Management’s managing director of curreny strategy, Kathy Lien, commented “Today was also the single worst day for the New Zealand dollar in more than a year. NZD had been following AUD but lost 60 pips in a matter of seconds following a significantly weaker than expected employment report.” Regarding the data itself, Lien added “Economists had been looking for the unemployment rate to rise from 3.9% to 4.1% but instead it rose to 4.3% from an upwardly revised 4% reading. Employment increased less than expected and the participation rate declined in Q4. Average hourly earnings growth also slowed to 1% from 1.4%.” Lien went on to note that “Although dairy prices rebounded today, this report validates the central bank's decision to keep interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future."" The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is due to hold their first monetary policy meeting of 2019 next week with market participants expecting the central bank to adopt a dovish stance. Elsewhere, chief strategist and head of education at ACLS Global, Marshall Gittler wrote, “Tuesday the AUD collapsed, yesterday it was the turn of NZD. The currency gradually weakened during most of the trading day, then fell off the proverbial cliff when the employment data came out.” In terms of rates prospects, Gittler added his expectation for a dovish stance and noted market pricing now implied a rising expectation of a cut to rates later in the year. Gittler wrote, “The report sets up a dovish background for next Wednesday’s Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) meeting. The market previously accorded no chance at all to a rate hike anyway, but now it’s pricing in a 50% chance of a rate cut by November.""

Netflix has cancelled the sci-fi series Travelersstarring Eric McCormack ( Will & Grace )after three seasons, Deadline noted. ""A lot of you have been asking about the possibility of a season four, but many of you have been saying, 'Look, if this is it, what a moving and surprising and profound ending it is,'"" McCormack tweeted.

Katz, the brother of out Broadway star Joel Grey, was the victim of burglars who allegedly used an SUV to bust through security gates and steal $300,000 from his Los Angeles mansion, The New York Daily News reported. The burglars apparently used the SUV like a battering ram on the massive gates protecting the estimated $15 million Holmby Hills estate and then made off with a 1,000-pound, second-floor safe containing the $300,000 in cash and jewelry. Katz made his fortune with technological innovations in the areas of computer telephone integration and speech recognition.

During the extraordinary interview with the Independent ( UK ), he placed air quotes around the offending words and expressed shame for his behaviorbut, even for an actor known for not mincing words, the comments will raise eyebrows. Neeson said, in part, ""I'm ashamed to say that, and I did it for maybe a weekhoping some [air quotes with his fingers] 'black b*st*rd' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him."" In a follow-up interview on GMA, Neeson denied being racist, but explained that he felt a ""primal urge to lash out"" after learning about the decades-old incident, Deadline noted.

Louisa Moritzan actress who appeared in the classic film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and who was among those accusing Bill Cosby of sexual assaulthas died from a longstanding heart ailment at age 72, Deadline noted.

Andrew,Davis,2366,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SAVOR-Publican-Quality-Meats-Banchet-Awards/65311.html,"That's because Publicanfrom One Off Hospitality Group, which is behind an impressive array of spots, including Blackbird, avec, The Violet Hour and Publican Ankeris a combination butcher shop, neighborhood cafe, bakery and gourmet market. The look is intriguing, as one goes by a selection of meats to sit at communal tables ( which I have mixed feelings about ) situated next to display cases from which patrons can purchase items ranging from duck fat to butterscotch soda. However, I wasn't there to buy salami or beef heart by the pound ( at least on this day ); it was all about what the cafe offersand there's something to everyone's liking. That includes libations, which range from the aforementioned soda to beer/wine to a lengthy list of coffee-related drinks ( necessary during this frigid weather ). Starters at PQM include sweet-potato soup ( tasty but a little thin, even with pomegranate molasses ), turkey chili verde, pozole rojo ( with pork shoulder, guajillo chili, hominy, cabbage, radish and cilantro ), You've Got Salad ( evident from the name ) and The Beet Goes On ( a beet dish with smoked whitefish on rye bread ). A lot of people go to this spot for the sandwiches, and it's easy to understand why. My Parm #2 ( breaded chicken cutlet, basil tomato sauce, fried sage and mozzarella on a sesame roll ) was a solid choice. However, you may opt for sandwiches like Tom's Silver Medal ( spicy capicola, lonza cotto, ham, provolone, pickled peppers, piperade and aioli on a hoagie roll ) or Hot Guts ( steeped in Southern tradition ). However, despite the spot's name, PQM has several vegetarian options. They include sandwiches like the Broccoli Crue ( charred broccoli, piperade, sundried tomato, almond aillade, calabrian chile aioli and gouda on naan ) and the BGS ( the manager's initials, and it contains crispy falafel, red curry soubise, urfa yogurt, fennel, pickled cauliflower and gem lettuce on a potato bun ). Also, there are the previously mentioned salad and sweet-potato soup. Also, sides include marinated kale. ( I skipped this, but don't let me stop you. ) And please don't skip out on desserts. Up front is a tantalizing selection of sweets, such as gooey ( gluten-free ) chocolate-chip cookies, oatmeal pies and cupcakes. By the way, PQM is also open on weekends, with Butcher's Breakfast and the Brunch Burger offered alongside the usual sandwiches. I'll have to stop by again. There's one caveat, though: PQM closes at 5 p.m. during the week and Sundays ( 6 p.m. on Saturdays )which means there's only a limited time each day to enjoy this spot's delightful items. Jean Banchet Awards On Jan. 13, more than 400 culinary enthusiasts gathered last night at Venue Six10for the 2019 Jean Banchet Awards. Presented by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Jean Banchet Awards for Culinary Excellence are the only Chicago-based awards ceremony that recognize culinary originality and talent throughout the region.

The “a capella” ensemble, made up of Fisk University students has been around since 1871 and continues to inspire captive audiences today. The singers broke barriers, and carry on a lasting tradition. Inside the rehearsal room on the campus of Fisk University, members of the Fisk Jubilee Singers fine tune their instruments. Andrew Davis, a tenor with the group said, “It feels amazing to be a part of it. I feel a whole plethora of emotions when I walk into rehearsals, when I walk on stage.” Back in 1871, the original Fisk Jubilee Singers introduced “slave songs” to the world. They broke racial barriers in the U.S. and abroad, entertaining kings and queens in Europe -- including Queen Victoria in 1873. Fisk historian Dr. Reavis Mitchell said, “(Queen Victoria) said, ‘who are these young people? Their voices are magical, where are they from?’ She reportedly was told they are from Fisk school in Nashville. And she said, 'I don't know this Nashville, but it most certainly be a musical place."" The original ensemble were pioneers in many ways. “They are also one of the first groups to use music as a way of really large fundraising,” Mitchell explains. “(They) eventually ended up in Carnegie Hall. People wouldn't give them places to stay. Restaurants wouldn't allow them to come in and eat. It was still a racially charged country. They're really on the front lines of changing America’s perception of the African American. Mitchell says the singers are ultimately students. “What we're most proud of, is they're among the best academic students,” said Mitchell. “These students don't come to Fisk to sing. They end up singing, they come to be educated in a Fisk tradition.” For the students, the enormity of the ensemble isn't lost on them. “It means, upholding an entity that's bigger than you,” Davis said. “There's an idea of always trying to know my history, but also it keeps me humble.” Soprano Cortney Towns said, “Being a part of the Fisk Jubilee Singers is more than you. You are literally part of history. You have to look at the bigger picture.” “We are ministering, not necessarily performing, but ministering to people and touching the hearts of people,” she said. In 2008, the Fisk Jubilee Singers were selected as a recipient of the National Medal of Arts, the nation's highest honor for artists and patrons of the arts.

EMORY, Va. – The players on the Emory & Henry women’s basketball team excel in one subject. “Our chemistry is off the charts,” senior guard Chloe Harris said. “We’re all working together to get that conference championship ring.” The Wasps aced another test Wednesday with a 67-51 decision over the Roanoke College Maroons at Bob Johnson Court. E&H advanced to the Old Dominion Athletic Conference tournament championship last season before falling to Randolph-Macon. The Wasps (19-3, 12-3) currently trail only Guilford (17-5, 14-2) in the conference standings. The Wasps, who were ranked among the top 20 NCAA Division III teams early this season, earned their eighth straight win Wednesday behind a flawless start. Ignited by pressure defense and finishes in transition, E&H grabbed a 17-0 first quarter advantage. “It doesn’t matter what opponent we’re facing,” Harris said. “We know where each other is going to be on the court and we know what each of our strengths are. We hit the floor in fourth gear and we will run you right to the bus.” A total of 11 players scored for E&H, with record-setting 6-foot-1 senior forward Taylor Blevins delivering 19 points and six rebounds. The Wasps extended the advantage to 29 points with 7:09 left in the third quarter as Roanoke (15-8, 8-8) was doomed by 23 turnovers. “It’s always our goal to come strong like we did tonight,” said &H junior forward Sydney McKinney, who supply six points, five rebounds and four steals. “We’ve all been playing together for years and everyone on our team has talent.” E&H finished with 16 assists and 26 fast break points while shooting 51 percent from the field. According to E&H head coach Anne Crutchfield, the Wasps take delight in spreading the wealth. “One of the core values of our program is service,” Crutchfield said. “We always talk about what we can do to make our teammates better, and that mindset carries over to everything we do. Sometimes, we’re too unselfish.” Crutchfield instills that pride in service early, as each freshman is assigned an older player as a mentor. “And our upperclassman embrace that role on the court, in the classroom and around campus,” Crutchfield said. Humility is another hallmark for E&H basketball. Crutchfield said the Wasps gain daily inspiration for seven-year Abingdon resident Ellee Large, who is undergoing treatment for leukemia. Large often watches games from the E&H bench and has her own Wasps uniform. “Ellee keeps us grounded as to what’s important in life,” Crutchfield said. E&H travels to Randolph Saturday before finishing the regular season with a pair of ODAC home games on Feb. 13 and 16. ‘We couldn’t find our rhythm at times this season, but I hope we’re gonna peak at the right time. This a special group that deserves success,” Crutchfield said. Harris, who supplied seven points and four assists Wednesday, is anxious for more Chemistry 101 classes as the ODAC tournament approaches on Feb. 19. “We’re all just the best of friends and we’re playing the sport that we love to play,” Harris said. “What’s better than that?” MEN Randolph 84, Emory & Henry 76 A six-game winning streak for E&H was halted in the late game by the youthful and athletic Wildcats. After trailing throughout the first half, the Wasps (15-7, 8-5) faced a 20-point deficit with 14:27 left in the game. The Wildcats managed to frustrate the Wasps with an aggressive man-to-man defense and fluid execution of offense. “[Randolph] had a really good plan and played really hard. We didn’t create for each other enough and we didn’t play with enough focus to compete,” E&H coach David Willson said. Behind the offensive creativity of 6-foot sophomore guard Tharon Suggs (28 points), 6-6 senior forward Alic Wynn (16 points, 14 rebounds) and 6-2 junior guard Daniel Spencer (15 points, seven rebounds, five steals), E&H sliced its deficit to 77-73 with 1:13 left on a 3-pointer by Suggs. Randolph (10-12, 5-8) iced the game with steady free throw shooting. The Wasps committed 13 turnovers against just nine assists while Randolph earned a 29-6 edge in bench scoring and 42-31 advantage in rebounding. Six-foot-seven senior post Andrew Davis did not play for E&H. “I thought the one positive was that our guys kept fighting and gave themselves a chance at the end, but it’s hard to win when you don’t play up to your capability for 30 minutes,” Willson said. Three players reached double figures for Randolph, which has just three seniors on its 18-man roster. agregory@bristolnews.com | Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports | (276) 645-2544 Whenever Allen Gregory posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 3:33 pm RACINE—David Carl Bidstrup (age 87) was taken into God’s arms on Monday, February 4, 2019 from Ascension All Saints Hospital. David’s life was one of gifts received and gifts shared. David was born March 21, 1931 to Emil and Clara Bidstrup in Racine, WI. He grew up with his older sister Marcella (Nielsen). David graduated from Park High School in 1950. After a brief employment at SC Johnson, David served his country as a member of the Marine Corps. Following his discharge he returned to school, attending Dana College in Blair, NE. While serving as a photographer for the school, he had the good fortune of being asked to photograph incoming freshman students. One of them was Betty Christensen from Green Bay. She learned that David was also from Wisconsin and arranged a ride back with him at the end of the term. This was the beginning of a life long journey together. They were married August 10, 1957. David graduated in 1958 and they remained in Blair as he was employed by the college. Their first child, Kären, was born while they were living in Blair. They moved to Racine in 1961 after David took a job with the Racine School District. David became the Director of Buildings and Grounds shortly thereafter (a position he held until his retirement in 1989). Their family then grew with the additions of Karla and Kai. The family was active in the Lutheran Church of the Resurrection. David served as a trustee and frequent volunteer. He was also a member of Kiwanis. One of the many gifts David was grateful for was the kidney he received from his daughter Kären in 2000. It gave him renewed health and 18 more years to enjoy his family. His hobbies produced heirloom items that are owned by many, and are used weekly by his church family. His woodworking skills produced both beautiful furniture and artfully turned pieces. His braided rugs softened hard floors for many feet. His 700+ quilt tops were turned into complete quilts by the women of the church, and have been distributed worldwide through Lutheran World Relief. But the greatest gift he shared was his quiet, gentle approach to marriage and parenting. He will be dearly missed by his family: wife Betty, children Kären Gueldenzopf (Robert), Karla Bidstrup, Kai Bidstrup (Susan), grandchildren Carly Griffis (Nic), Evan Spencer, Elizabeth Bidstrup, Margaret Bidstrup, and great grandchildren Audrey Davis, Andrew Davis, Rose Griffis and Luke Griffis. David was looking forward to the glories of heaven, including seeing his grandson Aaron Davis (Ana) who preceded him in death. He greatly enjoyed both the love he was shown by his many nieces and nephews and the time he spent with friends. A celebration of David’s life will be held at 2:00 pm on Saturday, February 9 at the Lutheran Church of the Resurrection, 322 Ohio Street, Racine, Wi 53405. Visitation will be held from Noon—2:00pm preceding the funeral. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to the Lutheran Church of the Resurrection, for facility maintenance.

Bob,Diamond,2371,https://news.efinancialcareers.com/be-en/332912/roger-jenkins-barclays-bonus,"by Daniel Davies 29 January 2019 If you're looking for gems of insight into what goes on at the very top levels of a slightly dysfunctional investment bank when the pressure is on, the Barclays trial is a trove of treasures. One of the clearest takeaways is that the very richest of the rich bankers get that way because, as well as going the extra mile to get key transactions done, they never lose sight of the need to make sure they get paid themselves. In the immediate aftermath of the shareholder vote approving the controversial Qatar investment, BarCap’s Roger Jenkins sent a stream of consciousness internal email making his case and divulging the inner workings of his brain. It’s possible to piece together the whole text from various news reports: “So vote goes thru. This capital did the trick why can’t varley diamond go to renco and say we need to make a special payment for this endeavour now. It was not his job no one else in the organization or at any other bank except credit suisse did this. Did it four times this year to save our arses and jobs guys you know the sell! If not what is the plan” There’s a lot to decipher here; Mr Jenkins was clearly from the school of thought that saw email as an informal means of communication. But the context makes it clear and pretty easy to translate. The message is topped and tailed with the request for action “Why can’t [John] Varley [and Bob] Diamond go to Renco [typo for RemCo, the remuneration committee]” leads to “Guys, you know the sell! If not, what is the plan?” This will be familiar to a lot of us – Jenkins is writing to his immediate boss, Rich Ricci, and asking him to enlist the two even bigger bosses in making a case (the “sell”) for him to the committee that makes the decisions about his pay. Since Bob Diamond was the overall head of Barclays Capital and John Varley the group CEO, this is interesting in itself as it suggests that the committee was not a rubber stamp and needed to be persuaded; at this level, the bonus cheques are so big that even the chief executive can’t sign them off on his own. In between the two, we have some standard-issue banker boasting which will also be recognised, in style if not in size, by many. Big up your successes - “save[d] our arses and jobs”. Make comparisons to the competition, both external – “any other bank except Credit Suisse” and internal – “no one else in the organisation”. The only slightly false note is “It was not his [that is, Robert Jenkins’] job”. If you’re a middle ranking VP then it’s OK to point out when you’re going outside your role and title, but at this level of seniority one might have expected that people might see the big picture and volunteer to work on survival capital issues to save the whole bank without demanding extra credit for doing so. In any case, it appears that RemCo accepted the “sell” and a “special payment for this endeavour” was made, of £25m (around $40m at the prevailing rate). It’s quite unusual for an individual banker to be given a special commission on a single deal, outside the normal bonus cycle. But then, nothing about the Barclays/Qatar transaction seems to have been normal. The situation between Andrea Orcel and Santander is also a long way from normal. The latest development seems to be that he is considering suing the bank for his lost UBS compensation. At the time when the job move first fell through, many of us were surprised that Orcel seemed to have made the elementary mistake of resigning without having established all the remuneration details in writing, but it appears that he was in possession of a contractual letter and therefore believes himself to have a strong case. Even so, this is an unusual move and a rather paradoxical one. The main reason to sue would be that Mr Orcel expects to take another job in banking; otherwise, consistent with the non-compete details of the UBS deferred compensation scheme, he could sit at home and collect the money, without paying lawyers’ fees. Then again, if he wants to get another banking job, employers are likely to be put off someone who brings litigators into an HR dispute, particularly when the party that they’re suing is that single biggest client relationship on which their investment banking career was based. Perhaps he intends to use the lawsuit proceeds to start up Orcel & Co? Where do you go to from the top levels of investment banking? Sometimes, into the top levels of executive recruitment.

Sara,Burns,2441,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/sara-burns-fredericton-grimross-brewing-1.5012037,"A Fredericton brewery has created a beer to honour a Fredericton police officer killed in the line of duty. Const. Sara Burns was one of four people killed in a shooting outside an apartment building last August. Grimross co-owner Stephen Dixon felt the way many others did in the days following Aug. 10. He was shocked but looking for some way to help. ""I wanted to do something. I didn't know what else do to."" He turned to what he knows best — brewing beer. He collaborated with the graphic artists at Ginger Design and James Ponting, the co-owner of Craft Coast Canning, to come up with the brew they're calling Grimsby. The pale ale is named after the constable's beloved racehorse, packaged in her favourite colour — yellow. It also tells Burns's story on the side of the can. To honour her memory, Burns's family has established the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund through the Fredericton Community Foundation. The fund will support mental health and wellness, women facing violence, adult continued education to ""make our community a safe place to live in. … All things that were important to Sara,"" the can says. ""It's community stepping up to help other people and we're just one of the channels among many that are helping to make this happen,"" Dixon said. All proceeds from the beer will go to charity. A day after the beer launched, more than a third of the batch is sold, Dixon said. Steven Burns said the gesture in honour of his wife has been overwhelming. ""It just gives you strength. It's very comforting. I mean, my boys have seen it and they asked me 'Why are all these people doing this?' And I said it's because they care. And it's just the type of community that we live in."" NB Liquor is giving up its cut of the sales, meaning every penny from every Grimsby sold goes directly to the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund.

The principal of Exmouth Community College has apologised to parents who were told about a temporary school closure 10 minutes before classes were due to start. Some mums and dads were told by text message at around 8.20am the community college would be closed until 11.20am on Friday morning (February 1), following wide-spread snow across Devon overnight. Classes were due to start at 8.30am, meaning some pupils were turning up for school without knowing about the near two-hour delay. Some parents claimed their children were being turned away at the school gates, a claim principal Andrew Davis has since denied. Mr Davis apologised to parents for the late notice and said it only became clear at shortly before 8am that the school was not going to have enough staff to supervise the pupils. Exmouth mum Michelle Germain said: “The thing most of us parents are annoyed with is we got a text just after 8am and many had already gone to school, via walking, lifts or buses – not great communication.” In a statement, Mr Davis said: “We were fully intending to open today since the weather in Exmouth was fine and I am very mindful of the burden that closing the school places on parents and carers. “That decision was dependent on the school site being safe in terms of snow and ice and having enough staff able to get to school so that students could be supervised safely. “It became clear as staff started their journeys to school that there were large numbers who were going to be late due to either snow and ice, traffic, or both. “Unfortunately the numbers of staff affected by this only became apparent shortly before 8am. “We made in clear that students on their way in, already in or on buses would be supervised by the staff that had arrived on site. “Can I please reassure all parents and carers that no students were turned away from the school at any point during the morning. “In fact we had staff out in Phear Park and the surrounding area to make sure all students were either safely in school or at home.” Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.

Michael,Gordon,2382,https://www.smh.com.au/national/victoria/crossing-the-channel-for-a-journalist-who-bridged-worlds-20190201-p50v3q.html,"At high tide, 4.15pm next Saturday, Scott Gordon and a number of his friends will line up on the fine sand at San Remo to swim the narrow Phillip Island channel in memory of his late father, the celebrated journalist Michael Gordon. The local surf club's Channel Challenge is a 550-metre swim across the channel that separates the island from the mainland, followed by a two-kilometre run back over the bridge into town. The men's winner will receive the Michael Gordon Trophy, in honour of the avid ocean swimmer, surfer and political-humanitarian journo, whose death in a Phillip Island ocean swim on February 3 last year saddened and stunned an eclectic coalition of media, politicians, Indigenous leaders, refugee advocates, the Hawthorn Football Club and fellow surfers. Friends who regularly competed with Michael Gordon training for the big event at San Remo.Credit:Justin McManus “A bunch of mates are getting involved this year and we'll definitely be thinking of Micky as we do it,” said Scott Gordon. “It was one of Micky's highlights of the year, the Channel Challenge.” Micky suffered a heart attack about 150 metres from shore during what turned out to be the final Philip Island Classic ocean swim at nearby Woolamai. He was pulled from the water by surf lifesavers and given CPR at length, but he couldn't be revived on shore, an outcome that was tragically repeated in last month's Pier to Pub swim with a 65-year-old man. Micky was 62. If this was too young – and more so for a man with Michael Gordon's ceaseless vitality – it was also noted by friends that he died doing something he loved, “in the ocean and with the sun at his back”. The demise of that 1.2-kilometre ocean swim was not connected to Gordon's passing, but the race organisers, the Woolamai Beach Surf Life Saving Club – in consultation with Micky's family and local mates – decided that it would be fitting if Gordon was commemorated by the winner of their aquathon Challenge race, the first of which was swum, run and won by Gordon in 1986. Michael Gordon on assignment at Uluru in May 2017. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen In that first, almost experimental race, he was the first among 60 competitors. Next weekend, there will be 10 times that number swimming the channel during a fleeting 20-minute window when the tide is right. This week, as the anniversary of his father's death beckoned, Scott Gordon recalled how his dad's competitive streak was such that, when he couldn't find his running shoes (they are left on shore in a specified spot for each Challenge competitor), he ran the two kilometres across the bridge barefoot on a 30-degree day. Feet scorched, Micky finished the race and was found later in the first-aid tent. The race organiser, Ron Nicholson, another of Micky's diverse group of friends, recalled that in their last conversation Micky had expressed the wish that he would one day do a channel race with a grandson. Nicholson, who used to share a post-race beer with Micky, said many of Gordon's friends – some “crusty old surfers” – would do the Challenge next weekend “with the aim of dedicating their effort to the memory of the man they loved and admired”. The life of journalist Michael Gordon will be honoured at the 2019 San Remo Channel Challenge.

The Melbourne Press Club, with the backing of The Age's then publisher Fairfax (now absorbed by Nine), is honouring Gordon's memory by creating the Michael Gordon Journalism Fellowships to fund reporting on areas such as Indigenous affairs, human rights, migration policy and international development. Like the footy team he followed and chronicled (he was Hawthorn's biographer), the surf and that 550-metre swim across the channel, these lofty issues were among Michael Gordon's many passions.

Greenwich Department of Parking Services Director Rita Azrelyant speaks with local business owners and residents in the Byram section of Greenwich on Sept. 6, 2017. She was dismissed and the position was GREENWICH — Starting Friday, the town’s embattled Department of Parking Services will once again be under the authority of the Greenwich Police Department. Parking service was rocked by the April 2017 arrest of account clerk Michael Gordon, who was charged with stealing money from the department through “an elaborate series of fraudulent transactions.” In November 2017, the town dismissed Parking Services Director Rita Azrelyant. She was never replaced, and the future of the parking services department had been under review since then. Under the changes announced Thursday, the Department of Parking Services will report directly to Deputy Police Chief Mark Marino, First Selectman Peter Tesei said. “I am very excited about this organizational change,” Tesei said in a statement. “With the proper internal controls in place, a change in reporting structure is the next step. The Police Department and Parking Services share many operational similarities with enforcement and direct engagement with the public. Alignment with the Police Department will allow for greater synergies with parking management and enforcement.” After Azrelyant’s dismissal, Tesei brought in independent consultant SP Plus to review the department’s policies. The changes announced Thursday came after a their reivew. Tesei also praised Ron Lalli, a former risk manager and internal auditor for the town who has been working as an external consultant looking into cash-handling and ticket-voiding procedures in the department. Since August, SP Plus has made several visits to the town to review parking services operations, processes, policies and staff assignments. It also assisted with the implementation of the new security procedures after Gordon’s arrest. It was never fully ascertained how much Gordon stole from the department. But when he agreed to a plea deal in State Superior Court, he had paid back $4,000 to settle the two felony charges against him. A 2017 internal audit, released after Gordon’s arrest, called the department’s internal controls “inadequate to nonexistent” for handling cash. The audit, which covered 2012 to 2016, found problems that predated Azrelyant’s tenure and recommended more security and oversight of employees. The town has since changed the department’s cash-handling procedures and ended its voiding practices for tickets. It also put in place more stringent financial controls to improve security and accountability as well as more automation and technological advances. Last March, Azrelyant filed a lawsuit against the town, claiming that she was unfairly fired and that Tesei and Town Administrator Ben Branyan retaliated against her for trying to speak out about issues inside the parking department. In her suit, Azrelyant said she took her concerns to Lalli as well as other “appropriate individuals” in town government but was “punished for her efforts to address important issues regarding the public finances of the town and malfeasance by town employees.” Tesei and Branyan have called Azrelyant’s claims “patently false.” Her lawsuit could be go for jury selection and a trial in August in state Superior Court. At the time of her dismissal, Tesei did not criticize Azrelyant’s job performance and said the position was being phased out, which Thursday’s announcement made official. The Parking Services Department was once part of the police department. Longtime residents can likely can recall paying parking tickets at the police station. In 2004, under then-First Selectman James Lash, the department was separated from the police and shifted to Town Hall. “Assuming this additional responsibility is certainly in keeping with our long-standing commitment to community policing,” Chief of Police James Heavey said. “Having Parking Services as part of the Police Department will also provide a number of efficiencies for the operation while also improving service results for our residents and visitors to town.” Marino said, “I have had an opportunity to work with some of the Parking Services staff and look forward to building upon a strong team to enhance customer service and provide a better parking experience for the public.” There are no immediate plans to move the Parking Services Department, which is behind the Town Hall main building, to the Public Safety Complex. But that option could be explored “in the future,” Tesei’s office said. The hours at the counter could be adjusted. The location for parking ticket appeals, which are held in Town Hall, could also be changed. “All the changes will have a goal of enhancing customer service,” Tesei’s office said. kborsuk@greenwichtime.com

Michael,Gordon,2438,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/02/09/stat-attack-spinal-adjustment-on-the-cards-for-bottom-eight-sides/,"STATS There are more than twice as many playmaker changes for sides that finished outside the top eight in 2018 than for those that made the finals, but how detrimental are spine changes to a team's hopes of making the playoffs? Conventional wisdom would have it that a settled playmaking roster is a big advantage, with new combinations usually taking a while to gel. However, crunching the numbers for the past two seasons, NRL.com Stats shows the more settled sides heading into 2018 actually performed more poorly while the teams that finished in last year's finals series on average had more changes in key positions. Further, there was a strong relationship between teams making the most changes improving their ladder finish compared to 2017, with the more settled spines dropping down the ladder. The four teams that finished on equal-most ladder points in 2018 – the Roosters, Storm, Rabbitohs and Sharks – averaged just over one change per team with the Roosters bringing in James Tedesco and Cooper Cronk for Michael Gordon and Mitch Pearce, while the Storm had to replace Cronk with a rotating cast before settling on Brodie Croft, the Bunnies switching from a two-hooker policy led by Robbie Farah to Damien Cook as sole dummy half, and the Sharks replacing James Maloney with Matt Moylan. However the next four teams on the ladder – the Panthers, Broncos, Dragons and Warriors – averaged almost two changes per team, largely due to major (and in part injury-affected) upheaval at Penrith. The next four sides – Wests Tigers, Canberra, Newcastle and Canterbury – averaged two spine changes per club with a settled Canberra the odd team out while the other three were almost unrecognisable from 2017. The bottom four sides – North Queensland, Gold Coast, Manly and Parramatta – were the most settled of all 16 clubs. The Eels, almost inexplicably, dropped 12 ladder spots from 2017 with the same spine that guided them to the top four a season earlier while the Cowboys also had no changes to their preferred spine (though they did have to deal with a long-term injury to Michael Morgan mid-season). Manly had to replace five-eighth Blake Green and the Titans fullback Jarryd Hayne, but in all there were just two changes for an average of 0.5. The top eight averaged 1.5 spine changes per club while the bottom eight was slightly more settled at 1.25 per club. Interestingly, of the six clubs with two or more spine changes, all improved their ladder finish in 2018 compared to 2017 other than Canterbury, who dropped just one spot but had ongoing upheaval throughout the season with Moses Mbye departing and Kieran Foran getting injured. Newcastle and Wests Tigers each made three changes and improved five spots while the Panthers also had three changes and rejoined the finals zone. The two teams who entered 2018 with an unchanged spine from the previous year, Canberra and Parramatta, were both winless after four rounds and while Canberra ended up matching 2017's 10th-place finish, the Eels dropped 12 spots from fourth to 16th. Of course, the quality of players coming and going from each playmaking roster will have a far bigger influence over a club's success than the total number of changes. The teams that either improved markedly from the previous year (Souths, Warriors, Wests Tigers, Newcastle) or performed strongly (Roosters, Storm, Sharks) had high-calibre performers either join or remain in the spine. The Roosters are a good example - they had two significant spine changes and they did have a settling in period, going 4-4 through the opening eight rounds before finding their groove. But with a superstar spine they were bound to click and duly did. Melbourne's 2017 line-up of Billy Slater, Cameron Munster, Cooper Cronk and Cameron Smith had both quality and continuity on their side. Cronulla a year earlier found James Maloney to be the missing ingredient with Ben Barba, Chad Townsend and Michael Ennis. The 2015 Cowboys had both quality and continuity on their side, the Bunnies in 2014 found Luke Keary to be the missing ingredient (though they had to also overcome a one-game ban to hooker Issac Luke for the grand final). Going back to 2007 there were three grand final wins to the Storm with a similar and world-class spine; two for Manly with Daly Cherry-Evans the only change in 2011; none in '08 following Matt Ballin's emergence in '07; the Roosters in 2013 added Maloney as the missing ingredient while the 2010 Dragons had the same dominant line-up as the previous year. This time around it is the teams that missed out last year making the majority of changes, with the 2018 top eight set for as few as six total spine changes, while the bottom eight are headed for at least 13. Whether those changes pay off as it did for many 2018's finalists remains to be seen. NRL News Who will blow away the off-season blues in 2019?

Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 4:20 pm CHARLESTON — A bill to require access to more psychologists in the county school systems passed the House of Delegates' Committee on Prevention and Treatment of Substance Abuse on Thursday. House Bill 2397, as amended by the committee, will require each county school board to provide one school psychologist per every 500 kindergarten through seventh-grade students. The bill also adds language to code requiring county school boards to provide adequate mental health and counseling services to students with issues stemming from the opioid drug epidemic. Currently, 129 school psychologists are working in the state, said Karen Cummings, government and professional relations chairwoman of the West Virginia School Psychologists Association. That means, under current student enrollment, a ratio of one psychologist per every 2,000 students, she said. This is while 26 percent of West Virginia children have an adverse childhood experience, or ACE, like having a parent who has overdosed. This would be the first-ever ratio for school psychologists included in West Virginia law. The committee members acknowledged that the requirement will cost the state more money to pay for the increase in employees, who are on the teacher pay scale, and that there is still the issue of relatively low pay, which can make it hard to recruit. ""There's a reason this bill was sent to this committee,"" said Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha. ""Yes, it's going to cost money, but it's already costing us money."" The bill passed unanimously and will be sent to the Education Committee for review. The committee also passed Senate Bill 62, which amends code with the goal of getting more people into drug court. As explained by committee counsel Charles Roskovensky, lead sponsor of the bill Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, saw prosecutors were limited by code to only send marijuana municipal offenders to drug court. His original bill opened it up to all schedule one drug offenses. The committee amended the bill to include all schedules of drug offenses. The bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee. Follow reporter Taylor Stuck on Twitter and Facebook @TaylorStuckHD.

Michael,Gordon,2377,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/01/31/stat-attack-jake-trbojevic-and-victor-radley-the-supporting-stars/,"STATS Of all the statistics we use to analyse players' performances, one of the most unheralded is support plays. Points, try assists, tackle busts, as well as total tackles and metres – these are all headline stats that are regularly dominated by the biggest names in the game. NRL.com Stats crunched the numbers on who the top supporting players are and the list was dominated by notable support runners – fullbacks and halves like James Tedesco (563), Chad Townsend (562) and Michael Gordon (552). But who are the forward workhorses who already churn out stacks of tackles and metres per game yet still find the energy to support ball-runners, not knowing if they'll be needed for a run or not? Looking at just players who started in the prop, lock or second row position in five or more games in the 2018 Telstra Premiership, the leader by weight of numbers was Manly star Jake Trbojevic with 339 support runs in 23 games while the leader on a per-game basis was up-and-coming Roosters lock Victor Radley. Radley's 10 run-on games netted 150 supports at 15 per game, just ahead of Cam Murray (14.9 in eight run-on starts) and Trbojevic (14.7). Veteran Gavin Cooper (278 at 12.6 per game) was next best by average and second in total after Trbojevic while Ryan James (273 at 11.9) notched the third-biggest support tally among forwards.

The move was prompted by one new and one improved NCAA provisional qualifying mark that the Timberwolves earned at last Saturday's Jet's Pizza Invitational at Saginaw Valley State. The improved mark came from Rami Gharsalli, who posted a season-best time of 8.03 in the 60-meter hurdles and now is ranked No. 7 nationally in the event. The new provisional mark came from Mason Phillips, who earned his fourth provisional qualifying mark of the season with a season-best leap of 7.03 meters in the long jump, which ranks him 11th nationally. In addition to his provisional mark in the long jump, Phillips also owns the top time in all of NCAA Division II in the 200-meter dash, is ranked second in the 60 dash, and is ranked 10th in the 400 dash. Other NU men who own provisional marks are Brian Patrick in the 5,000 run (No. 17) and Andrew Davis in the 200 dash (No. 26). The NU men's and women's teams will head to Hillsdale on Friday and Saturday for the Wide Track Classic.

Andrew,Davis,2370,https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2019/01/30/the-scoop-2019-20-toronto-symphony-season-to-converges-with-past-present-and-future/,"There is arguably no other orchestra in Canada that has undergone so much change as the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) has over the past couple of years. It was just two years since former CEO Jeff Melanson resigned following the breakup of his marriage to frozen-food heiress Eleanor McCain. It then saw the entry of Interim CEO Sonia Baxendale step off the TSO Board of Directors in March 2016 to lead the organization through the turmoil that followed. Toronto native Gary Hanson was subsequently installed by an understandably shaken board to guide the TSO through to a sense of normalcy. Hanson’s successor was found in the sure hand of Philadelphia Orchestra import Matthew Loden, as President and CEO, who started this past summer. If that weren’t enough, the orchestra also had to deal with the end of the illustrious 14-year tenure of music director Peter Oundjian, and the hiring of Gustavo Gimeno — a young Spanish conductor most of us on this side of the Atlantic have never heard of. As a stop-gap, TSO Conductor Laureate Sir Andrew Davis was named interim Artistic Director for a two-year stint to keep the ship afloat before Gimeno takes the helm in September 2020. Amidst so much change, one wonders how it might affect the TSO’s planning for a 2019/20 season. Is this to be a patchwork of here, there, and everywhere? The answer, thanks to Sir Andrew Davis and Matthew Loden, is to turn a weakness into a strength by highlighting the convergence in a grand theme of past, present and future. “The music directors are particularly interesting,” said Sir Andrew Davis. “We’ve got Gustavo as the future, you’ve got me, who is a little bit of the present and the past. Peter of course… and we have Jukka-Pekka [Saraste], and Günther Herbig.” All but Gimeno are former conductors of the TSO, and while mentioned, Herbig will be featured this season (March 27 and 28, 2019). The musical pillars are found in the repertoire, which over the 2019–20 season, includes a birthday year for Beethoven and over a dozen of his works performed. “I’ve done a lot of Beethoven over the years,” says Davis, but he confesses he is particularly looking forward to the King Stephen Overture, (Op. 117 ), “which nobody ever plays.” They also have violinist virtuoso James Ehnes performing Beethoven’s Violin Concerto (June 10, 11, 13 and 14) and pianist-dynamo Jan Lisiecki playing the Emperor Concerto in April. Beethoven’s Pastoral is coming alongside the Montreal Symphony Orchestra with Kent Nagano, for their annual Toronto appearance. Davis will harken back to “where it all started” as organ scholar at Kings College Cambridge from 1963-67, with a performance of Saint-Saëns Symphony No. 3, featuring Davis doing double duty conducting and playing the organ. “We wanted to create the essence of having many different points of access throughout the season,” Loden says. “Particularly for new people who are interested in the storytelling aspect of symphonic music, from The Four Seasons [Vivaldi] with Jonathan Crow leading it and performing it, (Nov. 16, 17, 20 and 21), to the story that you can get walking through the Pictures of an Exhibition [Mussorgsky]…” This double duty is also seen in the season opener on September 19 and 21, with John Storgårds leading soprano Barbara Hannigan in an excerpt from Brett Dean’s opera Hamlet. The two then switch roles with Hannigan leading Storgårds in a performance of Dutilleux Nocturne (a composer, who has a long history with the TSO). Loden described the process of creating his first season with the TSO as a little like crafting a story. “You begin by just putting stuff down; what is it that I love and that I really want to do… You can then begin to piece the season together based what you haven’t done recently. What are the new works that are interesting, new artists you want to bring up… You then get this beautiful artistic pallet that’s really lovely.” Davis describes the process as “a kind of jigsaw puzzle that’s kind of fun, and as you get to the last stages of it, you go backward and forward to fill in the moments that are missing.” One of those missing ingredients was Mozart’s Requiem which next season will include a collaboration with Barbara Hannigan’s Equilibrium Young Artists program. The program was founded by Hannigan in order to provide opportunities for young musicians to move beyond the post-training grey area that many find themselves in after they graduate. “It’s the first time it has happened in North America,” says Loden. The auditions begin next Sunday, where the TSO will vet a series of singers vying for an opportunity to attend an intensive workshop with Hannigan in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, before returning to Toronto to sing the iconic Mozart’s Requiem at Roy Thomson Hall in January 2020. The biggest surprise of the season is arguably the rarely performed Thaïs. “It’s my favourite Massenet opera,” Davis says, and also the concert he is most looking forward to of the season. The performance will also include Canadian soprano Erin Wall in the title role at the TSO. When asked about the decision to cancel the TSO’s New Creations Festival last year, both Davis and Loden were quick to express their commitment to contemporary music in Toronto. Loden called it, “an institutional investment in the art of now.” Davis added that it was a question of whether “a festival is the best way to present contemporary music, or if it’s better to seed it through a season so that you can bring it to a wider audience…” He mentioned that if “you do a festival for people who you know want to come to these, it doesn’t always reach the main subscriptions.” Loden hinted that incoming new music director Gimeno just might have something special in mind for new music when he takes the baton full-time in 2020, but could not confirm anything just yet. As for Gimeno, Toronto will have to wait until September 2020 for his official debut as music director. Until then, patrons can catch Gimeno perform in concerts featuring rising pianist Beatrice Rana in early October, as well as a program of Brahms with piano superstar Yuja Wang in April. He will also be here on June 28 for Stravinsky’s Suite from The Firebird. With the TSO’s 2019-20 season announcement in play, one gets the impression they are very much looking onwards and upwards. While they may be a little wary after a tumultuous few years, they are also all the wiser for it. +++ For a complete list of 2019/20 programming, visit www.tso.ca.

Michael,Gordon,2453,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190211/jury-begins-deliberations-in-brutal-haines-city-double-murder,"Michael Gordon, 38, is charged with fatally stabbing two Haines City women - Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51 - in a brutal January 2015 home invasion. BARTOW — After three weeks of testimony and more than four hours of closing arguments from lawyers Monday, jurors in the first-degree murder trial of Michael Anthony Gordon will begin deliberating their verdict Tuesday. Gordon, 38, is charged with fatally stabbing two Haines City women in a brutal January 2015 home invasion, but his lawyer told jurors Monday there’s not enough evidence against him to support a guilty verdict. Clearwater lawyer Jervis Wise criticized law enforcement for not testing a bloody towel and other items for evidence, and suggested they focused solely on Gordon to the exclusion of other possible suspects, including the man Gordon said killed the two women. “When you look at the physical evidence, it doesn’t suggest Michael Gordon could have been the person,” he said. “What else was not looked at?” But Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme, in her closing argument to the jury, said all the evidence points to Gordon as the man who killed Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51. “Michael Gordon is the person that comes out of 618 Astor, where these women lived and where these women were murdered,” she said. “He’s the only person that comes from that house. He’s driving Patricia Moran’s vehicle and crashes into the ravine. Nobody else is with him.” Gordon and three others were arrested in January 2015 following an armed robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale. A GPS tracker among the stolen jewelry enabled police to pursue the robbers, who led law enforcement to the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City, according to court testimony. Devonere McCune, 26, was the first suspect to be arrested after they crashed the car at the subdivision’s entrance. Gordon would be next. Jovan Lamb and Terrell Williams, both 33, would be taken into custody within hours. Prosecutors have accused Gordon of killing the Haines City women in an attempt to elude capture. During trial testimony, officers with Haines City Police Department and the Polk County Sheriff’s Office told jurors they saw Gordon crash through the garage door of the women’s home and drive Moran’s Ford Focus across an open field, amid gunfire from officers, before crashing into a ravine bordering Lake Confusion. Moments earlier, the two women had been stabbed more than 50 times, Ducharme told jurors in her closing argument. “Miss Royal is stabbed 54 times,” she said. “She had defensive wounds that we can see on her hands. Clearly, she was fighting back. “Not only had her throat been slashed, but the cut went so deep that it went all the way through to her spine,” she said. Later, blood-soaked clothing that prosecutors say Gordon was wearing in the pawn shop robbery was discovered in the washing machine of the women’s home, with Gordon’s DNA on the collar, along with the DNA of at least one other person. But Wise, in his closing argument, questioned why that would be the only DNA evidence linking Gordon to the crime. “With each (evidence) submission, nothing is pinning this on Michael Gordon,” he said. “The only place DNA is found is that one collar spot, where another person’s DNA is also found.” He said Gordon could have worn the shirt months earlier and left his DNA on it. Gordon also faces charges of armed robbery stemming from the pawn shop robbery and other related crimes. On Monday, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb asked jurors to bring overnight bags as they begin deliberations, suggesting they will be sequestered if they don’t reach a verdict Tuesday. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Gordon if he’s convicted, which means the jury will continue to hear testimony and will decide a sentencing recommendation. The final decision on sentencing will rest with Harb. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070. Follow her on Twitter @southpolkscene.

Steve,Cummings,2454,https://www.cbr.com/miles-morales-one-more-day-deal-mephisto/,"WARNING: The following article contains spoilers for Champions #2 by Jim Zub, Steve Cummings, Marcio Menyz and VC's Clayton Cowles, on sale now. In the relaunch of Marvel's Champions, the status quo has well and truly shifted. Miles Morales' Spider-Man, Kamala Khan (Miss Marvel), Amadues Cho (the Hulk known as Brawn) and former Nova Sam Alexander are all leading a widely expanded roster. They're more or less acting as a young version of the Avengers, with recent missions seeing teams in Japan and Mexico pull off enormous rescues. However, the mission Miles' squad embarked on in Dubai was kept under wraps except for one big revelation -- Miles struck some big deal with Mephisto. Well, in the latest issue, we find out exactly what it is and, as expected, it comes at a mysterious yet dear cost. RELATED: Miles Morales Is About To Have His Own 'One More Day' Moment In Issue #1, as the teams celebrated their trifecta of wins, Miles retreated to his room, distraught. Only Amadeus knew what was going on, but readers were kept in the dark. All we knew was that an emotional toll was exacted, resulting in Miles lashing out at Sam and Kamala. When Mephisto appeared on the final page, asking him if this wasn't everything he hoped for, it became abundantly clear Miles struck a pact like Peter Parker did in ""One More Day."" That cost Peter his marriage to Mary Jane, though it did save Aunt May's life. Still, fans decried Peter's decision, as we all know superheroes shouldn't be bargaining with devils like Mephisto. And, once again, the demon plays on a Spider-Man's biggest fears and selfish nature when it comes to protecting the people he loves, as we see disaster tugging at Miles' heartstrings in Dubai. RELATED: Marvel's New Champions Roster Is Way Larger Than Advertised When the team touches down to face Zzzax, who's basically a walking electric field, they can't contain the energy-based entity and an explosion that claims several lives erupts. However, Miles was able to save one mysterious young girl in a hijab just before, giving him hope he could prevent the destruction to come. Sadly, it just isn't meant to be, and by the time Miles recovers in the wake of the near-nuclear fallout, death has hit home. He recovers Kamala's body from the rubble, while Amadeus is cradling the lifeless frame of Viv Vision. Mephisto, as is his nature, sees this as the most opportune moment and offers Miles a choice in front of Amadeus -- he'll rewind time so they can contain Zzzax using their special device and thus prevent the death of their friends. Amadeus warns Miles against it, but Mephisto makes it clear this deal involves no souls, blood pacts or debts in general. It's a favor, ""free and clear,"" and one a heartbroken Miles accepts so he can reverse the tragedy. And so, the devil rewinds time, allowing them to stop Zzzax, prevent mass destruction and save civilians they couldn't before. Most importantly, Kamala and Viv are alive and well. This is why Miles was affected mentally and didn't want to celebrate. No one knew what was up apart from Amadeus, and now we see it's because he saw what Miles went through. RELATED: Marvel's Champions Go International, Including a New East Indian Hero The key moment in his decision comes at the end, however, at ground zero in Dubai, as it's revealed the woman Miles initially saved ends up dying in this new timeline. It turns out her life was deemed a worthy exchange for his friends. Now, we don't know if Miles found out about her death or why Mephisto considered her important, but it emphasizes nothing is free. Maybe she was a random sacrifice and a victim of chance, but Miles should know better, especially when it comes to altering the course of history, which the likes of Doctor Strange and Brother Voodoo have sensed. Expect consequences for this, because Miles and Amadeus should not have been duped -- the devil's always in the details, and it seems we now have one more dilemma to contend with.

Michael,Gordon,2555,https://www.qt.com.au/news/mothers-praise-dr-gordon/3658673/,"IPSWICH mothers have leapt on social media to praise Dr Michael Gordon, who has delivered around 6000 children into the community. Dr Gordon chalked up 40 years of continuous service at Ipswich Hospital before announcing his retirement earlier this week. When announced on Facebook, more than 100 people commented with fond memories. Mother, Nicole Schipplock was quick to praise the doctor, who not only delivered, but went on to inspire her now 24-year-old daughter in a career of midwifery. ""Thanks so much for all the beautiful years of service to the Ipswich community, you were my private obstetrician in 1994 who delivered my beautiful daughter Amy,"" Ms Schipplock wrote on Facebook. ""I'm proud to say Amy has grown up into an amazing young woman whom has worked alongside you as a registered midwife. ""You were the most amazing obstetrician, your softly spoken calming nature and wealth of knowledge will be missed at Saint Andrews and Ipswich hospital. Enjoy your very well deserved retirement."" Ms Schipplock's daughter, 24-year-old Amy Ryan said Dr Gordon was a ""great teacher"" and that she ""hopes to emulate this in (her) own practice"". Mrs Ryan, who is on maternity leave herself is working as a midwife at the Royal Brisbane Woman's Hospital, with hopes to return to Ipswich, and also a community educator with the Australian Breastfeeding Association. ""My passion for midwifery has grown immensely since becoming a mother myself - my job is not just about helping mothers birth their babies safely but also helping to create empowered and confident mothers,"" she said. ""I've always loved babies and children but I've always loved healthcare and helping people and providing care so it really just matched up."" Dr Gordon was gobsmacked with the heartfelt community thanks that poured out for him. ""I wouldn't have expected anyone to have said very much but it's amazing that people would bother,"" he said. ""I'm not right into all the electronic stuff (social media) but the fact that people are doing that, it's really rewarding. I feel good about that. I wish I could thank them all personally."" The good doctor went on to say it wasn't the first time he had worked with someone he had birthed though. ""I have worked with people I've delivered at times, as long as you remember them you're right, they look a bit different from the last time night,"" he laughed.

Inside the rehearsal room on the campus of Fisk University, members of the Fisk Jubilee Singers fine tune their instruments. “It feels amazing to be a part of it,” said Andrew Davis, a tenor. “I feel a whole plethora of emotions when I walk into rehearsals, when I walk on stage.” In 1871, the original Fisk Jubilee Singers introduced “slave songs” to the world. They broke racial barriers in the United States and abroad, entertaining kings and queens in Europe, including Queen Victoria in 1873. “The queen said ‘Who are these young people? Their voices are magical. Where are they from,” said Fisk University historian Dr. Reavis Mitchell. “She was reportedly told they are from Fisk in Nashville, and she said ‘I don’t know this Nashville, but it most certainly be a musical place.’” Mitchell said the original ensemble were pioneers in many ways. “They are also one of the first groups to use music as a way of really large fundraising,” said Mitchell. “Eventually they ended up in Carnagie Hall. People wouldn’t give them places to stay. Restaurants wouldn’t allow them to come in and eat. It was still a racially-charged country. They’re really on the front lines of changing America’s perception of the African-American.” Mitchell said the singers are ultimately students. “What we’re most proud of is they’re among the best academic students,” said Mitchell. “These students don’t come to Fisk to sing, they end up singing. They come to be educated in a Fisk tradition.” For the students, the enormity isn’t lost on them. “Being a part of the Fisk Jubilee Singers is more than you. You are literally part of history. You have to look at the bigger picture,” said soprano Cortney Townes. “We are ministering, not necessarily performing, but ministering to people and touching the hearts of people.” Copyright 2019 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).

Michael,Gordon,2453,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/02/12/stat-attack-rating-the-best-goal-kickers-at-your-club/,"STATS Which clubs have the best goal-kicking depth leading into the 2019 Telstra Premiership season? In 2018 there were 742 points missed through try conversion and penalty goals, at an average of 46.4 points per side. With the top eight finishing in its closest ever fashion in 2018, any points on offer can later affect ladder positioning. NRL.com crunched the numbers to highlight the challenges each club may face with the boot and ranked their depth. Nathan Cleary: 185/219, 84.5% James Maloney: 760/936, 81.2% Jarome Luai: 8/11, 72.73% Penrith will go into the 2019 season cherry-ripe of options in the goal-kicking department with Nathan Cleary and James Maloney slotting over 80% of goals in their career. The pair shared the duties last season with Maloney (86%) outdoing Cleary (78.5%) throughout the year. The side found another suitable replacement during the representative period with Jarome Luai stepping up in their absence while they were on Origin duty. Jarrod Croker: 656/808, 81.2% Aidan Sezer: 179/218, 82.1% Sam Williams: 25/30, 83.3% The Raiders are blessed in the area of goal-kicking with an 82% strike rate as a club. Jarrod Croker will be the first-choice option for the Raiders with Sezer and Williams healthy back-up options. Croker is also chasing the record to become the youngest player under 30 to score 2000 points in the game and can do so with a big season in 2019. Rhyse Martin: 36/38, 94.7% Kerrod Holland: 70/89, 78.7% Kieran Foran: 8/10, 80.0% Canterbury endured a difficult season in 2018 but unearthed arguably the next best sharp-shooter in the game in Rhyse Martin, who missed just two goals from 38 attempts. After losing Moses Mbye mid-year, Martin's emergence into first grade came with the added bonus he can play the full 80 minutes. If he continues down this path of success, six points per try is almost a guarantee. Kerrod Holland, who had off-season ankle surgery, is the next best option at the club. Michael Gordon: 654/807, 81% Tyrone Roberts: 230/311, 74% Ash Taylor: 83/116, 71.5% Michael Gordon is expected to resume the goal-kicking role with Ash Taylor proving a handy back-up option for the Titans, who have lost Kane Elgey to Manly. Gordon has hovered around the 78% strike rate mark in his past four seasons. The Titans are also boosted by the return of Tyrone Roberts, who kicked at 77% during his last stint at the club, though his spot is not as secure in the halves with Ryley Jack and AJ Brimson possible options. Jamayne Isaako: 97/117 , 82.9% Jordan Kahu: 145/188, 77.1% Anthony Milford: 36/53, 67.9% The emergence of Jamayne Isaako in 2018 gives the Broncos a top line option at the club. Isaako's calmness under pressure saw him kick at an impressive 83% during his rookie season. Jordan Kahu and Anthony Milford will be his deputies with the side looking comfortable with their depth. Adam Reynolds: 548/667, 82.2% Damien Cook: 7/8, 87.50% Cody Walker: 10/12, 83.33% Adam Doueihi: 9/15, 60.00% Adam Reynolds was noticeably down in conversions throughout the 2018 season, dropping to a 75% success rate - 7% below his career average. His biggest struggle came from both sidelines with just 25% of tries converted on the right side of the field. The left edge wasn't too much better with a 49% strike rate from the near sideline. Reynolds had a similar season in 2016 but bounced back to slot 88.1% of his goals in 2017. Injuries to Reynolds in the past have always left the Bunnies scrambling. Their next best option is Cody Walker, who last kicked in 2016, with Adam Doueihi still recovering from an ACL injury. Gareth Widdop: 382/500, 76.4% Ben Hunt: 25/36, 69.4% Tim Lafai: 16/24, 66.7% Zac Lomax: 11/13, 84.6% Gareth Widdop is on track for a return in round one following shoulder surgery and is no doubt to take conversions as the club's number one goal kicker. Widdop kicked at a career-high 83.9% in 2018, well above his overall average. Zac Lomax proved more than capable during the Telstra Premiership finals series to slot 11 of 13 attempts and is likely to feature more regularly in the Dragons line-up this season. Shaun Johnson: 325/434, 74.9% Chad Townsend: 112/168, 66.6% Matt Moylan: 29/47, 61.7% Not only have the Sharks landed a handy replacement for Valentine Holmes but they picked up a decent goal-kicker in the process. Shaun Johnson arrives in the Shire and will likely become the club's first-choice option. Chad Townsend had the role last season before Holmes took over after his efforts in the Origin series. Both Townsend and Moylan should act as backup options. Josh Dugan has also kicked 23 goals in his NRL career if needed. Mitchell Moses: 154/208, 74% Clint Gutherson: 60/85, 70.6% Blake Ferguson: 22/32, 68.8% Mitchell Moses and Clint Gutherson are the chief kick options at the Eels. Moses is kicking at a handy 80% since joining Parramatta, well above his career average. Blake Ferguson slotted six from nine attempts at the Roosters in 2018 and could make a handy back-up if required. Dylan Brown is also an option for the side should he cement a spot. Cameron Smith: 1104/1486, 74.3% Cameron Munster: 14/25, 56.0% Brodie Croft: 5/7, 71.4% Cameron Smith will resume his usual goal-kicking duties. Smith has noticeably improved on his career average in the last two seasons and slotted goals at 82.35% last season – his best year with the boot since 2011. Given the ironman effort Smith possesses each season, Cameron Munster and Brodie Croft have had limited experience but will act as back-ups to the champion hooker. Latrell Mitchell: 111/151, 73.5% Sio Siua Taukeiaho: 35/48, 72.9% Brock Lamb: 30/35, 85.7% The Roosters have picked up former Knights playmaker Brock Lamb who missed just five goals across two seasons in the Hunter. Latrell Mitchell had his first full season with the duties in 2018 and kicked at 77 percent. Sio Siua Taukeiaho is a handy backup for the club but his limited minutes means he's not always on the paddock. An unwanted injury to any of these players could force Trent Robinson to re-jig his side. Trent Hodkinson: 294/378, 77.8% Daly Cherry-Evans: 102/ 145, 70.3% Dylan Walker: 42/64, 65.6% Kane Elgey: 19/24, 79.2% Api Koroisau: 6/14, 42.9% The Sea Eagles are well equipped for goal kickers. Trent Hodkinson is no guarantee to make Des Hasler's final 17-man squad in round one but is the club's most experienced sharp shooter. Whether he or Kane Elgey partners Daly Cherry-Evans in the halves could dictate who takes the conversions. Cherry-Evans is no slouch himself and kicked at 78.3% in 2018. Esan Marsters: 56/73, 76.7% Benji Marshall: 402/566, 71% Moses Mbye: 101/146, 69.2% Esan Marsters is likely to resume duties after a solid rookie season with the boot with newly appointed skipper Moses Mbye a decent back-up option. Benji Marshall hasn't kicked a goal since 2013 when he was last at the club. Ethan Lowe: 69/89, 77.5% Kyle Feldt: 19/31, 61.3% The Cowboys will go into the new season in foreign territory having lost goal-kicking wizard Johnathan Thurston to retirement. Jake Clifford finished with a 73% record in Queensland's Intrust Super Cup competition and could take on the role fulltime if he makes Paul Green's starting 17. Back-rower Ethan Lowe slots goals at a career average of 77.5% but found himself struggling for a spot at times throughout the 2018 season. Kyle Feldt is another fall-back option but overall it is a bit of a worry for Paul Green with the winger's 61% not exactly flattering. Kalyn Ponga: 27/39, 69.2% Mason Lino: 16/21, 76.2% The Knights have picked up former Warriors halfback Mason Lino in an added boost to their goal-kicking stocks. The club lost Ken Sio to the English Super League and Brock Lamb to the Roosters, leaving their options limited. Most of their reliance will come down to Kalyn Ponga in 2019, who took on the role before handing over the duties after an off-night in Tamworth. Newcastle are being tipped by many to reach their first finals campaign since 2013 and it would be a cruel blow if goal-kicking dictated how things later pan out. Issac Luke: 180/255, 70.6% Tohu Harris: 8/12, 66.7% The Warriors are the biggest losers in the goal-kicking department following the exits of Shaun Johnson and Mason Lino. Only Issac Luke, who kicks at 70.6% and is no certainty to play in round one, is the club's most recognised option. Tohu Harris kicked eight goals over four seasons at Melbourne and may be club's first string option in the opening round. Potential halfback Chanel Harris-Tavita kicked at 65% in the Intrust Super Premiership throughout the 2018 season but is untested at NRL level.

Michael,Gordon,2369,https://m.themorningbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast-coach-garth-brennan-locks-in-spot-for-t/3635240/,"GOLD Coast coach Garth Brennan has revealed boom youngster Alexander Brimson will play five-eighth and not fullback this year, and could even start the season in a super sub role off the bench. Still recovering from a post-season shoulder reconstruction, the dynamic 20-year-old won't commence contact training for several more weeks and Brennan said his return would not be rushed. Brennan conceded veteran Michael Gordon would start in the custodian role, with Brimson up against Tyrone Roberts and Ryley Jacks to partner Ash Taylor in the starting halves. ""A lot will depend on how 'AJ' is tracking with his shoulder,"" Brennan said. ""I am not going to rush him. ""I think long-term fullback is going to be his spot because he is such a dynamic runner. ""And I think that is where he feels most comfortable, as a one. ""The good thing for me is that I have Michael Gordon there who is a real pro and with a lot of experience. ""If Flash is fit and healthy Flash will be fullback. ""Fit and healthy, AJ Brimson will be in my 13 somewhere."" The Titans are scheduled to play Brisbane in a trial on March 2 and if and how Brimson performs will determine where he starts the season. ""The other option for me is to ease him off the bench round one,"" Brennan said. ""Because that is my number one concern, making sure the kid gets looked after. ""It is such a long year and he is such a super kid. ""The last thing I want is for him to go out too early and damage (the shoulder) or lose confidence. ""I have to protect him. It is hard not to get excited about him. I think there is representative football in him. He is just such a competitor. ""When he came back after Christmas and he came straight into our ball sessions at six, the teamwork just changed. ""The speed of everything he does is fast. The tempo of everything we did went through the roof. ""He was playing alongside (Tyrone Peachey) on the left side and Peach has just gone, 'wow, what about this kid'. ""He will be into a bit of light contact in the next few weeks and he will hopefully be ready to go in that Broncos trial. ""But look, whether he is fit and ready to go will determine the make-up of that spine.""

Michael,Gordon,2369,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190129/testimony-begins-in-haines-city-double-murder-trial,"Opening statements held in the trial of Michael Anthony Gordon for the brutal January 2015 stabbing deaths of Patricia Moran and Deborah Royal. BARTOW — Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme spent nearly two hours before a jury Tuesday detailing the state's evidence against accused murderer Michael Anthony Gordon, who's charged with fatally stabbing a 72-year-old Haines City woman and her daughter during a home invasion four years ago. In her opening statement to jurors, she accused Gordon, 38, and three accomplices of first robbing an Auburndale pawn shop before a high-speed chase with law enforcement led them to the Haines City neighborhood and the deaths of Patricia Moran and Deborah Royal, 51. Ducharme went through a litany of evidence linking Gordon to both crime scenes, including DNA on a shirt, witnesses who saw him outside Royal's house and clothing found at the murder scene that prosecutors say Gordon was wearing in videos during the robbery. She described how a GPS tracker led police from the pawn shop to the Haines City neighborhood, where the assailants crashed their car into an embankment. The four men scattered, she said, and when the man prosecutors say was Gordon approached Royal's house, neighbors asked what he was doing there. “The black male went on to tell them he had just been robbed, and 'I'm being shot at, didn't you hear?' ""she said. “They think this is very odd.” The neighbors then saw him walk around to the rear of Royal's house, Ducharme said. Law enforcement officers arrested Gordon moments after the two women were murdered, when he crashed through the garage door, in Royal's car, trying to leave the murder scene, Ducharme said. But Clearwater defense lawyer Jervis Wise, representing Gordon, told jurors in his 13-minute opening statement to be mindful of the totality of the evidence, and to listen for elements that are missing. “The state believes that Mr. Gordon was the person who killed these women, and apparently he killed these women alone,” Wise told the jury. “This is going to be despite the fact that (co-defendants) Lamb and Williams are unaccounted for. That is despite the fact that both of these women are stabbed 50-plus times, right in the general vicinity where one of them could have tried to defend the other against a single attacker. This is going to be despite the fact that this is a very, very bloody scene, and it would appear that the bodies had been moved after they were killed. ""And despite all this, as you've heard, the only place Mr. Gordon's DNA is found is on that one black shirt. And on that shirt, the only place it is found is on the collar.” Testimony in the trial is expected to continue for two weeks, with prosecutors calling more than 50 witnesses and presenting more than 800 pieces of evidence. If Gordon is convicted, prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against him. One of the co-defendants in the case, Terrell Williams, 33, already has been convicted of first-degree murder and is serving a mandatory life sentence in prison. Jovan Lamb, 33, is scheduled for trial in September, and no trial date has been set for Devonere McCune, 26. McCune initially took a plea deal for 25 years in prison in exchange for his testimony against the three co-defendants, but later reneged on the agreement. Just weeks before Williams' trial last October, he told prosecutors he would exercise his right to remain silent if called to the witness stand. As a result, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb set aside the plea agreement, leaving McCune to stand trial. In 2015, prosecutors secured indictments against McCune, Lamb and Williams for felony first-degree murder. Under Florida law, when a death occurs during the commission of certain violent felonies, each participant in the felony also can be held responsible for the killing, even if they had no immediate involvement. That argument led to Williams' conviction, and prosecutors have charged Lamb and McCune under the same law. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070.

Andrew,Davis,2449,https://ninetyminutesonline.com/mint-tidy-newcastle-midfielder-showered-with-praise-after-wolves-showing/,"Newcastle United suffered late heartache in their 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday night, but after the game the attention of the visiting fans circled on the midfielder who stood out for them in the contest. The Magpies were comfortable for much of the outing at Molineux, and produced a consummate away performance, right up until the very last minute when they saw their hopes of a rare road win evaporate. Rafael Benitez’s charges more than held their own in a scoreless first half against Nuno Santo Espirito’s men, and then took the lead after the break when Isaac Hayden’s shot somehow made its way past Rui Patricio in the home goal. It looks like the Magpies would see out the match for a much needed victory, but Willy Boly broke their hearts when he converted a 95th minute cross, after Martin Dubravka made a mess of dealing with the original delivery. On a night where Newcastle record signing Miguel Almiron came off the bench for his debut for the Tyneside outfit, it was actually young academy product Sean Longstaff who stole the show with a wonderful performance. The Magpies playmaker learnt his trade in a loan spell away at Blackpool last season, and broke into the Toon first team on Boxing Day, when he made his debut for his home club, and he has gone from strength to strength since then. He shone throughout the contest at Molineux, regularly offering himself and taking the ball off the Newcastle defenders and moving play on effectively and efficiently. Football fans love watching their youth products shine on the senior stage and Magpies supporters are no different in that regard. A huge number of them took to social media after the contest to rave about the midfielder, with many highlighting how good he was. Here are some of those messages: Rondon's holdup play was excellent tonight but Longstaff was immense in midfield. Well done that lad.#NUFC — David Mcgivern (@davemcg1) February 12, 2019 Disappointing in the end, but let's hear it for Sean Longstaff. He's been some player this past month and a bit. #NUFC — Scott Johnson (@SAJtoonfan) February 12, 2019 Moving away from the Dubravka Debate. How mint is Longstaff? Shelvey did nothing in the first half of the season to make time think he deserves a spot ahead of this lad. #NUFC — This Dave (@ThisDave) February 11, 2019 Gutted about tonight. 2 points lost, hope it doesn't cost us. Strong performance and Longstaff looks class. Almiron lively but I doubt he will start for a while. Dubravka may have been fouled maybe should have punched but he made 3 or 4 great saves in that game too #NUFC — Chris Dixon (@MightyShearer) February 11, 2019 Plenty of positives from tonight, #nufc very good on the road, Rondon & Perez worked hard, Longstaff tidy & Ritchie looking comfortable at wingback — Andy Forrester (@AndyForrester1) February 11, 2019 Longstaff feels like a new £10m+ signing, delighted he got MOTM. Heartbreaking to let in equaliser in 5th minute of a half with no injuries or hold-ups in play. Onwards and upwards #nufc — Nobby Solono's Trumpet (@solonostrumpet) February 11, 2019 I wouldn't change Hayden and longstaff as our mf 2 no matter whose coming back from injury. #NUFC — nachodog (@nachodog47) February 11, 2019 Sean Longstaff brilliant game again tonight. Hell of a young talent, Shelvey shouldn’t even get a look in now. #NUFC — Dean (@DeanWales2) February 11, 2019 One thing about the MF you can’t see Hayden and Longstaff losing there places and with the players coming back #nufc it’s a luxury of options.2 home games are massive now but we are not in the bottom 3 and once Almiron is settled in raw pace will add more goals. — Andrew Davis (@andrew14ad) February 11, 2019 Not a foul, M-dub has to be stronger than that but Longstaff was superb yet again, good away point. A little gutted. Great game, beautiful mags #nufc #WOLNEW — Michael Phillips (@MikeLCPhillips) February 11, 2019

Michael,Gordon,2453,https://www.newschief.com/news/20190211/michael-gordon-trial-jury-begins-deliberations-in-brutal-double-murder-of-haines-city-mother-patricia-moran-daughter-deborah-royal,"Michael Gordon, 38, is charged with fatally stabbing two Haines City women - Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51 - in a brutal January 2015 home invasion. BARTOW — After three weeks of testimony and more than four hours of closing arguments from lawyers Monday, jurors in the first-degree murder trial of Michael Anthony Gordon will begin deliberating their verdict Tuesday. Gordon, 38, is charged with fatally stabbing two Haines City women in a brutal January 2015 home invasion, but his lawyer told jurors Monday there’s not enough evidence against him to support a guilty verdict. Clearwater lawyer Jervis Wise criticized law enforcement for not testing a bloody towel and other items for evidence, and suggested they focused solely on Gordon to the exclusion of other possible suspects, including the man Gordon said killed the two women. “When you look at the physical evidence, it doesn’t suggest Michael Gordon could have been the person,” he said. “What else was not looked at?” But Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme, in her closing argument to the jury, said all the evidence points to Gordon as the man who killed Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51. “Michael Gordon is the person that comes out of 618 Astor, where these women lived and where these women were murdered,” she said. “He’s the only person that comes from that house. He’s driving Patricia Moran’s vehicle and crashes into the ravine. Nobody else is with him.” Gordon and three others were arrested in January 2015 following an armed robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale. A GPS tracker among the stolen jewelry enabled police to pursue the robbers, who led law enforcement to the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City, according to court testimony. Devonere McCune, 26, was the first suspect to be arrested after they crashed the car at the subdivision’s entrance. Gordon would be next. Jovan Lamb and Terrell Williams, both 33, would be taken into custody within hours. Prosecutors have accused Gordon of killing the Haines City women in an attempt to elude capture. During trial testimony, officers with Haines City Police Department and the Polk County Sheriff’s Office told jurors they saw Gordon crash through the garage door of the women’s home and drive Moran’s Ford Focus across an open field, amid gunfire from officers, before crashing into a ravine bordering Lake Confusion. Moments earlier, the two women had been stabbed more than 50 times, Ducharme told jurors in her closing argument. “Miss Royal is stabbed 54 times,” she said. “She had defensive wounds that we can see on her hands. Clearly, she was fighting back. “Not only had her throat been slashed, but the cut went so deep that it went all the way through to her spine,” she said. Later, blood-soaked clothing that prosecutors say Gordon was wearing in the pawn shop robbery was discovered in the washing machine of the women’s home, with Gordon’s DNA on the collar, along with the DNA of at least one other person. But Wise, in his closing argument, questioned why that would be the only DNA evidence linking Gordon to the crime. “With each (evidence) submission, nothing is pinning this on Michael Gordon,” he said. “The only place DNA is found is that one collar spot, where another person’s DNA is also found.” He said Gordon could have worn the shirt months earlier and left his DNA on it. Gordon also faces charges of armed robbery stemming from the pawn shop robbery and other related crimes. On Monday, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb asked jurors to bring overnight bags as they begin deliberations, suggesting they will be sequestered if they don’t reach a verdict Tuesday. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Gordon if he’s convicted, which means the jury will continue to hear testimony and will decide a sentencing recommendation. The final decision on sentencing will rest with Harb. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070. Follow her on Twitter @southpolkscene.

The Reynolds High wrestling team poses with the championship trophy following Saturday’s District 10 Class 2A Dual Meet Championship at Sharon High’s Tiger Gymnasium. SHARON – The number “7” is considered lucky by some people. But when it comes to Reynolds wrestling, luck has nothing to do with its success. That said, that numeral was standing out as the Reynolds Raiders of Coach Casey Taylor won their 7th straight District 10 Class AA Dual Meet Championship and 17th overall for the program Saturday at Sharon High. The Raiders rolled over Conneaut Area, 64-18, in the finals after a 84-0 semifinals victory over rival Greenville. The Trojans of Coach John Reynolds – who were dominated by Reynolds in a regular season bout – sent out only several subs and forfeited several weights to save the team for the consolation finals. “It was a great day for our team,” said Taylor. “Winning (7 straight and 17 in all) is a testament to the kids. They want to match or surpass what teams have done in the past. “These kids have been told too many times this year that in the last two years we lost too much. I’m proud of this group and how mentally tough they are to push that kind of talk aside. “We have 28 young men who are dedicated and work hard for this program. Now they are going back to state and want to win a 3rd straight (duals) title. “We were a little banged up so we took off last Monday and Tuesday, then went at it hard Wednesday and Thursday. We’ll be healthy for state.” Reynolds advances to the state tournament on Thursday, while Conneaut Area and third-place Greenville face wrestle-in bouts Monday. Against CASH, the Raiders (13-0) jumped out to an early 18-0 lead after pins by Andrew Ischo (126), Andrew Berger (132) and Rocco Bartolo (138). However, Conneaut senior Wes Davenport put his team on the scoreboard with a fall over Alex Ischo in 1:37. The Eagles cut the margin to 18-12 when Brendan Laird decked Jarred Wilkerson in 5:29, then tied the match at 18 with a fall by Peyton Hearn over Hunter Thompson. Reynolds sophomore Cole Toy righted the ship for the Raiders with a fall over Dominic Ellis at 170 and after that the Raiders were in control the rest of the way. Bryce McCloskey notched a pin at 182, while Braydon Herbster had a forfeit at 195. Wyatt Owen (220) added a fall in 3:27. Then at heavyweight, Raider senior Derek Skeehan added a pin as well. Turning to the lightweights, Reynolds state champ Gary Steen had a 10-second pin at 106. At 113, Cole Bayless won 12-1 then at 120, senior ace and Harvard recruit Beau Bayless, a 3-time state medalist (champ in 20-16) won by fall to close the match in style. “It was a good win, but I told the kids that when we get to state, we can’t afford to lose three straight matches like that,” said Taylor. “Cole Toy really came through to stop the momentum. He was losing at the start, then tied it up. It was close, but he came up with a pin. “I wasn’t panicking, but I could see on the faces of the kids they were a little worried.” There was certainly no worry in the semifinals when Reynolds won 84-0 against Greenville as the Trojans starters were held out. What did Taylor think about that? “That’s for Greenville to comment on,” said Taylor. “Reynolds and Greenville have had a long history in wrestling so to me that 84-0 looked pretty good on the scoreboard.” CONSOLATION FINALS “Moving on, that’s the name of the game,” said Greenville Coach Reynolds after beating Titusville, 43-33, in the third-place match. “And that’s what we came here to do. “I think we beat the best team ever from Union City (34-30 in the quarterfinals), so that was a really good win for the program. “We did what I felt we needed to do here. People don’t realize had hard this is on the kids so we wanted to keep them healthy as best we can. “There are 31 Class AA teams in District 10 so to be in the top three is really good.” In fact, following that theme, after building a huge lead in the consolation finals, Greenville forfeited the final 3 matches. Cole Karpinski (160), Wasim McClinton (170) and Jacob McMaster notched falls for the Trojans, while Brady Gentile (182) won by major decision and Mason Karpinski (152) by injury default. Max Wills (285) picked up a 2-0 decision. For Titusville, Aric Burleigh (138) and Jarrod Rogers (145) had falls. Greenville will travel to Huntington to take on the District 6 runner-up on Monday. Notes: CASH is coached by Carmen Russo, former Hickory High wrestler, who guided the team to its first-ever appearance in the state duals. “I’m excited and really proud of our kids,” said Russo. Conneaut will meet the third place team out of the WPIAL in Linesville Monday. … Reynolds defeated Fort LeBoeuf, 57-9, in the quarterfinals. ——— CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL REYNOLDS 64, CONNEAUT AREA 18 126 – Andrew Ischo (R ) pinned Patrick Powell, 2:47; 132 – Andrew Berger (R) pinned John O’Neil, 5:00; 138 – Rocco Bartolo (R) pinned Jesse Davenport, 1:31; 145 – Wes Davenport (CA) pinned Alex Ischo, 1:37; 152 – Branden Laird (CA) pinned Jarred Wilkerson, 5:29; 160 – Peyton Hearn (CA) pinned Hunter Thompson, 3:40; 170 – Cole Toy (R) pinned Dominic Ellis, 4:58; 182 – Bryce McCloskey (R) pinned Coulten Coulter, 2:33; 195 – Braydon Herbster (R) forfeit; 220 – Wyatt Owen (R) pinned Austin Kelly, 3:27; 285 – Derek Skeehan (R) pinned Evan Gerber, 3:58; 103 – Gary Steen (R) pinned Zach Wheeler, :10; 113 – Cole Bayless (R) maj. dec. over Brady Gould, 12-1; 120 – Beau Bayless (R) pinned Henry Piatt, 1:23.

Yesterday, Sir Andrew Davis celebrated his 75th birthday in style with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. The conducting legend took to the podium, expecting to hear Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. But the orchestra didn't last long before they all ignored the conductor's cues and played a symphonic cover of ‘Happy Birthday’. The music turned into a fully-blown orchestral version of the birthday tune, with harmonised vocals from the choir – of course. Sir Andrew is conductor laureate of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, as well as being Music Director and Principal Conductor of the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and Chief Conductor of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. In 1992, the maestro was made a Commander of the British Empire, and in 1999, he was recognised in the New Year Honours List. If this had you tearing up, this isn't the first time an orchestra has played a birthday prank on a conductor...

Andrew,Davis,2435,https://news.uga.edu/mary-frances-early-has-message-for-local-students/,"Students from Clarke Central and Cedar Shoals high schools, Athens Community Career Academy and KIPP Metro Atlanta heard from UGA alumna Mary Frances Early, the university’s first African American graduate, on Thursday. “Align your goals to where you are now and where you want to be, because you are tomorrow’s leaders,” she told them. Students gathered at the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication for the message, then toured different parts of Grady such as the Virtual Environment Room and Gaming Experience (VERGE) lab and the Grady Newsource studio. They also heard from TEDxUGA students about how to use their ideas to transform the community. Afterward, the group then headed to the Chapel to hear retired Atlanta broadcaster and UGA alumna Monica Kaufman Pearson deliver the Holmes-Hunter Lecture.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little moved in early trade after ending almost unchanged on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.2 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.06 percent in very thin trade. Wall Street had already snoozed through a subdued session, though disappointing revenue forecasts hammered shares of the major videogame makers. Electronic Arts Inc tumbled 13.3 percent and Activision Blizzard Inc sank 10.1 percent. The Dow fell 0.08 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.36 percent. Markets are still waiting on developments in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute after President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that he and other U.S. officials will travel to Beijing next week for trade talks, aiming to clinch a deal to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. WE'RE ALL DOVES NOW In currency markets, the early mover was the New Zealand dollar which slid after local data showed unemployment, job gains and wages growth all missed forecasts. ""The figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year,"" said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac. ""Soft jobs growth and hours worked increase the risk of another weak economic print in the December quarter."" The kiwi slid to $0.6772, losing 1.6 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors narrowed the odds on a cut in interest rates. Bonds rallied hard, with two-year yields dropping 7 basis points to 1.67 percent, well below the 1.75 percent cash rate. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand holds its first policy meeting of the year next week and markets are wagering it will take a dovish stance. Its neighbour, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), caused ripples on Wednesday when it tempered a long-standing tightening bias and indicated the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The Aussie dollar duly dived 1.8 percent to stand at $0.7110 and gave a broad fillip to the U.S. dollar. The dollar index has now risen for five straight sessions to reach 96.400, recovering almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes. Less lucky was the euro, which was dragged back to $1.1366 in the wake of a dismal reading on German industrial output. The dollar could make no headway on the yen, which benefited from its own safe-haven status, and idled at 109.93. It broad gains still put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,306.84 per ounce, slipping further from last week's top of $1,326.30. Oil prices were underpinned by signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply. Brent crude futures gained 71 cents higher on Wednesday to settle at $62.69 and were yet to trade. U.S. crude eased 6 cents in Asia to $53.95 a barrel. - Reuters We deliver news to your inbox daily

Andrew,Davis,2408,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/428536-spain-is-a-vibrant-democracy-portrayal-to-the-contrary-is,"I started reading with interest a Jan. 15, 2019 op-ed published on The Hill’s website entitled “Congress must prioritize human rights and democratic values.” The title gave for an enticing opening, and I, as many of your readers, cannot disagree with that statement. Human rights and democratic values - who would not agree? To my surprise, however, I found under that promising sentence a thread of lies and propaganda not worthy of your respected publication. The author is Andrew Davis, former head of the Catalan Delegation in the U.S., a then FARA-registered organization. During his tenure there, Davis unsuccessfully tried, using Spanish taxpayers’ money, to convince the American public that Catalonia is an oppressed region in the very heart of Europe, the same goal he expresses in this article. He tries to convince U.S. readers that Spain is an authoritarian country. Allow me state some facts to the contrary. Spain is a democracy, a progressive country that is open to the world, respectful of human rights, and which fought hard to become what we are today after a long period of dictatorship. This democracy was permanently instituted in Spain with the Constitution of 1978, which devolved large political power to Catalonia and other autonomous regions. Never in history has Catalonia enjoyed a level of self-government comparable to its current state in its economy, police force, employment, and education, among other important issues. Catalonia and the rest of Spain, together as a united people and country, began and continue to flourish under this new and exciting Constitution. Now, our democracy is stronger than ever, as confirmed by the latest “Democracy Index” published by The Economist. The Index identifies Spain as one of the only 20 “full democracies” in the world, out of 167 countries included in the study. Catalan separatists and their “agents” have not only proven to be unfazed by their infringement of the rule of law, but are also willing to actively expand the hatred and lies they express on this side of the Atlantic to a U.S. audience. This campaign, which seeks to discredit the democratic character of Spain, is so ludicrous that it needs to rely on falsehoods, half-truths and distorted facts. The article I refer to contains so many of these that it is difficult to choose where to start, without stating the obvious. Just to mention some of the most outrageous points: The politicians currently in jail awaiting trial are there, not because of their opinions – that is not a cause for incarceration in Spain – but rather because they broke the law; they sought to organize an illegal referendum against both Spanish and Catalan laws, and against court orders. Others decided to flee Spain and are now in self-imposed exile, for the same reasons. They will be judged by an independent judiciary, subject to the rule of law and due process, and in a transparent manner. The Spanish government, which cannot and will not try to interfere in the judicial process, is committed to facing challenges with optimism, dialogue, and respect for pluralism and the rule of law. The secessionist attempt has provoked the most serious institutional crisis to date in democratic Spain. This crisis has divided Catalan society and dampened Spain’s external image. The government’s priority is to restore it by highlighting Spain’s long-standing respect for democracy, the rule of law, and consistent economic growth. We in Spain are proud of our democracy and strong democratic values and want to ensure that they are represented in a just and correct manner to the public, both in our country and abroad.

Andrew,Davis,2408,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Anti-LGBT-attacks-NJ-education-law-Gen-Pulaski-a-woman/65366.html,"In Florida, police announced they have arrested a man who they believe murdered a transgender woman from Port Charlotte in September 2018. Juan Salazar-Diaz, 21, was the last person Tyren Anthony Kinard called before she was killed, police said. Salazar-Diaz, who is from Punta Gorda, was arrested for second-degree murder, grand theft auto and possession of a firearm by a felon. On April 8, Smithsonian Channel plans to air ""The General Was a Woman?,"" an episode from the network's series America's Hidden Secrets ( which begins March 4 ), a press release noted. The episode goes behind Polish-born General Casimir Pulaski ( for whom a day in Chicago is named ), who was George Washington's most charismatic cavalry commanderand delves into the possibility that Pulaski was intersex. Other episodes look into a 1982 Siberian explosion, the infamous spy Benedict Arnold, the flu pandemic of 1918 and more. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law requiring boards of education to include instruction, and adopt instructional materials, that accurately portray political, economic and social contributions of persons with disabilities and LGBT individuals, InsiderNJ.com reported. This law would bring classroom materials into alignment with Core Curriculum Content Standards by ensuring that students receive diverse instruction in history and the social sciences, which will cultivate respect towards minority groups, allow students to appreciate differences, and acquire the skills and knowledge needed to function effectively with people of various backgrounds. The federal government agreed to allow federally funded foster care agencies in South Carolina to deny services to same-sex or non-Christian couples, Fox10Phoenix.com reported. The waiver issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will allow Greenville's Miracle Hill Ministries to continue as a state-supported foster care agency. Gay-rights groups and non-Christian religious organizations opposed the waiver, saying it would cut down on the number of people willing to be foster parents and allows public money to take away rights. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the city of Fayetteville could not enforce its ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, NewNowNext.com reported. The high court said it had already determined the measure was in violation of state law that prevents cities from passing non-discrimination ordinances that offer protections not already offered by the state, which does not include the LGBTQ community. A federal magistrate is stopping the enforcement of a portion of Tampa's ordinance prohibiting same-sex conversion therapy for minors, U.S. News & World Report noted. The injunction stops the city of Tampa from banning conversion therapy involving talking, but it would allow the ban to be applied to techniques like electroshock therapy. ""The fact remains that LGBTQ minors are at risk of fraudulent and dangerous so-called 'conversion therapy,'"" said Equality Florida Public Policy Director Jon Harris Maurer in a statement. ""Equality Florida will not be deterred from protecting LGBTQ youth, and we applaud the City of Tampa's leadership for taking a stand to do the same."" Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin is saying that former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis should pay more than $222,000 in legal fees for the gay and straight couples who sued, not taxpayers, The Huffington Post noted. ""Only Davis refused to comply with the law as was her obligation and as required by the oath of office she took,"" Bevin attorney Palmer G. Vance II wrote in a brief filed with the court. Bevin had been a staunch supporter of Davis, who spent five days in jail for refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling that effectively legalized same-sex marriage. Pressure is mounting on Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam to resign in the wake of his med-school photo scandal/Michael Jackson confession, CNN.com noted. Statements from the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, the Virginia House and Senate Democrats and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffewho was governor when Northam was lieutenant governorratcheted up the tension, as they all announced they believed the governor must step aside. In addition, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said, ""Northam must resign immediately. The right path forward is for Justin Fairfax to become the next Governor of Virginia."" The National LGBTQ Task Force issued a press release demanding that Delta Airlines apologize to two deaf Creating Change Conference attendees for preventing them from traveling home. According to NBC News, Melissa Elmira Yingst and Socorro Garcia said they were traveling from Detroit to Los Angeles and were initially told by a Delta agent at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport that they would be seated together on the flightbut that didn't happen. Garcia then tried to write a reply, but the agent allegedly crumbled up the paper and threw it in the garbageand then reportedly pushed Garcia. The Task Force said, in part, ""No one should have to fear that Delta will call the police on them for simply being deaf, blind, or disabled. Delta should take immediate steps to prevent future incidents from occurring."" Delta said it is reviewing the situation ""to better understand what transpired."" A Utah therapist has apologized for his work with conversion therapy among the LGBTQ community after coming out as a gay man, KSL.com reported. In his work as a therapist, David Matheson worked for years to convert gay men into becoming heterosexual. Matheson, though, said he is now looking for a gay partnerwith the news causing outcry around the world, especially among critics who are calling him a fraud. Almost 700,000 LGBTQ adults in the United States have received conversion therapy. Legislators are expected to begin the lengthy process of amending Vermont's constitution soon with the aim of codifying greater equality and a women's right to abortion, MyChamplainValley.com reported. Democratic Sen. Ginny Lyons of Williston said at a panel held by the Champlain Valley League of Women Voters that the state needs to do more to protect the ""underrepresented"" and underprotected."" The earliest the amendments could take effect would be 2022. The state legislature must approve the measure for two consecutive sessions and pass a majority vote. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among the vanguards who will be recognized at this year's VH1 Trailblazer Honors, NewNowNext.com noted. Kicking off Women's History Month, the hourlong television special will air on International Women's Day, March 8. Pelosi joins previously announced honoree Ava DuVernay, the Oscar-nominated director best known for Selma, A Wrinkle in Time, and OWN's Queen Sugar. Instagram recently banned Tom Bianchia longtime male erotic photographer and HIV activist whose photographs have helped document gay men's sexual history on Fire Island and elsewhere, LGBTQ Nation noted. The shot that got Bianchi banned was called ""Untitled, 457,"" a picture from his collection entitled Fire Island Pines: Polaroids 1975-1983. The Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform has a habit of deleting supposedly risque homoerotic content, including tasteful pictures of nude athletes, an image of Queer Eye food guy Antoni Porowski in his underwear and even an image of a lesbian couple cuddling in bed with their child. The American Society of Journalists and Authors ( ASJA ) has honored 11 young writers, between 14 and 25, for essays submitted in the organization's call for personal stories from gay and transgender youth, a press release touted. The essay competition was made possible as part of a $35,000 national reporting project on the topic of ""Gender Identity: What's the Cost?"" Among writers honored for their essays are first place winners: Hannah Good of Bowling Green, Kentucky; Lara Danger Detrick of Westerville, Ohio; and Isabella, an anonymous writer who attends college in Washington, D.C. The police department in Wilton Manors, Florida, unveiled its new squad carand, in a clear display of support for the local LGBTI community, it bears a huge rainbow design, Gay Star News noted. The Broward County city is one of the most LGBTI-friendly places in the United States. Police officer Jennifer Bickhardt Graziose said, ""Each Wilton Manors police officer is sworn under oath to ""protect and serve"" and to ""police with pride""pride toward themselves and each other, pride toward the badge and pride for our community."" Following three years of advocacy from students and litigation against the state of Connecticut, Yale Law School introduced two new multi-stall gender-neutral restrooms recently, according to Yale Daily News. The new bathrooms, two multi-stall units located in the basement of the Sterling Law Building, bring the count of gender-neutral stalls throughout the school to 20. OutLaws an organization for LGBTQ members of the law-school communityheld an event to celebrate the multiyear effort coming to fruition. Michael Avenatti will not be charged by the Los Angeles City Attorney ""at this time"" in an incident of domestic violence last year, TheWrap.com noted. The city attorney's office said it has declined to file charges, but has left open the option to do so at a later date, should anything change.

Michael,Gordon,2425,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/employment-flat-more-jobless,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Wage growth was ""modest"", with the private sector wages up 0.5% for the quarter to December and in the public sector up 0.7%. Unemployed men rose by 8000, unemployed women rose 2000 and there were 12,000 more unemployed youth; aged 15-24-years-old, according to StatsNZ household labour force survey released yesterday. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said the latest figures portrayed slowing jobs growth and muted wage pressures. ""The latest figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year,"" he said in a statement. Employment had grown only slightly faster than the working-age population, and the unemployment rate was only 0.2 percentage points lower than a year ago, Mr Gordon said. StatsNZ labour market and household statistics senior manager Jason Attewell said the unemployment rate for men rose to 4.4% in the December quarter, while it was 4.2% for women. ""This was the first time since June 2010 that this rate was lower for women than men,"" he said. Mr Attewell said private sector wages for the year to December were up 2%, while public sector wages increased 1.7%. In the December quarter, the nurses' pay settlement, which came into effect in August 2018, affected both the labour cost index and quarterly employment surveys. Annual wage inflation reflected the remaining two-thirds of the settlement in the latest quarter. For the quarterly employment survey, the key contributor to the increase in public sector hourly earnings came from hospitals, Mr Attewell said. While the central bank has repeatedly said that the next move in rates could be up or down, its official forecasts show the next move will be a hike, albeit not until late 2020,BusinessDesk reported. ASB senior economist Mark Smith said the survey result was ""generally expected"", with employment ""virtually flat"". ""The lack of an inflationary smoking gun keeps the prospect of possible official cash rate cuts alive,"" he said.

Michael,Gordon,2407,"http://liherald.com/stories/hewlett-relishing-tourney-season,111491","Wednesday, February 27, 2019 Complete forecast A deep Hewlett wrestling team is poised for a strong finish in the Nassau County championships. Hewlett qualified 15 for the individual county championships scheduled for this weekend at LIU Post.Â After a grueling dual meet season in which the Bulldogs battled injuries, eighth-year head coach Steven Jones sees a strong chance for Hewlett to be near the top of the standings in total points when the championships wrap up Sunday night. âThe tournament season is a whole new season,â Jones said. âIf all goes well I think we have a chance to be a top three team and at least top five.â Hewlett is fueled by several wrestlers capable of achieving All-County honors by placing in the top six. Senior Michael Gordon is the Bulldogsâ lone returning All-County finisher and is hoping to exceed his fourth place placement last year. The 182-pounder is battle-tested after placing in the prestigious Eastern State Duals last month and capturing last weekendâs county qualifier at Long Beach High School. âHe has that experience of competing in a county semifinal match last year,â Jones said of Gordon. âHe is peaking at the right time.â Gordon is among six county qualifiers from Hewlett looking to build on experience gained from reaching the championship stage. Junior Naim Lynch qualified for his third straight county championships and has potential to earn All County accolades despite competing in a stacked 113-pound weight class. âHe has had a great year,â Jones said of Lynch. âHe can really make some noise.â Other Hewlett wrestlers looking to make runs after competing in the county championships a year ago include juniors Tyler James (160) and Khamar Narcisse (220) along with senior Zach Maiorano (heavyweight.) Jones said Maiorano is likely Hewlettâs best shot at a county title since the heavyweight division is more wide open than other weight classes. Senior Sam Warshall reached the counties for the second straight year after earning a wildcard entry at 120.Â Fellow seniors Julian Cilento (195) and Michael Almonte (182) also earned county championship spots. Several youngsters also qualified for counties led by 99-pound eighth-grader Ariel Waldman, who defeated East Meadowâs Nick Chimienti by a 4-2 in the consolation finals for a third place finish. Freshman Jacob Maiorano also qualified at 170 while sophomore Joey Iannacci reached the counties at 106 after moving down from the competitive 113 class. Muiz Hussain (1245), Michael Iannacco (132), Fletcher Goodman (138) and JonathanÂ Zenny (152) also will represent Hewlett on county championship stage. The county championships will begin Saturday at LIU Postâs Pratt Center and finish late Sunday evening with the finals scheduled to start at around 7:30 p.m. The New York State Championships are scheduled for Feb. 22-23 at the Times-Union Center in Albany. Jones said no matter how his wrestlers fare under the bright lights, the program is set up for a strong future because of the dedication experienced year-round taking part in numerous offseason tournaments. âThat is where the growth comes from,â Jones said of the offseason work. âThey put in the time.â Other items that may interest you What's Trending What's Trending Being a caregiver for a loved one can be a very fulfilling experience, but may also be one of the … Q: When I go to the mynassauproperty.com website, my propertyâs market value seems low.

Along with the victory, Justice Brantley joined the elite in Catskill basketball lore as the third highest scorer in school history. Brantley was also the lone senior who was honored for Senior Night. Addison Allen was unable to attend the game due to illness. Brantley surpassed the 1,385 points by Eric Swain in becoming the third highest scorer in Catskill history. Overall, Brantley is now at 1,394 points in his career and trails only John O'Neil (1,597) and Stacy O'Neil (1,499) on the Cats' all-time scoring list. “It was a great night tonight for Justice Brantley,” Catskill’s Coach Doug Lampman said, “It was a great night for Devon (Haye). Devon showed his different layers of skills. He was able to put it on display tonight. It was a good team effort; the defense clamped down in the second half and that was really the difference.” Brantley led the Cats in scoring with 34 points; putting in 6 in the first quarter, 8 in the second, 9 in the 3rd quarter and 11 points in the fourth quarter. It wasa three-pointer in the fourth quarter with 6:49 left in the game that pushed Brantley past Eric Swain and into the third spot on the Cats' all-time scoring list. The crowd went wild for Brantley when it was announced during the game that he made history. Haye followed with a solid 33 points in the game and showed off his skill set, dominating in the paint. Kellen Gibbs added 16 points, 10 coming in the second half. “Well you know it is another step,” Coach Lampman said “We have one more step left on Friday against Taconic Hills. The league is getting stronger every year. Cairo came out on fire tonight from three-point range; no matter what we did we could not disrupt their rhythm with three’s. So they made it tough for us. We made a few adjustments at halftime and took away some of their advantages and it lead to a nice win.” Cairo-Durham was lethal from three-point range with six players making a three-pointer or more. Jacob Hall led the team with 16 points, including two three-pointers. Louis LaRegina followed with 14 points, including two three-pointers. Ethan Philips had 12 points with four three-pointers in the first quarter. Noah Justice had ten points for the team with two three-pointers. Catskill (13-2, 16-3) plays at Taconic Hills on Friday at 6:30 p.m. A victory would clinch at least a tie for the Patroon title for the Cats. CATSKILL (99): M. Christian 2-0-4, K. Gibbs 7-2-16, J.

Karen,Cummings,2395,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-47088864,"Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Serious concerns were raised over the finances of one of the UK's leading carnivals, the BBC has discovered. A former accountant who worked for Manchester's Caribbean Carnival refused to sign off the books, which he described as a ""cowboy job"". The city council also recently warned the annual festival did not have the ""expected measures"" in place to ""ensure that money is properly accounted for"". Carnival chairman Mickey Bisson said changes were being made as a result. The BBC investigation also found: In 2013, the Arts Council stopped donating tens of thousands of pounds a year in direct funding for the carnival, citing ""serious concerns regarding artistic quality"", including that ""photo evidence demonstrates persistent recycling of costumes"". During the same year, concerns over the carnival's accounts were raised internally by Aatif Rehman, an accountant who was asked to sign off the books. Mr Rehman told the BBC he refused to do so due to a lack of documentation, describing the organisation's book-keeping as ""a cowboy job"". Karen Cummings, the carnival's committee secretary in 2013, said the organisation rarely produced or kept invoices, purchase orders or artist contracts. Mr Bisson declined to respond to Mr Rehman's allegation and said he ""disagreed"" with Ms Cummings' account. Ms Cummings subsequently left the organisation and is now part of a rival group bidding to run this August's event. Several artists and contractors who have worked for the carnival in recent years have also alleged that they have not been paid. Max Croasdale, who provided a sound system and DJs in 2017, said every time he had seen Mr Bisson ""he tries to fob me off"". Security firm Safeguard Security told the BBC it was still waiting for nearly £6,000 in payment for services provided the same year. Mr Bisson said responsibility for both payments lay with other contractors. Income generated by the Moss Side-based carnival has fallen in recent years. BBC analysis of the carnival's accounts suggests its income dropped from £109,000 in 2010 to £84,365 in 2017. Private sponsorship also fell over the same period, from £44,500 to £6,000. The BBC investigation also found the carnival's website advertises trading plots for at least £500. There were 127 stalls at the park in 2017, suggesting a potential income of £63,500. The carnival declared £28,345 in its accounts. Mr Bisson said this was because some stallholders were allowed in for free while others received a discount. The fall in the carnival's funding was due to circumstances outside its control, Mr Bisson said, such as austerity and a ""sluggish economy"". In 2018, a Manchester City Council report raised concerns over an apparent lack of measures to ensure money was properly accounted for by carnival organisers. While it found ""no evidence of theft or misappropriation of monies based on the limited information available to us"", several changes were demanded. The council's executive member for culture, Luthfur Rahman, said: ""I think there's got to be a mechanism for them to be able to account for how they conduct their transactions, they've got to be clearly presented in the accounts."" Mr Bisson said his organisation had already ""completed some of the tasks"" in the council's report and was ""continuing to make the changes asked for"".

John,O'Neil,2421,https://bangordailynews.com/2019/02/06/news/york/judge-temporarily-stops-maine-town-from-moving-ahead-with-recall-of-3-selectmen/,"A Maine judge has temporarily stopped Ogunquit from moving ahead with a recall election spurred by a controversy over the dismissal of the town’s former fire chief. The Portland Press Herald reports that York County Superior Court Justice John O’Neil on Tuesday issued a temporary stay stopping the Ogunquit Select Board from setting a date for a recall election targeting Chairman Charles Waite III and board members Madeline Moody and Robert Winn. The Select Board was scheduled to set a date for the recall election on Tuesday night. [Residents angry over fire chief dismissal seek recall of 3 selectmen] That decision came in response to a lawsuit filed last month by Ogunquit residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn seeking to block the recall effort, citing issues with recall petitions and how town officials handled the recall process. The lawsuit asks the court to stop the town from moving forward with the effort to unseat the three Select Board members, according to the Press Herald.. In addition to stopping the Select Board from voting to set a date for the recall election, it also temporarily stops the use of a provision of the Ogunquit charter to have a notary call the election if the Select Board fails to, according to the Press Herald. The recall effort, led by the group Take Back Ogunquit, was launched in October after the three Select Board members voted to uphold former fire chief Mark O’Brien’s termination. [‘I’ve got nothing to hide’: Town fire chief says he’ll fight termination] O’Brien was put on paid administrative leave by Town Manager Pat Finnigan on June 27, 2018, during an investigation into concerns brought to her by firefighters. Finnigan fired O’Brien on Sept. 18, 2018, after the investigation concluded. His firing was appealed to the Select Board on Oct. 9, 2018, and the board ultimately upheld his termination in a 3-2 vote. In December, O’Brien sued the town in York County Superior Court. His complaint asks the court to vacate his firing and order the town to reinstate him with back pay, full benefits and paid legal fees. Have feedback? Want to know more?

Steve,Cummings,2424,https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Area-communities-reveal-how-much-theyre-losing-under-Wisconsins-dark-store-loophole--505478281.html,"APPLETON, Wis. (WBAY)- We've been looking into the state's dark store loophole and Action 2 News has uncovered just how much it's costing taxpayers here in Northeast Wisconsin. The loophole is designed to give big box retailers a break by allowing an operational store to be assessed based on the value of a closed property. In some communities it's led to hundreds of thousands of dollars being paid back in property taxes, and ongoing legal battles, all of which could cost you. Governor Tony Evers said just this week he will offer a proposal to close the dark store loophole in his upcoming budget address which will take place before the end of this month. However, it's unclear if Republicans who control the state legislature will actually be on board. ""It's a fairness issue,"" said Appleton Mayor Tim Hanna. According to Hanna, the dark store loophole has already cost the city about $300,000 in legal fees and more than $802,000 in property tax refunds given back to four companies. This includes $385,633 for Walgreens; $335,036 for CVS; $79,128 for Target; and $2,313 for KFC. ""It's going to cost individual homeowners more. They're going to pay more for the same services because the commercial class of property is paying less,"" said Hanna. It's not just Appleton. Oshkosh Mayor Steve Cummings told Action 2 News $307,000 was given back to Walgreens and more than $100,000 to Lowe's in order to settle property tax lawsuits. In Fond du Lac, City Manager Joe Moore said Menard's was refunded a tax credit of $28,412.98 just recently after they, too, used the loophole. Grand Chute has refunded $678,457.51 between 2013 and 2017. This was split almost equally among Sears, Macy's and Fleet Farm. Plus, the town has pending lawsuits right now with Walmart and Sam's Club. Grand Chute Town Chairman Dave Schowalter said, ""They pay double tax in Minnesota right next door than what they pay over here, and now they want to reduce it more."" Schowalter wrote a column in a recent town newsletter warning residents about the potential for rising taxes because of the loophole. He specifically calls out state Senator Roger Roth, who sponsored legislation to close the loophole which never received a vote. Efforts in the state Assembly met the same fate. ""We have rules set up in the Senate to make sure that bills that are on the calendar have adequate time for the public to understand what's happening, and we would not violate those rules, but I'm a firm supporter in this,"" responded Roth, an Appleton Republican, when asked by Action 2 News about Schowalter's column. Senator Dave Hansen says the legislation should have been given a vote. ""It is beneficial to the top one percent but detrimental to the rest of us,"" said Hansen. The Green Bay Democrat added, ""They do not need the dark store loophole."" One organization against eliminating the loophole is Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. In a statement, WMC Senior Vice President of Government Relations Scott Manley said, ""Taxpayer funded lobbyists have pushed this legislation in an effort to cover up overly aggressive and illegal assessments of small businesses, retailers and manufacturers. This policy would raise taxes on local businesses, raise costs for consumers and should be rejected."" Hanna was among those who spoke in favor of closing the loophole during a hearing in Madison last year. ""It's about who funds campaigns. There were more sponsors on these bills than needed to actually pass the bills, but neither one of them could get to the floor. It's about politics,"" he said. Senator Roth told Action 2 News he will reintroduce his bill this session. However, Republican leadership hasn't indicated if they will do the same in the Assembly.

Michael,Gordon,2415,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190205/testimony-bloody-clothes-found-of-slain-haines-city-women,"Michael Gordon murder trial: Detective presents gruesome details in 2015 stabbing deaths of Patricia Moran and Deborah Royal. BARTOW — Moments after law enforcement officers discovered the slain bodies of 72-year-old Patricia Moran and her daughter, Deborah Royal, in their Haines City home in January 2015, Dennis Russo made another discovery. Russo, then a detective with the Polk County Sheriff's Office, found blood-soaked clothing in the women's washing machine, a few feet away from where each of them had been stabbed more than 50 times. On Tuesday, Russo told jurors in the first-degree murder trial of Michael Anthony Gordon, 38, that he first noticed blood on the washing machine before he saw what was inside. When asked what else he had seen, Russo replied, “I noticed clothing at the bottom of the washer — a thermal shirt and a brown hoodie.” Forensic testing would identify Gordon's DNA on the shirt's collar, Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme told jurors in her opening statements last week, which placed Gordon inside that home. Defense lawyers argued there were other assailants with Gordon that day whose whereabouts were unknown, and suggested they were involved in the killings. Russo, now a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, also testified Tuesday that he found a single sports shoe and a gray glove in the living room near the nude bodies of the two women. Prosecutors have alleged that Gordon was wearing similar shoes and gloves during an armed robbery at an Auburndale pawn shop less than an hour before the women were murdered. In the early evening of Jan. 15, 2015, three masked men — two armed with guns and one with a crowbar — held two employees of the Cash America Pawn Shop at gunpoint while they took jewelry and electronics from the store. They also unknowingly took a GPS tracker, which enabled law enforcement to catch up with them as they sped east toward Haines City, frequently exchanging gunfire with the officers. As they approached the Chanler Ridge subdivision, they crashed into an embankment, and the four men, including the getaway driver, scattered. All four would be arrested within hours, including Gordon. Prosecutors have alleged that before his capture, Gordon forced his way into Royal's home, murdered the women and crashed their car through the garage door to escape. Officers testified Tuesday to firing on the car multiple times as it passed through an open field, striking Gordon four times, before it crashed on an embankment along the shoreline of Lake Confusion. Lawyers in the trial, which began last month, anticipate completing testimony and handing the case to the jury this week. If Gordon is convicted of first-degree murder, the case will move into the penalty phase since prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Prosecutors will present evidence to the jury for imposing a death sentence, and defense lawyers will seek to spare his life. Jurors will make a penalty recommendation to Circuit Judge Jalal Harb, who will make the final decision on sentencing. Gordon, who has been in custody at the Polk County Jail without bail since his January 2015 arrest, is the second of the four assailants charged in the robbery and murders to stand trial. In October, a jury convicted Terrell Williams, 33, of first-degree murder and related charges, and he's been sentenced to life imprisonment. Jovan Lamb, 33, is scheduled for trial in September and no trial date has been set for Devonere McCune, 26. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070.

Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 3:14 pm Brand Brand I hope everyone is staying safe and warm. We’re a month in here at the Minnesota House of Representatives, and there are a few important topics I’d like to share with you regarding our work here in St. Paul. I am extremely proud and honored to announce that for the 2019-20 legislative sessions, I will serve as the Vice Chair of the House Agriculture Committee. I will also be serving on the House Labor, Taxes, Jobs, and Vets & Military committees. I have also been appointed to the Legislative Water Commission. These appointments give us a great opportunity to work on issues important to our district, and I am excited to partner with my fellow legislators to strengthen Minnesota. Committees meet Monday through Thursday here in St. Paul. We’ve been working hard to address ways we can improve our community back home and Minnesota as a whole, and there are several pieces of legislation (House Files, or HF) I’ve authored in the last week that I think can do just that. Just a few days ago I introduced HF 422 and HF 423, both of which establish programs aimed at increasing the access to sustainable child care in Greater Minnesota. I’ll be sure to keep you updated as these pieces of legislation move through the legislative process. Another bill that I chief-authored that is a big deal for our area is HF 538, which funds four lanes of highway from Nicollet to New Ulm. This critically important piece of legislation is something that I’ve heard from a lot of people up and down the corridor during the election, and I’m working in a bipartisan fashion to get this done now. There is a hearing scheduled for March 8th in which the House Transportation Committee will be hearing the bill. If you’d like to testify in favor, please call my office at (651) 296-8634. A special shout-out to Sister Gladys and many others from School Sisters of Notre Dame and Pastor Andrew Davis from Union Presbyterian Church who contacted me to voice their support of HF 5, which deals with needed time off from work, whether it be for paid family or sick leave. As a member of the House Labor Committee, I look forward to hearing this bill and the testimony that comes with it! With session underway, I want to hear from you. You can reach me at (651) 296-8634, or at rep.jeff.brand@house.mn if you ever need anything. My office in St. Paul is Room 501 in the State Office Building. Cooperation and collaboration are important to me, and I’m excited about what we’ll be able to accomplish when we work together. Jeff Brand is the representative for Minnesota House District 19A. He can be contacted at (651) 296-8634 or rep.jeff.brand@house.mn. Brand Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error! There was an error processing your request.

Andrew,Davis,2428,https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-schools-awards-2019-weve-done-our-homework/,"Success stories emanating from classrooms in Jewish schools have skyrocketed in recent years beyond even the high standards set in past decades. But while the focus is inevitably on the end result, the hard work gets done in the run-up. That process involves a plethora of the willing and able, working to give Jewish children the best possible start in life, but in the rush for grades, their effort can sometimes get forgotten. That’s why the Jewish School Awards, run by Jewish News in conjunction with Partnerships for Jewish Schools (PaJeS), is so important. Get The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up Now in their its year, educators and those who help them across the country’s 120 Jewish schools are now once more looking forward to the annual glitzy London awards ceremony, to be held at JW3 on Monday. Here, we reveal the finalists over eight categories, who stand to take home up to £5,000 for their schools. The world would be so much more dull were it not for literacy, so an early introduction is essential. At North West London, the “outstanding and dedicated” Karen Dorman has introduced competitions and a school newspaper for the children to produce and edit, while at Sinai, Juliette Green “manages to enthuse every child with her passion,” meaning they now “love to read”. At Etz Chaim, Ilana Hutchinson has introduced writing competitions and Book Week, with authors coming to speak to the children and peers noting a “whole school” effect. While at Rimon, Kate Manktelow has trained other staff and even turned her classroom into a literary café with tea and biscuits, where children read books to one another. Cute! At JFS, “motivating” Anna Joseph “goes beyond the call of duty,” according to nominees, while at Yavneh, Jayne Waxman “gives positive feedback” and “sets extremely high standards” for students. At Immanuel, the “extraordinary” Ben Wolfin won’t stop championing the monthly school newsletter Chai Life, distributed to every student and teacher, in which he showcases creative writing, profiles teachers’ favourite books and links literacy-based puzzles and quizzes to the curriculum. Beyond that he organises competitions, encourages debating skills, uses comics to help reluctant readers, and even offers a lunchtime drop-in for any student preparing for exams who wants help with their essay writing skills. Can we clone him? Akiva’s Nicole Craig “really knows and nurtures every child” and colleagues say she reflects her “deeply Jewish values” in the Early Years setting, encouraging youngsters to be “local, national and global citizens” by introducing them to things like Mitzvah Day and Chinese New Year. King David’s Charlotte Fogel is “keen to impart her love of Judaism,” even dressing up as an air stewardess to take the children on “a flight” to Israel for Yom Ha’atzmaut, complete with passports, boarding passes and suitcases! At Mathilda Marks-Kennedy, “patient and calm” Suzanne Singer turned her classroom into the world of Disney’s ‘Frozen,’ immersing the children in educational activities linked to this imaginary world, while at Hasmonean, Sharon Wakefield teaches in “a multi-sensory and kinaesthetic way” helping those with hearing and speech issues feel part of the class. All-in-all, a very strong field! JFS fields two of the three finalists in this category, the first being “exceptional” Fiona Bellinger, who has captured imaginations with her “open and inclusive” music department. Known for always creating “a buzz,” colleagues say her work has meant that “students have found the music room to be their home”. Across the corridor, Denise Sloane leads drama. Described as “a pillar of the JFS community”, she is famous for her “legendary” productions of “West End standard”. Hoping to steal the award from the school’s grasp is Sita Shah at JCoSS, who has “breathed new life” into the school’s art department. Peers say she “sees beyond the curriculum” and her “positive energy” has led to a year-on-year increase in the number of students taking art since she joined. At Broughton, the “infectious” Cath Davies knows the school inside out after 25 years there. She coordinated the ‘Israel 70’ project and nominees said they had “seldom seen the pupils so engaged” as when they created the pop-up book for the exhibition. At Etz Chaim, Ilana Levy doesn’t just teach children about Israel but encourages them to “experience” Israel, including its history and culture. Meanwhile over at Sinai the “charismatic” Jewish Studies teacher Ada Mann “is adored by parents and teachers alike,” with colleagues saying she “mesmerises and captivates” pupils. Yavneh’s deputy head Rabbi Andrew Davis organises the Year 9 Israel Trip and “works tirelessly to educate, influence and inspire a love” for the country. Nominees noted his energy and experience, adding that he was Yavneh’s “backbone”. At King David in Manchester, Rabbi Jonathan Goodman is “unlike most teachers in that he understands that teaching should not take place 100 percent in the classroom”. He is known outside the school walls too, running the inter-secondary ‘Beat the Clock’ Jewish general knowledge programme. The final finalist in this category is the “dynamic” Sara Levan of JCoSS. As Head of Jewish Life at the school, she seems to understand that students don’t see things through rose-tinted glasses and offers Sixth Formers the opportunity “to discuss what is going on in the Middle East and air their concerns”. Beloved by teachers and pupils, one colleague told us “everything she touches turns to gold”. But will she take home gold? Yavneh’s Sixth Form coordinator Dina Jacobson is known as “the Sixth Form mum”. She pushes community volunteering in a big way, creating the Give Back programme, has older students mentoring their younger peers, encourages Mitzvah Day involvement and even gets students running the Jerusalem Marathon for Israel’s disability support organisation Shalva. At JFS, Indi Padda created the Visibility for Disability programme, offering a “safe space” for students, and coordinates special assemblies, visiting speakers, disability sports and work with external organisations, all of which “has given a voice to the most vulnerable students”. At Kantor King Solomon, Ana Rodriguez-Samosa “works tirelessly” to help students play a part in school and local leadership, encouraging the establishment of out-of-school clubs and facilitating student feedback direct to senior management. Colleagues say Ana’s work “prepares students to take an active role in the community”. Between them, the future looks bright indeed. At North West London, the “selfless” Ruth Finkel runs the Chesed committee, but she doesn’t just encourage the giving of money and clothing – she also builds relationships between the students and nearby Muslim schools, together raising thousands of pounds for Jewish and non-Jewish charities. Colleagues say she was a “lev tov” (a good heart). Eden’s Laura Fox gets the parents involved, too, facilitating visits to care homes, collecting for refugees and organising an event for Hope Not Hate. One parent said the visits, where children work with the elderly to “bring history alive,” were “powerful and moving”. Finally, at Wohl Ilford, the “amazing” Deborah Harris leads on all events to raise tzedakah, getting children collecting for everything from Camp Simcha to food banks, arranging maths resources for Ghanaian children, and even flew in an Israeli band to play at a Jewish care home. With Chesed like this, it’s a brave panel to judge a winner.

Andrew,Davis,2397,https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2019/02/02/the-scoop-sir-andrew-davis-gets-a-surprise-birthday-serenade-at-the-tso-video/,"The agitated start of Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” leads into one of the most well-known songs in opera canon. Saturday night’s performance was full of a hidden collection of Valkyries hiding in the Choir loft who burst into a rousing rendition of Happy Birthday, totally surprising Sir Andrew Davis, celebrating his 75th anniversary. Members of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir were invited by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra to fill the choir loft. Looking like regular audience members, Sir Andrew was unaware as he took the stage ready to start the opening number, “Ride of the Valkyries.” Three bars in, the Choir stood erupting into a fully orchestrated rendition of “Happy Birthday” accompanied by the entire orchestra. Sir Andrew quickly overcame his surprise to enjoy the moving show of love. Sir Andrew has a long history with both organizations, having conducted both countless times over many seasons across his 45-year history in Toronto. Many members of the orchestra have a long history with Sir Andrew as well. David Kent, Principal Timpanist, was one of Sir Andrew’s early hires. He shared a very kind well-wish with Ludwig Van. “Dear Sir Andrew, when you hired me almost 40 years ago, it was right around this time of year and we were both so young. How wonderful that I am able to continue to enjoy so many performances with you for my entire career! Best wishes from me for an auspicious birthday and many more concerts to come.” After the Happy Birthday, CEO Matthew Loden then took to the stage to give remarks. Earlier, Loden shared thoughts about the surprise in store. “Sir Andrew Davis is one of the most joyful and thoughtful musicians I have known, and the fact that he has been on the TSO podium every season for the last 45 years is a testament to his remarkable talent,” said Matthew Loden. “We count ourselves lucky to be able to celebrate his 75th birthday together and look forward to making music with him for many more seasons!” As for Sir Andrew, he said, “Words are failing me. I”m rather moved. it was May 1974 when I first stood on the podium at Massey Hall. For me, every time I’m here, it’s like coming home.” With a big smile on his face, he concluded, “before I start sobbing, I better stop.” Happy Birthday, Sir Andrew! +++ Read our review of TSO’s Die Walküre featuring Sir Andrew Davis, here.

However a drone has now captured footage of the progress on the site as the first homes start to get bought. As the snow fell last week, construction was temporarily halted. Andrew Davis, a holder of a RPQ (remote pilot quailification), is insured to fly drones and took an amazing video of the development. Residents had complained about the development in the summer after huge amounts of dust meant that they could not even leave windows open. Some also had some damage to garden tiles and brickwork on their own homes. Comments are closed on this article.

Andrew,Davis,2435,https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2019/02/07/scrutiny-toronto-symphony-and-youth-orchestra-make-for-a-fine-pair/,"Toronto Symphony Orchestra featuring members of the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra. Sir Andrew Davis, conductor. At Roy Thomson Hall, February 6, 2019. Repeats Thursday, Feb. 7 and Saturday, Feb. 9. Details, here. One of my favourite concert experiences over the years is always attending combined orchestra events that can only take place in cities large enough to bring together a flagship philharmonic with its companion youth orchestra. With players from the highly regarded Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra (TSYO) paired with their doppelgängers in the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO), desks got a little cramped in places, but the sound matched the visual thrill of seeing the stage so crowded. And no one seemed more delighted with it all than TSO conductor laureate Sir Andrew Davis, who showed us a grand night of music-making from first note to last, most conspicuously in Dvorák’s Sixth Symphony. He led everyone off with Carnaval Overture op. 2 by Oscar Morawetz, a huge Canadian favourite of the Godfrey Ridout Fall Fair variety, and the combined orchestras made the most of it in every section of the big ensemble. The audience ate it up — they knew how good it was. That summed up the rest of the evening too. Sir Andrew next took us on a two-part tour of Vienna in the 1880s and prior to conducting the Dvorák, he presented Brahms’ Double Concerto with two fine featured soloists, TSO concertmaster Jonathan Crow, who took on the work with the required authority, and the no-less-commanding TSO principal cellist Joseph Johnson. Described at the time of its première as one of the more morose compositions ever written by Brahms, it was never popularly received until very recently. Nineteenth-century ears heard it as a mildly dissonant piece with scrappy bow work for the cello spiced with some technically difficult passages beyond the audience’s listening capabilities. Nothing could be further from the truth for our times. If anything, programming the lyrical and often reflective Brahms Double gives us a chance to hear the composer’s last orchestral work from a new vantage point that is in some ways separated from the four symphonies, while in other ways it pays tribute to them with a fresh scope of ideas both quotational and brand new, all the while ensconced with inventive sonorities that take a view toward his nostalgic late-style chamber pieces. It’s a shame Brahms burned the sketches for a second Double Concerto; he was so dejected by the initial public reception toward his first concerto in this sub-genre. On the outside, the orchestral playing was taut but smooth, filled with creamy phrasing in the more melodically extroverted sections, particularly the strings from whom the score demanded some blue-collar bow work. But on the inside, Crow and Johnson seemed busy dialoguing with each other, separated by a different musical language of gentle, hyper-sweetened sonority. This was a considered approach to the work, in contrast to some of the astringent timbres voiced by twentieth-century recordings a half-century ago, or more contemporary, less well-considered live performances elsewhere of late. It’s encouraging to see it all changing these past ten or fifteen years, when a polished young duo like Crow and Johnson elect to offer something more thoughtfully constructed, lyrical, and ultimately opt for presenting a kind of intimate duet with a rich orchestral timbral accompaniment as commentary. The effect was excellent, mostly so in the second and third movements. Please go and see this — it’s not performed as often as the other larger works of Brahms, and the TSO and Sir Andrew Davis do the work justifiable credit. The concert’s second half was considerably more uptempo and equally delightful. Evoking a past era of dancing and social pleasures, Dvorak’s first grand Viennese masterpiece blended jaunty Czech modality with the Viennese majestic, and at times bridged some of the new music language found in Liszt and Wagner with a burnished eclectic palette. There are even momentary tributes to Beethoven, too, especially in the first movement. As we all expected, the orchestra presented another well-rounded performance, with broad attacks in strings, delicate but full wind ensemble textures throughout the first movement, and the double basses shone yet again, this time most conspicuously in the fourth movement. Echoes of Brahms’ Second in offset wind and brass chords, key modulations, and especially in the relaxed country atmosphere of the many different motives, all characterized a symphony full of ideas that sat comfortably together with one another in close quarters. After the beautifully played B-flat major Adagio, Davis transitioned to the third movement with an interpretive smoothness, easily guiding the audience into a folksy “Furiant” which jaunted along with curious but stridently off-accented vigour. From there, it was easy to lead us into a Finale that held its vitality with equitable energy. Not to be underestimated, the string sections were at their most broad in these later movements, demanding more sound space in their down-bow strokes and slightly asymmetrical rhythmic attacks that were so essential to the work’s character which frankly, were very pleasing to hear. Occasionally, there were some odd, spectrally rough moments to iron out (final cadence of the second movement in the Brahms) and some rather generalized playing where a little more variety of rhythmic attack was needed (end of the development section and coda in the first movement of the Dvorák), but overall the bravos at the evening’s close told the story: this was a concert entirely to be relished. With more performances Thursday and Saturday, this is an event not-to-be-missed. Want more updates on Toronto-centric classical music news and reviews?

The unemployment rate dropped from 4.4% to 3.9% in the quarter to September, but Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said he expected it to have risen to 4.2% in the quarter to December. ""Even if the unemployment rate nudges above 4% again, it would still imply a tight labour market by historic standards."" Statistics NZ labour market survey data is due out on Thursday, followed by the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy statement. ""A range of surveys and anecdotes point to an increasingly tight labour market over 2018,"" Mr Gordon said. He expected an unemployment rate above 4% for December, as it would be consistent with the underlying trend. ""With workers increasingly hard to find, we expect a gradual pick-up in wage growth in the coming years, though the quarterly result itself may not be all that revealing,"" he said. In Otago and Southland, separate data on the manufacturing and services sectors has consistently showed acute labour shortages in a number of industries, limiting the growth of some businesses. Mr Gordon said that the quarter to September was dominated by an unprecedented drop in youth unemployment. ""The narrowness of that result makes it more vulnerable to a reversal."" However, there was also a small drop in unemployment among older workers, which suggested that at least the direction of the move was genuine. Mr Gordon said Westpac’s forecast also implied softer employment growth during the December quarter, compared with the 1.1% jump recorded in the September quarter. He believed employment would ease from the 1.1% gain to a 0.2% gain. He was expecting to see a 0.6% increase in the labour cost index for the quarter, boosted by the pay settlement for nurses, which was agreed in August but only about a third of which made the cut-off date for the September quarter survey. ""That aside, we’re looking for, at most, a mild lift in private sector wage growth,"" he said.

Picture: Andrew Davis Andrew Davis Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. Researchers at the John Innes Centre, on the Norwich Research Park, have developed a method called AgRenSeq which allows them to rapidly recruit disease resistance genes from wild plants and transfer them into modern crops. It opens up access to some natural disease-fighting capabilities lost from today’s elite food crops, which have historically been bred to favour commercial and agronomic traits such as higher yields. The new technique developed in partnership with scientists in the USA and Australia enables researchers to search a genetic “library” of resistance genes discovered in wild relatives of modern crops. Laboratory techniques can then be used to clone the genes and introduce their benefits into elite crop varieties to protect them against potentially devastating infections and pests such as rusts, powdery mildew and Hessian fly. Dr Brande Wulff, a project leader at the John Innes Centre, said by making crops more resilient against disease, the breakthrough will help to improve yields and reduce the reliance on pesticides. “This is the culmination of a dream, the result of many years’ work,” he said. “Using speed cloning and speed breeding we could deliver resistance genes into elite varieties within a couple of years, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. “We have found a way to scan the genome of a wild relative of a crop plant and pick out the resistance genes we need: and we can do it in record time. This used to be a process that took ten or 15 years and was like searching for a needle in a haystack. Now we can clone these genes in a matter of months and for thousands of pounds instead of millions.” Dr Wulff’s laboratory has also recently pioneered the technique of “speed breeding” which uses enhanced LED lighting to fast-track genetic improvements in crops – and he sees AgRenSeq as the perfect complementary technology. READ MORE: Norwich crop scientists make ‘speed breeding’ breakthroughThe research published in the journal Nature Biotechnology reveals that AgRenSeq has been successfully trialled with wheat, and this work could now pave the way for the method to be used in protecting other crops which have wild relatives, including soybean, pea, cotton, maize, potato, wheat, barley, rice, banana and cocoa. Dr Sanu Arora, first author of the paper, said the new method combines high-throughput DNA sequencing with state-of-the-art bioinformatics. “What we have now is a library of disease resistance genes and we have developed an algorithm that enables researchers to quickly scan that library and find functional resistance genes,” she said.

Andrew,Davis,2386,https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/2019/02/01/scrutiny-lise-davidsen-makes-resplendent-canadian-debut-in-tsos-die-walkure/,"Wagner: Die Walküre (Act One). Lise Davidsen (Sieglinde), soprano; Simon O’Neill (Siegmund), tenor; Brindley Sherratt (Hunding), bass. Toronto Symphony Orchestra, Sir Andrew Davis, conductor. At Roy Thomson Hall, January 31, 2019. Repeats Saturday, Feb. 2. Details, here. To the inveterate Wagner fan, any performance of his operas is an occasion. And when it’s Die Walküre (albeit only Act One) featuring a dream cast, it’s extra special. Last evening at Roy Thomson Hall, a modest-sized but highly enthusiastic and appreciative audience was treated to a superb performance led by Sir Andrew Davis conducting the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Sir Andrew is a familiar and much-loved figure in these parts, having been at the helm of the TSO from 1975 to 1988. A self-professed Wagnerian, with him back as Interim Artistic Director, can opera be far away? Voice fans wax nostalgic when Sir Andrew was in charge of the TSO, and complete operas in concert were the norm — Capriccio, Daphne, and Der Rosenkavalier come to mind. Ah, the good old days! Last evening was the first of two performances of Act One Die Walküre. It might have been frigid outside, but inside Roy Thomson Hall it was pure white-hot, with three world-class singers lighting up the stage. The most accessible of the Ring operas, Act One is often presented in concert form. It requires a big band, and last night the TSO was out in full force, with nearly a hundred on stage. The “Ride of the Valkyries” from Act 3 opened the proceedings. This warhorse (pun intended) requires big sonorities and there was no shortage of decibels. Under Sir Andrew, who’s an old hand with Wagner and the Ring Cycle, it was a poised, well-judged and eloquent reading, with just enough showiness but not over-the-top, with just the right tempo; altogether thrilling but refined and never bombastic, a five-minute thrill ride that was over much too soon. This was followed by Alban Berg’s Three Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 6 (revised version). While Berg’s reputation as “box office poison” is unjustified, this expressionist work is indeed a challenge to those not fond of the Second Viennese School. To that end, Sir Andrew gave an illuminating introduction. Even with huge orchestral forces, there was no loss of clarity and delicacy so important to this piece. The showy third movement with its hammer blows were enough to strike fear of God in one’s heart. The second half was taken by Walküre, unstaged, with Siegmund and Sieglinde standing on either side of the conductor. Hunding walked on and off for his brief scene. Despite this static arrangement, I didn’t feel I was missing anything. The text was projected on two giant screens above the choir loft. Without stage action, one focuses entirely on the musical end of things. At only 32, Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen (Sieglinde) has already reached the pinnacle, having won many awards including Operalia and Queen Sonja. Hers is a typical jugendliche dramatischer sopran, ideal as Elsa, Elisabeth, Eva, and certainly Sieglinde. The timbre is bright, rich, even up and down the scale, capable of a whole spectrum of tone colours and dynamic levels. In other words, it’s a “force of nature,” a term reserved for very few singers — I can only think of her countrywoman Kirsten Flagstad and American soprano Jessye Norman. Opposite her as Siegmund was acclaimed New Zealand tenor Simon O’Neill, an experienced Wagnerian, in possession of a beautiful, bright and secure tenor. The third singer was renowned British bass Brindley Sherratt, a voice unfamiliar to me. I had the good fortune of attending a rehearsal under the auspices of the Toronto Wagner Society, and I was totally blown away by Sherratt, whose dark bass rivals that of the great Kurt Moll and Matti Salminen. It really whetted my appetite for more. And I was not disappointed, as last evening was one of the most thrilling moments in the concert hall for me in recent memory. Top honours belonged to Davidsen, who was totally thrilling as Sieglinde, singing with gleaming tone, observant of all the dynamic markings, and with power to shake the walls if she had wanted to. The beauty and ease of production in “Der Manner Sippe” and “Du bis der Lenz” were stunning. Orchestrally too it was a wonderful evening, almost flawless playing under the assured and inspired baton of Sir Andrew. I say “almost” because there were a few fluffed notes by the horns and brass, the most obvious was one by the solo horn during the Sword Motive, in a cruelly exposed moment in the beginning of Scene Three. There was a less obvious one, during Sieglinde’s “Der Manner Sippe.” Oh well, that’s life! Almost all musicians will tell you perfection is a myth, or at least extremely rare. A few fluffed notes do not affect my enjoyment and my overall appreciation of the wonderful playing by the TSO. There were many striking moments, one in particular was the gorgeous solo by Principal Cello Joseph Johnson in the beginning of the extended Siegmund-Sieglinde scene. Dramatically, If I were to nitpick, I would like a touch more passion, more urgency, and more connectedness between the lovers. O’Neill had the requisite ardent qualities, but I find there was a reserve, a certain shyness in Davidsen. I fully understand it’s not easy to emote in a concert setting, without costumes and sets. It’s only a minor quibble. In the final minutes, Siegmund moved to Sieglinde’s side and the two linked hands, the only moment of physical contact between the two. But with voices like these two, I will accept the non-drama in a heartbeat. At the end, the audience rose to its collective feet and showered the artists with extremely loud and totally deserved ovations. As I was making my way home, the music kept coming into my head – when Wagner is so well done, one doesn’t want it to end. If you missed it — or better yet, if you would like a second helping — there’s one more performance Saturday, 8 p.m. Not to be missed!

Michael,Gordon,2431,https://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-asian-shares-inch-up-to-4-month-highs-nz-takes-a-dive-idUSL3N2020MU,"5 Min Read (Recasts, adds analyst comment, updates levels throughout) * Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Asia ex-Japan shares tick up, Australia leads gains * Nikkei slips, S&P 500 futures down too * Dollar holds gains as kiwi slides on jobs data By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Asian share markets edged up to four-month highs on Thursday with Australian equities the star performer while the New Zealand dollar sank after disappointing jobs data prompted investors to narrow the odds of a future rate cut. Trading was still light overall with China on holiday and no major economic data on the diary. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.2 percent, rising to its highest since early October after ending almost unchanged on Wednesday. The index has risen steadily since early January as the U.S. Federal Reserve changed its tune on policy for further rate rises. Australia’s benchmark stock index jumped 1.2 percent amid expectations of easy monetary policy after the country’s central bank chief shifted away from his previous tightening bias. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.7 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 as well as Dow minis were both off 0.2 percent. The next major trigger for markets will be any breakthrough in the U.S.-Sino tariff talks when the two sides meet in Beijing next week. U.S. President Donald Trump offered little new to chew on in his State of the Union speech but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he and other U.S. officials will aim to clinch a deal next week to avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “Investors are continuing to look for clarity on the trade situation between the United States and China and as the trading days drift by with no concrete update on progress then markets become more and more concerned,” said Nick Twidale, analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “Probably more pressing for the U.S. markets is the threat of another government shutdown,” Twidale added. “With both sides of the house standing firm on the contentious border wall issue at present and the deadline approaching swiftly on Feb 15 we could be back where we were just a few weeks ago.” Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow fell 0.08 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.36 percent. In currency markets, the early mover was the New Zealand dollar which slid after data showed unemployment, job gains and wages growth all missed forecasts. “The figures present a more modest picture of the labour market over the last year,” said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac. “Soft jobs growth and hours worked increase the risk of another weak economic print in the December quarter.” The kiwi slid to $0.6752, losing nearly 2 percent in the past 24 hours, as investors narrowed the odds on a cut in interest rates. Bonds rallied hard, with two-year yields dropping 7 basis points to 1.67 percent, well below the 1.75 percent cash rate. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand holds its first policy meeting of the year next week and markets are wagering it will take a dovish stance. Its neighbour, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), caused ripples on Wednesday when it tempered a long-standing tightening bias and indicated the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The Aussie dollar duly dived 1.8 percent to stand at $0.7110 and gave a broad fillip to the U.S. dollar. The dollar index has now risen for five straight sessions to reach 96.44, recovering almost all the losses suffered after the Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for more rate hikes. Less lucky was the euro, which was dragged back to $1.1359 in the wake of a dismal reading on German industrial output. The dollar could make no headway on the yen, which benefited from its own safe-haven status, and idled at 109.88. The broad dollar gains put pressure on gold, which eased to $1,303.25 per ounce, slipping further from last week’s top of $1,326.30. Oil prices eased too after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country held at record levels. Brent crude futures slipped 22 cents to $62.49. U.S. crude eased 15 cents to $53.86 a barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey; Editing by Richard Pullin and Jacqueline Wong All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Steve,Cummings,2439,http://www.cyclingnews.com/features/aldag-on-rebuilding-a-struggling-dimension-data/,"Head of Performance says internal competition can be positive After a year that yielded just seven wins and saw their leaders underperform on nearly every front, changes were needed at Dimension Data. Step forward Rolf Aldag, who alongside Douglas Ryder, were the men with the plan to kickstart a struggling team that had fallen to the lower echelons of the WorldTour.Related ArticlesDimension Data finalise 2019 rosterDimension Data to wear Assos kit in 2019Dimension Data 'guarantee' Tafi will not race Paris-Roubaix with themValgren: Dimension Data will shoot with one missile, hopefully that will be meDimension Data to make Hammer Series debutO'Connor sets sights on Green Mountain at Tour of Oman The challenges facing Aldag and the rest of the management at Dimension Data were huge. For one, they had endured a season in which their frontline of Mark Cavendish, Louis Meintjes, Steve Cummings and Edvald Boasson Hagen had failed to produce a single WorldTour win between them. A drop in performance from their leaders only highlighted the lack of depth within the rest of the team, and without the two stage wins at the Vuelta a España, courtesy of Ben King, the team would have gone an entire season without tasting WorldTour success. Throw into the mix a lack of fit and experienced captains, riders calling out the team's equipment in public, a star sprinter out of contract, and a responsibility to support African talent, and Dimension Data’s task looked insurmountable. ""Most of all we needed stability in our racing,"" Aldag told Cyclingnews during a series of conversations during the off-season that started in September and ran until late November. ""So last year we'd have maybe Edvald in a race, but the rest of the guys were a bit more random. We needed to get to a point where we had five or six stable guys. If you have some jokers, that's fine, but you need to be able to predict the results from your riders more."" At times, Dimension Data appeared to be racing with one hand tied behind their back in 2018. With Cavendish on the tarmac more than on the podium, Eisel out injured and Cummings pushed and pulled from race to race, the team was stretched too thinly. The first task was to solidify their core in the transfer market. With roughly half the roster out of contract, the management at least had wiggle room to invest. They targeted the highly talented Michael Valgren almost as soon as they heard that the Dane was on the market, while Roman Kreuziger and Enrico Gasparotto followed 'officially' after the Tour de France. While one could point to the fact that all signings filled the podium at Amstel Gold Race last year, the reality is that they provide very different skillsets. In Valgren - a rider Aldag had been keeping close tabs on for three years - the team has a rider who can perform on a number of terrains and who could be future a world champion if his ride at the Innsbruck Worlds last year is anything to go by. Kreuziger comes with the ability to compete in one-day races, but also provides much-needed mountain support to Meintjes in Grand Tours. Gasparotto - although nearer the end of his career than the start - gives the team another communication channel within the peloton and takes pressure off the directors when it comes to issuing instructions to the less experienced riders. ""The quality on the bike and leadership have come up another level. Michael is still young, but he knows what he wants. Roman is definitely a guy who is one of the most professional riders I've ever met. He really is one of the role models of professional cycling. That really helps,"" Aldag says. The team's second row was also strengthened. Danilo Wyss and Lars Bak - who Aldag knew from his Highroad days - are two highly underrated domestiques, while the move for Giacomo Nizzolo provided both extra cover in the sprints and a fresh pair of legs for Cavendish in the lead-out. The team also looked at Niki Terpstra, but a deal couldn't be reached. ""Giacomo is definitely a sprinter, not just a lead-out guy, and we want to see how far he gets. He's had difficult times, but I see them in multiple ways. He was leading out for John Degenkolb most of the time at Trek, and when he was sprinting he was mostly alone. ""Look at Viviani at Sky,"" Aldag says as a way of comparison. ""He was a good rider - no one ever questioned that. But he also didn't win 18 races at Sky. And then suddenly he comes into an environment where they look after sprinters, they have a plan, they give him a chance and build a train around him. So, I think Giacomo wants to prove himself, and he has a team that believes in him. But first, we need to help him recover from his knee injury."" It's unlikely Nizzolo can match the winning streak that Viviani produced in 2018. He's not the Olympic Omnium champion, and, with all due respect, Dimension Data is not a lead-out force in the same bracket as QuickStep. But as Aldag points out, Nizzolo picked up more WorldTour points in two months of the 2018 season than Dimension Data did in the first half of the season. He is ultimately an improvement. Another important element in the recruitment drive was the hunt for crucial ranking points. Given that Dimension Data have regularly struggled when it comes to the GC at races, and that the UCI's points system is tilted towards the overall standings in races rather than sprints, the team was always struggling to keep up with squads decked with top-10 regulars. ""Only a few teams can pay for the second row of winners,"" Aldag says. ""The rest of the teams live and die by their captains, but you also need to look at the UCI system. If they had enforced the relegation system, we'd have been out the last three years. Valgren had more points last year than we did as a team."" If points are the currency of success within modern cycling, then Dimension Data's desired aim of developing African talent remains their dream. However, reality can be harsh, and the simple fact is that the team has not been able to produce consistent performers from their home continent. The numbers back this up. In 2015, in the team's final season at Pro Continental level, the squad signed 24 riders, from which nine were South African, while a further five were from other African nations. Fast forward to 2019 and the roster has grown by three, yet there is one less South African and only one rider from another African nation. It's a delicate matter, and few professional teams work as hard as Dimension Data at establishing roots within a home community and provide a charitable outlet as a result. For that, the team should certainly be applauded. ""Our big focus is Qhubeka, but we have to support them by showing quality in races and not just quantity,"" Aldag says. However, idealism doesn't reward a team with ranking points and security. And for all the goodwill, there simply isn't enough time for the team to bring through as many African riders as they perhaps would like. For all the sport has done to globalise itself, it's still incredibly difficult, even from a logistical point of view, to secure visas for African riders at races such as the Tour Down Under or the Tour of California, for example. However, Aldag justifies the team's stance with the fact that a win for the team will always lead to greater rewards for the Qhubeka cause. ""We can't say out of principle that we'll have 50 per cent African riders. There is a need for points, the need to perform on the road, but also the need to perform for Qhubeka. If we go to the Tour with a full African team, there would be some really nice stories, but after stage 1, it's all about how you do against the other riders. The next story would be on the rest day and about how we have some guys still fighting to survive until Paris. ""But if you look at 2016, Cavendish won and wore yellow. He donated and auctioned his first ever yellow jersey, which was good to donate 260 bikes for Qhubeka. You can put that in numbers. Every time we win a bike race, you see a spike in donations. Get into the headlines, then bring your message."" Away from the new signings, the team were desperate to keep hold of Eisel, even with his advancing years and the uncertainty after his early-season head injury last year. Mark Renshaw was also given a new deal, while the future over Cavendish remained unclear until the late winter. The sprinter's plans were linked to Eisel, and there was genuine talk of a move that would have taken the pair to Bahrain-Merida. Although the Bahrain-Merida management were somewhat lukewarm on the idea - they had already signed Phil Bauhaus - they held two spots for the sprinter and the Austrian in case their new sponsor, McLaren, pushed for the pair to form part of the company's wider sponsorship commitments. Aldag played no part in the Cavendish negotiations, but the German was always keen on the sprinter remaining within Dimension Data. However, by the point at which a deal was finally struck, most of Dimension Data's budget had been soaked up in the pursuit of other transfers - such as Valgren - but Aldag was keen for everyone, including Cavendish, to move in the same direction. As far as Aldag was concerned, re-signing Cavendish was only part of the puzzle when it came to improving the team. ""Absolutely, and Bernie was one of the most important riders we re-signed. Internally, the riders look up to him and I think we're going to have to figure a way over time of finding a replacement. He gives all his know-how and passes it on. ""When it came to Mark, it was between him, Douglas and Dimension Data. But we know that there were alternatives for Mark and the team. So, ultimately, there was a lot of waiting from both sides. Did he want to change team and were there going to be changes in the team? So that's why it took so long - to make sure it made sense for both sides."" Cavendish wasn't the only star the team looked to rally around as the new season approached. Louis Meintjes was given a substantial contract to re-join the team from UAE Team Emirates at the end of 2017, but his first season back was an unmitigated disaster. The South African finished inside the top 10 in just one stage race he started, while his two Grand Tour efforts in Italy and Spain resulted in a DNF and 58th overall. Aldag admits that collective mistakes were made throughout the year and that the team effectively tried to alter an already successful formula with new methods in relation to the rider’s training and race programme. Too much time was spent at altitude camps, racing blocks were too long and too demanding, and by the time Meintjes was meant to hit peak form, he was drained. ""I think his preparation was too ambitious,"" Aldag admits after a year of hard knocks for the 26-year-old. ""He had a super-positive attitude and knew where he wanted to kick ass. And there was this mentality of doing everything 20 per cent better, and that would result in a podium at a Grand Tour or even two Grand Tours. And because of that, I think it was overdone. He should have started slower and not gone too extreme. And that was not just his own mistake but also the team's. ""He went to altitude training above 3,000m and came back super light. He did Algarve, Tirreno, Catalunya, and went to altitude again, but we didn't really give him the chance to recover. Then he went straight into the Tour of the Alps and then straight into recon for the Giro mountain stages. It was too much, too ambitious."" On stage 1 of the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana on Wednesday, Edvald Boasson Hagen took a shock win. It was the Norwegian's first time trial victory outside of a national title since the Tour of Qatar in 2016. With the fact that the UCI’s ranking system now rolls over points from 2018, and has incorporated races outside of the WorldTour, Dimension Data are on far more stable ground. Cavendish is building up slowly in South America, Valgren is racing without pressure, and the rest of the team are waiting in the wings for their opportunities. The new depth within the team, coupled with the chance to wipe the slate clean and start again, is clearly paying off. ""If you look at our signings, they are multi-talented. Valgren can win a stage at the Tour de France and Kreuziger can also win at big races,"" says Aldag. ""What does work is a little bit of internal competition, in a positive way. At Highroad, when Andre Greipel won in Paris-Nice, you could bet your life Cav would win the next day in Tirreno. It's not racing against each other - it's just getting more out of it and lifting team spirit. The race programme is so heavy - we race around 280 days or something - that you want to be present and competitive in multiple events at one time, and then we can add up our resources and bundle them together for the really important stuff. I think we can be competitive now in multiple events.""

David,Pulver,2388,https://www.colby.edu/news/2019/02/01/colby-college-establishes-pulver-science-scholars-program-with-5-million-commitment/,"February 1, 2019 At a time when competition for federal grant funding has never been greater, Colby College has established the Pulver Science Scholars Program, designed to create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue research at the nation’s top biomedical laboratories. Trustee David Pulver and his wife, Carol, made the $5-million commitment to help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health. The program will provide selected students with a set of experiences to prepare them to be scientific leaders and innovators. Working in tandem with the recently launched Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the Pulver Science Scholars Program will fund and facilitate high-level student research with Colby faculty at places like The Jackson Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, among others. After a research experience at The Jackson Laboratory as a student, Jocelyn Thomas ’16 is now a full-time research assistant at the leading biomedical research institution. For the first time in the post-World War II era, the federal government no longer funds the majority of the basic research done in the U.S. Federal funding dipped to just 44 percent of the research dollars awarded in 2015, down from more than 70 percent in the 1960s and ’70s. By training the most talented science students, the program will have a positive impact on potential life-saving discoveries and cures that could otherwise be delayed. “Funding challenges for research labs have led to constraints on research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students,” said Colby President David A. Greene. “These research assistantships are critical learning experiences for science students and are essential to scientists’ ability to make life-altering discoveries that could have immediate impacts on human health. The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders.” The Pulver Science Scholars Program will provide funding for science research by training the most promising liberal arts undergraduates to work alongside—and eventually become—world-class scientists tackling pressing health challenges such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Adding to Colby’s well-established undergraduate research program, Pulver Scholars will be given the opportunity, often in their first year, to work collaboratively with Colby science faculty. Students will ultimately join top research teams in the fields of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, statistics, computational biology, and other relevant disciplines. Research scientists report that funding challenges have restricted the number of research assistants they can employ. This program establishes a direct pathway that will supply a steady stream of high-achieving, well-trained students to ensure the productivity of important research labs. David Pulver, who graduated from Colby in 1963 and went on to run major national clothing brands, was inspired to establish the program by his own experience with bladder cancer. Pulver, cancer free for ten years, is the author, with his sister Fran and the expert guidance of Mark Schoenberg, M.D., of a guide for bladder-cancer patients. He sees the cross-disciplinary education offered at Colby as key to achieving significant progress on cancer and other public health challenges. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” said David Pulver. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” The program’s investments in scientific exploration will capitalize on Colby’s recent upgrades in high performance computing infrastructure, aided by a grant from the National Science Foundation. As medical research becomes increasingly data-driven, students must be able to work efficiently with large, complex data sets in rapidly evolving scientific fields. Pulver Scholars will have the tools and analytical skills necessary to achieve high levels of performance, reliability, and predictability for science applications. In addition to on- and off-campus research opportunities, the Pulver Science Scholars Program will fund a network-in-residence program to bring industry leaders to campus to engage and collaborate with the scholars. Events designed to build intellectual exchange and collaboration among the Pulver Science Scholars will also be offered. In 2018, Colby announced the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, which supports programs for students to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. A year earlier, the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change was established at Colby to support internships, research, and global experiences in issues broadly related to climate disruption. These initiatives, including the Pulver Science Scholars Program, support ongoing efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. Founded in 1813, Colby is one of America’s most selective colleges. Serving only undergraduates, Colby offers a rigorous academic program rooted in deep exploration of ideas and close interaction with world-class faculty scholars. Students pursue intellectual passions, choosing among 58 majors or developing their own. Colby’s innovative and ambitious campaign, Dare Northward, will support deeper connections between the College and the world and a fully inclusive experience for all Colby students. Colby is home to a community of 2,000 dedicated and diverse students from more than 80 countries. Its Waterville, Maine, location provides unique access to world-class research institutions and civic engagement experiences.

Jessica,Stanton,2373,https://wellesley.wickedlocal.com/news/20190130/submit-work-to-sustainability-challenge-2019,"Sustainability Challenge 2019 is now open for students to participate by submitting their ideas. The Sustainability Challenge (Wellesley STEM Expo/ Wellesley Education Foundation) welcomes submissions by K-12 students who are residents of Wellesley and/ or enrolled at Wellesley Public Schools. The challenge asks students to work of a project promoting a local resource, policy or behavior change that makes Wellesley greener; this can be in the form of an advertisement, op-ed or essay, video commercial, infographic, poem, music or another form of audio/visual artwork — convince your audience that it’s a great way for them to help the environment. Furthermore, each entry must explain the problem that a current local resource or policy in Wellesley, or a behavior change you are proposing, aims to help solve. The entry must provide a convincing argument for the positive impact this resource or activity can make. Here are some questions to answer: • What environmental problems does this organization/resource/behavior change help solve? Provide data or examples of how the environment is negatively impacted by this problem. • What is the positive impact of your topic? How does it help solve the problem? Be as specific and concrete as possible. • What can Wellesley residents do to help or how can they participate? Convince them this resource deserves their support or participation. Last year students submitted projects that included green energy such as solar and wind power, devised ways by which to reduce pollution, recycle and reduce our carbon footprint. This years key organizers include Kelly Caiazzo and Naglaa El-Abbadi and Jessica Stanton. When asked why this is important — both the Sustainability Challenge and the environment, Caiazzo said, “the challenges our environment faces can feel pretty grim, whether it’s plastic in our oceans or gas leaks right here in our town. It’s important not just to cultivate awareness of the problems, but to highlight potential solutions. We wanted a Sustainability Challenge that would encourage students in Wellesley to learn more about existing environmental practises in town, or about behavior changes people can make. We hope students of all ages in Wellesley will learn the importance of protecting our environment, and also know that many organizations in Wellesley are working towards positive change and could use their help. Whatever students care about most, there are likely organizations right here in town that they could join or work with. As environmentalists, we don’t have to work alone; we’re stronger together! We hope this Sustainability Challenge will inspire students and their families to get involved.” “There are many changes and habits that individuals, families and the community as a whole can make that together add up to great benefits for the environment,” El-Abbadi said. “Our town is fortunate to have great people and resources dedicated to programs such as transitioning to renewable energy, environmental food programs, diverting organic waste to compost or biofuel, reducing pesticide use, and many others. By highlighting these Sustainable Wellesley initiatives as part of the WEF Sustainability Challenge, we hope to channel the ingenuity of our students to bring these issues into focus in creative and engaging ways, as well as empower them to recognize the positive differences they can make through their own sustainability-oriented behaviors.” “Wellesley has always considered itself to be a leader in many areas — including in education and care for the environment,” Stanton, a longtime proponent of Wellesley-sustainability said. “WEF’s Sustainability Challenge creates a link between the two and provides students with an opportunity for truly creative, out of the box thinking about how and why our town and residents care about the natural world. Students these days are growing up under the cloud of climate change and that can be fairly scary. This challenge allows them to understand how they can participate in the solution and highlights that small changes in thinking and behavior can add up to some pretty substantial impact and encourages others to be part of the solution too.” Sustainability Challenge finalists will be recognized and awarded at Wellesley STEM Expo on April 6.

Phillip,Frost,2400,https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Stanford-Lands-25-Million-for/245604%3Fcid%3Dcpfd_home,"By Maria Di Mento A roundup of notable gifts compiled by the Chronicle: Marilyn Hohbach gave $25 million through her Harold C. and Marilyn A. Hohbach Foundation to establish a research center focused on the university’s archive of more than 300 collections related to the history and development of Silicon Valley. The money will also be used to endow the Silicon Valley Archive program and create new classrooms and spaces for group study, seminars, events, and exhibitions. Hohbach is the widow of Harold Hohbach, a patent attorney and prominent real-estate developer in Palo Alto, who died in 2017. Brett and Louise Samsky donated $11 million to create the Samsky Invasive Cardiovascular Services Center. Brett Samsky is chief executive of Credigy, a financial firm in Atlanta. He has been a Piedmont Atlanta Hospital patient over the years and underwent heart surgery there several years ago. The couple gave the organization $6 million in 2015 to establish the Samsky Advanced Heart Failure Center at Piedmont Heart Institute. Phillip and Patricia Frost pledged $10 million to endow the dermatology department that will be named the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. Phillip Frost leads OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He previously founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, a generic-drug manufacturer that he sold to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 for $7.4 billion. A physician by training, he completed his residency at the university’s Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. The Frosts have been giving to the university since 1989. In 2016 they gave $100 million for applied sciences and engineering, and they have appeared on the Chronicle’s Philanthropy 50 list of big donors several times since 2003. Charles Phipps committed $5 million to endow the Charles H. Phipps Dean at the Case School of Engineering. Phipps is partner emeritus at Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture-capital firm in Dallas. He earned a degree in electrical engineering from the Case Institute of Technology in 1949 and worked at Texas Instruments for 30 years, eventually becoming the director of strategy. He has been a longtime donor to the university and in 2011 gave $2 million to establish the Phipps Endowment Fund, which supports the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. John and Susan Sobrato donated $5 million to help pay for the construction of a new medical office building, to be called the Sobrato Pavilion, which is expected to open in the fall. The Sobratos founded Sobrato Development Company, a commercial real estate and development firm in Palo Alto, Calif. They have given extensively to nonprofits in the Silicon Valley region with a focus on helping low-income families and providing rent-free office space to local charities. They appeared on the Philanthropy 50 in 2106. Joel and Gail Morrison Morganroth gave $5 million for the Sky Garden, a vertical garden and visitor-services building that will house a stormwater-management system and generate energy to power the organization’s renovation efforts. Joel Morganroth is a cardiologist who founded the company that became eResearchTechnology, or ERT, a medical data and technology corporation.

Jessica,Stanton,2418,http://www.hometownweekly.net/uncategorized/sustainability-challenge-seeks-submissions/,"By Rama K. Ramaswamy Wellesley has a unique and longstanding history of environmental conservation. For example, Wellesley is the longest running Tree City USA community in Massachusetts and boasts 26 miles of marked trails interconnecting open spaces and conservation lands. The idea that humans cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around them has often been the focal point of discussion by conservationists such as Jane Goodall and members of Wellesley Green Schools (WGS) alike. ""Wellesley has always considered itself to be a leader in many areas - including in education and care for the environment,” explained Jessica Stanton, a longtime WGS member and one of the founders of the Sustainability Challenge. “WEF’s [Wellesley Education Foundation’s] Sustainability Challenge creates a link between the two and provides students with an opportunity for truly creative, out-of-the-box thinking about how and why our town and residents care about the natural world. Students these days are growing up under the cloud of climate change, and that can be fairly scary. This challenge allows them to understand how they can participate in the solution and highlights that small changes in thinking and behavior can add up to some pretty substantial impact and encourages others to be part of the solution, too.” Sustainability Challenge 2019 is now welcoming submissions by K-12 students who are residents of Wellesley and/or enrolled at Wellesley Public Schools. The Challenge asks students to work on a project promoting a local resource, policy or behavior change that makes Wellesley greener. This can be in the form of an advertisement, op-ed or essay, video commercial, infographic, poem, music, or another form of audio/visual artwork. Students are asked to convince their audience that it’s a great way for them to help the environment. Furthermore, each entry must explain the problem that a current local resource or policy in Wellesley, or a proposed behavioral change, aims to help solve. The entry must provide a convincing argument for the positive impact this resource or activity can make. The questions to answer in the entry are as follows: What environmental problems does this organization/resource/behavior change help solve? Provide data or examples of how the environment is negatively impacted by this problem. What is the positive impact of your topic? How does it help solve the problem? Be as specific and concrete as possible. What can Wellesley residents do to help or how can they participate? Convince them this resource deserves their support or participation. Last year, students submitted projects that included green energy, devised ways by which to reduce pollution, recycle, reduce the community’s carbon footprint, and more. “Whether wind or solar power, this is our time, this is our hour,” said 2017 Sustainability Challenge finalist Noa Lil Helmbrecht. This year's key organizers for the Sustainability Challenge also include Kelly Caiazzo and Naglaa El-Abbadi. “The challenges our environment faces can feel pretty grim, whether it’s plastic in our oceans or gas leaks right here in our town,” explained Caiazzo. “It’s important not just to cultivate awareness of the problems, but to highlight potential solutions. We wanted a Sustainability Challenge that would encourage students in Wellesley to learn more about existing environmental practices in town, or about behavior changes people can make. We hope students of all ages in Wellesley will learn the importance of protecting our environment, and also know that many organizations in Wellesley are working towards positive change and could use their help. Whatever students care about most, there are likely organizations right here in town that they could join or work with. As environmentalists, we don’t have to work alone; we’re stronger together! We hope this Sustainability Challenge will inspire students and their families to get involved"". “There are many changes and habits that individuals, families, and the community as a whole can make that together add up to great benefits for the environment,” added El-Abbadi. “Our town is fortunate to have great people and resources dedicated to programs such as transitioning to renewable energy, environmental food programs, diverting organic waste to compost or biofuel, reducing pesticide use, and many others. By highlighting these Sustainable Wellesley initiatives as part of the WEF Sustainability Challenge, we hope to channel the ingenuity of our students to bring these issues into focus in creative and engaging ways, as well as empower them to recognize the positive differences they can make through their own sustainability-oriented behaviors.” Sustainability Challenge finalists will be recognized and awarded at Wellesley STEM Expo on April 6.

David,Pulver,2404,https://www.centralmaine.com/2019/02/04/pulver-funds-will-support-40-colby-students-research-each-year/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers A recent $5 million donation from David and Carol Pulver will bring experts to Mayflower Hill and finance biomedical research done by Colby College students. The first recipients of the award, selected based on high school achievement, will be members of the Class of 2024, according to the college's communications office. WATERVILLE — Ten students in each Colby College class, starting with the Class of 2024, will receive scholarship funding from the new Pulver Science Scholars Program, according to the school’s Vice President for Communications Ruth Jackson. The college announced the creation of the program along with a $5 million commitment from alumnus and trustee David Pulver and his wife, Carol, on Friday afternoon. It is designed to “help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health” by subsidizing on- and off- campus student biomedical research as well as bringing prominent experts to campus to engage with the recipients. It will not cover tuition or room and board costs, which hover around $69,400 per year, according to a pamphlet from the college. Candidates will be selected upon admission to Colby based on their demonstrated achievement in the sciences during high school. Applicants’ socioeconomic status is not a determining factor, according to Jackson. “The Pulver Science Scholars Program supports the experiences — not demonstrated financial need — for these students to attend Colby,” Jackson wrote in an email to the Morning Sentinel. All prospective students — including those admitted during early decision — will be eligible for the funds. When the program is fully rolled out in five years time, a total of 40 students will be enrolled in the Pulver Science Scholars Program, said Jackson. Colby has an annual matriculation of about 2,000. A competitive liberal arts institution, it accepted 13 percent of 12,313 first-year applicants last year, according to its Class of 2022 profile. Jackson noted that the Pulver funding is one of the college’s only merit-based awards distributed to incoming freshmen. She maintained that all of Colby’s financial aid is need-based, and the school touts a vow to meet 100 percent of accepted students’ demonstrated financial need without requiring loans. Its Presidential Scholars Program is the other main source of funds granted to first-years “based on their scholarly achievement in high school,” Jackson said. There are about 30 Presidential Scholars in each class. “It supports additional opportunities, not financial aid,” Jackson said of the Presidential Scholars Program. Recipients have access to paid fellowship opportunities with Colby faculty during their first year and can access grants of up to $3,000 during the summer of their sophomore or junior years or during a January term. The school also offers at least three merit-based scholarship programs specifically for students from underrepresented communities, including Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences, the Posse Program and the Ralph J. Bunche Scholarship Program. The Pulver Science Scholars Program is specifically science-oriented. It was created in part to combat heightened competition for federal research funding, which the college’s Friday news release noted has dropped to 44 percent of the amount awarded in 2015. Colby’s president, David Greene, stated that institutions have been able to hire fewer research assistants as a result. “The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders,” he wrote in the announcement. Pulver scholars will work with scientists at Jackson Laboratory, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in addition to members of Colby’s faculty. The new program marks Colby’s third major financial commitment to the sciences in the past three years. In 2018, it introduced the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation — which funds biotechnology-, biomedicine-, biochemistry-, ocean sciences-, genomics- and bioinformatics-related research — and internship or travel opportunities for students during summer or January terms. In 2017, it created the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change to finance similar opportunities for students interested in climate disruption. David Pulver decided to contribute the multi-million dollar gift partially out of gratitude for the medical technology involved with his recovery from bladder cancer 10 years ago. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” said David Pulver. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” Meg Robbins — 861-9239 [email protected] Twitter: @megrobbins Send questions/comments to the editors.

WATERVILLE — Colby College has received a $5 million donation to support student biomedical research, marking the school’s third major financial commitment to the sciences in the past three years. Trustee and alumnus David Pulver and his wife, Carol, committed the money, which will be used to create the Pulver Science Scholars Program, according to a news release from the college Friday afternoon. The program aims to “help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health.” It is unclear how many students will be able to use the money each year and when applications for the program will open. Colby currently enrolls about 2,000 undergraduate students. It consistently has been ranked as one of the nation’s top liberal arts institutions. The college noted that the biomedical science-focused program was designed in part to combat heightened competition for federal grants. “Federal funding dipped to just 44 percent of the research dollars awarded in 2015, down from more than 70 percent in the 1960s and ’70s,” the release notes. “By training the most talented science students, the program will have a positive impact on potential life-saving discoveries and cures that could otherwise be delayed.” Colby President David Greene stated that the decline in federal funding has constrained research opportunities for the college’s undergraduates, including by reducing the number of research assistants institutions are able to hire. “The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders,” he wrote. As part of the new program, selected students will work closely with members of the Colby science faculty and at local laboratories, including Jackson Laboratory, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory. The funds also will bring industry leaders to campus to collaborate with students. Pulver noted that his personal battle against bladder cancer 10 years ago motivated him to support students who are interested in researching treatments and cures for a range of human diseases and conditions. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” he said. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” In 2018, Colby rolled out the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, which supports research, internship and travel opportunities in the summer or January term for students pursuing careers in biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics and bioinformatics. In 2017, it introduced the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change to finance similar opportunities in fields related to climate disruption. “These initiatives, including the Pulver Science Scholars Program, support ongoing efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all regardless of their financial means,” Friday’s news release stated.

Phillip,Frost,2384,https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/01/1708914/0/en/Future-Non-Coverage-Determination-for-4Kscore-Test-Posted-by-Novitas.html,"MIAMI, Jan. 31, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) today announced that Novitas Solutions, Inc. has issued a notice of a future non-coverage determination for the 4Kscore test® to be effective March 20, 2019. The notice released by Novitas today does not appear to be different from the draft local coverage determination released by Novitas on May 18, 2018. OPKO is evaluating options to appeal the decision and undertake other steps with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in an effort to have this determination rescinded or reversed. “The 4Kscore test is proven to offer significant benefits to patients. It can identify men at higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer who will benefit from a prostate biopsy, while also helping to avoid biopsies in men who are at low risk,” said Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We remain committed to our goal of widespread and affordable access to 4Kscore. Our test provides an additional important tool in the prostate cancer diagnostic paradigm and helps guide treatment decisions for both physicians and patients. We have also been working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and intend to submit the 4Kscore test to the FDA next quarter for approval.” “The 4Kscore test has become an invaluable component to my evaluation of patients with an elevated serum PSA,” stated Mitchell Benson, M.D., Herbert and Florence Irving Professor of Urology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital. “The results of the test dictate the judicious use of prostate MRI and is used to determine the need for prostate biopsy. The 4Kscore test is integral to the care of my patients.” This determination by Novitas was made despite widespread support for the test from leading urologists. The 4Kscore test has been included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines® (NCCN) since 2015 and the European Association of Urology Prostate Cancer Guidelines since 2016. Recommendations for inclusion in these guidelines to provide clinical standards for prostate cancer care are based upon the assessment by expert panels of peer-reviewed literature. Both guidelines recommend that the 4Kscore test be used as an aid in decision making before a first or repeat prostate biopsy in men with elevated PSA or other clinical symptoms. The 4Kscore test has 95% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for the identification of aggressive prostate cancer in the patient population recommended by the NCCN. We have and will continue to commit substantial efforts to obtaining broad reimbursement coverage for the 4Kscore test. We have obtained a positive coverage decision from at least one national private payor and pricing agreements from several regional payors. The 4Kscore test has been ordered by more than 12,000 practicing physicians worldwide, with over 200,000 tests ordered and extensively studied in more than 25,000 patients with results presented in 18 peer-reviewed scientific publications. Results of five new studies covering the 4Kscore test were presented at the American Urological Association's 2018 Annual Meeting, including a study demonstrating the test’s ability to stratify risk of prostate cancer mortality in men with elevated PSA. Novitas serves as the Medicare Administrative Contractor for a jurisdiction that includes the State of New Jersey, where OPKO’s BioReference Laboratories is located and where all 4Kscore test samples are processed. About OPKO Health, Inc. OPKO Health is a diversified healthcare company. In diagnostics, its BioReference Laboratories is the nation's third largest clinical laboratory; GeneDx is a rapidly growing genetic testing business; the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test is used to confirm an elevated PSA to help decide about next steps such as prostate biopsy; Claros® 1 is a point-of-care diagnostics platform with PSA and testosterone as the most advanced in development.

OPK88003, a once-weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity in Phase 2 clinical trials, is among a new class of GLP-1 – glucagon receptor dual agonists.

Phillip,Frost,2364,http://med.miami.edu/news/university-of-miami-establishes-dr.-phillip-frost-department-of-dermatology,"02.27.2019 Miller School of Medicine Departments and Centers Miller School Departments, Centers and Institutes Close The University of Miami is naming its distinguished dermatology department the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery in recognition of alumnus and renowned South Florida philanthropist Phillip Frost, M.D. The department, part of the University’s Miller School of Medicine and known for its innovation, discovery, clinical care, and development of leaders, will receive a $10 million endowment. Dr. Frost recently announced the transformational gift with an eye toward advancing innovative treatments and cures in dermatology. The gift is the culmination of his lifetime of dedication to medicine, particularly in dermatology and medical entrepreneurship. “Patricia and I are here in Florida because of the Department of Dermatology at UM. When I was working as a clinical associate at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Harvey Blank, the chairman of the Department, came to Bethesda to invite me to come to Miami to join the Department. This was an offer we’re glad we couldn’t and didn’t refuse,” said Dr. Frost, who, along with his wife, Patricia, is a champion for science, the arts, and education in South Florida. Dr. Frost’s longstanding relationship with the University spans nearly six decades. After receiving his medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he completed his residency at UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. “Patricia and Phil Frost have helped to transform leading institutions across South Florida,” said University of Miami President Julio Frenk. “The University of Miami is grateful for their extraordinary and meaningful support at the highest levels and across a diverse spectrum of disciplines.” “Before Dr. Frost became a giant in industry, he was a dermatology icon whose research continues to impact clinical care,” said Robert S. Kirsner, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Blank Professor and chair of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. “Dr. Frost’s gift, the associated prestige and the confidence Dr. Frost has demonstrated in our Department, will empower our current and future clinicians and scientists to improve patients’ lives beyond the Miller School of Medicine.” The Frosts’ philanthropic support of the University began in 1989, when they made gifts establishing the Patricia L. Frost Professorship of Music, which is bestowed on the dean of the music school, the Anna Frost Music Scholarship Fund, and the Abraham Frost Prize in Music Composition. In 2003, the University renamed its music school the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music in recognition of a $33 million gift, the largest ever given to a university-based music school in the United States. In 2015, the state-of-the-art Patricia Louise Frost Music Studios complex opened on the Coral Gables campus. And the Frosts also donated $1 million to establish an endowment to support the “Band of the Hour” marching band and $1 million to name the Donna E. Shalala MusicReach Program in honor of the former UM president. In 2016, the Frosts solidified their philanthropic legacy at the University with a landmark $100 million gift to support path-breaking research in science and engineering. Henri R. Ford, M.D., MHA, dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School, said the Frosts’ gift “is a critical step toward accelerating the innovative research taking place in the Department of Dermatology, helping us to promote team science and advance the field. We are extremely grateful for this investment.” Frost is CEO and chair of OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest U.S. generic drug manufacturers, selling the company to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 while continuing to serve on the TEVA board until 2015. “We applaud Dr. Frost for his generous gift and his vision,” said Edward Abraham, M.D., executive vice president for health affairs and CEO of UHealth. “This investment will be transformative in helping UHealth build another destination program that draws patients from across the region, because of its innovative clinical expertise.” Dr. Frost has been a member of UM’s Board of Trustees since 1983 and served as board chair. He also served as campaign chair for UM’s first Momentum fundraising campaign. He currently is a member of the UHealth and School of Law visiting committees, and both he and Patricia serve on the Frost School of Music Board of Advisors.

Full Year 2018 Financial Highlights** **All comparisons versus full year 2017. NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. “The fourth quarter was one of our best quarters ever for year over year market share gains, as well as volume growth in Open Trading™,” said Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. “The liquidity pool provided by Open Trading was increasingly valuable as credit spreads widened, leading to record estimated transaction cost savings for our clients of $57 million for the quarter. I am very happy to welcome Chris Concannon to MarketAxess as our President and COO to kick off the new year.” Fourth Quarter Results Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 14.1% to $112.4 million, compared to $98.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating income was $54.0 million, compared to $48.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.5%. Operating margin was 48.0%, compared to 49.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $45.8 million, or $1.21 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $33.5 million, or $0.88 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.3% to $101.4 million, compared to $88.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 17.0% to $76.6 million on total trading volume of $442.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $65.4 million on total trading volume of $355.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 19.3% for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. All other revenue increased 4.0% to $11.0 million, compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, principally due to higher information services revenue of $0.3 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.2 million. Total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17.6% to $58.5 million, compared to $49.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Occupancy costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $2.1 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.05. Other income increased to $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a $0.9 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 18.3%, compared to 32.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected $1.9 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. The fourth quarter of 2017 income tax provision includes a one-time tax charge totaling $11.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was signed into law in December 2017, offset by excess tax benefits of $11.4 million related to a new share-based compensation accounting standard (ASU 2016-09) adopted as of January 1, 2017.

U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 18.1%, compared to an estimated 16.9% for 2017. All other revenue increased 17.3% to $44.7 million in 2018, compared to $38.1 million for 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $4.3 million and information services revenue of $2.4 million. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 15.1% to $223.0 million, compared to $193.8 million for 2017. The increase in total expenses was principally due to higher occupancy costs of $8.1 million, employee compensation and benefits costs of $6.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million, technology and communication costs of $3.8 million and marketing and advertising costs of $2.4 million. Occupancy costs in 2018 included duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $7.3 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.15. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 20.7%, compared to 26.6% for 2017. The 2018 income tax provision reflected $5.6 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. The 2017 income tax provision included $26.1 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards offset by the one-time tax charge of $11.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.51 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on February 27, 2019 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 13, 2019. Share Repurchases A total of 30,106 shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.2 million. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new two-year share repurchase program for up to $100 million. The Company expects the plan to commence in April 2019 following the expiration of the current plan. Balance Sheet Data As of December 31, 2018, total assets were $695.5 million and included $486.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2018 was $607.9 million. Guidance for 2019 For 2019, the Company is providing the following guidance: Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items To supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and free cash flow.

Help shape the future of investing tools and receive a $60 prize! The risk of investing in the stock market is a systematic crash. This is when all the stock prices start falling around the same time. But this risk is also an opportunity for those that understand the fickle nature of the market. High quality, proven companies tend to stick around in the long run, although their share price may be temporarily impacted by a crash. This is the best time to buy stocks like MarketAxess Holdings Inc. at a discount. See our latest analysis for MarketAxess Holdings MarketAxess Holdings Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates an electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments worldwide. Founded in 2000, and led by CEO Richard McVey, the company provides employment to 429.00 people and with the company’s market cap sitting at US$8.1b, it falls under the mid-cap category. Generally, large-cap stocks are well-resourced and well-established meaning that a bear market will cause it to rejig some short-term capital allocations, but stock market volatility is hardly detrimental to its financial health and business operations. Therefore large-cap stocks are a safe bet to buy more of when the wider market is going down and down. With zero debt on its balance sheet, MarketAxess Holdings isn’t constrained to debt obligations and covenants, which can be burdensome during financial downturns. Highly-levered companies have to maintain a cash cushion to meet near-term interest payments as well as meet unforeseen circumstances. With no lenders’ needs to tend to, MarketAxess Holdings enjoys financial flexibility and independence – an invaluable position to be in during bear markets. Its cash and short-term investment is also sufficient to cover other upcoming liabilities, which means MKTX is financially robust in the face of a volatile market. MKTX’s year-on-year earnings growth has been positive over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of 20%, outperfoming the industry growth rate of 14%. It has also returned an ROE of 28% recently, above the industry return of 18%. Characteristics I value in a long term investment are proven in MarketAxess Holdings, and I can continue to sleep easy at night with the stock as part of my portfolio.

Opko will use the proceeds from the issue for its activity and to repay earlier debt. The company had $317 million in current liabilities, and had $43 million in cash at the end of the third quarter of 2018. Opko subsequently raised $92 million in a financing round led by an entity associated with CEO and controlling shareholder Dr. Phillip Frost. Opko also signed a $60 million line of credit with an entity associated with Frost. Yesterday's announcement followed a tumultuous period for Opko, during which the company published three announcements (probably in order to make sure that its issue is held with all the relevant information being disclosed). Opko first reported a decision by Novitas Solutions, an important US insurance concern, not to grant insurance reimbursement for Opko's kScore4 product. Novitas asserted that Opko had not proved the importance of its test for decisions about treatment of prostate cancer. Later that same day, Opko reported failure in a trial of its OPK-88004 product for preventing the absorption of male hormones in the prostate, while encouraging their absorption in the rest of the body, thereby reducing the risk of benign and malignant prostate tumors, improving muscle mass, and reducing body fat. The trial revealed failure in measuring the prostate with enough precision to produce significant results from the trial. Furthermore, safety problems at high dosages of the product were found. The current trial was discontinued, and Opko is considering other options for the product. Opko finally reported positive news: approval of its new product - a PSA test for detecting high risk of prostate cancer with in a few minutes in a doctor's clinic, instead of a test in a central laboratory taking days or weeks.

Rick,McVey,2375,https://www.marketsmedia.com/marketaxess-aims-for-emerging-markets-growth/,"Craig McLeod, head of emerging markets product management, CEEMEA & Asia at MarketAxess, said the fixed income platform could add thousands more clients in the next decade as electronic trading continues to grow. McLeod joined MarketAxess last September from the buy side. He had previously been head of fixed income and foreign exchange trading at Investec Asset Management. He told Markets Media: “The problem for the buy side is that a lot of liquidity has moved from the big banks post-2008, noticeably shifting into the inventories of regional and local emerging market participants. More and more buy-side clients have therefore begun to partner with MarketAxess, as our Open Trading platform gives them easy access to this fragmented liquidity.” Open Trading is MarketAxess’ all-to-all trading model which allows multiple parties in a network to come together to trade, rather than the traditional model of only banks supplying liquidity to the buy side. Craig McLeod, MarketAxess “We strongly believe that it’s possible to add thousands more clients to Open Trading in the next decade so there is huge growth potential,” added McLeod. Kevin McPartland, head of research for market structure and technology at consultancy Greenwich Associates, estimated in a report last year that 15% of emerging market hard currency bond trading in US dollars or euros on MarketAxess is through the Open Trading platform. He was the author of Greenwich’s study, Emerging Market Bond Traders Embrace E-Trading, which found that 70% of US investors are trading emerging market fixed income products electronically, amounting to 14% of the notional volume traded. “US investors favor MarketAxess here, which is not surprising, given they are the market share leader in US investment grade and high-yield bonds,” McPartland added. “The top dealers trading on the emerging market platforms differ little from the top dealers in emerging market bonds overall, with Barclays, Jefferies and JP Morgan the most used electronic counterparties by the US investors in our study.” The research showed that nearly one third of asset managers and half of the hedge funds in the US expect their volumes in emerging markets fixed income to increase in the coming year and at least 70% of those investors will execute some trades electronically. Kevin McPartland, Greenwich Associates McPartland wrote: “Technology is increasing the flow of information, removing the language hurdle and connecting disparate brokers and investors from all over the world, allowing trades to consummate that only a few years ago would have been too expensive, if not impossible, to get done.” Growth strategy McLeod continued that MarketAxess currently covers all emerging markets hard currency sovereign and corporate bonds. “Rollout to 26 emerging market local currency debt countries on Open Trading started in 2018, with Poland and South Africa, and we expect three more countries will debut by the end of this quarter,” said McLeod. Local currency trading has become an increasing proportion of MarketAxess’ overall emerging markets volumes. Last November MarketAxess said local currency trading represented approximately 30% of emerging market activity in the third quarter of 2018. McLeod added that priorities in emerging markets are to expand Open Trading to more local markets; roll out automated execution features for emerging market products and to improve block trading by making “request for market” (RFM) more prominent. Investors trading emerging market local currency bonds can use an RFM inquiry and receive two-way pricing, which allows them to trade in larger size. In November last year MarketAxess said more than $14.2bn (€12.4bn) had been traded via the RFM protocol in the year-to-date, up 78% from 2017. “RFM volumes crept up in November and we have found that it is a very powerful protocol for trading in volatile markets – just like Open Trading itself,” said McLeod. “It is currently at the user’s discretion as to whether they use RFQ or RFM. We are currently considering analytics to guide users on how to gauge which protocol will help them fulfil their best execution obligations.” Results MarketAxess reported its 2018 full year results today and said the firm had achieved its tenth consecutive year of record full year trading volume, revenue and operating income. Adoption of #OpenTrading accelerated during 4Q18 with volumes up 96% to a #record level of $188 billion. #OpenTrading represented 27% of overall platform volume in 4Q18, up from 17% last year. https://t.co/UcJQpfAh3l pic.twitter.com/h4oeQvWYws — MarketAxess (@MarketAxess) January 30, 2019 Emerging market volume was $378bn, up 23.3% on 2017, with local markets trading volume up 35%. In addition, Open Trading reached an all time high of $117.5bn last year, up 96.5% from 2017. Rick McVey, MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey, chairman and chief executive of MarketAxess, said in a statement: “The fourth quarter was one of our best quarters ever for year over year market share gains, as well as volume growth in Open Trading. The liquidity pool provided by Open Trading was increasingly valuable as credit spreads widened, leading to record estimated transaction cost savings for our clients of $57m for the quarter. I am very happy to welcome Chris Concannon to MarketAxess as our president and chief operating officer to kick off the new year.” And receive exclusive articles on securities markets Fixed income is trying to shed its caveman image.

Phillip,Frost,2364,https://news.miami.edu/stories/2019/01/transformational-gift-names-dermatology-department.html,"The University of Miami is naming its distinguished dermatology department the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery in recognition of renowned South Florida philanthropist Phillip Frost. The department, part of the University’s Miller School of Medicine and known for its innovation, discovery, clinical care, and development of leaders, will receive a $10 million endowment. Frost recently announced the transformational gift with an eye toward advancing innovative treatments and cures in dermatology. The gift is the culmination of his lifetime of dedication to medicine, particularly in dermatology and medical entrepreneurship. “Patricia and I are here in Florida because of the Department of Dermatology at UM. When I was working as a clinical associate at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Harvey Blank, the chairman of the Department, came to Bethesda to invite me to come to Miami to join the Department. This was an offer we’re glad we couldn’t and didn’t refuse,” said Frost, who, along with his wife, Patricia, is a champion for science, the arts, and education in South Florida. Frost’s longstanding relationship with the University spans nearly six decades. After receiving his medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he completed his residency at UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. “Patricia and Phil Frost have helped to transform leading institutions across South Florida,” said University of Miami President Julio Frenk. “The University of Miami is grateful for their extraordinary and meaningful support at the highest levels and across a diverse spectrum of disciplines.” “Before Dr. Frost became a giant in industry, he was a dermatology icon whose research continues to impact clinical care,” said Dr. Robert S. Kirsner, Harvey Blank Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. “Dr. Frost’s gift, the associated prestige, and the confidence Dr. Frost has demonstrated in our Department will empower our current and future clinicians and scientists to improve patients’ lives beyond the Miller School of Medicine.” The Frosts’ philanthropic support of the University began in 1989, when they made gifts establishing the Patricia L. Frost Professorship of Music, which is bestowed on the dean of the music school, the Anna Frost Music Scholarship Fund, and the Abraham Frost Prize in Music Composition. In 2003, the University renamed its music school the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music in recognition of a $33 million gift, the largest ever given to a university-based music school in the United States. In 2015, the state-of-the-art Patricia Louise Frost Music Studios complex opened on the Coral Gables campus. And the Frosts also donated $1 million to establish an endowment to support the “Band of the Hour” marching band and $1 million to name the Donna E. Shalala MusicReach Program in honor of the former UM president. In 2016, the Frosts solidified their philanthropic legacy at the University with a landmark $100 million gift to support path-breaking research in science and engineering. Dr. Henri R. Ford, dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School, said the Frosts’ gift “is a critical step toward accelerating the innovative research taking place in the Department of Dermatology, helping us to promote team science and advance the field. We are extremely grateful for this investment.” Frost is CEO and chair of OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest U.S. generic drug manufacturers, selling the company to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 while continuing to serve on the TEVA board until 2015. “We applaud Dr. Frost for his generous gift and his vision,” said Dr. Edward Abraham, executive vice president for health affairs and CEO of UHealth. “This investment will be transformative in helping UHealth build another destination program that draws patients from across the region, because of its innovative clinical expertise.” Frost has been a member of UM’s Board of Trustees since 1983 and served as board chair. He also served as campaign chair for UM’s first Momentum fundraising campaign. He currently is a member of the UHealth and School of Law visiting committees, and both he and Patricia serve on the Frost School of Music Board of Advisors. Copyright: 2019 University of Miami.

Peter,Lunder,2440,https://www.centralmaine.com/2019/02/08/colby-museum-adds-three-rembrandt-etchings-to-collection/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The donation brings the college's total number of prints by the Dutch master to 12. The Colby College Museum of Art has acquired three etchings by Rembrandt, bringing its holdings of prints by the Dutch master to 12. The newly acquired prints come to the museum as a gift from longtime benefactors Paula and Peter Lunder. Colby President David Greene announced the acquisition at an event in Portland on Friday hosted by the Portland Press Herald. Rembrandt made the etchings in the mid-1600s, and all are relatively small. The largest, “A Scholar in His Study (Faust),” is about 9 inches by 7 inches. The others are the size of postcards. Rembrandt made these prints more 350 years ago, “but they look as if they were printed as recently as yesterday. They are fresh and vibrant,” said Colby museum director Sharon Corwin. “Rembrandt was a master for a reason. You can see his facility and his mastery of the medium. The detail he is able to get into the etched line, that is where the magic comes in.” The prints are not yet on view. One arrived in January, another was delivered this week and the third is due to arrive at the Waterville museum soon. The museum could not provide images of the artwork. Rembrandt was skilled at painting, drawing and printmaking. While his paintings are worth millions of dollars, his prints hold far less value. Colby College would not discuss the value of the newly acquired prints, but Rembrandt prints generally sell for between a few thousands dollars apiece to $100,000 or more at auction. Art scholars believe he made about 300 etchings. He died in 1669 at age 63. The smaller prints donated by the Lunders are “Christ Returning from the Temple with His Parents,” made in 1654, and “Woman Bathing Her Feet at a Brook,” from 1658. During Rembrandt’s time, a small etching was similar to a photograph today and was considered a key form of cross-cultural communication. During his life, he was better known for his prints than his paintings. He often depicted landscapes, biblical scenes and portraits. The newly acquired Rembrandt prints add to a growing print collection at Colby, which already includes nine Rembrandt prints donated by the Lunders, as well as works by Picasso, Dürer, Goya and James McNeil Whistler, who was influenced by Rembrandt. Justin McCann, a Colby curator, said the prints will serve Colby’s art community well. “We have printmakers here, and students in the studio-art classes and art history classes will learn from them, as well,” he said, calling Rembrandt’s line work and printing “exquisite.” At the event in Portland on Friday – part of the newspaper’s Like A Boss series of live interviews with local leaders – Greene called the Lunders “the most amazing people in the world” and credited them for caring so deeply about Maine “that they are investing in it in just incredible ways, completely transforming institutions and opportunities for people in this state.” The Lunders have given Colby numerous gifts of cash and art. Both serve on the museum’s board of governors and are former Waterville residents. Peter Lunder is a 1956 Colby graduate, former president of Dexter Shoe Co. and a nephew of its founder, Harold Alfond. In 1995, the Lunders pledged the lead gift to the museum’s Lunder Wing. In 2007, the couple donated hundreds of works of art valued at more than $100 million. Six years later, the Alfond-Lunder Family Pavilion opened to display the works. In 2016, the Lunders donated a set of 100 of Pablo Picasso’s etchings from the 1930s, and in 2017 they gave the museum another gift of $100 million.

Bob,Diamond,2409,http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/4144428,"LONDON - TORTOLA / ACCESSWIRE / February 6, 2019 / Atlas Mara Limited (""Atlas Mara"" or the ""Company"" and, including its subsidiaries, the ""Group"") (LSE: ATMA), the sub‐Saharan Africa financial services group, today announces the following key initiatives and updates: • Atlas Mara's Board of Directors is undertaking a review of strategic options and assessing indications of interest for certain banking assets • Atlas Mara continues focus on investments in core markets where a path to market leadership is clearly achievable; will seek to partner, exit or reduce risk exposure elsewhere • Atlas Mara announces plan to accelerate new digital banking & agricultural finance initiatives, including a Memorandum of Understanding to consider the acquisition of Fairfax Africa's 35% stake in GroCapital, a South African financial services provider • Atlas Mara announces leadership transitions and enhancements to its management team and operational structure The Board of Directors of Atlas Mara is undertaking a review of strategic options to determine the key strategic priorities and actions for 2019 and beyond to drive shareholder value. The process includes a review of each banking operation to ensure that top five market leadership is practicably achievable in the near term, or to explore transactions that will reduce risk exposure where such leadership is unlikely on a stand-alone basis. As part of this process, Atlas Mara has retained Citigroup Global Markets Limited (""Citi"") to assist in the review and to evaluate various indicative proposals received by and options available to the Company. The Board has identified the following key strategic priorities for 2019 and beyond that must be in place to realize substantial core operational growth and maximize value: 1. Focus on the core to maximize value by reducing exposure and/or activities in non-core markets; exploring potential strategic partnerships; selectively expanding into new scalable markets and/or increasing the depth and scope of financial services offered. 2. Accelerate agricultural finance platform given the importance of the sector in Africa, with expertise that can be leveraged across Atlas Mara's markets through a potential new investment in a 35% stake in GroCapital, a financial services platform in the South African market. 3. Execute on Nigerian strategy by achieving consolidation of Union Bank of Nigeria (""UBN""), and supporting opportunities for prudent growth along with a capital and liquidity plan oriented towards a sustainable dividend policy. 4. Invest in high-impact technology and digital banking strategy, including establishing a sub-Saharan pan-African digital bank, creating transactional platforms to drive substantially lower cost of funds, enhancing core banking systems, and developing technology-enabled products to retain and grow Atlas Mara's customer base. 5. Reposition Markets & Treasury business line and expand client base and offerings, moving closer to relevant business opportunities, and accelerating revenue growth by offering a full suite of products and services to a larger and more diverse group of clients. Further detail of these strategic initiatives will be communicated as part of an Investor Day intended to be held following the release of Atlas Mara's 2018 financial results. Fairfax Africa Holdings Corporation (""Fairfax Africa""), as the largest shareholder of Atlas Mara, and Atlas Merchant Capital (""AMC""), the investment platform of the founder of Atlas Mara, remain committed to these strategic priorities to accelerate the transformation of the Group and create shareholder value. As a long-term Africa investor with a permanent capital base and a footprint complementary to that of Atlas Mara, Fairfax Africa continues to represent a strong and supportive strategic partner for the Company to enable its next phase of growth. The companies are exploring geographic and operational synergies, given Fairfax Africa's holdings and expertise across the sector including in agricultural finance, infrastructure finance, and insurance, among other areas. Union Bank of Nigeria Nigeria remains a flagship market for Atlas Mara and is central to the Company's overall strategy. The Company is focused on execution of its previously stated objectives, including achieving consolidation of UBN. Atlas Mara remains committed to supporting UBN's strategies for growth within the Nigeria banking industry. Notably, Atlas Mara will support a growth strategy consistent with prudent management of capital and liquidity and a sustainable dividend policy. Digital Banking As part of its strategic imperative to be a positive disruptive force in the banking industry, Atlas Mara will focus on developing a digital banking platform that can be implemented across its markets to strengthen its retail banking franchise, and which is expected to lead to a broader base of deposits and lower cost of funds. Sub-Saharan Africa remains one of the greatest global opportunities for enhancing financial intermediation using technology, and Atlas Mara intends to use the Digital Bank to accelerate its core business growth and profitability across the Group. Atlas Mara believes that the Digital Bank presents a significant opportunity for growth, and the Company is increasing its focus on the initiative. As a result, the Board has asked John Staley, CEO, who has significant experience and expertise in this area, to focus his efforts in 2019 on developing this opportunity for the Company. Leadership Changes Atlas Mara announces that Bob Diamond, a founder of the Company, has decided to transition from his role of Chairman and return to his role as a non-executive director of the Board, to enable him to increase his focus on his other executive roles while continuing to contribute actively to Atlas Mara's growth and strategic direction. As previously announced, Mr. Diamond assumed the role of Chairman on an interim basis with the expectation that a new Chairman would be appointed in due course. He has served as Chairman for two years, guiding Atlas Mara through a substantial transformation, including its strategic financing with Fairfax Africa and the increase in its ownership of UBN from 31% to 49%. Concurrently, the Board has appointed Michael Wilkerson, a non-executive director of Atlas Mara, to assume the role of Executive Chairman. Mr. Wilkerson currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Fairfax Africa, a TSX-listed company focused on investments in Africa, and the largest shareholder in Atlas Mara. In other changes, Funke Opeke, Chair of the Nominations Committee and Hisham Ezz Al-Arab have resigned as directors of Atlas Mara to focus on their leadership responsibilities with other companies, as CEO and as Chairman and Managing Director, respectively. The Board has appointed Mr. Diamond to assume the role of Chair of the Nominations Committee in place of Ms. Opeke. The Board of Directors is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jawaid Mirza as an independent non-executive member of the Board, effective April 1, 2019. Mr. Mirza has over 30 years of experience in banking with global financial institutions, including senior executive positions with Citibank and ABN AMRO Bank. He served as ABN AMRO's CFO European Region, Managing Director and COO for Global Private Banking, Asset Management and New Growth Markets, and Managing Director and CFO for Asia, Middle East and Australia. Mr. Mirza also served as Group COO and later CEO and Managing Director for Consumer & Commercial at Commercial International Bank of Egypt. Mr. Mirza is currently an independent non-executive board member of Eurobank Ergasias (Athens), where he chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk Committee, and of Commercial International Bank (""CIB"") of Egypt, where he chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk and Board Technology & Operations committees. He is also a non-executive board member of the South African Bank of Athens. Mr. Diamond said, ""I am excited to return to my original role on the Board and to continue to partner with Michael to accelerate the execution of our strategy. My belief in our ambition - to create a premier sub-Saharan African financial institution to better serve continental and global customers - remains as strong as the day we founded the Company."" Mr. Diamond also said of the transitions, ""On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Funke and Hisham for their valuable contributions to the growth and strategic direction of Atlas Mara. They provided extraordinary service and leadership, and we wish them all the best with their companies. I am also excited to work with Jawaid, who I know will bring incredible value to the Board."" Mr. Wilkerson said, ""On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Company, I want to express our gratitude to Bob for his leadership as Chairman through the challenging times of the past two years. I look forward to continuing to work together on the Board to build on our partnership to fulfill the vision of creating a leading, sub-Saharan African financial services platform to better serve our customers and communities. Mr. Wilkerson continued, ""We thank Funke and Hisham for their service and look forward to welcoming Jawaid to the Atlas Mara Board of Directors. We have high regard for Jawaid's expertise and know that he will add substantial value to the Company going forward."" Atlas Mara further announces that Muhammad ""Omar"" Khan has been appointed Chief Financial Officer of Atlas Mara effective April 2019. Kenroy Dowers, who served as Acting Chief Financial Officer, will continue in his role as Group Managing Director for Strategy and Investments. Mr. Wilkerson said, ""We greatly appreciate Kenroy's strong leadership and significant contributions as Acting CFO, and look forward to continuing to work with him."" Mr. Khan was previously Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Commercial International Bank (""CIB""). Mr. Khan has over 24 years of banking experience in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Canada with Citibank, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland and CIB, among others. During this time Mr. Khan has developed expertise in a multitude of areas of banking, including Finance, Asset & Liability Management, Service & Quality, Retail, Operations, Human Resources, Project Management and Administration. Proposed Acquisition of 35% stake in GroCapital Consistent with the strategic alignment outlined above, Atlas Mara and Fairfax Africa have entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding whereby Atlas Mara would explore the acquisition, in a proposed share exchange transaction on terms to be agreed, Fairfax Africa's 35% stake in GroCapital Holdings Limited (""GroCapital""), a South African financial services provider with a core focus on the agricultural and food processing sectors. This transaction will be subject to finalizing definitive agreements, as well as the approval of the South African Reserve Bank, the Minister of Finance, and the Competition Commission, and other regulatory approvals and customary conditions precedent. In addition to Fairfax Africa, GroCapital's shareholders include the Public Investment Corporation of South Africa (35%) and AFGRI Holdings Limited (""AHL"") (30%). Fairfax Africa has a 43% indirect beneficial interest in AHL. GroCapital offers through its subsidiaries comprehensive traditional business banking such as lending, transactional banking and treasury functions, as well as alliance, business and international banking. Its subsidiaries are known for a focus on the development of market-leading, niche alliance transactional banking offerings in partnership with businesses. GroCapital's go-forward strategy is to focus on companies in agriculture and food production, offering debt origination, forex and commodity trading, specialised finance and broking services, and an array of financial and insurance products and services directly to the farmer and agricultural intermediaries. As part of AHL, GroCapital has an established track record in financial services, offering bespoke financial products and services to the agribusiness and food sectors. AHL maintains c. $1 billion in farmer and corporate loan portfolios, with a proven history of negligible bad debts through multiple agricultural cycles. When concluded, this transaction would position Atlas Mara to access the South African banking market, enabling it to participate in financing of trade flows, foreign exchange, commodity finance and retail banking, and allow for operational integration into the core banking and technology environment of the Company, including with regard to digital banking and cross-border payments. The Board sees considerable potential for the Company to capitalize on the large market opportunity in agricultural finance (""agrifinance"") in sub-Saharan Africa and the unique positioning Atlas Mara could achieve with this strategic transaction to enhance its capabilities in this industry vertical. The World Bank estimated in a 2016 report on agribusiness in sub-Saharan Africa that the sector faces an annual financing gap of at least $11 billion, and agribusinesses routinely cite the lack of access to financing as one of the key impediments to their growth. Atlas Mara's current footprint includes markets in which agriculture is a leading contributor to economic output but remains underbanked. For example, in Nigeria, the Company's largest market, agriculture is one of the largest economic contributors at more than 20% of GDP and more than 30% of employment per the World Bank's 2017 data, but represents a far smaller proportion of credit and financial services transactions. Atlas Mara's footprint is well matched to a focused agrifinance strategy, and the Board foresees the potential of such a strategic transaction to enhance the Company's agrifinance-specific capabilities and expand its reach into new, attractive agrifinance markets. The Board of Directors of Atlas Mara will form a special committee of independent directors who are unaffiliated with Fairfax Africa or GroCapital to assess the strategic merits of the potential transaction, and to oversee negotiation of the key terms of a proposed agreement. Operating Structure The Company is also reviewing its operational structures. Dubai will for the time being remain the corporate headquarters of Atlas Mara, while the Company accelerates the shift of key functions and personnel closer to Atlas Mara's banking operations in Africa. Over time, the Group expects to eliminate various duplicative structures that were inherited from previous acquisitions, which is expected to result in greater operational efficiencies and lower costs. As part of the review the Company has also determined to reposition the Markets & Treasury offshore business segment, to be more strategically located for additional business opportunities, and in light of the potential agreement to acquire a substantial position in GroCapital, which will give Atlas Mara its first presence in South Africa. The offshore segment will transition from its base in Dubai, with further plans to be announced in due course.
