Matthew Raymond is charged with the first-degree murders of Fredericton constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. “The conclusion is, Mr. Raymond is fit to stand trial,” provincial court Judge Julian Dickson said Tuesday after receiving a report on a psychological assessment of Raymond. In court, Raymond — dressed in an orange jumpsuit and orange sweatshirt and carrying a file folder full of documents — motioned a number of times that he wished to speak. He stood and addressed Dickson. “My name is Matthew Raymond. I am innocent,” he said, adding that his lawyers had failed to enter a plea of not criminally responsible.

This is a total violation of my rights. I should be freed immediately, these cuffs removed and these (expletive) ankle bracelets now. My rights have been violated. I should have been in the Supreme Court,” he said. Dickson has imposed a publication ban on any information or arguments dealing with the application for the psychological assessments. The case will be back on court Dec. 11, as the lawyers discuss a longer assessment for the question of whether Raymond could be found criminally responsible. He is alleged to have fired from his apartment window with a long gun, killing the two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip on Aug. 10, and the two police officers as they responded to the scene. Family members of some of the victims sat quietly in the court Tuesday. During earlier court appearances, Raymond had said he felt he was not being defended by his first lawyer — Nathan Gorham — and tried numerous times to fire him. Raymond suggested Gorham was withholding evidence that would allow him to be “exonerated” immediately because of temporary insanity. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. Former friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered varying memories of the accused murderer, ranging from a boy who retreated into video games, a pleasant supermarket co-worker and an increasingly isolated loner in recent years. Some business owners have described Raymond, who is in his late 40s, as becoming reclusive and occasionally unpleasant in the year before the alleged shootings.

Picture: James Crook. Mollymook lifeguard Tyson Davies lifts the wandering echidna to safety, Creatures of the deep are one thing, but an echidna on the beach? The lifesavers at Mollymook on the NSW south coast took in their stride on Monday . Lifesaver Tyson Davies rescued the spiky Aussie native found near the drain in front of the surf club, Canberra’s James Crook said. Mr Crook and his family were walking along the beach, enjoying the pristine view and glassy water when they passed the lifesaver, who was returning the echinda to nearby bushland. “I can’t imagine anything more Australian,” Mr Crook said. His three-year-old daughter, Lara was beaming when she saw the native monotreme. “My three-year-old was quite enthusiastic,” Mr Crook said. “It’s one of the best things we’ve seen. “Tyson put it down on the beach in front of the trees and she was running alongside telling people there was an echidna.” Mr Crook said Mr Davies handled the rescue well. “He was smiling, they’re a pretty laidback couple of guys.” Milton-Ulladulla Times

Karen,Cummings,2049,http://demerarawaves.com/2018/12/04/ppps-frank-anthony-lambastes-govt-on-drug-procurement-hiv-aids-tb-and-diabetes/,"Posted by: Denis Chabrol in Business, News, Politics December 4, 2018 0 Opposition MP Dr Frank Anthony Opposition People’s Progressive Party (PPP) Shadow Health Minister, Dr. Frank Anthony on Tuesday assailed the David Granger-led coalition administration for alleged bad drug importation deals, unregistered importing entities, increased prevalence of HIV/ AIDS and failure to assist the country’s estimated 60,000 diabetics with free glucometers. Anthony, who is one of his party’s presidential candidate hopefuls for the 2020 general elections, was evidently passionate as he contributed to the 2019 National Budget debate. Noting that Junior Health Minister, Dr. Karen Cummings confirmed multiple drug resistance tuberculosis (TB), Anthony said that was due to a shortage of critical drugs, inadequate monitoring, non-compliance and sometimes patient poverty. “Many of these patients are too ill to work and with the paltry sum set aside for public assistance, when they do benefit, it is hardly enough for them to survive,” Anthony said. He insisted there were up to recently shortages of TB drugs from the Global Fund. In the area of HIV/AIDS, he said the disease has been on the rise in certain age groups- the adult prevalence rate being 1.7 percent; 6.1 percent among sex workers and 8.4 percent transgender persons. He echoed calls by the gay and lesbian rights organisation, Society Against Sexual Orientation Discrimination (SASOD), for government to introduce Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis to help reduce the incidence of the disease among high-risk groups. “I urge the government to implement this most effective way of preventing this disease in the country,” he said. The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Shamdeo Persaud has said government was studying the experiences of other countries and organisation in using PrEP. There are an estimated 8,200 persons living with HIV, but 5, 237 are receiving treatment, prompting him to call on government to allocate more funds to treat everyone tested positive. Dr. Anthony called on the Guyana government to match its words with action in fighting non-communicable diseases such as diabetes. While a glucometer, which is used by diabetics to test their blood sugar levels, costs about GYD$5,000 each, Anthony said government could have easily supplied these to the estimated 60,000 diabetics countrywide. “If we take the money that we had wasted from the Sussex Street bond, we could bought about 65,000 glucometers and give it to those patients.,” he said. He said the Public Health Ministry was filled with “stench” on procurement of drugs and other medical supplies, as he alluded to the 2017 Auditor General’s Report that states that ministry had single-sourcing drugs through 13 contracts valued at GYD$91.4 million. “Single sourcing, we know Mr. Speaker, can lead to higher prices for the items because the vendor has a monopoly,” he said. Contracts amounting to GYD$278.5 million were awarded without bid security, splitting of 11 contracts totaling GYD$82.5 million to four contractors, and GYD$104.1 million in single-sourced drugs through six contracts without the approval of the Tender Board were among the observations made in the Auditor General’s Report. “The tender board was asked to rubber stamp the transactions after the deliveries were made to the suppliers. Dr. Anthony cited HDML Labs as possibly being given preference for the award of a GYD$409.4 million contract for the supply of medical supplies instead of the initial contract price for GYD$366 million. “When the contract was audited then we saw how much more was given to this company,” he said, adding that there was a huge gap between that company and other offers. “This is how our money is being squandered and wasted in this country,” he said. Minister of Public Health Volda Lawrence has publicly defended sole-sourcing to fulfill emergency needs for drugs. However, Anthony, a medical doctor by profession, told the House that the shortages could have been avoided. He said more than GYD$345 million were paid for drugs that were not delivered. In 2015, he said the ministry did not receive GYD$144.6 million worth of drugs already paid for and GYD$67.7 million in 2016 and GYD$133 million in 2017. “This type of situation, Mr. Speaker, where right now there are shortages in almost every health facility in this country…because she (the Public Health Minister) goes around to the various health centres she would know that so don’t come here and pretend that there aren’t shortages…we know differently and more so what is important the patients know differently,” she said. Anthony also again demanded that government lays a list of the drug importers that are licensed and registered by the Food and Drug Administration in the National Assembly, a situation he said was a “total breach” of the Food and Drug Act. Even as the Public Health Ministry completes the construction of a new drug bond at Kingston, Georgetown, the PPP frontbencher accused government of breaking its now one-year old promise to stop renting a bond on Sussex Street, Albouystown from Larry Singh and another at Diamond, East Bank Demerara. He said the Auditor General’s Report shows that GYD$137 million was paid as rent for the Sussex Street bond from February to December 2017, and another GYD$100 million from January to August, 2018. Overall, he said the rental of that bond has cost GYD$250 million. Enter your email address to subscribe to this website and receive notifications of new articles by email.
