John,O'Neil,1897,https://westseattleblog.com/2018/11/from-post-viaduct-buses-to-crime-updates-and-beyond-southwest-district-council/,"West Seattle, Washington Toplines from tonight’s Southwest District Council meeting: BUSES, POST-VIADUCT: Have you seen this map yet? It was brought to the SWDC meeting by Chris Arkills from King County, who has been visiting local groups to explain what’s happening during and after the January closure. The yellow pathway is what buses from the south end will use during the closure; after that, the interim period “9 months to 1 year,” it’ll be the blue pathway; then the green signifies the “permanent south end pathway.” The blue route will involve traveling on 99 to the “new exit” and then on to 1st; in the reverse, same thing, heading down Columbia to 1st, then onto 99 at Dearborn, and on to the bridge. There’s a commitment to build “the south part of Columbia first” in hopes of accelerating that. (Note that there’s a caveat that this could be subject to change once things happen and they see how it’s working, or not working.) The bus-only lane on the bridge will be extended to 4th, in the meantime, Arkills noted, and there will be a bus-only exit lane on the 4th Ave. exit from the eastbound bridge, too. Some other details are still being hashed out. As previously reported here, the West Seattle Water Taxi will have extra vessel and shuttle service during the 99 closure, as well as 200 parking spaces (during commute hours) at Pier 2, as well as vanpool parking at Don Armeni Boat Ramp, and extended street-parking hours near Seacrest. Bike parking will be added in the Seacrest area too. UPDATES FROM THE SOUTHWEST PRECINCT: The precinct’s third watch commander, Lt. Tammy Floyd, said auto thefts and burglaries are on the way down, after being up earlier in the year. A “property emphasis” is planned, with two or three officers each shift specifically focused on property crime including “proactive work.” The precinct now has two Automated License Plate Reader cars and is working to make sure both are deployed at all times to help detect stolen cars. Regarding the reports of “roving juveniles” causing trouble in the Westwood area, including between Chief Sealth International High School and the shopping area, Lt. Floyd said bicycle officers, CPT and ACT will also do some “focus projects” stepping things up there. The Community Police Team now has a new officer, Officer Nic Plemel, replacing John O’Neil, who’s moved to the South Precinct and awaiting promotion to sergeant. Another appointment to the team is pending. Police remind you to take care about deliveries (package/mail theft)with the shopping season revving up for the holidays. Asked specifically about a pre-announced meeting topic, reporting missing people, Lt. Floyd explained Silver Alerts. They can be issued if the missing person is identified as a “vulnerable adult” who is: -60 or older -Unable to find their way back -Has dementia There also has to be ‘enough descriptive information’ to assist in safe recovery, such as photos, so people know more about who they’re looking for. SPD gets info via WSP because it goes into a national system. DEPARTMENT OF NEIGHBORHOODS’ INVOLVEMENT ON LIGHT RAIL: We’ve covered Erin House‘s presentation before (at September’s Delridge District Council meeting). City elected officials asked the DoN to check in with neighborhood reps about what they’re hearing from Sound Transit regarding West Seattle to Ballard light rail. An ST consultant was present too in case any project- specific questions came up, and she recapped where the process stands – the three “end-to-end” Level 3 possibilities we reported on Tuesday, as unveiled Monday night. Meantime, SWDC member Cindi Barker from West Seattle Emergency Communication Hubs suggested that the DoN go back and find lessons learned during the monorail-planning process, with regard to potential station areas. House said they’re reviewing light-rail station areas such as Beacon Hill and Capitol Hill. SWDC member Ellen West from the Junction Neighborhood Organization said questions are already coming up about eminent domain. Deb Barker, SWDC member (who also happens to be on the light-rail project’s volunteer Stakeholder Advisory Group), said she has been researching that too. Sound Transit can’t officially negotiate until much later in the process but is working on an “interim communication” plan for addressing those questions sooner. At the start of the meeting: ANNOUNCEMENTS: JuNO has Sound Transit coming in for their November 19th meeting, along with SDOT and King County Metro discussing more about the Highway 99 transition. JuNO director Amanda Kirk, co-chair of SWDC, is meeting with Department of Neighborhoods director Andres Mantilla next week to see what DoN’s current philosophy is regarding district councils. … Cindi Barker suggested that West Seattle organizations/businesses/facilities take pains to be sure their publicly available meeting space is listed on the new city website Spacefinder. … She also recapped some of the results from last weekends NEXT MEETING: SWDC meets first Wednesdays, so the next meeting will be at 6:30 pm Wednesday, December 5, upstairs at the Senior Center/Sisson Building. Maybe I’m reading the map incorrectly or missing a story detail, but how are buses supposed to make the three-block climb of Madison Street from Alaskan Way to First Avenue ? I mean, the intersection of First and Madison is now level with the viaduct’s lower traffic deck, and once the viaduct has been removed the intersection will be left sitting on top of the vertical drop between First Avenue and Post Avenue a block closer to the waterfront. Buses will be using Columbia, not Madison. I’m not sure what you are referring to. The map doesn’t show buses using Madison, plus Madison already connects from Alaskan to 1st. Coming from West Seattle heading North on 99 where does traffic exit to get onto Alaskan Way? That part of the map is not on here. CWS, information about the downtown exits from 99 has been widely available for YEARS, despite the fact that people refuse to believe they will exist. Check the project web site. You’ll find more maps there. Not only is it on the map but it’s spelled out in the narrative, “The blue route will involve traveling on 99 to the “new exit” and then on to 1st; in the reverse, same thing, heading down Columbia to 1st, then onto 99 at Dearborn, and on to the bridge. “ The end-goal is routing along the “Permanent” green line on the map. Buses traveling northbound on SR 99 will exit near the Stadiums at approximately Dearborn, where the current plan is to have a transit-only lane next to the regular vehicle lane. Buses would then continue north along the new Alaskan Way and onto the map you see above. I feel like the bus commutes are going to be so much longer without the viaduct. Also, the climb up columbia street is such a mess. It takes the 120 like 10 minutes to drive three blocks on Columbia to turn left on 3rd. How could you possibly know that? Columbia is currently a one-way street going from 3rd Ave to the Viaduct. For anyone unaware, Columbia is being redesigned and rebuilt as a “two-way transit corridor.” We wrote about the project almost a year ago: https://westseattleblog.com/2017/12/columbia-street-work-starts-next-week-to-get-ready-for-its-future-as-a-2-way-transit-pathway-once-tunnel-opens/ (Added: You’ll note the map in that story is something of a precursor to the map featured in this one.) Thanks for this link You’re right, I take the route daily but always mix up directions of Seneca and Columbia! Are you thinking of Seneca, as currently designed? The reason for the regular backup on Seneca approaching third is that there is always a cop at the stop on Seneca blocking buses and pedestrians to give priority to single occupant vehicles entering a parking garage. Thanks SPD! I believe J is talking about Seneca. I ride the 125 and it was recently rerouted onto Seneca when coming into downtown. I don’t know why they changed the route (I have a couple unresponded to emails in to Metro), but buses do indeed take forever to get up to Third. I believe J is referring to Seneca. I ride the 125 and can attest to the long delays getting from the Viaduct to Third coming into downtown. I have a couple of as yet unresponded to emails to Metro to ask them why they rerouted the 125 from turning left on First. I am guessing it’s not convenient for the majority of 125 riders; I know it’s not for me because it adds travel time and results in buses being late almost every morning. Will the bus only lane changes on the bridge to 4th Ave be temporary or permanent? Hopefully, only temporary, as traffic already backs up to where the Harbor Island traffic merges, and eliminating the ability for vehicles not travelling to I-5 or Beacon Hill to avoid the bottleneck is imperative. Somehow, though, these things take on lives of their own and I could see SDOT making it permanent. 4th is not the permanent pathway so there would be no reason for a permanent bus lane. If the new bus only exit onto the 4th ramp extends all the way onto northbound 4th ave S, that route to downtown will not be usable for car drivers. I say this because currently, with 2 lanes exiting to N-bound 4th, the exit already backs up, occasionally all the way up to the Spokane St Viaduct. Lately, I sometimes have to wait 2 or 3 light cycles to get off the ramp and onto N-bound 4th. If cars are limited to one lane, that will clog the viaduct with cars trying to get off at 4th. And cars will sit through more than just 2 or 3 light cycles trying to exit. If they manage to squeeze 3 lanes to N-bound onto this ramp, then it might not be so bad.Similarly, the one thing that relieves congestion at the end of the east-bound WS Bridge right now is the opening of the bus-only lane to all cars once you get past the exit to 99. If that becomes a bus only lane all the way to the 4th Ave exit, then drivers trying to get to I-5 S-bound or Beacon Hill will be stuck with all the people trying to get off at 4th Ave S. The 2 lanes left to cars on the Spokane St Viaduct in this location will become a complete bottleneck during the morning commute. And before anyone says that it’s time to start riding the bus instead of driving, I commute to Mercer Island, and busing to my workplace would take 2 transfers and at least 2 hours each way. It currently takes me 35-40 minutes driving up 4th to I-90 from my house in Westwood. And I commute with a child, so biking is not an option either, even if I had the will to do that. While I understand the efforts to prioritize bus routes, city and county transportation planners need to take into account that people who are not able to take the bus also need viable options to get to downtown and beyond. I’ll add to my above comment (not yet posted), that the bottleneck would be even if no new cars that take 99 now divert to 1st or 4th while the connections to downtown via 99 are being built. I’ve read that those connections won’t be open until at least March. If significant numbers of people switch to 1st and 4th ave exits, then the exit to 1st Ave S will back up into the bus lane, and 4th Ave S exit will be impossible for cars. The lane that currently goes to I-5 S and Beacon Hill will become a parking lot for cars trying to get off at 4th. I really can’t envision this working, although I am not a traffic engineer.And what about all the cars and trucks that come up from the lower bridge? They need to use that right lane that is proposed to be a bus only lane to merge into the lanes headed for I-5. Or to get off at 1st or 4th. I hope the people who are doing the planning spend some time during the morning commute to watch traffic flow. Is there a way to get one of the maps? I don’t see the railroad tracks on this map. During one of the many, previous re-routes of Route 21, there were frequent delays of up to 30 minutes while traffic (buses included) waited for trains. Can’t tell if these routes involve crossing tracks… Username: Password: Lost Password? Username: Email: Enter the code in the image*: Please enter your username or e-mail address.

Michael,Gordon,1749,https://www.fxstreet.com/news/nz-larger-surplus-westpac-201810090437,"Michael Gordon, Senior Economist at Westpac, notes that the New Zealand Government’s financial statements revealed a much larger surplus and lower net debt than expected for the June 2018 year. Key Quotes “Some of this was due to higher tax revenue, but the majority was due to unplanned delays in operational and capital spending. While some catch-up is expected, delays in spending tend to persist from year to year.” “The stronger than expected starting point provides some leeway if economic growth fails to live up to the Treasury’s upbeat forecasts.” “It also implies that in upcoming fiscal updates the Government could announce even more stimulus for the economy than is already planned.” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Sep 20, 2018 @ 1:03 pm By Bruce Kelly It's time for Dr. Phillip Frost to resign as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., the home of 4,300 retail brokers and financial advisers. The risk to Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation, as well as to the four independent broker-dealers it controls, is simply too great for Dr. Frost to continue his association with the brokerage. All brokerage firms are required to have a minimum level of liquid assets, or net capital, to remain in business and meet their financial obligations. A broker-dealer's reputation is almost an intangible sort of net capital; if it is less than sterling, the reputational capital can drain out of the firm, sometimes overnight. Clients get nervous or complain, and advisers start looking around to jump to a new broker-dealer. That's why Dr. Frost, who owns close to 36% of the company's stock, must go. Dr. Frost, who has a medical degree, is an octogenerian whose past investments have mostly been in the pharmaceutical arena. On September 7, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dr. Frost and nine other individuals for allegedly participating in ""long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock."" The SEC's complaint illustrates in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off the ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges. Dr. Frost's involvement in the alleged scheme poses tremendous risk to Ladenburg's reputation and brand. The market clearly believes that there is new risk associated with Ladenburg Thalmann. The company's stock price has cratered since September 7, the day the SEC released its complaint. It opened that day at $3.43 per share before falling 15% for the day. And the share price has worsened. On Wednesday afternoon, shares were trading at $2.35, down 31.5% since the SEC's complaint. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network Inc. ""The controversy is likely to lead to further fundamental deterioration; financial firms are sensitive to reputational risks,"" according to a post published Tuesday on Seeking Alpha, whose author, Hindenburg Investment Research, is a short seller of Ladenburg Thalmann shares. That means that aptly titled Hindenburg is betting the price of those shares will go down. ""Plus, the worst may not be over; signs point toward possible criminal charges."" ""We think Phil Frost should resign to avoid more reputational damage to the firm,"" according to the article. ""As the investigation and enforcement process continues forward, it is almost assured to create more negative headlines and spook clients."" The Seeking Alpha post also details the amount of leverage on Ladenburg Thalmann's balance sheet and the drag that could present for shareholders. Hindenburg Investment Research is led by Nate Anderson, who describes himself as performing hedge fund due diligence and marketing in his profile on Twitter. Other analysts, including those on Seeking Alpha, have had kinder outlooks on Ladenburg Thalmann in the wake of the SEC's allegations about Dr. Frost. ""If you are convinced that the issues with [Dr. Frost] are not life threatening, (and I do not believe they are), then the baby bonds are definitely worth a look,"" wrote a firm called Rubicon Associates in another Seeking Alpha post. ""Of these, I favor the Ladenburg Thalmann 7.25% notes due 9/30/2028."" Others were also sanguine about Ladenburg's future. ""It is important to note for Ladenburg shareholders that Dr. Frost serves as a non-executive member of the board of directors and does not hold any operational executive position at the company and that, as noted in previously published reports, Ladenburg's business is robust and its financial position is strong, with $390 million in book value and nearly $250 million in cash,"" wrote Alexander Paris, an analyst with Barrington Research, an investment bank that has done business with Ladenburg Thalmann in the past year. ""This opinion piece was published by investors disseminating misleading information to push their own agenda, and we categorically reject its wrongheaded conclusions with respect to Ladenburg's financial strength and stability,"" wrote Ladenburg CEO Richard Lampen in a message to InvestmentNews. ""Ladenburg continues to be one of the most well-capitalized and well-resourced firms in the independent financial services industry."" A spokesman for Dr. Frost, Jamie Tully, did not respond to questions about the future of Dr. Frost at Ladenburg. But in a statement, Dr. Frost wrote: ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives. I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name."" Was the Seeking Alpha post by Hindenburg an example of a short seller trying to take advantage of negative news about a company? It could very well be. What is clear is that Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation must be protected, for the benefit of its advisers and their clients. That means Dr. Frost should leave the company as soon as possible.

Phillip,Frost,1653,https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/billionaire-news/miami-billionaire-charged-in-27-million-fraud-scheme/,"Phillip Frost is a Miami billionaire and one of 10 people the SEC charged with fraud on September 7th. He is accused of being a part of when the SEC calls a series of ""classic pump and dump schemes"" that generated more than $27 million. Frost is the founder of the pharmaceutical company OPKO Health. The SEC alleges that Frost and nine other investors manipulated the stock prices of three companies for their own gain. Basically, the 10 investors allegedly promoted the companies without admitting that they owned a stake. Then they waited for the stock prices to rise and sold their shares. This meant that the so called retail investors were left holding stock that was nearly worthless. The group is accused of ""brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,"" said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/Getty Images Both Frost and OPKO Heath are named in the suit. The SEC believes that Frost allegedly participated in two of the three pump and dump schemes that earned him about $1.1 million. Frost has a net worth of $3.7 billion. In a statement, OPKO Health said that the SEC did not notify them of their plan to file a lawsuit and said the complaint was riddled with ""serious factual inaccuracies."" The company said that if the SEC had followed its own standard procedures, Frost and OPKO would have happily provided documentation that answered a number of the SEC's questions and cleared Frost and OPKO of the charges. The pump and dump scheme was reportedly spearheaded by South Florida businessman Barry Honig. He is one of the biggest shareholders in the cryptocurrency company Riot Blockchain Inc. The virtual currency company's stock took a nosedive of 24.3% after the news of the fraud charges broke. Riot Blockchain was subpoenaed in April as part of a formal SEC investigation. Honig is believed to be the primary ringleader who asked the other defendants in the case to buy or sell stock, engage in promoting the companies, among other things. Honig allegedly made more than $3.4 million while running the pump and dump scheme. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved",0.0,10.0,0.4166666666666667,0.0,1053951,0.8710208539117397,1,2018-11-14 15:58:49,True,Priority Mail,False

Updated: November 14, 2018 @ 3:41 pm Titans head coach Andy Morgan walks onto the field with senior captains Bryce Allison (85) and Adam Randolph (13) prior to McDowell's loss to Mitchell Sept. 7. The Titans open the Northwestern 3A/4A Conference season tonight on the road at Hickory (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Titans head coach Andy Morgan walks onto the field with senior captains Bryce Allison (85) and Adam Randolph (13) prior to McDowell's loss to Mitchell Sept. 7. The Titans open the Northwestern 3A/4A Conference season tonight on the road at Hickory (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Take away the big plays, and the McDowell Titans were right there with the Hickory Red Tornadoes last season. Taking away the big plays is what the Titans will have to do in order to hang with Hickory tonight. McDowell (2-2) opens Northwestern 3A/4A Conference play on the road (7:30 kickoff) against a 2-2 Tornadoes squad that has play-making ability similar to last season, when they ran away from the Titans in the second half en route to a 36-13 victory. “If we can do what we’re coached to do and play the way we’re capable, we can be right there,” said MHS head coach Andy Morgan, whose club is coming off its bye week. “We’ve got to limit their big plays, and we’ve got to keep them on a long field. Even if we don’t score, we’ve got to punt it and pin them deep. “They can score from anywhere on the field. If we’re lazy or don’t take good angles, they’ll cut it back all the way across the field. Athletically, they’re the best team we’ve seen.” The athletes primarily responsible for what happened a year ago – when Hickory turned a meager seven-point halftime lead into a blowout win – are gone. Quarterback Derrien Phillips and receiver Jaekwon Staton both graduated. Staton caught seven Phillips passes for 137 yards and touchdowns of 33, 39 and 25 yards in that game. They’ve been replaced by the likes of senior quarterback Bryce Stober, who was 19-of-29 passing for 269 yards and two touchdowns in last week’s 28-27 come-from-behind win over Bandys. Stober also ran for 74 yards on just six carries. Running back Cody Young, a standout basketball player who only recently joined the football team, ran for 98 yards and a score on 11 carries. Meanwhile, the Titans are coming off back-to-back losses to Patton and Mitchell after starting the season 2-0. Morgan said the Titans have taken a back-to-basics approach since the loss to Mitchell Sept. 7. “I think maybe I overwhelmed them a little offensively going into the Mitchell game and tried to put too much in,” said Morgan. “We’ve just tried to get better at what we do, and we’ve had a really good two weeks of practice. We’ve been really focused.” When the Titans have focused, they’ve been effective, especially on offense. McDowell is averaging 323 total yards and 25.3 points per contest this season. Senior quarterback Adam Randolph is 50-of-73 passing for 786 yards and eight touchdowns with four interceptions. Running back J.C. Olivo has rushed for 248 yards and two TDs on 51 carries. Receivers Andruw Randolph (17 receptions, 247 yards, 4TDs), Dakota Effler (14-237-2TDs) and Olivo (9-163-2TDs) have all passed the 100-yard mark for the year. Defensively, senior inside linebacker Andrew Davis (2 tackles for loss, INT) leads the team in tackles with 36, while fellow linebacker Johan Ayala (3TFL) has made 31 stops. Three other players, safeties Brycen Seymore and Drew Green and defensive tackle Nick Ivy, are tied for third with 24 tackles apiece. But McDowell may be without Seymore’s services tonight; the senior has been sick and is listed as questionable by Morgan. Hickory holds a 12-7 edge in the all-time series.

Business editor Powerful crews — Crews of Florida Power & Light linemen in bucket trucks work to restore power to a community in North Carolina, in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence. Ready to get to work — Will Teti poses in the Duke Energy Florida staging area. In the background are the luxurious sleeping arrangements he and his colleagues will enjoy — nearly wall-to-wall cots. Experienced restorer — Jay Davis of DeLand is among the 900 Florida Power & Light workers who are in the Carolinas, helping to get the lights back on for victims of Hurricane Florence. Hurricane Florence may have moved out of the Carolinas, but the storm left widespread damage, epic flooding and pervasive power outages in its wake. As of Sept. 19, at least 40 deaths in three states have been attributed to Florence, with 27 of the fatalities occurring in North Carolina, according to media reports. The hurricane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, at around 7:15 a.m. Sept. 14, as a Category 1 storm, with winds of up to 90 mph. But even before Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm, rescue help poured into the area from all over the country, including Florida. That help included more than 2,000 electrical linemen and contractors from the state’s power companies, including Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy Florida. Jay Davis of DeLand is among FPL’s 900-member contingent that drove to Charlotte, North Carolina, to stage for deployment once the worst of the weather had passed. “We all volunteer. The company looks for volunteers,” Davis said by phone Sept. 14 from the Bojangles Coliseum in Charlotte. Davis, who marked his 31st anniversary with FPL the day before, is a veteran of post-storm restorations with FPL. His first restoration was after Hurricane Andrew in Miami in 1992, and he has helped get electricity flowing again on many occasions since. “Restorations are what we do,” he said. “Our goal is to keep the lights on.” Duke Energy Florida sent 1,100 personnel to help the recovery efforts. Will Teti of Lake Wales was among a crew that staged near Sumter, South Carolina. He spoke to The Beacon Sept. 15, and like the FPL contingent, he and his colleagues were all volunteers. “It’s kind of an honor to get on one of these storm teams,” said Teti, a 15-year veteran of Duke Energy, who has been deployed numerous times to restorations in Texas, Alabama and the Carolinas, as well as here in Florida. Davis and Teti said their first days in the staging areas were to be spent checking equipment and vehicles so they would be prepared before getting into the field and making repairs. Both said they anticipated encountering lots of downed power lines, broken poles and blown transformers. “It’s the same things we see every day, just on a larger scale,” Teti said. “When we do go, we’ll be ready.” “We won’t see anything worse than Andrew,” Davis said. Utility crews could begin restoration work once the winds died down to 35 mph or lower. The rains, however, did not have to stop, Davis said. “Sweat or rain — it’s no different,” he said. By Sept. 17, FPL, Duke Energy and other utilities had begun restoring power where they could, but many areas couldn’t be reached because roads were impassable due to the widespread flooding. Florida’s power companies sent more than 2,000 personnel to states affected by Hurricane Florence as of Sept. 12 to prepare for post-impact restoration of power, according to Gov. Rick Scott’s office. But they are not the only entities sending assistance; the governor announced Sept.14 that the state was taking a number of actions to support its neighbors in the Southeast. “In Florida, we are fortunate to have the best emergency-management professionals in the world to respond to disasters in our state, and to help other states during times of emergency,” Scott said in a prepared release. Help from Florida includes: Multiple media reports indicated Wilmington, North Carolina, for instance, was a virtual island because all the roads into and out of the city remained underwater until Sept. 18, when two roads opened. Also by Sept. 18, the Associated Press reported that outages were down to about a third of the nearly 1-million homes and businesses that had lost power at the height of the storm. By noon Sept. 19, that figure was down to fewer than 200,000 customers. That means there is still work for Davis, Teti and their fellow linesmen. Both said they expected to be in the Carolinas for about two weeks, or until the host utility — Duke Energy — released them.

Sara,Burns,1650,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/sara-s-song-family-of-slain-officer-looks-to-find-good-in-unimaginable-loss-1.4101059,"Live Now: CTV News at Five Advertisement The husband of a police officer killed during a shooting in Fredericton last month is speaking out about how his family is coping with the devastating loss, their hope for the future, and a special song that is helping them through the dark days. Steven Burns says his community, his friends, and his family have been a source of strength for him and his three boys since the death of his wife, Const. Sara Burns. Sara was shot and killed outside an apartment complex on Aug. 10, along with fellow officer Const. Robb Costello and civilians Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud. Steven says he and his boys have been keeping busy and they’re doing the best they can. He also says he’s overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. “People from all over the world have reached out to me and it’s very comforting from that side,” he says. “It just makes you know how important she was and how it gives you that comfort.” Steven also says he now believes that when it’s your time, it’s your time – a belief that stems from getting to spend the entire day together before Sara died. “We got up and had breakfast together at a local restaurant,” he recalls fondly. “She always would have a nap in the afternoon before her work, because she was going to be up all night, and we had a nap. We just had a fantastic day.” In addition to the love, support, and memories, Steven says a special song is also helping them make it through the dark days, and is ensuring his wife’s legacy lives on. “I listen to it every night and every morning. I just do it because it gives me a lot of comfort.” Unable to find a song or hymn that would speak to their loss, a long-time friend of the Burns family wrote the song, titled “We’d Rather Have You,” for the regimental funeral. “On Sunday evening, I think it was probably about 6 p.m. I sat down, and by 8 p.m. I had pretty much the song,” says Steve Patterson. “When I came here Monday morning, played it for Steve with my guitar …it was funny because he said, ‘That really sucked man,’ with tears in his eyes. He really liked it.” “For him to come up with such a beautiful song that quickly, and really it resonates, I think, not only with, it could be Sara or Robb, anyone, a service member that has passed away, to me that’s why we think that this potentially could have more good from it.” The Sara Burns Memorial Fund was created last month and one of the first major steps to raising money is through the song. “We’d Rather Have You” will be released Friday on iTunes. It will cost $1 to download the song, with all proceeds going towards causes in the Fredericton area. Steven says that’s what Sara would have wanted. “She would call this showy, and I don’t want it to seem like that. For me it’s about, how do we help people based on what happened? It was a tragedy, and this community will grow from it, but some good has to come from it,” he says. “I don’t know how we’re going to do that, but this is part of it, this song is part of it.” He says mental health and violence against women are two of the causes on his mind, because they were always on Sara’s mind. The memorial fund will eventually have an advisory board, but right now the focus is on raising money. The parent company Steven works with is offering to match the first $50,000 raised and his goal is to reach $100,000 by the end of September. He says the song is the first step to reaching that goal. “I hope that people that are out there, and maybe they’re going through a tragedy or even a loss, that that can comfort them in some way, because you know, if you listen to the words … it’s what everybody would want. If you could have the person back, you certainly would want them back.” In addition to iTunes, the song will soon be available on Spotify and Apple Music. CTV Morning Live will also air the song in its entirety Friday morning. With files from CTV Atlantic's Laura Brown Steven Burns, Const.

One of these patents is already the subject of an inter partes review by the Patent Trial and Review Board of the USPTO to determine the patent's validity, and both are the subject of existing litigation against ChromaDex charging it with misuse of its intellectual property. ""While we would not normally issue a statement, and instead prefer to let these matters play out in court, ChromaDex's actions have made it necessary to do so,"" said Elysium Health CEO Eric Marcotulli. ""We have built our growth strategy around scientific research and product development, while ChromaDex has built its around litigation and misrepresentation, which are not new tactics for their leadership."" The press releases issued by Elysium Health in 2018 included announcements that the company had been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for its experimental therapeutic EH301 for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was recognized by the Good Housekeeping Institute for innovation, and had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mayo Clinic and Harvard University to use nicotinamide riboside for dietary supplement applications in the slowing of aging and age-related diseases. During the same period, ChromaDex announced that it had abandoned direct involvement in development of a nicotinamide riboside-based treatment for children afflicted with Cockayne Syndrome so that it could focus on its TruNiagen dietary supplement sales strategy, coopted the results of studies carried out by independent research institutions to promote TruNiagen, and frequently sought to publicize its dispute with Elysium Health and the ongoing litigations, including in direct advertising for TruNiagen. ChromaDex has thus far remained silent on the alleged involvement of several of its major investors and the former co-chairs of its board of directors in a fraudulent ""pump and dump"" scheme detailed in a civil complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2018, and described in an SEC press release entitled ""SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes."" Among those named as defendants, Phillip Frost and Michael Brauser are and historically have been among the largest holders of ChromaDex stock, and Barry Honig was, along with Brauser, co-chair of ChromaDex's board of directors until March 2015 when they abruptly resigned. Current ChromaDex board member Steve Rubin is also an executive and board member of OPKO Health, which invested in ChromaDex in 2012, of which Frost and his affiliates are significant shareholders, and is also named as a defendant in the SEC's lawsuit. ""It is not surprising that the SEC is investigating the alleged unscrupulous conduct of these ChromaDex-affiliated individuals, who have previously represented to us their continuing control over the company,"" said Marcotulli. ""We have reason to believe that ChromaDex's efforts to undermine Elysium Health, including through these baseless lawsuits, is connected to these individuals and their current associates at the company. In deference to the judicial system, we have declined to comment publicly for the last two years and we do not intend to make a habit of commenting on ongoing litigation."" Elysium Health takes intellectual property rights very seriously and respects the intellectual property rights of others. Elysium Health is confident that it does not infringe any valid claim of the patents described in ChromaDex's most recent baseless lawsuit and trusts that the court will arrive at the same conclusion.

Phillip,Frost,1649,https://investorplace.com/2018/09/7-biotech-stocks-to-buy-now/,"Menu Source: Shutterstock Now that the biotechnology sector is well on its way to bouncing back after bottoming in May 2018, investors may feel like they missed out. The fears that previously plagued biotech stocks are no longer as big a threat. The government is no longer putting companies hiking drug price in their cross-hairs, at least not for now. This favorable environment should help biotech firms carry out their plans for the rest of the year. So, if you’re interested in getting into biotech stocks, where should you begin? Well, here is a list of seven great options to get you started. OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK) fell by over 20% in the last month after the SEC suspended trading in the stock on Sep. 11. The regulator asked the company to provide information related to the securities lawsuit against OPKO’s Chairman and CEO, Phillip Frost. On Sept. 7, the SEC charged the CEO and others with a stock promotion scheme. Despite this distraction for the company, the value of the business could improve if RAYALDEE, which treats patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism, is a commercial success. The FDA approved the drug, which works by raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lowers parathyroid hormone levels in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the second quarter, prescriptions for the drug rose 36% from Q1. OPKO expanded its sales team to 64 representatives, a move that helped drive that growth. The drug is now available to 83% of the overall insured population. Adoption, reimbursement and growing awareness of the drug through the marketing efforts from the sales team will drive sales higher. Operationally, improving collection yield and cutting the accounts receivable balances and DSO will eventually help the bottom line. Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) lost half its value in 2018. The downtrend started when Roche and Exelixis ended Roche’s Phase 2 MODUL study. This included Exelixis’ COTELLIC (cobimetinib) for patients suffering from CRC or metastatic colorectal cancer. The negative developments will hurt future earnings, which is why the stock continued to fall with no “bottom” in sight. In its second-quarter report, released on Aug. 1, the company reported earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue of $186.1 million, up 88%. Both numbers beat consensus estimates and yet the stock continued falling. EXEL is looking to complement its cabozantinib development activities. Still, management sees healthy growth for this business, even after factoring increased competition. It is developing potential new indications for cabozantinib, be it single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is seeking collaborations with early stage biotech this year and beyond, keeping its financial risks low. Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN), whose shares rallied to $6.99 recently only to pull back, made only $210,000 in revenue in its second quarter. This biotech’s potential lies in its imetelstat drug, which is being tested in two randomized clinical trials. The drug is a potential treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer and also a “maintenance treatment following a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen in patients with NSCLC.” On Sept. 13, GERN stock fell in the double-digits and gave up over 20% gains intraday after markets worried over Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continuing with imetelstat. In its presentation, JNJ appeared more likely to continue, since it mentioned the Myelofibrosis-treating drug as a 2019-2021 potential filing (slide 15). The irrational drop in GERN stock in so short a time may have created an entry point. When JNJ added imetelstat on its compassionate use list and, together with Geron, spent four years planning for its use, chances are good JNJ remains committed to the project. Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FOLD) is not having a good year, after falling by a third from its yearly high. The company won the FDA’s approval for Galafold (migalastat), a drug that treats adult patients with Fabry disease, an inherited disorder. The approval, posted on Aug. 10, sent the stock lower in what could have been a “sell on the news” event. Markets may have shifted their concerns over the launch risks. But Amicus already hired and trained a full launch team. With over 3,000 diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. and Japan and a peak worldwide TAPP (Total Amenable Patient Population) of 4,200–6,000, FOLD stock could recover as revenue from drug sales grows steadily in the years ahead. Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR) recovered from its lows in July, topped around $70 by the start of the month, only to close recently at $58.33. Last month, the company reported revenue of $1.09 million, up sharply from $34.59 million last year. EPS totaled $5.33. These solid numbers should have sent the stock higher but markets may have expected more or, once again, sold on the news. Nektar has an excellent future ahead. Its pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, which studies TLR-78 agonist. Nektar — 255 looks at an IL-15 candidate that stimulates both NK-cells and memory T-cells. At the end of 2019, Nektar will report the first data for NKTR-214. This study will enroll patients who have relapsed to at least two prior lines of therapy but have no more than three prior treatments. That is just one of the studies I mention. Nektar is embarking on the initiation of 20 registrational trials with NKTR-214 and will initiate trials for other targeted therapies and I-O therapies. The company is a strong believer of the molecule as a central therapy in immune-oncology. Wall Street analysts are bullish on NKTR stock. From the four analysts (tracked on Tipranks.com) offering a price target, the average is $92 a share, which would give investors 58% in upside. Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) did not fall big like the other picks but is still stuck in a range and is down 16% year-to-date. Valuations are very compelling as shares trade at a 24 times earnings and 8 times forward earnings. Much of Celgene’s deep future value depends on management accelerating its next innovation cycle. Ozanimod and fedratinib regulatory submissions are on track, so expect at least two blockbusters adding to Celgene’s revenues. The company reported two positive Phase III trials — MEDALIST in MDS and BELIEVE in beta-thalassemia. If approved, patients suffering from chronic anemia have a treatment option. In the second quarter, Celgene reported a 17% year-on-year growth in net product sales. Earnings rose 16% in that period. Management raised its revenue forecast to $15 billion, up from $14.8 billion. It now expects net sales of REVLIMID, a drug treating multiple myeloma, to top $9.7 billion, up from a previous guidance of $9.5 billion. Investors seeking a slow, steady biotech stock should consider Celgene. The round trip from $90 in August to $120, and back to $94 on Sept. 18 should pique investor interests. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY) rose after the European Commission approved ONPATTRO (patisiran), a drug that treats adults afflicted with hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. Investors sold ALNY shares in the last week after the company failed to win the FDA’s support for the cardiac indication. The full manuscript, entitled ‘”Effects of Patisiran, an RNA Interference Therapeutic, on Cardiac Parameters in Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis: an Analysis of the APOLLO Study,” will be published in Circulation. Patients suffering from neuropathy will be prescribed this medicine. The heart block is not a major risk for those taking the drug. With the stock nearly 40% below its yearly high, biotech investors may want to pick up some ALNY stock. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not own any of the shares mentioned in this article.

Phillip,Frost,1649,http://floridapolitics.com/archives/275168-ashley-moody-mega-donor,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused one of Republican Attorney General candidate Ashley Moody’s financial supporters of manipulating stock markets to make millions for himself and co-conspirators. According to a complaint brought against Barry Honig, he and a ring of South Florida investors orchestrated a classic pump-and-dump scam. Moody campaign officials say they are refunding Honig’s contributions and disassociating from him completely, but the micro cap fraud case draws fresh questions how Moody as attorney general might treat white collar crime should more donors come under scrutiny. Pump and Dump SEC officials say Honig and other investors arranged the discount purchase of stock in three different companies, then engaged in deceitful trading to create the illusion of market activity. The group of investors sold the stock at inflated prices, reaping millions at the expense of duped investors. “As alleged, Honig and his associates engaged in brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “They failed to appreciate, however, the SEC’s resolve to relentlessly pursue and punish participants in micro cap fraud schemes.” According to the SEC, Honig acted as “primary strategist” in the micro cap fraud scheme. The scheme involved at least three unnamed companies, according to the SEC. First, Honig and other investors, including Miami billionaire Phillip Frost in two of the businesses, bought a large amount of stock at a discount by purchasing a shell company, executing a reverse merger or engaging in financing favorable to the company. Then investors sat on the cheap stock while Seeking Alpha blogger John H. Ford, another defendant in the complaint, or another “promoter” wrote misleading articles hyping the stock, the SEC alleged. The ring of investors meanwhile engaged in trades to create a false impression of market activity right before “news” broke in the blogs. The SEC says Honig directed executives at the companies to sign public filings omitting his and other defendants’ ownership in stock or the size of their holdings. Finally, the investors dumped their stock as prices jumped. The SEC complaint says investors made $9.25 million in stock sales from one company, $9.5 million from a second and $8.3 million from a third. Potential for Favoritism All the investors in the scheme — Honig, Frost, John Stetson, Michael Brauser, John R. O’Rourke III and Mark Grossman — live in South Florida, while the company executives facing charges were based in New York at the time of the activity; Ford lives in California. The SEC says the illegal practices took place from 2013 through this year. Only Honig donated to the Friends of Ashley Moody committee. In the past, he has given to congressional campaigns for former Republican U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite and retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, according to Open Secrets. The SEC filed its complaint in federal court in Manhattan, but it involves plenty of financial activity in Florida, and as more details come out, state laws may come into play. The Florida Attorney General’s Office includes a Consumer Protection Division that investigates and litigates civil cases including theft and deceptive trade practices. Officials with the Moody campaign now are distancing themselves from Honig. “Upon learning of the SEC complaint filed against Barry Honig earlier this month, Melanie Bonanno, chair of the Friends of Ashley political committee, started the process to refund his contribution,” said Christina Johnson, a Moody campaign spokeswoman. The refund doesn’t yet show up in the state’s campaign finance database, but the committee shared a copy of the check. Bonanno sent a letter to Honig on Sept. 11, three days after the SEC announced charges: “In light of the pending SEC complaint, enclosed please find a refund of your donation.” But opponents likely won’t make distancing Moody from Honig easy. The Boca Raton businessman had been one of the top 30 donors to Friends of Ashley Moody as of Sept. 7, the last filing deadline. Of course, the potential influence of political donations has caused headaches for the Attorney General’s Office before. Attorney General Pam Bondi suffered withering criticism over a $25,000 donation by the Trump Foundation in 2013 to a political committee supporting Bondi’s candidacy. The donation came as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump and his Trump University of deceptive conduct. Officials at the Attorney General’s office before the donation was made told two newspapers they were looking into the Trump University case, but after the donation, the office said it was not pursuing its own investigation, according to liberal watchdog group CREW. The issue became a national story after Trump launched his presidential bid and Bondi endorsed him. Bondi also endorsed Moody immediately after she launched her candidacy. Democratic opponent Sean Shaw‘s campaign made mention of the Bondi controversy in its own critique of the Friends of Ashley Moody connection to Honig. “America already has its hands full with the amount of corruption coming from the Trump White House,” said Shaw spokesman Michael Starr Hopkins. “Pam Bondi accepted $25,000 to call off the Trump University investigation and it looks like Ashley Moody was willing to be bought for less until she got caught. Floridians deserve better.” Florida Politics is a statewide, new media platform covering campaigns, elections, government, policy, and lobbying in Florida.
