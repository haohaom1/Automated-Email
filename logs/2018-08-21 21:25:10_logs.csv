Derry Foundation for Arts in Education held its fourth annual golf outing on Saturday, Aug. 11, at Shewami Golf Course. More than 70 golfers enjoyed a beautiful sunny day included 18 holes of golf, followed by dinner, basket raffle, silent auction and presentation of awards. The winning foursome was Cory Clark, Jacob Derry, Andy German and Joe German. The runner-up foursome was James Crook, Rich Kustwin, Mike McCann, and Todd Robinson. Jacob Derry won closest to the pin; Hunter Keith won longest drive, and Mike McCann won longest putt. Derry received a sand wedge, Keith a driver, and McCann a putter for their winning shots. The Derry Foundation, a non-profit organization was founded by the sons of Bill Derry, former art teacher in the Milford school district. Its primary goal is to honor his passion for the arts as well as keep arts alive and thriving in today’s classroom. Each year the Foundation awards a scholarship to a college student studying the arts. This year’s recipient of a $2,500 scholarship was Laura Hanson of Chebanse, who attends ISU. The Sam Fanning Dedication to Education award went to Dick Ronna, a veteran educator from the Pekin school system. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

The latest collaboration between filmmaker Bill Morrison and composer Michael Gordon, The Unchanging Sea, creates a mesmerizing new narrative from 17 ocean-centric short films, dating from 1897 to 1928. Until the early 1950s, film stock was made from cellulose nitrate, which was both highly flammable (remember the scene from Cinema Paradiso when the theater catches fire?) and prone to deterioration. With age, celluloid breaks down and blisters, leaving images looking like they are under attack by hordes of man-eating amoebas. These fantastical images, from the dawn of cinema, are catnip to Morrison, who edits the old clips with a director's efficiency and a poet's sense of expressive detail. While the surreal and sometimes disturbing images in The Unchanging Sea are not unlike our own dreams, there's something oddly comforting in watching the film decompose on screen. The bubbling decay is especially appropriate as it casts a watery spell. Morrison's characters seem to wash up on shore and recede into the ocean's depths. Gordon's sumptuous and undulating score, commissioned and performed by the Seattle Symphony, is equally dramatic, though not overly pictorial. Waves of ominous chords from the depths of the piano come crashing in as the sun rises over an endless ocean. The heroine, napping on a shoreline boulder, is introduced with long, sighing figures in the winds. Within her dream – and the film's 30-minute span – she will find love, wealth and tragedy. Hollywood blockbusters these days are shot through with so many computer-generated special effects and whiplash edits that the brain grows weary. Funny then, how these 100-year-old films, without dialog, fancy lenses or lighting, appear so fresh you can't take your eyes off them. The Unchanging Sea comes out Aug. 24 via Cantaloupe Music. Deceptive Cadence covers the world of classical music. Hosted by Tom Huizenga and Anastasia Tsioulcas, it's an open space for discussion, discovery, music listening and news. Want to know more?

Rookie hooker Wayde Egan is also expected to be given a far more increased role as the Panthers look to fine tune their title run leading into September. The Warriors have suffered a major blow with Blake Green ruled out for Friday’s match at Mt Smart Stadium, but Tohu Harris returns. A win for the Panthers keeps their top four hopes alive while a loss would almost certainly see them finish in the bottom half of the top eight. Panthers forward Viliame Kikau has also been cleared to make the trip to New Zealand despite fears an immigration bungle would prevent him from travelling. The Rabbitohs welcome back several of their backline stars including Greg Inglis, while the Storm are reeling from the injury crisis suffered against the Eels, and Will Chambers’ suspension.

Wayde Egan replaces Sione Katoa in the No.9 jersey. Blake Green is a late scratching for the Warriors, and Mason Lino will take his spot at No.6.

Plans are announced for a new building to provide continued care for those with the development disorder. With an oversized tent and golf cart shuttles to the rescue, downpours didn’t stop the Signs of Hope lawn party Aug. 1 at the Falmouth Foreside home of Sheri and Joe Boulos, longtime supporters of Maine Behavioral Healthcare and Spring Harbor Hospital. “The goal this year is to open your hearts and minds to those who, for no fault of their own, have brains that work differently,” said Sheri Boulos, a member of the development committee. Signs of Hope fundraising was crucial in establishing the organization’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders four years ago, led by autism spectrum disorders expert Dr. Matt Siegel and serving individuals through age 21. The grand announcement at this year’s event was that long-term plans include a major expansion to continue care through adulthood in a new building that will be named after Dr. Girard Robinson. “This is a really important personal honor,” said Robinson, adding that it had been a major challenge in his career to expand access to behavioral healthcare. Over the past 40 years, Robinson has worked as chief medical officer at Spring Harbor Hospital, senior vice president for medical and clinical affairs at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Though retired from those roles, he is serving as interim director of substance use disorders at Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “Dr. Robinson was instrumental in bringing our developmental disorders program to Maine, and we have one of the strongest developmental disorders treatment centers in the country,” said Maine Behavioral Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Steve Merz. “But we want to meet the needs of the children who are now adults, so they don’t have to go away for the services they need.” “Tonight is the first step of raising funds for a major expansion to serve adults as well,” Siegel said. With 150 guests, the majority of whom were host committee members, Signs of Hope raised more than $95,000. “This is crucial to our success, helping us to expand services to a population that is underserved, both locally and nationally,” said Linda Durst, chief medical officer for Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Attendees included parents of young adults with autism who used to have to travel to Boston for care, then were able to access services locally when the center was established – until their children aged out. “We still need to do more for adults once they’ve aged out of high school and have graduated,” said Irene Kapothanasis, whose son Gregory is 25. “They’ve done a marvelous job with pre-K through high school. Now, we need to take the next step.” “Maine Behavioral Health has have done a tremendous job of meeting the needs of children and adolescents, but the specialized needs of this population do not vanish after the age of 21,” said Wendi O’Donovan, whose son Ryan is 22. “In fact, as these children or adolescents become adults, their ability to injure themselves or others grows exponentially.” “We need a whole continuum of care,” said Mary Jane Krebs, president of Spring Harbor Hospital and senior vice president for Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “We’re hoping in the next couple of years to have this larger center. It’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen. It’s really needed.” Amy Paradysz is a freelance writer and photographer based in Scarborough.

It has been just over a week. Since Constable Robb Costello and Constable Sara Burns were killed in the line of duty along with two civilians. Today, the police officers were honoured before more than a thousand family members, friends and first responders from all across Canada. Thousands of police officers attended the funeral services for 45-year-old Costello and 43-year-old Burns. Both officers were gunned down last week in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Fredericton. A 48-year-old man has been charged with four counts of first degree murder. Today was a grey day, with clouds and rain in Fredericton, seemingly echoing the feeling of hundreds who lined the streets to pay their respects. A procession starting at a local high school ended at the city’s university where the funeral took place. The president of the Brantford Police Association tweeted a photo saying: “Heading to Fredericton with 70 police officers of the Police Association of Ontario chartered flight to pay respects to our fallen comrades at Fredericton Police. Huge thank you to Westjet for getting us this flight.” Niagara Regional Police tweeted a photo saying “Our members are in Fredericton paying tribute to fallen officers #fredericton-strong”. The Halton Regional Police Association were in Fredericton saying the made the trip to support the families and colleagues.

The memorial sprung up after a gunman opened fire on the parking lot of an apartment complex on Aug. 10, striking down Constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, along with civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. Mourners flocked to the police station to pay their respects, leaving cards, signs and stuffed animals in a tribute to the small police force still grappling with the death of two of their own. “Thank you Fredericton! Your outpouring of support has been overwhelming,” the agency tweeted Sunday morning. The Fredericton Police Force said it will share the messages among its employees and the families of Costello and Burns. The deluge of sympathy has been noted by Jackie McLean, Costello’s partner, who has been documenting her mourning process through her Twitter account. “I’ve had all of you holding me up and squeezing me back together this past week,” McLean tweeted Sunday. “I’m going to need you to keep doing it.” I’ve had all of you holding me up and squeezing me back together this past week, I’m going to need you to keep doing it. Robb excelled at bringing people together and tonight’s celebration of his life was no exception. The move to collect the cards and flowers comes a day after the regimental funeral for Costello and Burns, attended by more than a thousand officers and first responders from across the continent. At the beginning of the ceremony, officers laid the caps and belts of the fallen constables on top of their caskets, which were covered by Canadian flags, next to the roses placed there by family members. The flags were later carefully folded and given to Costello and Burns’s families with their police hats. “As long as I live, I will never forget the feel of that flag, pillow and hat being place in my hands,” tweeted McLean a couple hours after the ceremony. “I arrived home to think ‘now what do I do with this?’ Nothing seems substantial enough.” Several hours later, she wrote: “Robb excelled at bringing people together and tonight’s celebration of his life was no exception.” During Saturday’s funeral, Burns’s husband fought back tears as he delivered a powerful speech in which he asked the surviving Fredericton officers not to feel any guilt about his wife’s death. As long as I live, I will never forget the feel of that flag, pillow and hat being place in my hands. I arrived home to think “now what do I do with this?” Nothing seems substantial enough. “I want each and every one of you to know that she is at peace, and knows that you did everything you could to protect her,” he said. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, will appear in court Aug. 27 facing four charges of first-degree murder. In a statement last week, police asked that the public not speculate about the case or the alleged shooter’s motives. On Friday, a judge lifted a publication ban that had been imposed on court documents revealing details about how the deadly attack unfolded. Monday’s ban came hours after several media outlets had already reported on what the documents contained. The now public documents say the accused gunman was wounded as he allegedly exchanged gunfire with another officer from his apartment window. We want to improve your reading experience"
