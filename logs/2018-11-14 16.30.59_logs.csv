Andrew,Davis,1620,http://theechonews.com/forgiveness-flashes-across-stage-amish-project/,"Morgan Turner (’16) plays the solo lead in “The Amish Project” (Photograph by Abigail Yasmeen Roberts) By Abigail Yasmeen Roberts | Echo Seven characters, one heart wrenching event, one stage, one woman. In a telling exploration of the West Nickel Mines Schoolhouse Shooting, alumni Morgan Turner (’16), the solo female lead effortlessly embodies the innocence, pain and anger of an entire grieving community. As the stage lights flicker and Turner adeptly moves from character to character, audience members find themselves moving closer and closer to the edge of their seats. Inspired by the killing of five girls on Oct. 2, 2006 in a hostage-taking at an Amish school in Lancaster County, Pa., the play was written in 2008 by Jessica Dickey. Not only reenacting the chilling event itself, Dickey also observes the ripple effect it has in the community after the fact. “This play wrestles not only with being able to forgive,” Turner said, “but being able to be forgiven.” One of the characters Turner personifies, Carol Stuckey, the non-Amish widow of the gunman, wrestles with her husband’s “sick act.” She becomes the recipient of others’ blame, her children’s mistrust and the surprising gift of forgiveness. Through Carol’s journey of rage and despair to possible peace, we see the transformation that forgiveness brings. Gripped by the script since finding it her first year at Taylor, Turner feels honored to be given this role and the rare opportunity to return to Mitchell Theatre. “It is a blessing seeing the play fully realized and the script given the full production it deserves,” Turner said. “It is like going back to the beginning where I began, in a very redemptive way.” Taylor remembers Turner as a vibrant force on the Taylor stage 2012–2016, performing in 10 shows and starring in Taylor’s award winning show, “Rabbit Hole.” Turner is currently working as a director and teacher of Shakespeare to inmates at the Pendleton Correctional Facility as well as performing in and auditioning for shows in Indianapolis. Joining Turner are fellow theater alumni working as production staff for the show, Conner Reagan (’17) as lighting designer, Erin Gautille (’17) as set designer, Tamara Peachy (’17) as stage manager and assistant director, Andrew Davis (’17) as trailer producer and Natalie Smiley (’17) as costume designer. For the student theater staff, it has been rewarding working on a one man show. “It is nice because you can do the things you have to do well,” said sophomore Elizabeth Carrier. Heavy to receive and heavy to give, “The Amish Project” stands as an exceptional example of high-quality acting not to be missed. The cost is $7 for Taylor students and $10 for Taylor faculty, don’t miss this weekend showing, Today at 8 p.m., Saturday, Sept. 15 at 8 p.m. and Sunday, Sept. 16 at 2 p.m. Comments are closed.

Photograph: BBC $image.copyright Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. “Music is not mere entertainment, but rather one of the most powerful forces for good that we have. It makes us smile. It makes us weep. It brings us close to each other. We live in a world that all too often seems dominated by division… it has the power to unite us in beauty and in strength”. These were words from the conductor laureate of the BBCSO, Sir Andrew Davis, when he addressed the 6,000-strong audience in the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night’s Last Night of the Proms, with countless thousands listening and watching across the globe. This year, in addition to the many Union Jacks which traditionally adorn this event, the EU flag was extremely prominent. These were offered for free to raise awareness of the plight facing UK musicians after Brexit. I supported this movement, as I am a freelance viola player who has appeared in several Proms over the last few years, most notably with Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s English Baroque Soloists, and this year performing in Handel’s Theodora with Arcangelo. The act of giving flags was reported as a ‘hijacking’, but in the context of the support that we experienced from the music lovers in the audience that feels like a misplaced description. Sir Andrew’s words will ring true for anyone who enjoys classical music. What many people don’t realise is that music is also hugely beneficial to our economy. The Incorporated Society of Musicians report that the music industry as a whole brings in £4.4bn for our economy every year. Writing on the Musicians’ Union blog earlier this year, the Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire stated that music generates £2.5bn of export revenue for the UK. Musicians are hugely concerned about losing freedom of movement. In the wake of the Proms, now is the ideal time to highlight the issues ahead and alert audiences to how Brexit stands to adversely affect classical music in this country. There is no point having these conversations in six month’s time. In a poll by the Incorporated Society of Musicians, a third said that 50% or more of their income comes via work in the other EU member states. So, following the vote to leave the EU, where does this leave us? As it stands, my colleagues and I plan to undertake EU work post-Brexit. We hope that the UK achieves a deal with the EU, and we know that in this instance musicians will retain freedom of movement until the end of 2020, under a transition period. With the eventual, anticipated loss of freedom of movement UK ensembles will be required to provide instrument carnets, work permits and/or visas to support our touring activities. Realistically the admin costs will need to be added on to the fee. Will a promoter in the EU want to book a UK group, or would they prefer a cheaper group from an EU member state operating without the costly burden of bureaucracy? If music colleges have to charge EU nationals the rates which currently apply to non-EU countries, many will simply not be able to come. The UK has already lost two of its most prestigious training opportunities to Brexit; the European Union Youth Orchestra and the European Union Baroque Orchestra. Our musicians will now miss out on these valuable career-shaping experiences. It has been 18 months since the UK government triggered Article 50. Since then we have heard nothing about freedom of movement regarding services. We have just under 200 days until we leave the EU. The uncertainty in our sector of industry, as with so many, is bad for business, and the failure of the government to address this vital issue is an absolute dereliction of duty. At the time of writing Nigel Farage has taken his dog-whistle racism act to half-empty halls in Australia, whilst chortling into his pint. David Cameron disappeared which such alacrity that I’m surprised Theresa May hasn’t contacted him for tips on how to make a speedy exit. The less said about Michael Gove the better. Our sector is one of many which stand to be disadvantaged by the various versions of Brexit which we see proposed. And looking at our politicians for reassurance what do we see? Clowns to the left of us, and jokers to the right. Orchestras such as the Oxford-based Instruments of Time and Truth have immediate concerns, as they tour to Spain from the UK for a week next year, leaving on March 29th. As of today musicians are being asked to check if they have at least three to six months left on their passport. Artistic Director of the Gabrieli Consort and Players, Paul McCreesh, sums up the situation as follows. “Let's be realistic - leaving the EU is not going to prevent the Berlin Philharmonic appearing at the Proms. Nor will concert halls and opera houses in Vienna, Paris or Madrid cease to engage the most renowned UK soloists and singers. But the axe will fall very hard on the thousands of hard-working UK-based freelance musicians in orchestras, choirs and all sorts of musical ensembles across the EU, who are likely to face drastic loss of earnings.” I end with an endorsement from mezzo-soprano Dame Sarah Connolly DBE, “The BBC Proms season is the greatest music festival in the world. It welcomes excellence from abroad and so the audience is bound to reflect this sense of unity. Music-making should be barrier and boundary free and in my understanding, Brexit is about limitation, narrow mindedness resulting in impoverishment. I whole-heartedly endorse Aliye’s thoughts and will add that when we are in peril, music has the duty to carry a powerful and important message.” Aliye Cornish is a viola player, teacher and arts consultant Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.

Bob,Diamond,1619,http://www.ifre.com/bobs-big-bet-barclays-purchase-of-lehman-brothers-10-years-later/21356030.fullarticle,"Wednesday, 14 November 2018 IFR 2251 15 September to 21 September 2018 By Gareth Gore When two days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy Barclays announced that it was buying the collapsed bank’s prized US investment banking and capital markets business for just US$250m, the deal was widely seen as something of a coup. Bob Diamond, who had spent a decade transforming Barclays’ sleepy investment bank BZW into a dominant European bond house, had long held ambitions to break into Wall Street. Lehman’s collapse was his chance. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Barclays,” he said at the time of the deal. Barclays had been circling around Lehman for months ahead of its collapse – an internal team had been working on what was known as Project Long Island since March. Lehman, with its strength in the US, especially in equities and M&A, seemed like a perfect fit for the European, bond-focused Barclays. Only days before its collapse, Diamond had been preparing to bid up to US$4bn for the whole of Lehman – and much of the mess that lay within. UK authorities baulked at the deal, helping Diamond dodge a bullet. In the end he got the businesses he really wanted, without the mess, for a fraction of the price. “All the conversations were initially about buying the entire Lehman business,” Diamond told IFR. “It fit us perfectly. Only after bankruptcy did it become clear to us that it might be possible to purchase part of it. If I’m perfectly frank, it was even more perfect for Barclays.” On paper, the two promised to be a dominant force in the US - the source of almost half of all underwriting and advisory fees globally then and now. Barclays boasted that the combined entity would be a top three player in the US. MIXED RESULTS But, ten years on, the results are mixed. While Barclays is the top European investment bank in the US – just ahead of Credit Suisse – it now only ranks seventh, according to Thomson Reuters data, well short of the top-three it had targeted. It has slowly dropped down the rankings ever since the deal. Globally, the bank also earns less in revenues from trading and investment banking activities than the combined Barclays and Lehman US businesses did the year before the deal. That is in part because trading revenues have fallen across the industry, but mostly due to half a dozen strategy overhauls in the last few years that saw the bank pull back in many areas globally. Still, initially at least, the deal was a game changer for the UK bank. Overnight, it gained 10,000 Lehman employees (around 4,000 were cut soon after the deal) and lucrative new relationships with huge US clients that previously Barclays could only dream of. “To acquire a franchise that deep, with an incredible advisory business … it was transformational,” said Diamond. “There were so many talented Lehman people that stayed with us. It was a really tough environment, but exciting for us to have such a platform. We couldn’t have done that organically.” It also gave Diamond the ideal excuse to rebalance the business outside of the US away from bonds. He sensed an opportunity for Barclays to be a full-service investment bank across the globe. New teams were set up and big names hired, especially in European equity capital markets. BIG MANDATES With the US economy growing and deals returning, the New York office won some big mandates: it advised Kraft on its acquisition of Cadbury’s, MetLife on its purchase of American Life Insurance, and Hewlett-Packard on Autonomy. None would have even been thinkable for Barclays before Lehman. Revenues from the US surged, and by 2012 were treble what Barclays earned out of the US before the acquisition. That created a nice counterbalance for the bank’s dwindling fortunes in Europe, where the eurozone crisis was ravaging dealmaking. The Lehman deal was paying off nicely. But then the Libor scandal hit the bank, forcing the departure of Diamond, who by that stage had been elevated from head of Barclays’ investment bank to chief executive of the entire group. With Diamond’s exit, the investment bank lost its biggest champion. Two things then happened to dent the momentum of Barclays in the US. Incoming CEO Antony Jenkins launched a crusade to change the culture of the bank. This grated with former Lehman staff, who had been given a relatively free hand to do deals under Diamond. A divide that already existed between London and New York grew wider. Then new rules on leverage and ring-fencing led to a dramatic rethink about what Barclays’ investment bank should be doing – so-called Project Elektra. “It was clear that my successor was not supportive of a global investment bank or of investing in the US business,” Diamond said. Over just a few months, the bank’s US top brass took the hint. Leavers included Skip McGee, global head of investment banking; Larry Wieseneck, head of global finance; Paul Parker, head of M&A; Jeffrey Weiss, head of FIG advisory; Ros Stephenson, co-head of corporate finance; and Jerry Donini, head of equities. SHRINK IN BUSINESS In an industry built on relationships, that hurt. Insiders say the franchise took a hit that it has struggled to recover from. Thomson Reuters data show that Barclays investment banking fee haul in the US peaked in 2012. While the overall pie has grown, it has seen US fees fall by about 6% since. Jenkins was pushed out at the end of 2015, to be replaced by Jes Staley, a former JP Morgan investment banker. Under him, Barclays has sought to recharge its US operations. He has publicly said that the UK lender will seek to have a “bulge-bracket transatlantic investment bank”. “In the years prior to Jes coming in there was certainly a loss of talent. But Jes has been very supportive of the US,” Diamond said. The strategy appears to be bearing some fruit. In the US last year, the bank had its best year ever for M&A advisory fees, after winning mandates on some key deals such as the Mars acquisition of VCA and the buyout of Staples. This year, it ranks fifth in US equities. Still, the top three it was aiming for in 2008 remains a long way off.

Bob,Diamond,1619,https://whbl.com/news/articles/2018/sep/14/britains-fc-bans-ex-deutsche-bank-trader-after-euribor-rigging/,"(Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has banned former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar from performing any function related to any regulated financial activity, the financial watchdog said on Friday. Christian Bittar, 46, was sentenced to five years and four months in March after pleading guilty for plotting to rig global Euribor interest rates. ""If he had not been convicted and imprisoned for the same matters, the FCA would have sought a financial penalty of 6.5 million pounds ($8.50 million),"" said Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. ""As it is, we have prohibited him from performing any regulated function, reinforcing the message of the criminal court,"" Steward said. Apart from Bittar, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef was also sentenced to eight years for the same crime. The two men were charged with conspiring to manipulate the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide, between January 2005 and December 2009. ""Between March 2005 and June 2009, Bittar made at least 81 requests to Deutsche Bank submitters for high or low EURIBOR submissions to benefit trading positions,"" Steward said. Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 in a global investigation into allegations of rate-rigging. Its $453 million penalty sparked a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry. Three years later, Deutsche Bank was ordered to pay $2.5 billion and was accused of obstructing regulators and ""cultural failings"". Its London-based subsidiary pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud. ($1 = 0.7649 pounds) (Reporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru, editing by Louise Heavens)

Bob,Diamond,1619,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6170059/Crash-dramatic-hour-hour-reconstruction-fateful-day-bank-Lehman-Brothers-collapsed.html,"By Guy Adams Published: 19:17 EST, 14 September 2018 | Updated: 19:31 EST, 14 September 2018 50 View comments Today marks the tenth anniversary of the day the U.S. bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy — and tipped the global economy into a crisis from which the world is still recovering. Pictures of Lehman employees stumbling out of the London headquarters carrying their possessions in boxes came to sum up the chaos that swept the City in those febrile days. Here, a gripping hour-by-hour reconstruction describes how the crisis unfolded as the then chancellor Alistair Darling, the Bank of England governor and a series of finance chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic fought to stave off disaster. A worker carries a box as she walks away from the office of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in the Canary Wharf district of London Wednesday, Sept 10, 2008, 10am, UK (5am New York time) Bleary-eyed after four hours’ sleep, Richard Fuld steps into a chauffeur-driven Mercedes and begins his daily commute to central Manhattan. As the car rolls away from his 12-acre estate in Greenwich, Connecticut, the 61-year-old CEO of Lehman Brothers glances at the New York Times, whose front page declares that ‘Wall Street is gripped by fears’ about his company. Just seven months ago, Fuld was a fully paid-up Master of the Universe, who’d earned more than half a billion dollars since the mid-Nineties, and owned Lehman shares worth a billion more. He was nicknamed ‘The Gorilla’ for his pugnacity (for years he kept a stuffed toy silverback in the office), and famed for such macho catchphrases as ‘every day is a battle!’ and ‘you’ve got to kill the enemy!’ Today, however, Fuld is the one being killed. Lehman shares, which had peaked in February 2007 at $86.18, are now changing hands for a paltry $7.79, due to concerns over its exposure to toxic mortgages. In a few hours, he must announce a staggering $3.9 billion quarterly loss. 11am (6am NY) Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, presides over the monthly meeting of its ruling Court of Directors. It’s been a gruelling few hours. Markets are ‘tense’, they are told, with ‘considerable nervousness around Lehman Brothers’. The ‘position remains very fragile’, minutes of the meeting state, with fears that the fallout could soon threaten ‘UK mortgage banks’. Behind the crisis lies a simple fact: major financial institutions, unsure of the scale of losses rivals may be exposed to, are starting to question each other’s solvency. As a result, they are offloading investments and calling in debts. At Lehman, this has created a major cash-flow crisis. 3.30pm (10.30am NY) At the London Stock Exchange opposite St Paul’s Cathedral, traders are glued to Richard Fuld’s crucial earnings statement, where he reveals that Lehman has had to write down (i.e. reduce the value of) $5.6 billion linked to home loans that recently turned sour. Brokers trade dollars on the currency market at BGC Partners in London, September 15, 2008 As the jumpy atmosphere suggests, few believe this already gargantuan figure to be anything other than the tip of an iceberg. Over the past decade, mortgages have been used as raw materials for trillions of dollars’ worth of highly complex financial products. But U.S. house prices began tumbling the previous autumn, causing many of those products to fail. Today, no one is entirely sure what — if anything — they’re now worth. Or who exactly might be exposed to them. Computer screens turn red as investors begin offloading banking stocks. Shares in Barclays and Lloyds, a staple of many Britons’ pension funds, will have fallen by 4 per cent by the closing bell in 90 minutes. HBOS, whose shares have halved in recent months, also tumble. The FTSE ends the day down 40 points at 5327. A year ago, it had peaked at 6730. 4.30pm (11.30am NY) Bob Diamond, the ambitious head of Barclays Capital, convenes a meeting of senior staff at the bank’s headquarters, pejoratively known as ‘the Bungalow’, in Canary Wharf. During today’s earnings statement, Richard Fuld effectively hoisted up a ‘for sale’ sign over Lehman Brothers, saying he needs to raise cash by offloading assets. And Diamond, a brash American responsible for transforming what was once a small British bank with 3,000 employees into a global juggernaut boasting 15,000 of them, smells an opportunity in the crisis. Though Barclays has its own problems — shares have lost a third of their value in 2008 — he wants to launch an audacious bid to take over the whole of Lehman in a move that will effectively place him in charge of the world’s biggest investment bank. Thursday, Sept 11, 2.30pm (9.30am NY) After his morning run, Timothy Geithner, fitness fanatic president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, hits the telephones. United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner returns from a run before the G20 finance ministers meeting on November 7, 2009 in St Andrews, Scotland Lehman shares have opened down yet again, this time a staggering 42 per cent, to $4.44, on the back of grim morning briefing notes from brokers to their clients. The Fed now believes only a deep-pocketed buyer will be able to prevent its collapse. One possible bidder, Bank of America, has been mulling a deal overnight. But Geithner is desperate to bring a second ‘white knight’ to the table. He duly passes Bob Diamond’s mobile telephone number to Fuld. ‘I understand I’m supposed to call you. I think we should talk,’ says the Lehman boss. ‘We are going to be flying over tonight,’ replies Diamond. 5pm (Noon NY) In America, Lehman shares collapse another 13.5 per cent, while shares in Merrill Lynch and Washington Mutual, thought to be the next two most vulnerable banks, are also tumbling. Meanwhile, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has just ended a day-long meeting in Nice with European finance ministers. Britain's former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling (L) talks with President of the European commitee of regulation for stock market, Eddy Wymeersch, on September 12, 2008 The Labour government is terrified by the growing likelihood of a crash, which has already seen UK unemployment rise from 5 to 6 per cent this year. News that Barclays is courting Lehman fills him with dread. ‘You should know that we have serious concerns about this deal,’ he tells U.S. treasury secretary Hank Paulson during a stern phone call. ‘Barclays shouldn’t take on any more risk than they could possibly manage.’ Ironically, just minutes after the conversation ends, Barclays boss Bob Diamond arrives at the Lehman Brothers’ headquarters in a blacked-out Mercedes. 11pm (6pm NY) A dozen of Wall Street’s most powerful CEOs are summoned to the Federal Reserve building by Hank Paulson. They are told to spend the weekend inside this imposing edifice, which is modelled after the Strozzi Palace of Florence, working out how to save Lehman. ‘We’re going to need to find a solution before the weekend is out, and it’s not going to be government money,’ declares Paulson, adding that by Monday morning the firm will be insolvent. ‘You’re going to have to figure this out.’ Despite carnage in financial stocks, the FTSE ends the week almost exactly where it started, on 5,416, while the Dow will nudge up 1.8 per cent, reflecting the public’s apparent ignorance of the growing threat to the economy. Saturday, Sept 13, noon (7am NY) Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, drinks coffee as he flicks through the Wall Street Journal in his Park Avenue apartment. The front page headline screams: ‘Lehman Races Clock; Crisis Spreads’. If anything, he knows the real situation is far more precarious: Lehman’s collapse will cost other banks billions, most likely pushing first Merrill Lynch, then his own company and even Goldman Sachs into the firing line. Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co At 7.30am, he tells a conference call with 24 members of the management team: ‘You are about to experience the most unbelievable week in America ever and we have to prepare for the absolutely worst case. We have to protect the firm. This is about our survival.’ 2pm (9am NY) More than 100 bankers, along with a throng of regulators and treasury officials, arrive at the Federal Reserve, where they will spend 48 hours exploring options to rescue Lehman Brothers. Bank of America declares itself out of the running, believing a takeover would only make financial sense if the U.S. government were to provide a subsidy of $80 billion. Bob Diamond of Barclays seems to think he might know better. On the fourth floor, his team is holed up in a room with a sheet marked ‘bidder’ taped to the door. There is a problem: in London, his firm’s top lawyer, Mark Harding, reckons any deal will require a shareholder vote, taking up to two months. They need to find a way to guarantee Lehman’s whopping debts, which no one can properly value, during that period. Sunday, Sept 14, 1pm (8am NY) Bob Diamond has a plan: Barclays will sign a deal to buy the whole of Lehman, with the exception of its real estate debts. These will be parcelled off into a separate entity, financed by $3.5 billion from Barclays (the maximum Diamond can spend without a shareholder vote) along with contributions from other Wall Street banks. A meeting of chief executives is convened at the Federal Reserve by JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon. ‘OK, let’s make this really simple,’ he declares. ‘How many of you would kick in $1billion — I don’t care what form it takes — to stop Lehman from going down?’ The answer is almost all of them. They are close to saving Lehman. Or so they think. 3.30pm (10.30am NY) A frantic Hector Sants of the Financial Services Authority is driving up the A30 from Cornwall to London, discussing the Barclays takeover with his chairman Callum McCarthy. They believe the UK bank has insufficient cash to carry out the deal without placing the entire UK financial system at risk. At 4pm, Alistair Darling calls America’s treasury secretary Hank Paulson and tells him that Britain will block any bid, snuffing out any hope of saving Lehman Brothers. 10pm (5pm NY) A ping on the BlackBerry of Mo Grimeh, Lehman’s Head of Emerging Markets, confirms the Barclays deal is off. He rushes into the office, where hundreds of colleagues are converging. ‘If the bank was going to file for bankruptcy, we wouldn’t be able to enter the building on Monday morning,’ he later told Bloomberg. ‘That’s the reason everybody headed back to 745 Seventh Ave: to collect whatever personal items they might have.’ Richard Fuld, Chairman and C.E.O. of Lehman Brothers, listens to a speaker during a press conference organized by the US Climate Action Partnership 22 January 2007 at the National Press Club in Washington, DC Inside, chaos reigns. ‘The trading floor was packed, but people were not working. Some were crying. Some were drinking beer. Some were doing shots of tequila. Most of them were smoking. There was total chaos.’ ‘The girls were just packing boxes and boxes of shoes. I discovered that females tend to have multiple pairs of shoes under their desks. I had no idea until that day.’ Monday, Sept 15, 6.45am (1.45am NY) The board of Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, It has $639 billion of assets, $613 billion of debts and 100,000 creditors, making it the largest ever corporate bankruptcy. Around $70 billion owed to other institutions is wiped out and 25,935 staff around the world face redundancy. 8am (3am NY) Staff arriving at Lehman’s European headquarters at Canary Wharf in London are handed an A4 sheet of paper telling them of ‘high-level information regarding recent changes impacting the firm’. Namely: it has gone bust. The note stresses ‘no trades or other transactions may be entered into by members of staff today without prior clearance from a member of the Europe and Middle East operating committee’. They begin boxing up belongings and swapping contact details. Some are in tears while the stoics among them are busy calling head-hunters in search of a new job. 10am (5am NY) A walk of shame awaits the 4,000 bankers filing out of the Canary Wharf office, boxes in hand. Graduate trainee Jack Reynolds, who had been at the firm for little more than a week, carries a Lehman Brothers branded umbrella and rugby ball. ‘My career has been screwed,’ he tells TV crews and newspaper reporters. ‘No one is happy. Everyone is upset and down, but they’ve just got to get on with it.’ Kirsty McCluskey, 32, who works on Lehman’s London trading floor, declares: ‘It is terrible. Death. It’s like a massive earthquake. It’s final. Everybody is just finishing up. I’ll now try to move into another industry.’ Thankfully, she adds, managers have promised to process her outstanding expenses. 12 noon (7am NY) Jennifer Duthie, a 22-year-old graduate recruit, is one of roughly 4,000 London bankers who have spent the morning at Lehman’s Canary Wharf headquarters, processing the fact that they are out of a job. ‘By midday people were looting the office, sweeping up branded merchandise such as bags and stationery for memorabilia,’ she later told the Mail. ‘Other colleagues were having slap-up lunches in the canteen or buying boxes of Coke cans and chocolate bars to use up the money on their staff ID cards. ‘I went for a drink with colleagues in a bar, where we were harassed by Press and recruiters [from other banks]. They were like hyenas around a carcass . . . But we stayed anyway as we didn’t want to go home where reality would sink in.’ John Collins, 40, who works in equity derivatives product control, gives passers-by a first-hand account of proceedings inside the steel and glass building. ‘People are trying to put a brave face on it, but obviously there are some disconsolate people who have taken it very badly,’ he says. ‘They say the economy is in its worst position since the Twenties. They could be right. It’s only the guys at the top who know what’s happening.’ 1pm (8am NY) A sheepish-looking Lehman boss Richard Fuld arrives at the firm’s New York HQ and is escorted to his 31st-floor office by security guards who fear that angry colleagues might attack him. Lehman employees were unique on Wall Street in that they owned about a quarter of the firm’s shares. Most had a five-year lock-in period, meaning huge sums of their own net worth had disappeared during the bank’s collapse. As the world’s media converge on the building, staff create a 100ft ‘wall of shame’ on its south side, filled with angry graffiti along with photos of Fuld and his chief operating officer with the caption ‘Dumb and Dumber’. The following days and weeks see carnage on global stock-markets, plunging the world into the deepest slump since the Great Depression. Merrill Lynch and HBOS are taken over, and Washington Mutual, once America’s biggest savings and loans bank, is shut by watchdogs. As regulators pour trillions into attempting to bail out stricken financial institutions, the slump morphs into a worldwide recession, with international trade crashing by 30 per cent and unemployment spiralling across the globe, and Britain’s GDP falling by 7.2 per cent and unemployment doubling to 8.5 per cent. The stock market will lose almost half its value. And public finances will take a hammering that leads to almost a decade of austerity. Three weeks after Lehman’s demise, on Tuesday, October 7, 2008, prime minister Gordon Brown talks his aide Damian McBride through last-ditch plans to bail out eight of the nation’s most troubled banks, at a cost of £2,000 for every British taxpayer. ‘We’ve got to get ourselves ready in case it goes wrong tomorrow. And I mean really wrong,’ he says. ‘If the banks are shutting their doors, and the cashpoints aren’t working, and people go to Tesco and their cards aren’t being accepted, the whole thing will just explode. If you can’t buy food or petrol or medicine for your kids, people will just start breaking the windows and helping themselves. ‘It’ll be anarchy. That’s what could happen tomorrow . . . We’d have to think: do we have curfews, do we put the Army on the streets, how do we get order back?’ Capitalism is a whisker from collapse. The chilling question now, of course, as storm clouds gather over the global economy once more, is whether lessons have been learned that will stop the same thing happening all over again.

Steve,Cummings,1617,https://www.theinertia.com/surf/10-minutes-at-the-wedge-with-all-the-play-by-play-hoots-from-the-beach/,"Ever wonder how some filmmakers and photographers can keep themselves on the beach all day while the rest of us swim around and play? It’s the exact opposite of how most of us would choose to spend a day knowing there are going to be good waves. Don’t touch the water. Don’t catch a wave for yourself. Look but don’t touch. Isn’t it boring? How do these people keep their sanity? For Southern California filmmaker Steve Cummings, aka JacuzziSurfer, staying entertained doesn’t seem like much of a problem. In fact, from the sounds of it, the guy is perfectly happy posting up with a camera all day, throwing out a few hoots of encouragement and a chirp or two when necessary. Enjoy 10 minutes on the beach with Steve, here. No fancy music and highlight reel moments from this week at the Wedge. Just Steve pointing a camera at the waves and giving his two cents, one soundbite at a time.

You can also post comments, and manage your email subscription. Lost your password? Only one active session is allowed per subscriber. You don't have an account? Sign Up Dear Editor, Today I am sad. Very sad. Today, the 14th September, would have been my brother’s thirty-fifth birthday. He died last December at GPHC. I wrote a letter to the Stabroek News on the 31st January 2018, titled ‘Sad the way GPHC treated a terminally ill patient’. It described the inhumane treatment my brother received during his last days. As a result of my letter I was contacted by Rohmena Chung, Director of Human Resources of the Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation on the 1st February who made some queries and promised to investigate and get back to me. To date I’m still awaiting a follow up response. My letter got to Guyana Times, in New York. Not sure how it got there. GPHC CEO Brigadier (ret’d) George Lewis was contacted by the newspaper and this was his response on the 5th February, as quoted by the Guyana Times. “Yes, I saw the letter and I was disappointed. I read the letter because I felt that, rather than going to the press, Mr. Devonish should have shared the information with us (at the GPHC), and we certainly would have launched an investigation into the issue and taken corrective actions, whether it would be disciplinary, whether it be training or whatever, to correct the situation,”. Minister within the Public Health Ministry Dr Karen Cummings was also contacted, on the 5th February, by the Guyana Times and this was her response. “We are aware of the issues, but I want to say that there are supervisors for the nurses, and they know that they are not supposed to be on their phones because they are very important in the delivery of health care. We are developing programmes to teach them customer care and efficiency, but the issues didn’t come the other day; (they are) something that we inherited, and moving forward, we are going to address (them). I want to say that in addressing (the issues) we would have to reassess the attitudes of the nurses and then we have to overhaul the system to improve it.” Mr. Lewis you said I should have made a complaint to the GPHC and it would have been investigated. Anyway, you were aware of it since February. What have you done? Same question to Dr. Karen Cummings and Rohmena Chung. What was done? What has changed? I can answer those questions for you. Nothing has changed. Patients continue to experience undue suffering. Now you understand why I have no confidence in the GPHC investigation process? Now you understand why I chose to go to the media? The fact is that there have been similar tragedies in the health care system after my letter. The baby that died in the NICU from sepsis when he was admitted with a congenital duodenal problem. The mother in Linden who died from a ruptured uterus and no matching blood available in Linden. The driver had to scurry to Georgetown to get blood and by the time he returned the mother was dead. The mother who died in Berbice because of poor care and when the mourning relatives complained they were chased off the maternity ward. The mother who was admitted to the maternity ward with a foetus that was alive. She was placed on a bed with a massive hole, developed back pain and lost the baby. These are just the few I could remember off my head that occurred over the past seven months. There are many more. The point is that the health service in Guyana is in crisis. Not today. For years. Under PPP. Under PNC. Under APNU+AFC. None of them care. Their health is taken care of overseas. Editor, my letter today is not for those in authority to provide answers for my brother’s horrendous care. It’s not about me. It was never about me. I am just the humble messenger for the suffering patients. Rather, my letter today is to give an insight as to why I repeatedly write letters in defence of patients. My brother last year. My mother when I was nine years. Both died in front of my eyes. Both experiences that keep this passion burning in me. I will not stop until things improve for others. No one should have our horrible experiences. I see myself as a patient mole who has infiltrated the medical profession. Dr Martin Luther King once said, “If a man has not found something worth dying for, he is not fit to live.” I have found that something Dr. King alluded to. Unlike most, I found it at the tender age of nine. An age where I did not understand the magnitude of my beliefs or its consequences. Sherwin, happy birthday. I miss you. I really miss you. No day goes by without me thinking of you and mom. I know you are looking down on me. When you were alive you always made me feel special by boasting to your friends that your brother is a doctor. My text message I sent to you last year on your birthday I do still have it. If I had known that our phone conversation on your birthday would have been the last birthday conversation we would have had I would have recorded it. I will be with you and mom. Not sure when. Be patient with me. I have much more to do before I take my rightful place in Thugz Mansion. The final resting place for the poor and underprivileged.

Andrew,Davis,1615,https://news.uga.edu/new-uga-scholarship-rural-students/,"The University of Georgia has introduced a new scholarship for exceptional students from rural Georgia as part of a new ALL Georgia program. Part of President Jere W. Morehead’s strategic initiatives, the ALL Georgia scholarship provides financial aid for six outstanding students matriculating to UGA from rural Georgia each year. The scholarship is renewable for up to eight semesters and is part of the ALL Georgia Program, which supports all students from counties classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as predominantly rural and who may or may not have financial need with a network of resources through partnerships with a variety of departments across campus. Some 3,700 students are eligible for the ALL Georgia program network. “Our data show that students hailing from rural areas of Georgia face different challenges as they transition to the university,” said Vice President for Instruction Rahul Shrivastav. “The ALL Georgia Program supports students from rural Georgia and ensures that they have the same opportunities for success at UGA as their peers.” Through the ALL Georgia program, the Division of Academic Enhancement, the Division of Student Affairs and Public Service and Outreach, among other offices, collaborate to promote common experiences, such as Freshman College Summer Experience, Dawg Camp and Scholar Success Days, for rural students. “We are excited to bring together this network of resources from across campus to support these exceptional students,” said Victor Wilson, vice president for student affairs. “Immersive experiences like Dawg Camp and Freshman College help students make meaningful, lasting connections and aid in their transitions from rural home communities to Athens and campus life.” That transition can be challenging. As a result, rural students have lower four-year graduation rates and are more likely to withdraw from college than their peers. “The goal is to help keep students from rural areas on track by cultivating a sense of belonging,” said T. Chase Hagood, director of the Division of Academic Enhancement. “Even as our students are academically well-prepared, the culture, language and expectations of higher education can present unanticipated challenges. We want to make sure that all students understand that the University of Georgia wants to see them be successful from their very first day to graduation.” ALL Georgia Scholar Elizabeth Floyd on the UGA campus. (Photo by Peter Frey/UGA) For many, like ALL Georgia Scholarship recipient Elizabeth Floyd, the transition to Athens living can bring obstacles. “Where I grew up, I was in a class of 52 people, so I knew everyone,” said Floyd, who comes from Alamo, Georgia, located 80 miles north of Waycross. “Here, I’ve gotten out of my comfort zone and met new people, people from backgrounds I’ve never come into contact with before.” Floyd, who plans to major in business management, is currently enrolled in one of the program’s cohort-based scholar success seminars, which feature small class sizes and group discussions on topics such as research-based study strategies. Undergraduate student Alex Huskey is an ALL Georgia Scholar. (Photo by Peter Frey/UGA) Fellow ALL Georgia Scholar Alex Huskey expected Athens to be different from his hometown of Summerville, Georgia, located 25 miles northeast of Rome. Fewer than 5,000 people call Summerville home. That is less than the number of first-year students enrolled at UGA. The scholarship and program have been key in helping Huskey acclimate to campus. “The scholarship program definitely connects you with resources and lets you know about them and makes you more comfortable with them, knowing where you should go if you need help with tutoring and things like that,” he said. For both Floyd and Huskey, the scholarship money helped bridge the gap between the dream of attending UGA and actually getting to the university. “This is my dream school and has been since I was younger,” Floyd said. “If it wasn’t for the scholarships, I wouldn’t be here.”

It makes us smile. It makes us weep. It brings us close to each other. We live in a world that all too often seems dominated by division ... it has the power to unite us in beauty and in strength”. These were words from the conductor laureate of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Sir Andrew Davis, when he addressed the 6,000 strong audience in the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday night’s Last Night of the Proms, with countless thousands listening and watching across the globe. This year, in addition to the many Union Jacks which traditionally adorn this event, the EU flag was extremely prominent. These were offered for free to raise awareness of the plight facing UK musicians after Brexit. I supported this movement, as I am a freelance viola player who has appeared in several Proms over the last few years, most notably with Sir John Eliot Gardiner’s English Baroque Soloists, and this year performing in Handel’s Theodora with the ensemble Arcangelo. The act of giving flags was reported as a ""hijacking"", but in the context of the support that we experienced from the music lovers in the audience that feels like a misplaced description. Sir Andrew’s words will ring true for anyone who enjoys classical music. What many people don’t realize is that music is also hugely beneficial to our economy. The Incorporated Society of Musicians report that the music industry as a whole brings in £4.4 billion for our economy every year. Writing on the Musicians’ Union blog earlier this year, the Bristol West MP Thangam Debbonaire stated that music generates £2.5 billion of export revenue for the UK. Musicians are hugely concerned about losing freedom of movement. In the wake of the Proms, now is the ideal time to highlight the issues ahead and alert audiences to how Brexit stands to adversely affect classical music in this country. There is no point having these conversations in six months' time. In a poll by the Incorporated Society of Musicians, a third said that 50% or more of their income comes via work in the other EU member states. So, following the vote to leave the EU, where does this leave us? As it stands, my colleagues and I plan to undertake EU work post-Brexit. We hope that the UK achieves a deal with the EU, and we know that in this instance we will retain freedom of movement until the end of 2020, under a transition period. Currently if I am offered work with an orchestra in Paris, all I have to do is send them a form from HMRC which demonstrates my status as a UK tax payer so that they can pass my fee on to me after the gig without deducting tax in France. If freedom of movement is lost, as it is likely to be following a transition period, then things become more complicated, as they were before the UK joined the EU. With the loss of freedom of movement we will be required to provide instrument carnets, work permits and/or visas to support our touring activities. As it stands, if you tour to the USA with an instrument then you must carry a document certifying all of the materials contained within it. If the customs officials suspect that your instrument contains a banned material then it will be destroyed. Now, I accept that it is unlikely that this sort of regulation will be applied overnight on 29 March 2019. But you can understand that no instrumentalist wants to take that risk. It has been 18 months since the UK government triggered Article 50. Since then we have heard nothing about freedom of movement regarding services. Nothing. With just over 6 months until we leave that is simply extraordinary. I am involved in organizing a tour with the Oxford-based orchestra Instruments of Time and Truth. We go to Spain for a week and leave the UK on 29 March 2019, which is the day that the UK is set to leave the EU. We have to get paperwork in place for 40-50 musicians. Do we only need paperwork for our return journey? Do we need to demonstrate on our return journey that we left the UK on 29 March, even though that technically wasn’t an issue at the time? Does every member of our choir and orchestra need to apply for a work permit? We have accepted the dates so I accept that this paperwork may well need to materialize. I cannot begin to deal with any paperwork until there is some guidance available. This is a shocking dereliction of duty by our government and the uncertainty, as in so many other sectors, is not good for business. Going forward, if UK orchestras do need to generate this paperwork for tours in the EU then realistically the admin costs will need to be added on to our fee. Will a promoter in the EU want to book a UK group, or would they prefer a cheaper group from an EU member state operating without the costly burden of bureaucracy? Do EU nationals playing in the Last Night of the Proms earn the £80,000 a year required to keep their place here? Every single Prom from this year’s festival would look and sound very different if you removed each non-UK EU national from the stage. If music colleges have to charge EU nationals the rates which currently apply to non-EU countries, many will simply not be able to come. The talent pool decreases, and standards drop. How many music college professors from EU countries earn more than £80,000 per year? The UK has already lost two of its most prestigious training opportunities to Brexit; the European Union Youth Orchestra and the European Union Baroque Orchestra. The latter shaped my path into the profession and it’s a disgrace that our musicians will now miss out on these valuable training opportunities. Artistic Director of the Gabrieli Consort and Players, Paul McCreesh, sums up the situation as follows. “Let's be realistic - leaving the EU is not going to prevent the Berlin Philharmonic appearing at the Proms. Nor will concert halls and opera houses in Vienna, Paris or Madrid cease to engage the most renowned UK soloists and singers. But the axe will fall very hard on the thousands of hard-working UK-based freelance musicians in orchestras, choirs and all sorts of musical ensembles across the EU, who are likely to face drastic loss of earnings.” Going forward, I and the musicians with whom I stand are writing to our MPs, and working hard to protect our rights as performers. We ask those who would like to support us to also write to their MPs, to raise these issues. In order to maintain our place on the world stage we need to preserve freedom of movement in the EU so that we can continue to share the world-class music-making which happens in this country. I end with an endorsement from mezzo-soprano Dame Sarah Connolly DBE, “The BBC Proms season is the greatest music festival in the world. It welcomes excellence from abroad and so the audience is bound to reflect this sense of unity. Music-making should be barrier and boundary free and in my understanding, Brexit is about limitation, narrow mindedness resulting in impoverishment. I whole-heartedly endorse Aliye’s thoughts and will add that when we are in peril, music has the duty to carry a powerful and important message.” Aliye Cornish is a freelance viola player.

Bob,Diamond,1614,https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-diamond-former-barclays-ceo-defends-role-in-financial-crisis-2018-9,"With the 10-year anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers just two days away, many key figures from the financial crisis have taken the opportunity in recent days to reflect on their part in it. Most have spoken of their regrets from the time, but largely struck a positive tone on the changes to the financial system that have occurred since then to make the world safer. Former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond has struck a slightly different tone, however. He said in an interview on Thursday that banks need to be taking more risks today, not fewer. ""If they are totally without risk, they are not helping create jobs and economic growth,"" Diamond said in an interview with the BBC. ""The culture of banking now is that if anyone makes a mistake they get fined — or the bank is in trouble."" Diamond, was head of Barclays Capital arm during the crisis, before becoming its CEO in 2011. During his time at the bank, Labour party grandee Peter Mandelson famously labelled him the ""unacceptable face of banking."" He left Barclays in 2012 amid the LIBOR rigging scandal and is now involved with Atlas Mara, a financial services firm focused on Africa, which he cofounded in 2013. Diamond told the BBC that all banks should not be lumped together when it comes to assessing the crisis. British lenders like Barclays and HSBC should not be compared to those that needed government aid like Lloyds and RBS. ""I think HSBC and Barclays deserve credit for raising capital privately,"" he said. ""People should be angry with RBS for failing in the way it did — ten years later people still haven't got their money back. Private investors who put money into Barclays have seen very good returns."" In need of funding during the crisis, Barclays turned to the wealthy middle eastern state of Qatar to secure a £12 billion ($15.6 billion) package. The deal was investigated by the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after it emerged that Barclays provided a $3 billion loan to the state of Qatar in the same year. Charges of conspiracy to commit fraud were brought against the bank but thrown out earlier this year. One of the biggest retrospective criticisms of financial institutions in the run-up to the crisis is that they had cultures that placed profits above anything else. Diamond has always denied that this was the case at Barclays, and used his BBC interview to reiterate that. ""I don't think the reprehensible behaviour of a few people out of 160,000 employees is representative of the culture we had at Barclays. I think we had a very strong culture,"" he said. Diamond also defended himself and Barclays from accusations during the crisis that they were involved in ""casino banking"" — the now infamous charge levied by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable in 2010 during his time as business secretary. ""Labels like casino banking are very pejorative and very unhelpful and don't describe the reality. Vince Cable was wrong,"" Diamond told the BBC. ""We have asset managers managing pension funds who need access to liquidity. We have companies hedging their foreign exchange exposure. Sit on a trading floor and you'll see the real value this brings to the economy."" This is a subscriber-only story.

Bob,Diamond,1614,https://www.barrons.com/articles/lehmans-buyer-is-on-the-lookout-for-another-crisis-1536859780,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

That acquisition leaves Barclays as “the only credible non-U.S. investment bank right now,” Diamond told Barron’s recently, with some justification. Diamond’s merger and acquisition skills were honed over four decades in banking, first at Morgan Stanley (ticker: MS), then CS First Boston, and finally Barclays (BCS). He gets a lot of the credit for building up Barclays Global Investors, the international asset manager that was sold to BlackRock (BLK) in 2009 for $15.2 billion. That transaction “was very successful for both sides,” says the Massachusetts native, 67. Barclays, under pressure to shore up its balance sheet, raised a chunk of capital, and BlackRock got a global platform that has been a catalyst for its recent ascendancy. Diamond was finally ousted from Barclays in 2012 as the postcrisis mood soured on star bankers, and after British regulators demanded his head for Barclays’ role in an interest-rate-rigging scandal. Since then, this lifelong deal maker has turned his hand to something else: investing. Atlas Merchant Capital, a firm he co-founded in 2013, has built up stakes in a range of financial firms, mostly across Europe. “I have done deals. I acquired Lehman Brothers…but being an investor is a different skill set,” he says. Barron’s interviewed him recently at his London headquarters. The following excerpts have been edited. Barron’s: There has been so much written about the financial crisis. Is there anything we still get wrong? Bob Diamond: I don’t read a lot of what’s coming out. It is just retelling the stories. The fundamental change in banks has been that no government, no elected official will ever want to be in the position where they are the one who has to bail out a financial institution. [But] if banks don’t take risks, aren’t willing to be innovative, then they are not going to be helping to create jobs and economic growth. Do you think we’ve solved the problem of Too Big to Fail, where some banks are considered so important that governments are forced to bail them out? How can anyone possibly say that it has been solved when we are looking at the situation of Deutsche Bank [DB] in Germany right now? I don’t know enough to opine, but if you go by the public discourse, there would potentially be a government bailout, and we will be back in the same position. Do I believe that the larger interconnected banks are safe and sounder today? Without question. I don’t think there’s a banking crisis around the corner. But do I believe we have solved Too Big to Fail? No. You said you don’t see a crisis around the corner, but do you see any pockets of concern? I said banking crisis. There is always a crisis around the corner! The crisis of 2008 created an economic correction, recession, whatever word you want to use. We saw an incredible response, particularly from the U.S., in terms of lowering rates and quantitative easing. But if you look at the amount of stimulus that has been put into the economy, and that the good times have been here for nine or 10 years, it causes you to think, what could be next? The clouds on the horizon are based on 10 years into an economic recovery; interest rates in the big economies still below 2%; $3.5 trillion still on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; recent stimulus of fiscal policy, between tax cuts and spending, was $2 trillion; and between now and 2020 we have $8 trillion in U.S. corporate debt that is going to mature. Tell us about what you are doing now. We started Atlas Merchant Capital with the idea that financial services is a really phenomenal opportunity because the valuations have been destroyed by the crisis, regulation is going to have a permanent impact, and supply and demand [of financial-services sellers and buyers is imbalanced]. Prior to the crisis, almost everything in financial services that was available for sale was acquired by another financial-services entity. Now, the chance of an American bank acquiring a bank in Greece seems so remote. You seem to have a lot of faith in peripheral Europe, having made investments in banks in Greece and Italy recently. In some ways the periphery has recovered more because they were first to crack. The opportunity there is phenomenal. Prior to 2009, there were 25 banks in Greece. The government consolidated those into four that have all the nonperforming loans—two-thirds of their loans are nonperforming. Also, Greece has, we estimate, over €50 billion [$58.4 billion] in deposits not in the banking system. We are looking for opportunities in European banking where we aren’t saddled with legacy nonperforming loans, legacy talent, legacy technology. Do you plan to link your investments into a multinational bank? Prior to 2008, it was all about scale and breadth in banking. We were global, global, global. Today, the best model for banking in Greece is a Greek bank. And it doesn’t have to be all things to all people. If we focus on small and medium enterprise businesses, we could be excellent at that. I believe that’s one of the most fundamental changes in banking across Europe and to some extent in the U.S. It is now about being national or regional and about being focused. How much do you worry about the impact of trade wars and global politics on the economy? I am a huge admirer of John McCain, and I think his recent passing smacks us all in the face. He was a conservative [but] he was always looking for compromise. He was one of the great giants of being an American first. I do worry that the Democratic reaction to Trump is to go further left, and we need to attract people into the middle. I am not a fan of trade wars. Therefore, I have some worries. Does this affect your investing approach? No. In financial services, we have very low valuations. Higher interest rates are very good for financial-services businesses, and since we don’t use leverage, it doesn’t raise the cost of doing a deal. If you add that we are seeing things that are much more national and focused, then we are not investing in global businesses that might be impacted by Brexit or a trade war or something like that.

Harvest organizers said that song is now being released as a single with proceeds going to local charities. Patterson will officially launch the fundraising effort this weekend with a performance of ""We'd Rather Have You"" during Harvest's annual Sunday free concert in Officers' Square, at about 1:50 p.m. This tragedy has and will bring the community together and Sara would want nothing less - Steve Burns ""Harvest has always celebrated the best of Fredericton and so we knew we needed to ensure that we found a respectful way to commemorate the wound our community suffered and the healing process we've been going through since then,"" said festival chair Kerry Wells. Harvest organizers said they were contacted about this initiative by Steven Burns, Sara's husband. ""I believe this is a way to give back to the community in Sara's honor,"" said Burns, adding that proceeds will go to three causes his wife was passionate about — local charities, families in need and continued education. ""This tragedy has and will bring the community together and Sara would want nothing less and that beautiful smile of hers would be gleaming looking down,"" said Burns, in a post on Facebook. Fredericton Strong Harvest volunteers will also be wearing navy blue T-shirts, in honour of the police department, with the logo #FrederictonStrong ""We're honoured to be able help Steven launch this fundraising effort during Harvest and proud that all our volunteers will serve as reminders of the resilience of our community and the need to come together after a terrible tragedy like this,"" said Wells. The song can be pre-ordered through the Fredericton Community Foundation. Donations to the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund can be made at the same website or at the concert venue on Sunday. ""We have had tremendous support so far and we want to keep this moving forward so that we may help many people in Sara's honour,"" said Burns.

Michael,Gordon,1612,https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Officials-don-t-know-amount-stolen-from-13224729.php,"By Robert Marchant Michael Gordon, a Greenwich parking employee pleaded guilty to stealing from the department. Michael Gordon, a Greenwich parking employee pleaded guilty to stealing from the department. Caption Close Michael Gordon, a Greenwich parking employee pleaded guilty to stealing from the department. Michael Gordon, a Greenwich parking employee pleaded guilty to stealing from the department. GREENWICH — A former Parking Services Department clerk entered a guilty plea last week to stealing money from the town, but authorities still aren’t sure how much money went missing. Michael Gordon, 49, was initially accused of taking $11,400 when he was arrested in April of 2017. But when he agreed to a plea deal in State Superior Court late last week, he had paid back $4,000, the amount that prosecutors had authorized to settle the two felony charges against Gordon. An accountant who has been working on implementing new procedures in the parking department said it was impossible to determine how much Gordon had siphoned off by misapplying credits for parking ticket transactions and pocketing amounts paid in cash. He also took money from SmartCard payments. “It was unclear. Nobody knows how much was taken,” said Ron Lalli, a risk manager and accountant contracted by the town. He said there were no software programs in place when Gordon was committing the thefts, so the thefts were essentially “un-auditable.” And there were no other means of reconciling what was missing. “The records were in such bad shape,” Lalli said. Attorney Phil Russell, who represented Gordon said, “It was not a significant amount. He paid it early on.” First Selectman Peter Tesei said, “The judicial process worked, and we’re moving forward with process improvements inside the department.” Gordon, a Greenwich resident, was given no jail time or probation for the pleas last week. “Jail would have been unusual, but not out of the question. Probation is typical,” said Russell, drawing on his experience in the criminal justice system. Gordon was given an unconditional discharge, Russell said, meaning his client is free and clear from law enforcement proceedings. Lalli said the parking department has substantially revamped its money-handling procedures. “Everything is in place, there’s much more internal controls,” he said. “We’ve been operating on much more stringent controls for the past three or four months. ... I’m very comfortable with where the department is going.” Lalli said he didn’t have a comment on the plea deal that Gordon made with the court, but he said his arrest was a potent deterrent. “He had a wonderful job with the town of Greenwich. He lost his job, his benefits, all of that,” the accountant said. Besides Gordon, two other town employees are facing criminal charges for taking money from town coffers — one for allegedly profiting from the sale of scrap metal, another for allegedly taking money from petty cash in the Human Services Department. State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo said the plea deal with Gordon “satisfies the interests of justice and the community.” Gordon told the judge overseeing his case last week: “I take full responsibility.”

Michael,Gordon,1612,https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/NY-Philharmonic-Presents-THE-ART-OF-ANDRIESSEN-This-October-20180912,"The New York Philharmonic will present The Art of Andriessen, October 4-14, 2018, celebrating Music Director Jaap van Zweden's Dutch compatriot Louis Andriessen, the third recipient of The Marie-Josée Kravis Prize for New Music at the New York Philharmonic. The Art of Andriessen will feature the World Premiere of Louis Andriessen's Agamemnon, commissioned upon his receipt of the Kravis Prize for New Music; Mr. Andriessen's TAO; music by Mr. Andriessen, his students, and more on the Philharmonic's two new-music series; the US Premiere of MUTED at National Sawdust; and The Juilliard School's AXIOM ensemble performing Mr. Andriessen's De Staat. Louis Andriessen was named the third recipient of The Marie-Josée Kravis Prize for New Music at the New York Philharmonic - which recognizes a composer for extraordinary artistic endeavor in the field of new music - in November 2016. ""Louis Andriessen is one of my heroes and I am honored that he has written a piece for my first year with the New York Philharmonic, particularly because he has not written for orchestra for many years,"" said Music Director Jaap van Zweden, who served on the 2016 Kravis Prize Selection Committee. ""One of the most inspiring moments as a conductor is being able to talk to the composer, so I am especially glad that he will be with us for Agamemnon. And I'm very happy that this initial commission has grown into The Art of Andriessen, with a range of concerts that will highlight this great composer and his influences."" ""My father, the composer Hendrik Andriessen, used to say: 'We are not important; the music is important, and we have the duty to write as well as we can,'"" Louis Andriessen said upon accepting the Kravis Prize. ""It is in this spirit that I will write for the New York Philharmonic."" Music Director Jaap van Zweden To Conduct World Premiere-New York Philharmonic Commission of Louis Andriessen's Agamemnon October 4-6, 2018 Music Director Jaap van Zweden will lead the World Premiere of Louis Andriessen's Agamemnon, October 4-6, 2018,commissioned by the New York Philharmonic as part of the Kravis Prize for New Music. The work is based on the story of the ancient Greek mythological character who sacrificed his daughter to the gods and, upon returning from leading the Greek forces in the Trojan War, was killed alongside his concubine by his unfaithful wife and her lover in revenge for his sacrifice of their daughter. The program will also feature Debussy's La Mer, Stravinsky's Violin Concerto, with Leila Josefowicz as soloist, and Symphonies of Wind Instruments (1947 version). Louis Andriessen cites Stravinsky as one of his primary influences, saying ""I cannot remember a time when I did not love the music of Stravinsky."" Scholars have noted the influence of Symphonies of Wind Instruments specifically on Mr. Andriessen's music. Stravinsky, in turn, counted Debussy as a primary influence, and his Symphonies of Wind Instruments is dedicated to Debussy's memory. The New York Philharmonic will offer an allotment of free tickets to young people ages 13-26 for the concert on Friday, October 5 as part of Philharmonic Free Fridays. David Robertson To Conduct Andriessen's TAO with Synergy Vocals and Tomoko Mukaiyama October 10 and 12-13, 2018 David Robertson will conduct the New York Philharmonic in Louis Andriessen's TAO, with members of Synergy Vocals and Japanese-Dutch pianist Tomoko Mukaiyama in her Philharmonic debut, October 10 and 12-13, 2018. TAO was written for, dedicated to, and premiered by Ms. Mukaiyama; the work calls for her to perform on piano and a traditional Japanese koto, and to vocalize. TAO is the second part of Mr. Andriessen's Trilogy of the Last Day, on the theme of mortality, and quotes the writings of ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu. The program will also feature Sibelius's Symphony No. 2 and Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganani, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist. The New York Philharmonic will offer an allotment of free tickets to young people ages 13-26 for the concert on Friday, October 12 as part of Philharmonic Free Fridays. Kravis Nightcap Series at the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse Music Reflecting Andriessen's Interests and Influences: Ravel, Miles Davis, John Cage Curated by Louis Andriessen October 13, 2018 The Art of Andriessen will also include a Kravis Nightcap series concert curated by Mr. Andriessen on October 13, 2018. The Dutch composer will explore his diverse musical interests, from Ravel to Miles Davis and John Cage, with performances by the Ariel Quartet. This follows a Philharmonic concert featuring Mr. Andriessen's TAO. The Kravis Nightcap series presents six late-night, cabaret-style concerts curated by composers of today, who will engage in conversation about the music with host Nadia Sirota, The Marie-Josée Kravis Creative Partner. Taking place at the Stanley H. Kaplan Penthouse after select subscription programs, the concerts will explore themes related to those Philharmonic concerts in a casual setting. GRoW @ Annenberg Sound ON Series at The Appel Room, Jazz at Lincoln Center Music by Andriessen and His Students Martijn Padding and Vanessa Lann Music Director Jaap van Zweden To Conduct Musicians from the New York Philharmonic October 7, 2018 The Art of Andriessen will inaugurate the GRoW @ Annenberg Sound ON series on October 7, 2018, with ""Going Dutch."" The program will highlight the Netherlands new-music scene with music by Dutch composer Louis Andriessen and his former students: Louis Andriessen's Image de Moreau, Hout, and Symphony for Open Strings, the last conducted by Music Director Jaap van Zweden; Dutch composer Martijn Padding's Mordants; and the New York Premiere of The Key to the Fourteenth Visionby Vanessa Lann, an American composer living in the Netherlands. The GRoW @ Annenberg Sound ON series - three Sunday afternoon chamber concerts at The Appel Room, Jazz at Lincoln Center - presents contemporary chamber repertoire performed by Philharmonic musicians. The concerts will dive deeper into the season's key initiatives and explore the music of our time through the performer's lens. Host and curator Nadia Sirota will lead conversations with the musicians, exploring what they love about the works they are performing - what is difficult, new, and unexpected. US PREMIERE-New York Philharmonic Co-Commission of MUTED with Violinist Monica Germino Co-Presented with NATIONAL SAWDUST Music by Andriessen, Michael Gordon, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe October 8-9, 2018 Also as part of The Art of Andriessen, the New York Philharmonic and National Sawdust will co-present the US Premiere of MUTED - a Philharmonic co-commission with Rotterdam's De Doelen, Oranjewoud Festival, Vancouver's Music on Main, and Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival - October 8-9, 2018, at National Sawdust. MUTED is a collective work by four composers - Louis Andriessen, Michael Gordon, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe - created for violinist Monica Germino, Mr. Andriessen's wife, following her diagnosis with high sensitivity to sound. Julia Wolfe counts Mr. Andriessen as one of her primary influences; Ms. Wolfe, Mr. Lang, and Mr. Andriessen are three of the five composers whose works are being commissioned and premiered by the New York Philharmonic, led by Jaap van Zweden, in the 2018-19 season. Ms. Germino writes: ""Michael Gordon's response to what was drastic news to me - having to protect my hearing by stopping or adapting how I played the violin - was one of optimism and curiosity: 'I'm going to write you a piece so soft, I don't care if no one can hear it.' Michael, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe decided to join forces to create MUTED, 'the quietest violin piece ever written.' The three later invited Louis Andriessen to join in the experiment, fulfilling a long-held wish to collaborate."" Ms. Germino will perform on her violin as well as a whisperviolin, a lower-decibel violin created for her, and she will also sing settings of texts from 20th-century American humorist Don Marquis's series of free-verse poems Archy and Mehitabel, set on the streets of New York. It is written for violin, voice, and light design and conceived for small groups of listeners in intimate spaces. The Juilliard School's AXIOM Ensemble To Perform Andriessen's De Staat At the Peter Jay Sharp Theater October 14, 2018 As part of the New York Philharmonic's The Art of Andriessen, The Juilliard School will present its AXIOM ensemble, led by Jeffrey Milarsky, in a free performance of Louis Andriessen's De Staat, Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks, and Knussen's Two Organa on October 14, 2018, at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater. Mr. Andriessen himself selected Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks to complement this performance of his De Staat. Robert Adlington's book Louis Andriessen: De Staat notes that in the year De Staat was premiered, Mr. Andriessen was staging his Matthew Passion, which evokes Dumbarton Oaks. The New York Philharmonic gave the New York Premiere of De Staat in May 1986. Single tickets to the October 4-6 and October 10-13 programs start at $31. Single tickets to the Nightcap performance are $25. Single tickets to the Sound ON performance are $45.

Phillip,Frost,1611,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/09/13/the-sec-takes-aim-at-opko-healths-phillip-frost.aspx,"Returns as of 11/14/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/14/2018 On Sept. 7, the Nasdaq halted trading in Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK) after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) levied market manipulation charges against it and its billionaire CEO, Phillip Frost. The stock has remained halted ever since and that's increasing concern that Opko Health investors will suffer significant losses. Is this news as bad as it seems? According to the SEC, 10 individuals, including Frost, and 10 associated entities, including Frost's Frost Gamma Investments Trust, participated in ""long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock."" IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. The SEC's complaint states that a group of ""microcap fraudsters"" led by Barry Honig used ""classic pump-and-dump schemes"" between 2013 to 2018. In these pump-and-dump schemes, Honig allegedly acquired ""large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume."" Once shares rallied because of the manipulation, the group allegedly sold their shares, ""reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors."" Frost allegedly participated in two of three schemes, according to the SEC's complaint. Frost has been considered one of the savviest healthcare entrepreneurs on the planet. While serving as head of dermatology for Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami in the early 1970s, he acquired nearly bankrupt Key Pharmaceuticals in 1972. Over the next 14 years, he helped transform Key Pharmaceuticals into a major asthma treatment player that was acquired for nearly $800 million by Schering-Plough in 1986. In 1987, Frost followed up that success by combining three small-cap healthcare companies to form Ivax Corporation, a company he turned into a major generic drugmaker. Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) acquired Ivax for roughly $7.5 billion in 2006. Frost was appointed Teva's vice chairman following the deal, and in 2010 he became Teva's chairman. Despite his responsibilities at Teva, Frost remained an active dealmaker. He took ownership stakes in various small-cap companies, and after he left Teva in 2015, he became Opko Health's CEO. At Opko, he's acquired several companies to build up the company's drug pipeline and expand it into new markets. For instance, Opko's acquisition of Cytochroma landed Rayaldee, a vitamin D prohormone that won FDA approval in 2016, and its acquisition of BioReference Labs in 2015 gave it about $1 billion in specialty lab services revenue. Opko Health has also amassed equity stakes in various companies, including Arno Therapeutics, Cocrystal Pharma, and RXi Pharmaceuticals. Overall, Opko discloses ownership in 12 small-cap companies in its 2017 10-K SEC filing that are collectively valued at $40.6 million as of Dec. 31. Unfortunately, based on the SEC's complaint, it appears Frost's wheeling-and-dealing style may have landed him and Opko Health in hot water that significantly tarnishes his and his company's reputation. Up until now, the fact that Frost has been involved so heavily in Opko Health as CEO and is its largest shareholder has helped support the company's share price. Given the black eye associated with the SEC charges against him, investors are unlikely to pay a Frost-premium to own Opko Health shares from here. If that's the case, then Opko Health is going to need some big wins. Unfortunately, Opko Health's acquisitions haven't panned out so far. It's been slow going for Rayaldee, and BioReference Labs' revenue is declining. Also, a chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting drug, Varubi, that it licensed to Tesaro (NASDAQ:TSRO) and that won FDA approval in 2015 has been a commercial dud. Earlier this year, Tesaro walked away from Varubi after it had to pull an IV formulation off the market following reports of anaphylaxis. Overall, Opko reported a $6.2 million net loss on $263.7 million in sales, down 10% year over year, in Q2. The lackluster financial performance does little to offset the overhang now associated with the SEC's ""continuing investigation."" The situation is likely to be a major distraction for the company, and the possibility of lawsuits adds even more uncertainty. Unfortunately, there's no telling when Opko Health will start trading again. According to Opko Health, Nasdaq has informed it that trading won't begin until ""the company responds (to Nasdaq's satisfaction) to the exchange's request for information related to the previously reported lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against a number of individuals and entities, including OPKO and its CEO and Chairman Phillip Frost."" The company says it's ""confident that once a proper investigation is completed and the facts of the case have been fully disclosed, the matter will be resolved favorably for the company"" and that it's ""working expeditiously to respond to Nasdaq's request for information, but it cannot currently estimate when trading will resume."" Given the SEC's complaint and the lack of clarity, this news is bad enough for me to think it's best to avoid the stock regardless of when it opens and its share price.

Pictured from left to right are Fran Hensley-A-flight, Jimmy Watlington - C-flight and Mike Reynolds - B-flight. Not pictured is John Horton of D-flight. Although the course is probably in the best condition it’s ever been in; it still proved to be quite a challenging tract. Just as in last season’s event held here; the Gene Hamm designed course only gave up two rounds in the seventies to the field of 25 Laidback Golf Tour participants. There were 18 birdies and one eagle made by the group on the fast rolling greens. The mid ninety degree very humid weather added to the challenge also. The two low rounds of the day were found in the A Flight as Fran Hensley and Steve Cummings both finished with rounds of 76. 76 was also last season’s low round scores here with Steve Cummings having one of them. Last year Cummings had to settle for second after losing a playoff with Steve Williams by a stroke. This time Cummings again came up a stroke short as he lost a playoff with Fran Hensley on the second playoff hole. Both players birdied the par five first playoff hole before Hensley won the second hole with par as Cummings got a bogie. The win was Hensley’s second win in a row and third for the season. Another player picked up his third season win today as Mike Reynolds won in the B Flight with a score of 82. A match of scorecards had to determine the flight’s second place as both Bob Foyle and David Wilson finished at 84. Foyle claimed the second-place prize with a par on the number one handicap hole while Wilson had bogey for third. The C Flight saw Jimmy Watlington turn in his best score of the season at 82 and capture his first Tour victory in a card match play-off with Mike Asbury who also finished at 82. The pair feeling too tired and hot for a play-off decided to use the number one handicap hole card match method to determine the winner. Watlington bogied the hole but Asbury had double bogied it giving Watlington the win. Willard Vicks claimed the flights third place with an 87. The only repeat winner from last season here was John Horton who claimed the D Flight’s top spot with his round of 93. Last season here Horton won the E Flight with a round of 97. The win was Horton’s first of this season. Another card match was used to determine D Flight’s second place as both Dan Curtin and Curtis Smith finished at 101. Curtin finished second as he had two strokes better than Smith on the play-off hole. The Tours next tournament is scheduled for Wednesday September 12th beginning at 10am at Forest Oaks Country Club in Greensboro. It is the former site of the GGO and new to the Tour’s schedule.

Nearly 3,000 people were killed in New York City, Washington D.C., and outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania after planes were hijacked. Dozens of families and local leaders gathered Tuesday evening in La Quinta to remember the lives lost and honor the first responders who bravely put their lives on the line, in many cases, paying the ultimate sacrifice 17 years ago.

Residents pay respect to the fallen Every year since 2013, the city of La Quinta hosts a candlelight vigil at their 9/11 memorial at Civic Center Park. The memorial, built in 2013, features a piece of steel recovered from Ground Zero. It was local resident, Andrew Davis', eagle scout project in 2011. His father was in New York on business and was supposed to be in the World Trade Center during the attacks but he had left home early. His father's experience, just missing the attack, was the inspiration behind the memorial project, but an encounter with a local woman was Davis' motivation to get the project done. ""She (a local woman he met while fundraising for the memorial) lost her daughter in the World Trade Center. She never got to recover her body, but she said this memorial is her grave, a way to remember her,"" Davis said. ""Jeannine Damiani-Jones. Damiani-Jones was a 28-year-old bond broker for Cantor Fitzgerald when her life was cut short on that September 11, 2001 day. She is missed every day and will also never be forgotten,"" Davis said.

At the center of the memorial is a piece of the World Trade Center. A tree was planted in her honor near the memorial in La Quinta. Nearly 3,000 others who lost their lives were remembered at the vigil, including 400 emergency workers. ""Having the community come around and support first responders in memorials like this, it touches me as an individual,"" said Captain Misty Reynolds, of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department Thermal Station.

In a new interview with Vulture, Lady Bird actor Lucas Hedges, 21, discussed his sexuality, saying, ""I recognize myself as existing on that spectrum. Not totally straight, but also not gay, and not necessarily bisexual,"" a Queerty item noted. He also said, ""In the early stages of my life, some of the people I was most infatuated with were my closest male friends. That was the case through high school, and I think I was always aware that while for the most part I was attracted to women."" Hedges, who was nominated for his first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work in Manchester By the Sea in 2017, added he felt ""ashamed"" in middle school about existing on a spectrum. Hedges will appear in the gay conversion drama Boy Erased, which opens in theaters in November. Pretty Little Liars alum Ashley Benson has been linked to model Cara Delevingne, but she's not revealing anything about her relationship status, People.com noted. ""I think it's the best way in any relationship,"" Benson told People Now. ""I've always been very private about them, and I think it's just better.""

The Toronto International Film Festival kicked off Sept. 6 with the opening-night selection Outlaw King, a historical Netflix drama starring Chris Pine as King of the Scots Robert the Bruceand there's been buzz over Pine's full-frontal nudity in the film, E! News related. Pine addressed the hoopla in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, saying, ""What I find very funny is there's so much beheading in this, and yet people want to talk about my penis. I think it says something about our society where people get disemboweledbut it's the man's junk that is of interest."" In a new interview with Variety at the Toronto International Film Festival, Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington brought up a prevalent myth about homosexuality, and he suggested a solution, Bustle.com noted. Harington wants a gay actor to play a superhero, to dispel stereotypes about ""masculinity and homosexuality."" Variety reported that during the discussion, Xavier Dolanwho directed Harington in The Death and Life of John F. Donovan, which premiered at the festivalalso commented on Hollywood representation. Dolan told Variety that LGBTQ actors might not be offered the same Hollywood roles that they would have been before coming out. Imagine Dragons singer Dan Reynolds took to social media to criticize Eminem over an anti-gay slur included in a song on the rapper's latest release, LGBTQ Nation noted. ""It's never ok to say a word that is filled with hate. I don't care what year you were born in or what meaning it has to you,"" Reynolds tweeted at the beginning of a multi-day takedown of both Eminem and the culture that excuses his repeated slurs. ""If it contributes to hate and bigotry then it is hateful. Period.""

The record is available for pre-order, and includes an immediate download of Menzel's studio version of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water."" Less than a month after announcing that a plethora of changes to the annual Oscars ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) said that the controversial new Most Popular Film category will now not be a part of the 2019 show as had been planned, Deadline noted. ""The Academy recognized that implementing any new award nine months into the year creates challenges for films that have already been released,"" said AMPAS, promising to seek ""additional imput"" on the new category. There will be another spinoff of Dick Wolf's Law & Order franchise, with a 13-episode order to the series Law and Order: Hate Crimes, TheWrap.com noted. The show will be introduced with a backdoor pilot during the latter half of the upcoming 20th season of Law & Order; SVU. The new show will focus on New York's real-life Hate Crimes Task Force, the second oldest bias-based task force in the United States. After a successful return season, Trading Spaces has started production on new episodes that will air in 2019, a press release noted. Host Paige Davis will return, along with Brett Tutor, Carter Oosterhouse, Doug Wilson, Frank Bielec, Genevieve Gorder, Hildi Santo Tomas, Joanie Sprague, John Gidding, Kahi Lee, Laurie Smith, Sabrina Soto, Ty Pennington and Vern Yip. See TLC.com/TrainingSpaces. Rapper Mac Millerwho had an MTV show and a long-term relationship with pop star Ariana Grandedied at his home of an overdose at age 26, Deadline noted. Miller, born Malcolm James McCormick, had a troubled history with drugs, and his relationship with Grande reportedly ended because of it. He also talked about his troubles in his music and interviews. In a new episode of his podcast Live Life Better, actor Scott Eastwood, 32, admitted he is ""having sex, lots of it"" while he's ""single and dating,"" People.com noted. The actor also said that he's ""had a lot of sex"" and called himself as ""a giver"" in bed. Eastwood, who labeled sex ""the most natural thing we as human beings do,"" had a message for his listeners: ""Sex is healthy, people. Don't shame it. Embrace it. Embrace it."" Production on a new one-hour primetime special that will give audiences a behind-the-scenes look at how a new category in People magazine's popular ""Sexiest Man Alive"" issue""Sexiest Chef""is being created and curated, a Food Network press release noted. Hosted by People Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle, the TV special will feature an up-close look at 10 talented chefs from across the nation as they are introduced to viewers, with one up-and-coming competitor being named ""Sexiest Chef."" The special is slated to premiere on Food Network on Thursday, Nov. 1. The Brooklyn home from the 1977 movie Saturday Night Fever recently hit the market, Today.com noted. While much of the townhouse has been renovated and restored, the main floor still looks familiar. Ideal Properties Group has listed the three-story home at 221 79th St. for $2.29 million, amNY.com added. CBS CEO Les Moonves stepped down Sept. 9, and is exiting the company without a severance packagefor now, TheWrap.com noted. In a joint release with National Amusements, which controls 80 percent of the voting power in CBS, the company said that Moonves will not receive a severance package at this time, and that he and CBS would donate $20 million to one or more organizations that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace. A dozen women, in two New Yorker articles, have accused Moonves of sexual harassment. In a related development, the CBS daytime show The Talk kicked off its ninth season talking about CBS CEO Les Moonves exit the previous night after more women alleged he'd sexually harassed them, Deadline noted. Moonves' wifeJulie Chen, who co-hosts The Talk and also hosts CBS' Big Brothernoticeably was missing. Show creator/panelist Sara Gilbert said, in part, ""Julie is our friend. … I love her and support her always. However, this is an important time in our culture, and just because this hits close to home doesn't change the story."" The Harvey Weinstein sex-crime cases that the LAPD and the Beverly Hills Police handed over to Los Angeles County District Attorney's office are still under reviewbut cases against Kevin Spacey, Anthony Anderson and Steven Seagal have been dropped, Deadline noted. Jackie Lacey's office announced that it has decided not to pursue assault charges against the trio. Spacey's and Seagal's cases involved statutes of limitations; in the case of the black-ish star, the L.A. D.A.'s office said that ""the reporting party has declined to be interviewed by the investigating officer."" Also, a sexual-assault case against American Horror Story actor Dylan McDermott has been rejected by prosecutors, TheWrap.com noted. According to paperwork, a woman accused McDermott of sexually assaulting her in 1991. However, given the length of time that had passed, prosecutors declined the case. Actor Boyd Holbrook has expressed support for castmate Olivia Munn in the controversy over a sex offender cast in their upcoming film, The Predator, Variety noted. Fox announced it had deleted a scene from Shane Black's movie after discovering it featured registered sex offender Steven Wilder Striegel in a scene opposite Munn. Among other things, Munn expressed dismay that she was feeling isolated by the fact that her castmates did not come forward to support her at the Toronto International Film Festivalprompting actor Sterling K. Brown to issue a statement of support saying, ""I hope you don't feel quite so alone. You did the right thing.""

Phillip,Frost,1605,https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/speak-up/article218246445.html,"September 12, 2018 01:29 AM Allegations are not facts. At least, until and unless proven before a judge and/or jury and/or a guilty plea. That presumption of innocence applies to three recent cases filed by the Justice Department: Miami’s Phillip Frost is accused by the SEC of participating in a $27 million penny stock insider trading scheme; New York Rep. Chris Collins (and his son) are facing another insider trading case; California Rep. Duncan Hunter (and his wife) have been indicted for improper use of campaign funds. The reported details are sketchy. Each defendant has pleaded not guilty. Therefore, innocent they are. They stand in sharp contrast to the many recent political guilty pleas and jury verdicts. The congressmen are from other areas of the country and are relatively unknown to Florida residents. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. On the other hand, Frost is very well known, especially in South Florida. Frost, a billionaire, has shared his fortune repeatedly. He has proven to be one of the most philanthropic individuals in recent memory. The Phillip and Patricia Frost Science Museum is a spectacular addition to the many fabulous venues in Miami. While it remains to be seen if the allegations against Frost hold water, it seems inconsistent that such a wealthy, generous individual would stoop so low and commit securities fraud, especially in an insider trading scheme regarding penny stocks to collect a relatively paltry sum ($1 million). I hope that Frost is innocent of these charges. Tom Murphy, Miami Having lived in Coral Gables for more than 70 years, I have witnessed a small village grow into a city that I am proud to say I live in. I have watched the city mature under the leadership of many administrations, most good and some not so good. I read in the Miami Herald that our city manager, Cathy Swanson-Rivenbark, will resign effective Sept. 14. Swanson-Rivenbark made significant improvements in the four years she was manager and the city will be hard pressed to replace her with a person of equal ability and enthusiasm. The city has lost a caring administrator and I hope the elected officials are able to find a worthy replacement. Scott Singleton, Coral Gables I read the newspaper because it is a newspaper. If I wanted news from social media I’d look at that. Why does the Miami Herald waste space with this “Influencer” series? We all know that term comes from social media. Can’t it just be called an op-ed? I read different papers, then I form my own opinion. It’s called critical thinking. I don’t need Influencers. I already have enough influencers telling me that climate change is not related to pollution and that constant construction of roadways and buildings is good for me. Yes, I read op-eds. Just call these people op-ed writers, but “Influencers?” Wow. Guess that makes them more important than your op-ed people. Marketing. I hear your reasons. Neris Franco, Miami Living in an area with commodities and necessities too far to walk and too close to drive, electric scooters revolutionized how I commuted. My ride-share to work could take 30 minutes in traffic, but with electric scooters I got to work faster, at a lower cost, didn’t contribute to the congestion and minimized my environmental footprint. Beyond getting to work, it became a convenient way to run errands or simply head to Wynwood to meet friends. Miami has always had traffic problems, and the way most of the city is built makes the pedestrian experience nearly impossible, yet there is an accessible and enjoyable solution. If other major cities like Paris and Dallas can embrace this alternative form of transportation, I hope my hometown commission can do the same on Sept. 12 when they take up legislation to bring scooters back to Miami. Daniel Zamora, Miami Serena Williams claims that she was fighting for women’s rights when she went on a tirade against the umpire at the U.S. Open finals. Please, let’s not confuse the frustration of a professional athlete who broke a tennis racquet in anger, with fighting for a greater good. Women have enough true battles to fight. We don’t need this kind of help. Rebeca Ramos, Miami Joe Robbie and Steve Ross spent mega-millions to build a splendid football stadium in Miami Gardens. With much criticism, former Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria and local government built a fine Major League baseball park where the Orange Bowl stadium used to stand. During the Dolphins/Titans game on Sept. 9, players and fans had to endure four extra hours of tedium because of two weather delays. If the same weather occurred at a Marlins game, there would have been no such delay. Perhaps the many folks who have been bad-mouthing Marlins Park may want to soften their criticism. Dave Oliver, Miami Lakes Why is there so much information about how poorly the insurance companies have done in Florida after Hurricane Irma and how much people are still suffering a year later? Why are there no answers or solutions to the problems? That’s very depressing. Barbara Parker, Palmetto Bay Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s response to the New York Times op-ed illustrates why I’m no longer a Republican. Supporting Trump’s policies doesn’t justify ignoring the threats of his presidency. When Trump claims Democrats are violent and tells Evangelists to repeat it, he maligns an entire political party and promulgates hostility. When he’s sorry for Paul Manafort’s convictions because “everybody does it,” he endorses criminal activity. Cheating is okay, just don’t get caught! When he claims the press is the enemy of the people, he is Kaa in the “Jungle Book,” singing “Trust in Me” while coiling around Mowgli’s body to kill him, castigating a whole profession and cornering us to choose. When he claims law enforcement is dishonest, he tells Americans to think so. Seventeen federal agencies claim Russian interference; Trump cannot. When he maligns Sessions for following the law, he urges him to break it. The goals of independent, politically neutral justice, he thinks, should be bent to his will. This is not a personality issue. These actions have grave, lasting national implications. Years from now, this will be known as the Nero Congress, because it fiddled while our democratic institutions were destroyed by a U.S. president and senators like Marco Rubio.

Phillip,Frost,1605,http://southfloridaclassicalreview.com/2018/09/florida-institutions-maintain-a-cautious-silence-on-benefactor-frosts-securities-fraud-charges/,"By Lawrence A. Johnson Phillip Frost. Photo: Emiliano Granado / Bloomberg The charging of Phillip Frost with securities fraud last week is sending quiet shock waves through the cultural landscape of South Florida. As reported last week by the Miami Herald, the wealthy philanthropist was charged along with nine others investors of manipulating the share price of three unnamed companies. Miami-based OPKO Health, of which Frost is the founder, was also named as a defendant in the scheme. Frost, whose wealth is estimated at $2.6 billion by Forbes, allegedly made $1.1 million off of the fraudulent stock actions. The SEC charges put the educational institutions and cultural organizations who have been the recipients of Frost’s charity in an awkward position. Frost’s name is on both the Frost Science Museum and the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music by virtue of previous large charitable donations. In the case of the latter, many school ensembles (Frost Symphony Orchestra, Frost Wind Ensemble, etc.) also bear his name. The 83-year-old doctor-biotech entrepreneur and his wife Patricia gave a total of $55 million to the Science Museum. Contacted Tuesday for a response to the charges, the Science Museum emailed the same brief statement sent to the Herald last week: “We are extremely grateful for the support of Dr. Phillip and Patricia Frost who are steadfast in their commitment to education, science and technology. Without their dedication, the museum would not be here today.” The Frosts’ philanthropic largesse to UM has been even more vast. The couple bestowed a $33 million naming gift in 2003 that recast UM’s music school as the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music. And in 2016, the Frosts presented a $100 million gift to support basic and applied sciences and engineering. The Frost School of Music declined to make a statement on the charges at this time. The couple has also endowed the Frost Art Museum at Florida International University. Barron’s, which has been reporting critically on OPKO for years, posted a story Monday that provided background to the events that led up to last week’s SEC announcement and suggested that the charges against Frost and others were “the tip of the iceberg.” Posted in News Message: Wed Sep 12, 2018 at 5:14 pm No Comments Powered by WP Bannerize Powered by WP Bannerize

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com. https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-charges-ladenburg-chair-with-fraud-1536771820 The SEC has charged Dr. Phillip Frost, the non-executive chairman and largest shareholder of Ladenburg Thalmann , with fraud. The agency’s lawsuit said Frost, nine other individuals and related companies were involved in “highly profitable ‘pump-and-dump’ schemes” that left “retail investors holding virtually worthless shares.” Ladenburg Thalmann, a leading network of independent broker-dealers, has said the SEC’s allegations are unrelated to the firm and to Frost’s role there. Even so, on Tuesday the company’s stock had fallen about 29% since Friday afternoon. Shares were changing hands Tuesday afternoon at about $2.45, compared with $3.44 at 1:30 p.m. EDT Friday. Aside from being chairman at Ladenburg Thalmann, Frost is a well-known biotech investor in South Florida, the publication notes. He’s chairman and CEO of OPKO Health, which is also a defendant in the SEC’s suit. In a news release announcing the suit, the SEC says that “from 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes.” The release alleges that Frost participated in two of the three schemes. OPKO said that the SEC’s complaint contained “serious factual inaccuracies” and that once “the facts of the case have been fully disclosed, the matter will be resolved favorably for them, according to InvestmentNews. --Ross Snel The SEC has charged Dr. An error has occurred, please try again later.

John,O'Neil,1596,http://www.mainepublic.org/post/lepage-withdraws-one-judicial-nomination-lets-one-go-forward,"Gov. Paul LePage continues to confound lawmakers. The governor has withdrawn the reappointment of a Superior Court justice, but is allowing a District Court judge nomination to go forward. The Legislature's Judiciary Committee last week unanimously recommended LePage's nominee, York County Superior Court Justice John O’Neil, for another seven-year term. But this week the governor withdrew the nomination before the state Senate could vote on it. In his letter to O’Neil, the governor said he regretted withdrawing the nomination. But in a move that's puzzling lawmakers, the governor is allowing the nomination of John Martin of Skowhegan to the District Court to go forward. There's no indication in the governor's communications to the Legislature why he has made that decision. Martin could be the only nominee considered at this week’s meeting of the Legislature.

Davis was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $5,700.86. Richard Anthony Davis, 30, entered a plea of guilty during an earlier court appearance to felony burglary and misdemeanor theft involving an elementary school. A teacher at Linderman Elementary School was able to provide investigators with a list of stolen items, including 10 laptop computers, nine iPads, one desktop tower, and other miscellaneous items. According to court records, the burglary was reported at Linderman Elementary School the morning of February 19. An investigation showed someone pushed a window-mounted air conditioning unit through the window to gain access to the school. A Lake County Sheriff’s Deputy found a casino cash-out ticket in the amount of 26 cents, time-stamped 02-17-18 at 22:41.23. The deputy took the ticket to the Kwataqnuk Resort Casino in Polson and matched the ticket with surveillance video to a person playing a poker/keno machine. The clothing of the person playing the machine matched the clothing worn by the suspect seen in surveillance video from the school. Using the surveillance video, investigators determined the identity of the suspect. Davis was arrested on charges of burglary on April 4 after multiple law enforcement agencies in Lake County followed leads to find him. According to court records, stolen items from the school were located in the car driven by Davis. At the time of his arrest, Davis insisted that he was Richard Andrew Davis and not Richard Anthony Davis. His sentence will run consecutively with another suspended sentence to the DOC involving an attempted escape. Davis was to appear in court on Dec. 20, 2012, on trespassing and obstruction charges when he attempted to bolt from Lake County Detention officers who were in the process of leading him out of the courtroom and back to jail.

The halls of Congress are filled with millionaires, but Hoyos wouldn’t be one of them. According to the candidate’s tax returns, submitted to the News Sentinel, she made $81,154 in 2016 and $69,058 in 2017; the latter figure is less because she worked half time as she ran her campaign, she said Monday. Hoyos’ Republican opponent, former Knox County Mayor Tim Burchett, declined to submit his tax returns. When asked about Burchett’s returns, campaign manager Andrew Davis said, “Tim has submitted everything that he is required to by law.” As mayor of Knox County, Tim Burchett earned more than $170,000 a year in 2016 and 2017. He declined to provide tax returns to the News Sentinel. (Photo: Caitie McMekin/News Sentinel) Burchett made $170,521 in 2016 and $172,738.02 in 2017 for his salary as mayor, according to county records. He made $180,787.62 in 2018. Hoyos has been the executive director of the Tennessee Clean Water Network since 2003. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Her 2016 returns included a $3,301 capital gain she received from sale of property. She donated $2,570 to charities or nonprofits in 2016. She donated $1,803 to the National Ski Patrol and another $420 to Radio Station WUOT. Her 2017 returns did not include a spot for donations and did not include an itemized list. Congressional candidates are required to file financial disclosure statements, which are public documents. Hoyos has three Vanguard accounts valued between $50,000-$100,000 and a fourth Vanguard account valued between $15,000-$50,000, according to her statement. Burchett’s disclosure included $2,501-$5,000 in Charles Schwab dividends, and small amounts of interest from First Tennessee and Knox County Employees Credit Union holdings. The disclosure included rent income from rental property valued at $50,001-$100,000 with yearly income of $5,001-$15,000 and $15,000-$50,000 worth of tax-deferred holdings in National Financial Services and a Northwestern Mutual IRA which pay him approximately $1,000 a year. He also has a Vanguard IRA which pays him $2,000 a year. Also, the disclosure included $1,001-$15,000 in Papa Murphy’s stock. While mayor, Burchett would be known to frequently check for updates on the pizza chain’s stock. Hoyos defeated Joshua Williams in the Democratic primary.

Phillip,Frost,1592,https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-charges-phillip-frost-1536608366,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com. https://www.barrons.com/articles/sec-charges-phillip-frost-1536608366 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed stock fraud charges late last week against billionaire drug entrepreneur Phillip Frost and a group of associates, accusing them of making $27 million in pump-and-dump stock schemes. The civil suit filed in Manhattan’s federal district court alleges that Frost and nine others manipulated micro-cap stocks over the last five years, aided and abetted by Frost’s investment trust and a Miami-based drug development company where he is board chairman and chief executive, Opko Health . Since 2012, Barron’s has chronicled Opko’s rise to a stock market capitalization that peaked near $9 billion, despite repeated product flops and cumulative losses that surpassed $1 billion this year. The 81-year-old Frost is a prominent philanthropist in south Florida, where his name adorns a university music school, a science center, and an art museum. He is a trustee of the University of Miami and Miami’s Mt. Sinai Medical Center. Opko was supposed to be Frost’s crowning achievement after his 1986 sale of Key Pharmaceuticals to Schering-Plough for $800 million and his 2006 sale of IVAX to Teva Pharmaceutical for $7.5 billion. The latter deal rewarded Frost with some $500 million in cash, $600 million in Teva shares and, for four years, the board chairmanship of Teva, the world’s largest generic drug maker. Frost is also chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services , a Wall Street investment bank where he became the controlling shareholder after converting loans to the Miami financier Bennett LeBow. When Opko stock peaked above $19 in 2015, it used its shares to acquire Bio-Reference Laboratories, a New Jersey-based outfit that was the country’s third-largest clinical lab by revenue. But as Barron’s reported in 2011, Bio-Reference produced little cash flow and had gotten financing from a Mafia-associated stock broker. The lab acquisition was the high-water mark for Opko stock. The stock fell 17% Friday before trading was halted, and trading remained halted Monday afternoon with shares at $4.58. The SEC complaint alleges that Frost participated in three stock manipulation schemes led by Barry Honig, a 47-year old investor in Boca Raton, Fla., whose penny-stock collaborations with the billionaire Frost were examined by Barron’s in 2014. Honig was “the primary strategist” of the three schemes, according to the complaint, which gained control of three tiny public companies — not named in the complaint — and then paid promoters to write favorable and misleading articles on the Seeking Alpha website. Honig then allegedly arranged manipulative trades — including some by Honig’s charitable foundation and Frost’s investment trust — to get the stocks to a level where the schemers could dump them on the public, according to the SEC complaint. Read more: Blockchain Is Starting to Show Real Promise Amid the Hype In a statement Saturday, Opko said that neither Frost nor the company had prior notice of the SEC’s complaint, which Opko said “contains serious factual inaccuracies.” Had Frost and his company been allowed to previously address the agency’s concerns, Opko said, the lawsuit could have been prevented. The SEC complaint makes no allegations, Opko said, about “Opko’s financial practices, financial statements or business practices.” “Opko and Dr. Frost have always prided themselves on adhering to the highest standards of financial disclosure,” Opko’s statement said, “and they are confident that once a proper investigation is completed and the facts of the case have been fully disclosed, the matter will be resolved favorably for them.” No lawyers for any of the defendants had appeared on the case docket as of Monday morning. Emails and phone calls to Opko, Frost, and Honig went unanswered. Although the SEC complaint didn’t name the three stocks allegedly manipulated, the pleading describes the companies’ officers and other characteristics in sufficient detail to allow their identification as Cocrystal Pharma , MGT Capital Investments and MabVax Therapeutics — penny stocks that all dropped sharply on Friday. MGT issued a statement saying it had cooperated with SEC investigators and lamenting that the agency charged its chief executive Robert Ladd among Friday’s defendants without first allowing him to formally address the agency’s concerns. A second statement announced that Ladd was taking a leave of absence to defend himself against the SEC allegations, which MGT said were without merit and did not name MGT as a defendant. Ladd has not commented publicly beyond MGT’s statement. Last year, Frost and Opko were sued for fraud in a Minneapolis court by Lee M. Pederson, the one-time patent counsel of Cocrystal’s predecessor company. In a 91-page complaint in Minneapolis’ federal district court, Pederson accused Frost of using Cocrystal and other stocks for pump-and-dump schemes. Pederson’s complaint said he began filing whistleblower claims about “the Frost gang” with the SEC several years ago. A federal magistrate has recommended that Federal District Judge Wilhelmina M. Wright grant a motion by Opko and Frost to dismiss Pederson’s case, saying the Minneapolis district lacks jurisdiction over the defendants. Pederson declined comment to Barron’s. Frost, Honig and a third investor — Miami-based Michael Brauser— have appeared as investors in more than a dozen penny stocks over the last decade. Most collapsed, after impressive runs, but some still maintain modest market caps, including Polarityte , Eloxx Pharmaceuticals , and ChromaDex . Neither the SEC nor any other regulators have alleged wrongdoing by the three men in connection with these three stocks. But another defendant in Friday’s complaint, John Stetson, was terminated by PolarityTE as its chief investment officer, the company said in a statement. Stetson declined to comment Monday. Monday, Brauser resigned as director and board chairman of Red Violet (RDVT), a company not included in Friday’s SEC complaint. In Red Violet’s announcement, Brauser said he’d defend himself vigorously against the SEC’s “baseless” charges. He did not respond to a query from Barron’s. Last year, a stock backed by Honig and Brauser enjoyed a 10-fold rise to $46, amid a blockchain frenzy: the Ft. Lauderdale-based RIOT Blockchain. After giving back those gains this year — the stock was at $4.46 on Monday — Riot disclosed that it is cooperating fully with an SEC investigation. Also named among the defendants in Friday’s complaint was RIOT’s chief executive John O’Rourke, who resigned over the weekend. O’Rourke didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. A YouTube video of Honig, after a night of partying, has gone viral among stock traders since Friday’s SEC complaint. The remarkable penny stock successes of Frost, Honig, and Brauser have also been the subject of dogged investigation by independent journalist Teri Buhl, who self-publishes her work and had to defend against two lawsuits filed by Honig over her stories, including a libel suit Honig dropped last year. “Reporting on this man is costly,” Buhl wrote Saturday on her website. Honig was highly confident about his penny stock plunges with Frost when Barron’s talked to him in November 2014. “Frost is probably one of the smartest men on the planet,” Honig said then. “This world needs a lot more people like him.” Honig proposed a pair trade: short Apple and long Opko. “You don’t bet against Phil Frost,” Honig said. Since then, Apple has doubled to reach its trillion-dollar capitalization, while Opko has fallen by nearly half. The U. An error has occurred, please try again later.

Phillip,Frost,1592,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3389336-sec-charges-billionaire-phillip-frost-may-tip-iceberg-barrons,"Barron's reports that the SEC's stock fraud charges against billionaire biotech investor Phillip Frost and others may uncover more widespread stock manipulation schemes. The SEC's complaint accuses Frost and certain associates, including penny stock promoter Barry Honig, of ""pump-and-dump"" promotion schemes to inflate the prices of three tiny companies, believed to be Cocrystal Pharma (NASDAQ:COCP), MGT Capital Investments (OTCQB:MGTI) and MabVax Therapeutics (OTCPK:MBVX). Last year, OPKO and Frost were sued by a former CoCrystal patent attorney accusing Frost of using CoCrystal and other companies in ""pump-and-dump"" schemes. A federal magistrate has recommended that a motion to dismiss submitted by the defendants be granted, citing the lack of jurisdiction in Minnesota where the lawsuit was filed. Mr. Honig has a long history in the penny stock sphere. He, along with Frost and Michael Brauser, is connected to PolarityTE (NASDAQ:COOL), Eloxx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ELOX) and ChromaDex (NASDAQ:CDXC), although none have been accused of wrongdoing in connection with these stocks. PolarityTE Chief Investment Officer John Stetson, one of the defendants in the SEC case, was recently let go. Mr. Brauser recently resigned as Chairman of software developer Red Violet (NASDAQ:RDVT), countering that he intended to ""defend himself vigorously"" against the SEC's ""baseless"" charges. Honig and Brauser earned a windfall in Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) which jumped 10-fold amidst the blockchain frenzy in late 2017.

Michael,Gordon,1591,https://www.greenwichtime.com/opinion/article/Thumbs-up-thumbs-down-13219043.php,"Hearst Connecticut Group Editorial Board Thumbs up to John Margenot, who was honored over the weekend with the dedication of the atrium at Greenwich’s Public Safety Complex in his name. Margenot earned the honor by serving five terms in the town’s top office, but the event was a reminder that that decade in office was just the centerpiece of his long service to the town. Margenot was also on the Board of Estimate and Taxation and the Representative Town Meeting, and volunteered at Greenwich Hospital, the YMCA, Hill House and the Old Timers Athletic Association. He’s not done yet, either. At 90, he serves as a member of the town’s Board of Ethics. Thumbs down to Michael Gordon, who stole about $4,000 from the town while working for the Greenwich Parking Services Department. Gordon, who paid back the money, was able to avoid jail time after pleading guilty to larceny. He had no previous criminal record. Thumbs down to the power outages that left more than 11,000 Eversource customers in Greenwich in the dark during last week’s heat wave. Local leaders were left in the dark as well about the cause of the blackouts. As temperatures drop, First Selectman Peter Tesei needs to keep the pressure on to get answers, as well as solutions to prevent similar outages in the colder months. Thumbs down to the abysmal record of Metro-North Railroad branch line on-time performance. A Hearst Connecticut Media examination found that some commuters have only a 64-percent chance of getting to work on time if they’re relying on a train. The Waterbury branch performance was the worst, with that 64 percent on-time figure. The New Canaan and Danbury branches — at 78 and 87 percent respectively — were better, but still not what people commuting to jobs can depend on. Thumbs up to Connecticut’s budget tracking to finish the fiscal year in balance, as reported by state Comptroller Kevin Lembo last week. There’s still a stretch to go to reach the end of June, but the outlook is much better than the $717.5 million deficit projected in the spring. Revenue is higher than predicted thanks to more from the sales tax and increased income tax withholdings. Hold back on celebrating, though, because a $2 billion deficit remains in effect for the following fiscal year — and for the new governor and General Assembly to tackle. Thumbs up to the steady, albeit slow, progress of student scores in the fourth year of the more demanding Smarter Balance test administered state-wide to students in third through eighth grade. Results released Thursday by the state Department of Education show 55.3 percent of the students who took the test in the spring met or exceeded the proficiency benchmark in language arts, but only 46.7 percent did so in math. While most districts saw overall gains, gaps remain among certain subgroups; for example, the Hispanic students’ pass rate for math was only 25.2 percent, much lower than the average. A state Commissioners Council on Mathematics is working on recommendations to improve math learning for all students. A helpful feature of Smarter Balance is that it also measures individual student performance through the years.

Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Statistics New Zealand figures showed electronic card spending rose by 1.1% in August. Spending in retail sectors was up 1%. This was ahead of market forecasts of a 0.5% rise. Retail statistics manager Sue Chapman said fuel prices rose in August, compared with July, contributing to the lift in fuel spending. Fuel spending on electronic cards generally had risen over the past year. Apart from fuel, other retail categories also showed increased spending in August. ""This helped lift overall retail spending to its largest monthly rise since March."" Card spending rose in six retail industries. The largest movements were for fuel, up $27million, or 4.1%; durables, up $15million, or 1.2%; and consumables (grocery and liquor), up $12million, or 0.6%. Ms Chapman said core retail spending, which excluded vehicle-related industries, rose 0.7% in August 2018 after a 0.3% rise in July. It was the fourth consecutive rise in core retail spending. Actual retail spending using electronic cards reached $5.2billion in August, up $306million, or 6.3%, from August last year, she said. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said the surprise in August was offset by a downward revision to July as growth was revised from 0.7% to 0.2%. Based on updated data, fuel spending in July was revised from a 1.8% rise to a 0.3% fall. ""This new figure is surprising given the rise in fuel prices over the month, including the introduction of the Auckland regional fuel tax."" Growth in consumer spending had slowed in the past couple of years as the housing market had cooled, he said. ""However, we've recently seen a boost to many households' disposable incomes via the Government's Families Package, which came into effect on July 1. ""And this extra assistance has tended to go to the households that are most likely to spend it.""

Ted Cruz’s re-election bid. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID THE SENATE MIGHT BE UP FOR GRABS? … ALEX ISENSTADT, “Inside the GOP’s rescue mission for Ted Cruz: The national party wasn’t expecting to have to defend a well-known senator in a conservative bastion”: “With a string of polls showing GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s lead slipping, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick showed up in Washington on July 25 to deliver an urgent plea to White House officials: Send President Donald Trump. Patrick, who chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, made the case that a Trump visit was needed to boost turnout for Cruz and the rest of the Texas Republican ticket. “The lieutenant governor soon got his wish: Trump announced on Twitter late last month that he was planning a blowout October rally for Cruz, his former GOP rival. The previously unreported meeting comes as senior Republicans grow increasingly concerned about the senator’s prospects in the reliably red state, with some expressing fear that an underperformance could threaten GOP candidates running further down the ballot. “Cruz’s Democratic opponent, Rep. Beto O’Rourke, has raised barrels of cash, closed the polling gap and emerged as a cause célèbre of liberals nationwide.” POLITICO -- @KasieDC: “JUST NOW: Former Communications Director for Ted Cruz, @rickwtyler, says it is ‘possible’ Cruz could lose his Senate seat. ‘This should be a 10 to 15 point race and it’s not.’” Video ANOTHER REPUBLICAN IN TROUBLE -- “Democrats corner Scott Walker,” by Natasha Korecki in Green Bay, Wisconsin: “There’s every reason to believe this is the beginning of the end for Scott Walker.

Polling shows that the independent voters who were so critical to Walker’s wins in the 2012 recall and 2014 reelection are breaking away from him. “After years of futility, Democrats here are convinced they finally have him cornered. ‘He’s stuck with a bad environment. He’s stuck with a long incumbency, and he’s stuck with a short general election,’ said Tom Russell, a Wisconsin-based consultant with the Democratic Governors Association.” POLITICO THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS DOWN in 21 DAYS … ELECTION DAY is in 57 DAYS.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), a gubernatorial nominee who recently was accused of using racially tinged language, spoke four times at conferences organized by a conservative activist who has said that African Americans owe their freedom to white people and that the country’s ‘only serious race war’ is against whites. “DeSantis, elected to represent north-central Florida in 2012, appeared at the David Horowitz Freedom Center conferences in Palm Beach, Fla., and Charleston, S.C., in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017, said Michael Finch, president of the organization. “At the group’s annual Restoration Weekend conferences, hundreds of people gather to hear right-wing provocateurs such as Stephen K.

At stake are more than ordinary political bragging rights. Central to Mr. Obama’s historical legacy is the economy’s recovery after its plummet to the brink of a new Great Depression.

FOR YOUR RADAR -- “North Korea is still making nukes, and the Trump admin is taking a harder line,” by NBC’s Courtney Kube and Carol Lee with Dan De Luce: “As President Donald Trump issues a steady stream of praise for Kim Jong Un in interviews and on Twitter, a steady stream of evidence that North Korea is still making nuclear weapons has pushed his administration to take a much more aggressive stance toward Pyongyang. “The newest intelligence shows Kim’s regime has escalated efforts to conceal its nuclear activity, according to three senior U.S. officials. During the three months since the historic Singapore summit and Trump’s proclamation that North Korea intends to denuclearize, North Korea has built structures to obscure the entrance to at least one warhead storage facility, according to the officials. “The U.S. has also observed North Korean workers moving warheads out of the facility, the officials said, though they would not speculate on where the warheads went.” NBC TRUMP’S MONDAY -- The president is having lunch with VP Mike Pence.

There is widespread scrutiny about the prospect of Moonves being paid tens of millions of dollars on his way out the door. “Moonves is one of the media world’s highest paid CEOs, so his severance package would normally be generous, even gargantuan. … With those optics in mind, CBS said Sunday night that Moonves and CBS will donate $20 million to organizations that support the #MeToo movement and other groups fighting for workplace equity for women.” CNN -- RONAN FARROW in The New Yorker, “As Leslie Moonves Negotiates His Exit from CBS, Six Women Raise New Assault and Harassment Claims” -- JOHN DICKERSON will be filling in for the next few weeks of CBS’ “Face the Nation.” MARGARET BRENNAN interviewed Pence Saturday on her due date.

But Democratic super PACs are playing a bigger role than ever in the party. “The super PACs charged with helping Democrats take back the House and Senate are raking in record sums from donors motivated by opposition to President Donald Trump, even as a rising class of candidates — like Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke and Ayanna Pressley, who scored a primary upset over Rep. Mike Capuano in Massachusetts last week — are rejecting corporate PAC money and using campaign finance as a purity test against entrenched opponents. “Meanwhile, the Democratic super PACs are using their new cash reserves to take over more and more of the party’s core functions, expanding from a focus on TV advertising to run major field programs and digital campaigns.” POLITICO BENJAMIN WERMUND: “U.S. News revamps formula for its latest college rankings”: “U.S. News and World Report is changing the formula for its widely read college rankings to reward schools that enroll and graduate more students from low-income families — a year after a POLITICO report showed that the rankings promote economic inequality on campuses. “The new methodology is reflected in the 2019 ‘best colleges’ edition, out Monday. It’s the first update to the rankings since POLITICO reported that they create incentives for schools to favor wealthier students over less wealthy applicants. The rankings are so closely followed in the academic world that some colleges have built them into strategic plans. “Still, the top of the U.S. News rankings don’t look that much different than have in years past. The top spots among national universities are still dominated by the Ivy League and other elite private schools. Princeton and Harvard were No. 1 and No. 2. Third place was split among Columbia, MIT, University of Chicago and Yale.” POLITICO ... The original POLITICO story LANGLEY READ … NYT: “C.I.A. Drone Mission, Curtailed by Obama, Is Expanded in Africa Under Trump,” by Joe Penney, Eric Schmitt, Rukmini Callimachi and Christoph Koettl, with a Dikkou, Niger, dateline: “The C.I.A. is poised to conduct secret drone strikes against Qaeda and Islamic State insurgents from a newly expanded air base deep in the Sahara, making aggressive use of powers that were scaled back during the Obama administration and restored by President Trump. “Late in his presidency, Barack Obama sought to put the military in charge of drone attacks after a backlash arose over a series of highly visible strikes, some of which killed civilians. The move was intended, in part, to bring greater transparency to attacks that the United States often refused to acknowledge its role in. “But now the C.I.A. is broadening its drone operations, moving aircraft to northeastern Niger to hunt Islamist militants in southern Libya. The expansion adds to the agency’s limited covert missions in eastern Afghanistan for strikes in Pakistan, and in southern Saudi Arabia for attacks in Yemen.” NYT KNOWING MARK ZUCKERBERG -- EVAN OSNOS in The New Yorker, “Ghost in the Machine” (online headline: “Can Mark Zuckerberg Fix Facebook Before It Breaks Democracy?: The most famous entrepreneur of his generation is facing a public reckoning with the power of Big Tech”): “Before I visited Zuckerberg for the first time, in June, members of his staff offered the kind of advice usually reserved for approaching a skittish bird: proceed gingerly, build a connection, avoid surprises. The advice, I discovered, wasn’t necessary. In person, he is warmer and more direct than his public pronouncements, which resemble a politician’s bland pablum, would suggest. The contrast between the public and the private Zuckerberg reminded me of Hillary Clinton. In both cases, friends complain that the popular image is divorced from the casual, funny, generous person they know. “Yet neither Zuckerberg nor Clinton has found a way to publicly express a more genuine persona. In Zuckerberg’s case, moments of self-reflection are so rare that, last spring, following a CNN interview in which he said that he wanted to build a company that ‘my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for,’ the network framed the clip as a news event, with the title ‘Zuckerberg in rare emotional moment.’” New Yorker OUT AND ABOUT -- WOMEN RULE hosted a “Salute to the Chiefs” live podcast taping at The Wing Sunday afternoon to kick off the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute and Congressional Black Caucus Foundation legislative weeks.

Don was born May 17, 1949, in Puyallup, Wash., to Donald and Louise Foster. Don grew up in Lewiston, and graduated in 1967 from Lewiston High School, and furthered his education at Lewis-Clark State College, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in business. Don married Connie Cooper in 1974; they would have been married 44 years this October. Together, they raised two beautiful daughters, Dori and Ann. He had five grandchildren who he enjoyed teasing, telling stories and joking with them. He loved attending their sporting events; he was their biggest fan.

After retirement, he couldn’t sit still and started working part-time for Enterprise. He loved moving around the cars and visiting with his co-workers. Don loved being on the water; the family spent most of their time on the Snake River, boating, fishing and water skiing. He also loved motorcycles, riding, rebuilding and selling them. Don is survived by his wife, Connie; daughter Dori (Randy) Foster and their three daughters, Logan, Parker and Hayden; and daughter Ann (John) O’Neil and their two sons, Taylor and Kason.

John,O'Neil,1581,https://www.pressherald.com/2018/09/10/judge-unfreezes-bank-account-of-partner-in-beleaguered-lobster-wholesaler/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Superior Court Justice John O'Neil Jr. rules that the wholesaler had not met the legal standard necessary to keep an attachment order on Vincent Mastropasqua's bank account. A York County judge has dissolved an order attaching bank accounts and other holdings belonging to one of two men accused by a Saco lobster wholesaler of embezzling more than $1.4 million. The order by Superior Court Justice John O’Neil Jr. said that the lobster wholesaler, Sea Salt, had not proved that “it is more likely than not” that the company would recover a judgment against Vincent J. Mastropasqua of Portland. The “more likely than not” language is the legal standard for an attachment order to stay in place. The ruling allows Mastropasqua to access funds in his bank account. O’Neil had approved an order in early August attaching up to $1.5 million in Mastropasqua’s name, in effect freezing his holdings for possible collection if the Sea Salt lawsuit succeeded. Mastropasqua is accused in the civillawsuit of working with Matthew R. Bellerose of Scarborough, a Sea Salt partner, to send lobsters from the wholesaler to a fake company. The fake company wasn’t billed for the lobsters, which were then sold, the suit alleges. The suit alleges that $1.5 million was embezzled, but said the total could be more than $2 million once accounting is complete. Bellerose was an employee of Sea Salt and had a 20 percent stake in the company, which also operates a seafood restaurant on Route 1 in Saco. Mastropasqua had formed a shipping company with Bellerose, but his lawyers told the court that he was unaware of any embezzlement. Sea Salt and Mastropasqua “present equally plausible versions of events,” O’Neil said in his order, and affidavits filed by Mastropasqua’s lawyer, “if believed, could also result in a conclusion that he was unaware and was not a participant in any scheme to defraud” Sea Salt. Bellerose’s wife, Amanda Bellerose, also has filed a motion seeking to dissolve part of an attachment order against the couple’s holdings, but O’Neil has not yet ruled on that motion. Edward D.

Andrew,Davis,1580,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/09/last-night-of-the-proms-review-andrew-davis-bbcso-flora-willson,"Royal Albert Hall, LondonIn a hall awash with EU regalia, inflatables and oversize hats, the celebration that ends the Proms season was fun, but both the music and the banter felt oddly removed from reality Flora Willson Sun 9 Sep 2018 07.44 EDT Last modified on Sun 9 Sep 2018 09.45 EDT The Royal Albert Hall is a huge venue, built to accommodate a Victorian penchant for “monster concerts” featuring hundreds of musicians. For the Last Night of the Proms, the place is packed. In the arena, prommers jostle politely for space amid the flags, oversize hats and comedy inflatables. One man is accompanied by a banana the size of a small adult. Elsewhere a blow-up flamingo and a kangaroo waving its own flag emerge occasionally from the roiling sea of bodies. There isn’t much space for elephants in this room, but this year there were two. The first, inevitably, was Brexit. Outside, a man wearing a “Thank EU for the music!” T-shirt and holding bunches of EU flags advertised his wares: “Free flags for free movement!” He was part of a wholesale giveaway crowdfunded annually since 2016, with more flags produced every year – 20,000 for 2018, says Paolo, a fourth-generation Italian Londoner who is campaigning for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal. Union jacks, meanwhile, were going for up to £3 each. Inside the hall was a different matter. Yes, there were flags galore, and yes, seeing the arena was awash with EU regalia. “I think something has changed recently,” German visitor Marie-Louise said brightly, as we surveyed the flags. “There’s no longer a majority that want Brexit.” Whether she’s right or not, this is an evening when an engrained taste for the carnivalesque – with periodic eruptions of silly noises from an audience determined to behave a little bit badly – outweighs any thought about the politics of the event. By the time the encore of the Henry Wood’s sea shanty arrangement rolled around, with its informally choreographed extravaganza of stamping, knee-bobbing, and all-together-now flag swinging, I started to wonder whether the symbols printed on the flags actually mattered. This whole ritual seemed to be more about being able to wave something, being able to join in. And that’s where the music (and the second elephant) comes in. Under Sir Andrew Davis – baton-free and bantering with the crowd like a harmless pre-watershed entertainer of yore – the BBC Symphony Orchestra served a first half of fleet-footed jauntiness from Hindemith’s Neues vom Tage overture, gossamer textures and a finely melded BBC Symphony Chorus in Berlioz’s irrepressibly strange Lélio, and harmless mysticism from a new work by Roxanna Panufnik. Gerald Finley sounded oddly distant, if as suave as ever, in Stanford’s Songs of the Sea. A woman in the interval queue for the loos asked her friend: “Does it get more exciting?” Fair question. In the second half, saxophonist Jess Gillam hurtled through a frantic Proms premiere of Milhaud’s Scaramouche, her sound even more tightly packed than the prommers. Finley took off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt, left his music outside and put on a mic for the soliloquy from Rodgers’ Carousel. But why unbutton only for Carousel when the Songs of the Sea could also have been so much livelier? Would the inflatables and the “naughty” sonic interruptions be so appealing if classical music weren’t otherwise seen as a po-faced serious business? Davis suggested in a recent interview that he might use the annual conductor’s speech to “get a bit serious about the lack of arts education in schools”. Well, he didn’t. But, without someone getting serious about that, his smooth assurance about music’s ability “to unite us” will ring increasingly hollow.

In Prom 72, the Royal Scottish National Orchestra plus massive choral backing delivered a performance of Britten’s War Requiem which was awe-inspiring and profoundly moving. The late prom which followed saw the Tallis Scholars singing music by Part, Hildegard of Bingen, and Thomas Tallis to a packed hall in hushed silence. In Prom 74 Jonathan Cohen and his Arcangelo ensemble plus distinguished soloists presented Handel’s own favourite among his oratorios, Theodora. Three hours passed serenely, thanks to the ever-superb Iestyn Davies and Benjamin Hulett as Didymus and Septimius, with fine support from the Swedish mezzo Ann Hallenberg, and – when she finally got the measure of the hall’s difficult acoustic – also from the British soprano Louise Alder. Tallis, Handel, Britten – the progression of these concerts, followed by the imperial rum-ti-tum of the Last Prom, looked like having a mournful symbolism this year, as we watch government and Parliament in paralysis while the country sleep-walks into disaster. Like the now-lost pragmatic wisdom of our political tradition, our best music too lies in the past. If there’s one thing I’ve always hated about the Last Prom, it’s the flag waving. But what is this? I am accosted at the door by a blue-clad lady bearing on her breast the words ‘Thank EU for all the music’, and she presses a flag into my hands: a ring of yellow stars on a blue background. Yes! I’ll take two, and I and my guest will wave them. This message needs broadcasting. Indeed, it puts a completely different complexion on things, and I find myself ready for once to plunge into the sea of Victorian sententiousness and drum-beating jingoism and accept it for the harmless charade it is. Musically the evening is the usual rag-bag, but it includes an ambitious new choral work by Roxanna Panufnik entitled Songs of Darkness, Dreams of Light which employs some lines of verse by Isaac Rosenberg and some visionary words by Kahlil Gibran as the basis for a musical confluence of all three Abrahamic faiths. The choral chants are punctuated by instrumental interjections to create a sound-world which is essentially Middle-Eastern. Rarely-performed works by Hindemith, Berlioz, and Milhaud leaven the traditional Last Prom fare which is despatched with grace by bass-baritone Gerald Finley and new-star saxophonist Jess Gilham under Andrew Davis’s genial direction. But with Anne Dudley’s very singable new arrangements of popular songs from the First World War, I find myself breaking another of my personal rules: singing along with ‘It’s a long, long way to Tipperary’ and ‘Keep the home fires burning’ – and actually meaning it. This, I think, must be for two non-musical reasons. First, it really felt that we were drawing for the last time on the reservoir of First World War folk-memory which has now been drained dry. Second, because it was plain – thanks to the forest of EU flags and the sea of EU berets in the arena – that what is currently emerging, in response to the threat of Brexit, is a spontaneous popular movement of a kind this country has not seen in decades. And the people in this Prom’s audience are very much part of it. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

In April 2010, during the general election campaign that followed the financial crisis, Lord Mandelson launched an ad hominem attack on Bob Diamond that registered as an eight or nine on the Richter scale of political savagery. The then Labour business secretary branded Barclays’ investment boss “the unacceptable face of banking” for his reported £63m pay packet, saying: “He hasn’t earned that money, he’s taken £63m not by building business or adding value or creating long-term economic strength, he has done so by dealmaking and shuffling paper around.” Eight years on, sitting in the Mayfair offices of the investment bank Lazard, where he is an adviser, Mandelson seems to have mellowed in his view of the man who… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most.

Bartsch always runs in full uniform and typically raises money for mental health, but this year he will be running for something else. Bartsch was close friends with one of the officers shot and killed last month in New Brunswick. He and Cst. Sara Burns attended police school together in the Maritimes and became good friends. Bartsch took the news of her tragic passing quite hard. Lawrence Robb Costello was the other officer shot and killed in Fredericton, NB in August. Today, Bartsch will partake in the run to honour their lives and what they meant to him. ""I was registered for the Queen City Marathon and I thought what a better fitting way to honour those two officers, Robb Costello and Sara Burns, to run for their memory and for their life and for everything they've done for us. And to run in the uniform for them as well. My run will be dedicated to them,"" Bartsch said. Cst. Bartsch is part of the Combined Traffic Services unit here in Weyburn and can't say enough good things about the community. He wants the city to know he appreciates all their support and will run with a lot of pride in Regina. ""This upcoming run will be in my uniform, as I normally do, but it will be for a huge cause, for the fallen officers I knew very well,"" he said. ""It's going to be a real honour to do that. I just wanted to let Weyburn know you are well represented as a community in regards to that.""

Rick,McVey,1577,https://www.nickiswift.com/132878/pretty-little-liars-janel-parrish-marries-longtime-boyfriend-chris-long/,"Pretty Little Liars alum Janel Parrish has tied the knot! On Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018, the TV star took to Instagram to reveal that she married her longtime boyfriend, chemical engineer Chris Long, in a ceremony held in Waikane, Hawaii. ""Rehearsal dinner photo,"" the 29-year-old actress wrote, captioning a snapshot of the two sharing a kiss. ""But today…I married him. Loving my husband so much @c_long."" According to an Us Weekly exclusive, the happy couple exchanged self-written vows in front of their closest friends and family, including some of Parrish's former Pretty Little Liars colleagues, actor Brendan Robinson and showrunner I. Marlene King. At the end of the ceremony, the newlyweds were accompanied by a song Parrish, who donned a mermaid-style Inbal Dror gown, wrote for her beau as they walked down the aisle together as husband and wife. ""We feel so lucky we found each other in this crazy world,"" the Dancing with the Stars alum released in a statement to Us Weekly this weekend. ""Marrying my dream man in my home of Hawaii surrounded by family and friends was a dream."" As Nicki Swift previously reported, Parrish and Long, who have been together for two years, announced their engagement in October 2017. ""Went to the park for a stroll with [her dog] Klee and came back with a fiancé. I get to marry my best friend and I'm over the moon,"" the To All the Boys I've Loved Before actress wrote on social media. At the time, she'd been preparing to star as Sandy in a Toronto production of Grease. While sharing a pic of her gorgeous engagement ring, she added, ""I can't stop staring at it. …@c_long You did GOOD."" Parrish isn't the only celeb to get hitched in recent weeks. Good Morning America co-host Lara Spencer wed MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey in a beautiful outdoor ceremony in Vail, Colo. just last week. Meanwhile, in mid-August, rapper 2 Chainz married his girlfriend and mother of his children, Kesha Ward, at the Villa Casa Casuarina. Around that time, actress Hilary Swank tied the knot with boyfriend Philip Schneider in a secret ceremony held at the Saint Lucia Preserve in Carmel, Calif. Congratulations to Parrish and Long!

Phillip,Frost,1576,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-billionaire-phillip-frost-charged-sec-27-million-fraud-plot-n907751,"Miami billionaire Phillip Frost is one of 10 people the Securities and Exchange Commission charged on Friday, accused of participating in a fraud plot that generated more than $27 million in what the SEC is calling a series of ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" The SEC alleges that from 2013 to 2018, Frost — who founded pharmaceutical company OPKO Health and is a primary benefactor of the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in Miami — and nine other investors manipulated three companies' stock share prices for their own gain. The SEC did not share the names of the three companies. The investors would promote the companies without disclosing that they owned a stake, wait for their stock prices to rise and then sell their shares. Retail investors, meanwhile, ""were left holding virtually worthless stock,"" according to the SEC statement. ""[The group charged] engaged in brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “They failed to appreciate, however, the SEC’s resolve to relentlessly pursue and punish participants in microcap fraud schemes.” OPKO Health and Frost are both named in the suit, though the SEC only believes Frost participated in two of the three schemes and earned approximately $1.1 million. The longtime health care investor is believed to have a net worth of $2.6 billion, according to Forbes. Frost's pharmaceutical company said in a statement that the SEC did not notify them of their plan to file suit and claimed the complaint contained ""serious factual inaccuracies."" ""Had the SEC followed its own standard procedures, OPKO and Dr. Frost would gladly have provided information that would have answered a number of the SEC’s apparent questions, and filing of this lawsuit against them could have been avoided,"" the company said. ""OPKO and Dr. Frost have always prided themselves on adhering to the highest standards of financial disclosure, and they are confident that once a proper investigation is completed and the facts of the case have been fully disclosed, the matter will be resolved favorably for them.” The scheme was allegedly led by South Florida businessman Barry Honig, one of the largest shareholders in Riot Blockchain Inc., a cryptocurrency company that saw its stock dovetail by 24.3 percent after the news broke. Riot Blockchain, in which Honig is heavily invested, was subpoenaed in April as part of a formal SEC investigation, CNBC reported earlier this year. ""Honig was the primary strategist, calling upon other Defendants to buy or sell stock, arrange for the issuance of shares, negotiate transactions, or engage in promotional activity,"" the SEC complaint said. Honig, who allegedly made more than $3.4 million via the scheme, could not be reached for comment. © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL

Phillip,Frost,1576,https://www.local10.com/business/phillip-frost-s-company-releases-statement-about-sec-lawsuit,"MIAMI - Dr. Phillip Frost, a Miami Beach entrepreneur and philanthropist who has donated millions to the University of Miami, Florida International University and the Miami Science Museum, responded to accusations that he was involved in a market manipulation scheme. The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit on Friday in the Southern District of New York against a group of 10 associates that includes Frost, the 83-year-old chief executive officer and chairman of OPKO Health Inc., a pharmaceutical and diagnostics company. OPKO released a statement on Friday evening accusing the SEC of serious factual inaccuracies that could have been addressed if investigators had contacted Frost before attorneys filed the complaint. ""Had the SEC followed its own standard procedures, OPKO and Dr. Frost would gladly have provided information that would have answered a number of the SEC's apparent questions,"" OPKO's statement said. Although the lawsuit mentions OPKO Health, the company released a statement on Friday evening saying the SEC does not include any allegations about OPKO's financial practices, financial statements or business practices. OPKO shares dropped about 18 percent after the SEC's announcement. The lawsuit accused the group of earning more than $27 million in stock sales proceeds through a pump-and-dump scheme that went on for about five years and allegedly left public investors ""holding virtually worthless stock."" Frost and the other accused are ""confident that once a proper investigation is completed and the facts of the case have been fully disclosed, the matter will be resolved favorably,"" the statement said. The other accused in the SEC lawsuit are Barry C. Honig, John Stetson, Michael Brauser, John R. O'Rourke III, Mark Groussman, Robert Ladd, Elliot Maza, Brian Keller and John H. Ford. The other entities mentioned in the lawsuit were Alpha Capital Anstalt, ATG Capital LLC, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, GRQ Consultants Inc, HS Contrarian Investments LLC, Grander Holdings Inc., Melechdavid Inc., Southern Biotech Inc. and Stetson Capital Investments Inc.

Organizers this year are preparing for rain with tents to shelter the visitors. Posted: Friday, August 3, 2007 12:00 am Praying for no rain BY JORDAN A. EICHER Odessa American After record-breaking August rains, Rock the Desert could again be facing fears of a flooding desert. Erika Lemmon, 14, a member of Tabernacle Baptist Church of Crane, said she remembers her singing-in-the-rain experience from last year’s concert, while there with her youth group. “It was really nice, I was listening to one of my favorite bands, then it started sprinkling and then it starting pouring,” Erika said. “By the time we got to the van, we were all soaked.” Erika said she’s not too worried about the rain this year, but if it does rain she said, “I just hope to hear all of my favorite bands first.” As of now, Doug Tull, an organizer for the event said he feels the event is pretty safe. “It hasn’t effected anything as far as setting up yet, because we won’t begin setting up until next week,” Tull said. “And the weather is supposed to be great next weekend.” If fact, Tull said they’re excited about this week’s rains. “We’re glad for the rain because it will keep everything looking nice and green and keep the dust down,” he said. However, just in case those leery gray clouds do choose to show up during the concert, organizers are prepared. “We’re setting up different tents, so if there’s rain issues, people can go get under these tents,” Tull said. “But are we worried about the rain? No, not at all. Why worry about what we can’t control anyway?” Posted in News on Friday, August 3, 2007 12:00 am. CLICK HERE to view full version of OA Social Marketplace.

Michael,Gordon,1575,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/09/09/players-champion-exciting-crop-of-youngsters-vie-for-2018-rookie-title/,"PLAYERS' CHAMPION Another superb crop of rookies has emerged in 2018, with five of the best fighting it out for the title of Rookie of the Year at the RLPA Players' Champion awards. Roosters lock Victor Radley, Broncos winger Jamayne Isaako, Titans fullback AJ Brimson, Sharks centre Jesse Ramien and Bulldogs second-rower Rhyse Martin represent a diverse crop of budding NRL stars and each has excelled in different ways this season. From 25-year-old Martin to 19-year-old Brimson, the rookies represent a wide variety of experience levels and game styles and each has produced remarkably consistent football for a rookie. Radley had the most caps of any of the contenders leading into this season after three games last year. He is ineligible for the rookie award at the Dally Ms due to a second suspension picked up this year but that restriction does not apply at the RLPA Players' Champion awards. Victor Radley (Roosters)A superstar in the making and capable of playing edge forward, in the middle or at dummy half, Radley punches well above his weight and is already one of the hardest hitters in the competition. Some of his goal-line defence this season has been eye-catching while he also has the ball-skills to have created three try-assists to go with his three tries. Jamayne Isaako (Broncos)The first rookie to top the season point-scoring tally since the prolific Daryl Halligan back in 1991, Isaako's clutch goal-kicking has been as impressive as his slick work on the Brisbane right wing with 11 tries and 94 goals at an 84 per cent success rate. His match-winning try against the Roosters in round 11 was one of the tries of the season. Alex Brimson (Titans)Brimson only debuted in round 10 and played most of the season at five-eighth before shifting to fullback for the injured Michael Gordon in round 22 with spectacular results. Even more impressive than Brimson's potent running game and seven tries has been his work off the ball, with a series of stunning try-saving tackles. He has been arguably his team's best player in all four matches he started at the back and single-handedly turned the tide in a round 23 win over Manly. Jesse Ramien (Sharks)A constant in the Sharks backline from round three until his own late-season injury, Ramien's tackle-busting runs made him an enormous handful for opposition defences and helped him to tries in six straight games at one point mid-season. His move to the Hunter next season is a coup for the rebuilding Knights. Rhyse Martin (Bulldogs)The sharp-shooting PNG international got a long-awaited NRL chance in round nine; he scored with his very first touch in first grade and has made every post a winner since. He's kicked 34 goals at an unbelievable 95 per cent success rate and bagged a hat-trick in a 24-point haul against the Raiders in round 17. He's played 80 minutes in all bar two of his 14 matches, making over 37 tackles per game, proving his worth at NRL level.

It was a fantastic year by the 2018 rookie class. Congratulations to the Sydney Rooster @sydneyroosters utility Victor Radley who has been voted by players as their 2018 ROY!#ThePlayersChampion pic.twitter.com/O2La99McEu Radley was voted as the best of the first-year players by his peers, and beat out an impressive that included Titans fullback Alex Brimson, Broncos winger Jamayne Isaako, Bulldogs second-rower Rhyse Martin, Sharks centre Jesse Ramien. The Rugby League Players Association have announced the shortlist of the five youngsters who are in contention to take out the Rookie of the Year award. Players from the league voted on which NRL first-timer they consider to have had the best and most influential break-out season. This year's diverse crop of players include Titans fullback Alex Brimson, Broncos winger Jamayne Isaako, Bulldogs second-rower Rhyse Martin, Sharks centre Jesse Ramien and Roosters lock Victor Radley. From 19-year-old Brimson to 25-year-old Martin, the shortlist represents a diverse range of experience and playing styles, but each player has produced consistent footy across their breakout seasons. With all NRL contracted players having the ability to vote in the 3-2-1 system, let's look at the five rookies selected and what made their breakout season so impressive. We take a look at the list of players who are in line for the RLPA Rookie of the Year award! #9NRLSFS pic.twitter.com/Nxq31sDt52 MORE: RLPA awards: Players' Champion shortlist revealed | RLPA awards: World Cup standouts rewarded with Rep Player of the Year nominations Debuting in round ten for the Titans, Brimson's short career has gone from being the rookie at five-eighth to arguably the Gold Coast's most influential player. The Titans' NYC ‘Player of the Year’ in 2017 was elevated into the top 30 for 2018, and took over as fullback for the injured Michael Gordon in round 22. In just fifteen appearences in the light blue and gold outfit, the youngster has not only scored seven tries but also has stunned the NRL with a series of try-saving tackles. In Brimson's short season he made 229 tackles at an 81.6% efficiency rate. As the leading point-scorer at the end of the regular season, you wouldn't guess that Jamayne Isaako is a rookie. Topping the season point-scoring tally with 223 points to his name, the Broncos winger scored 11 tries across the season and kicked 94 goals. Isaako kicked at an impressive 84 per cent conversion success rate. No rookie has topped the leader board for nearly thirty years when the prolific Daryl Halligan took out the title back in 1991. After a long-awaited NRL debut in round nine, Rhyse Martin scored in his very first match against Brisbane and has been a point-scoring machine since. In fact, the 25-year-old scored the most points in a beaten side with 34 goals at 95 per cent success rate. In his fourteen NRL appearences, the PNG international has scored four tries across the season. Martin played the entire 80 minutes in all but two matches, making over 37 tackles per game. With 633 tackles to his name at an efficiency of 87.6 per cent, the Roosters front-rower has proven to be one of the hardest-hitters in the NRL. With three try assists to compliment his three tries, Radley's ability to play forward, in the middle or at dummy half shows his raw versatility at just 20 years old. Copping two suspensions over the season, Radley is ineligible for the Dally M Rookie of the Year award, but the restrictions don't apply at the RLPA Players' Champion awards. The lock had the most caps of any of the finalists heading into this season after playing three games for the Roosters in 2017. In just eighteen appearences this year, Jesse Ramien has built up quite the resume. Scoring ten tries this season, six of those were scored in consecutive games. But it's not just his try-scoring ability that stuns Shark Park - the centre made 60 tackle-busting runs and nine line breaks across his short season. The Novocastrians will be eager to incorporate the youngster alongside the likes of Mitchell Pearce and Kalyn Ponga as he heads up north to the Knights in 2019. 2017: Nick Cotric 2016: Cody Walker 2015: Cameron Munster 2014: Luke Brooks 2013: George Burgess 2012: Josh Mansour & Adam Reynolds 2011: Daly Cherry-Evans 2010: Trent Hodkinson 2009: Josh Dugan 2008: David Williams 2007: Michael Jennings 2006: Darius Boyd 2005: Ben Smith 2004: Sonny-Bill Williams

Andrew,Davis,1574,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6147403/BBC-bid-thwart-Remainers-hijack-Night-Proms.html,"By Chris Hastings for The Mail on Sunday Published: 21:30 EST, 8 September 2018 | Updated: 04:31 EST, 9 September 2018 628 View comments The Royal Albert Hall filled with Promenaders waving Union Jacks and joining in the chorus of Land Of Hope And Glory has become one of the best-loved TV spectacles of the year. But BBC bosses last night restricted views of the crowds at The Last Night Of The Proms in a bid to avoid giving ‘undue prominence’ to anti-Brexit campaigners. In the hours leading up to the event, which was broadcast live on BBC1, pro-Remain campaigners handed out 20,000 European Union flags to concertgoers. Protest organisers hoped the EU flags would have a stronger visual presence than the Union Jacks that normally dominate the event. BBC bosses last night restricted views of the crowds at The Last Night Of The Proms in a bid to avoid giving ‘undue prominence’ to anti-Brexit campaigners. In the hours leading up to the event, which was broadcast live on BBC1, pro-Remain campaigners handed out 20,000 European Union flags to concertgoers This is the third time the protest has taken place since the Brexit vote in 2016, although twice as many flags were handed out this time around. A BBC source said: ‘We are still going to have shots of the crowds but we are more mindful of undue prominence. The primary focus will be the music.’ The pro-EU protest was last night criticised by classical musical enthusiasts who thought it was out of keeping with the event. David Mellor, The Mail on Sunday’s own classical music correspondent, said: ‘I think The Last Night Of The Proms should not be hijacked for political purposes.’ The event attracts a significant number of visitors from overseas, including many German fans. And ex-Tory Minister Mr Mellor, who described last night’s line-up of talent and music as ‘more British than in previous years’, added: ‘In all the years I have been going – and I have been going a lot of years – there is always a significant overseas element and particularly a German element, which is rather endearing in a way.’ The pro-EU campaigners spent the days leading up to the protest drumming up support on social media. Leading figures from the world of classical music last night defended the patriotic elements of the event. Acclaimed conductor Sir Andrew Davis, who last night conducted his first Last Night for 18 years, said on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday: ‘Nobody thinks that Britannia rules the waves. It’s sort of historically of its period. These things represent a naive and innocent pride in being British.’ Jonathan Kent, renowned opera and theatre director, added: ‘The jingoism is sometimes unfortunate but nonetheless it is a celebration of the event itself. To lose that would be a pity.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘On television we try very hard to avoid undue prominence when reflecting and conveying the atmosphere of the live event as it unfolds in front of our cameras – our focus is on the musicians and their performances.’ Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

Michael,Gordon,1573,http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/policereports/article/Former-Greenwich-employee-avoids-jail-after-13213510.php,"By John Nickerson Stamford Superior Court in Stamford, Conn. on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. Stamford Superior Court in Stamford, Conn. on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. Caption Close Stamford Superior Court in Stamford, Conn. on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. Stamford Superior Court in Stamford, Conn. on Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. STAMFORD — A former Parking Services Department employee for the town of Greenwich who siphoned thousands from town coffers avoided jail Friday and made guilty pleas to felony counts of first- and second-degree larceny during a brief hearing at the Stamford courthouse. Michael Gordon, 49, of Greenwich was given no jail time or probation for the pleas but he made restitution, paying all that he stole following his arrest, Stamford State’s Attorney Richard Colangelo said. “He has made restitution, but he will have these felonies on his record as a result of this plea, which satisfies the interests of justice and the community in this case,” Colangelo said after the hearing. Gordon, who had no criminal record before the two convictions, declined comment in the court hallway following the hearing. “I take full responsibility,” he told Judge Gary White after making his plea. White gave Gordon an unconditional discharge and waived any court fees and costs. Gordon’s defense attorney Philip Russell said, “I think the sentence was fair and just and reflects some compelling factors on both sides of this case.” Gordon was arrested in April 2017 after a police investigation determined that he had been diverting money from his job into his own pocket. When he was arrested, police said he had stolen at least $11,000 from the town between December 2016 and April 2017. In the plea, Gordon was sentenced for stealing about $4,000 from the town. The cause of the discrepancy was not clear. The arrest affidavit said Gordon engaged in “an elaborate series of fraudulent transactions,” in which he misapplied credits for parking ticket transactions that had already been paid in cash. He then kept the surplus cash for himself. Gordon had been an account clerk at the Parking Services Department since 2009. Greenwich town officials have said many changes have been put in pace to prevent similar theft from happening again. And the town has announced an independent consultant is coming in to take a look at the Parking Services Department. Chicago-based P Plus Corp. will be “reviewing current operations, processes, policies and staff assignments to inform the development of an updated, efficient plan of operations, and to assist with the implementation of upgraded technology and equipment to enhance services,” according to a statement from town officials. jnickerson@stamfordadvocate.com

Michael,Gordon,1573,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/09/08/gold-coast-titans-2018-season-review/,"TITANS As part of the NRL.com series reviewing each club's 2018 season, Neil Cadigan looks at the promising signs from the Titans in a year where they struggled for consistency. The Titans are a team that finished the season in the category of 'showed what might be to come', as they underperformed on the ladder but unleashed some young talent that should put them among the finals contenders in 2019. After winning three of their first five games, including a 26-14 win against derby rivals the Broncos, a side predicted to improve as the season progressed looked a possible finals hope. Their season waned, despite taking premiership heavyweights down to the wire like Cronulla (lost 10-9), South Sydney (lost 18-16), Melbourne Storm (lost 28-14 and 10-8) and enjoying victories over Brisbane and the Warriors. They could trouble any side but lacked consistency over 80 minutes let alone weeks or months; their home record stood at three wins and seven losses and they conceded more tries than all but Manly and Newcastle. Jai Arrow, Mitch Rein and Michael Gordon proved excellent buys, skipper Ryan James was a reliable workhorse, Kevin Proctor was a rock on the right edge defensively but broke few tackles with the ball and, although he played all three Origin games for Queensland, Jarrod Wallace was good early but failed to produce the form of his first Titans season in 2017. Halfback Ash Taylor began the season well but lost consistency and the ability to close out games as he had to handle the game-management by himself after Kane Elgey was dropped for defensive deficiencies after round seven (he was recalled for the last four games). The good news was the development of five-eighth/fullback AJ Brimson in a brilliant rookie year, 18-year-prop Moeaki Fotuaika, intimidating forward Keegan Hipgrave, prop Max King until his injury in round 14 and winger Phillip Sami. Best player Jai Arrow was an early season revelation in his first season with the Titans. The quality in his high workload in the first half of the season was enormous although his form tapered as his body struggled with the demands of playing Origin and knocking out big minutes as a run-on player. Ryan James, who won his second Paul Broughton Medal as official player of the year, was not far behind. What-if moment Without doubt the 'what could have been' element for the Titans was the inability of big-name signing Bryce Cartwright to provide anywhere near the impact the Titans expected from him. He could have been the X-Factor the club has lacked, a forward who can ball-play and break the line out wide, but coach Garth Brennan desperately tried to find a role for him without reward – in the middle, on the edge (on the left after he had been a right-side player all his career) and even at five-eighth in the first 12 rounds. He went back to reserves and appeared only five times again, each time playing limited minutes off the bench. The quote: Coach Garth Brennan on tearaway forward Keegan Hipgrave: ""He's a little bit of a loose cannon. When you look at what he does away from the football field, he's studying to be a sky-diving instructor … when I think of anyone who jumps out of a perfectly good plane on a regular basis certainly has some issues."" Best win Coming off a 46-point thrashing by the Dragons, the Titans' 26-14 victory over Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium in round four was an early-season statement by the Titans (that they could not live up to). They outplayed a near full-strength Broncos (who had Matt Gillett and Alex Glenn in the pack) in only their second victory at Suncorp against Big Brother, and their sixth in 24 games. Arrow was enormous against his old club, running for 160 metres from 17 hit-ups and making 39 tackles. Worst loss In round three the Titans let in nine tries and missed 42 tackles against the Dragons in Toowoomba, a place where they have worked hard to build a strong association. It's their worst memory of the year, ahead of the collapse against the Knights in Newcastle when they led 24-10 with 22 minutes remaining but stumbled to a 30-24 loss. Roster rotation The Titans have added size in Shannon Boyd from Canberra and utility value in Penrith and NSW livewire Tyrone Peachey, as well as strengthening their backline depth with playmaker Tyrone Roberts to return from Warrington and centre/winger Kea Pere joining the club from Melbourne. Popular centre Konrad Hurrell has been granted a release to join the Leeds Rhinos on a three-year deal. Kane Elgey (Manly), Ryan Simpkins (retired), Tyronne Roberts-Davis (released), Tony Mata'utia (released) are the other players on the way out. 2019 outlook The Titans should be one of the big improvers next season. The core of their squad is intact (not one regular player from 2018 will be lost) and they will have more attacking strike, which they need, with the acquisition of Peachey, Boyd and Roberts who will be the ally Ash Taylor needs if they can repeat their partnership of 2016 which was a major force in taking the Gold Coast to the finals. There is youth in the squad with several young players sure to have benefitted from this year's experience.

Ironworker Michael Gordon after the Sept. 7, 2018, ceremonial opening of the southbound/eastbound span of the new Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge.(Photo: Nancy Cutler/The Journal News)Buy Photo There was a long list of people to recognize and thank for Joanie Mahoney, chairwoman of the New York State Thruway Authority board. She had emcee duties at the Sept. 7 ceremony to officially open the southbound/eastbound span of the bridge that carries the Thruway and Interstate 287 over the Tappan Zee section of the Hudson River. There were the electeds, the dignitaries, and members of the Cuomo family, as the current governor had engineered the undertaking of the $3.9 billion project and the naming of the span for his father, the former governor, Mario M. Cuomo. And there was this key acknowledgement and welcome: ""... And all of our friends in labor who actually built this bridge,"" Mahoney said to rousing applause. Keynote speaker, Hillary Clinton, after extolling the project's timely and ""under budget"" completion (we'll see), also made sure credit was given where it's due: she thanked the workers. ""I hope anyone who had anything to do with it will stand a little taller because of what you've done."" 'BIG BRIDGE, BIG SCISSORS': Ribbon cut on second span of Cuomo Bridge WHAT ABOUT THE TOLLS? New span opens, but questions about bridge remain It seemed more workers were on hand last year, in August, when the first span opened. Then again, work is ongoing — we saw welders cutting into the superstructure of the old Tappan Zee, cranes bringing material up and down, boats going back and forth, even as we gathered on the new span for the pomp. Iron Worker 580 Michael Gordon helped build this bridge. He put up those sides keep us safe! I thanked him . #TapppanZeeBridge#CuomoBridge@lohudpic.twitter.com/nVHRIQ3l5W One of those ironworkers was Michael Gordon of Local 580. We stood by some of his work — the railings and mesh-like siding along the sides of both spans. That work was some of the last completed on the span that just opened. He'll keep working on the project during dismantling and as the new walking/biking path is completed.

This guy helped build this bridge. Concrete foreman Louis Cruz Union 780 NYC #tappanzeebridge#cuomobridge@lohudpic.twitter.com/ZNAAkwr820 Concrete foreman Louis Cruz of the Cement Masons Union 780 said his workers have a lot more to do on the shared-use path that will allow cyclists, walkers and runners to traverse the new bridge on the northbound/westbound span and soak in stunning Hudson River views. The path, which will have parking space in Tarrytown and South Nyack, is due for completion sometime in 2019. These are the people who aren't talking about rhetorical ""bridge building"" but are doing it (and building walls, too, like the one that will separate pedestrians and bike riders from traffic). Can you see the sparks as workers continue dismantle old #TappanZeeBridge amid opening of new x-ing over the #TappanZee? #CuomoBridge@lohudpic.twitter.com/ck7bb4LRuc During the Sept. 7 speechmaking, though, that wall vs. bridge symbolism was tapped more than a few times. Gov. Andrew Cuomo addressed President Trump, left unnamed, who has become Cuomo's political foil as the Democratic governor faces a Sept. 13 primary. Cuomo said the president was focusing on building walls, when we need to build bridges. Clinton also talked about building bridges, adding that she meant it literally and figuratively, as our nation's infrastructure continues to crumble. Promises of a federal investment haven't materialized. A view of the Tappan Zee Bridge being dismantled, as seen from the southbound deck of the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, hours before the second span officially opens, Friday, Sept. 7, 2018. (Photo: Nancy Cutler/The Journal News) There's plenty of controversy about this bridge — the lack of information about future tolls, ongoing problems with the ""cashless"" tolling system that is spreading throughout New York nonetheless, and that name. The workers, though, deserved a breather today, and all those cheers. The prayer by the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, senior pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, noted how the new bridge, with ""waters below and heavens above,"" was ""connecting New York land masses."" And who did that? The workers who attended, and the ones who were still busy on the old Tappan Zee superstructure and on the river below. Nancy Cutler is an Engagement Editor.

Joel,Cutler,1569,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180907/cincinnati-winton-woods-52-upper-arlington-45,"The Upper Arlington High School football team kept pace with visiting Cincinnati Winton Woods — last year’s Division II state runner-up — but came up a touchdown short in a shootout that wasn’t decided until the final drive. The Warriors racked up 31 second-quarter points en route to a 52-45 victory Sept. 7 and improved to 2-1. Isaiah Andrews’ 70-yard touchdown pass to Demeer Blankumsee gave Winton Woods the lead for good with 1 minute, 30 seconds left after UA’s Chris Schweisthal had scored on a 15-yard run to make it 45-all with 2:37 to play. “It was one of those games that probably takes years off your life,” Winton Woods coach Andre Parker said. “There were so many peaks and valleys. I’m very, very proud of our guys coming on the road.” Winton Wood’s rushing attack highlighted the night with Miyan Williams scoring on touchdown runs of 9, 60, 1 and 98 yards. He gained 260 yards on 20 carries, and the Warriors finished with 309 yards rushing. A blocked punt set up Williams’ 1-yard score, which ended a barrage of six touchdowns in the final six minutes of the first half, with Winton Woods holding a 38-24 halftime lead. UA fought back in the second half, with Sammy Sass’ 35-yard touchdown throw to Josh Rushin cutting the Warriors’ lead to 38-31 before Williams broke free for his 98-yard score to make it 44-31 before the extra point. The Bears' Eli D’Herete then scored from 1-yard out with 4:33 left, making it 45-38 to set up the wild finish. “There’s no quit in Golden Bears, and we talk a lot about Golden Bears’ spirit around here,” UA coach Joel Cutler said. “I told the boys that games like this get you ready for down the stretch. All of our goals are still intact, and we start OCC play next week.” Schweisthal finished with 111 yards on 18 carries for the Bears, who dropped to 1-2. Sass completed eight of 20 passes for 134 yards and two touchdowns, both caught by Rushin. The teams combined for 883 yards of offense. sports@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekSports ========== WW — Prince 40 pass from Andrews (Velasquez kick) UA — Sass 4 run (Raish kick) UA — Raish 30 FG WW — Williams 9 run (Velasquez kick) WW — Velasquez 26 FG UA — Rushin 28 pass from Sass (Raish kick) UA — D’Herete 2 run (Raish kick) WW — Williams 60 run (Velasquez kick) WW — Andrews 1 run (Velasquez kick) WW — Williams 1 run (Velasquez kick) UA — Rushin 35 pass from Sass (Raish kick) WW — Williams 98 run (Velasquez kick) UA — D’Herete 1 run (Raish kick) UA — Schweisthal 15 run (Raish kick) WW — Blankumsee 70 pass from Andrews (Velasquez kick) © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Bloomberg and Financial Times both said this information was revealed by people with knowledge of the case. Citing those who begged to remain anonymous, Bloomberg said Mr Phido was detained by police in May 2017 because his name isn’t public, but was released on bail after his arrest and went back to Nigeria. According to the reputable journal, an official from the UK National Crime Agency hinted at the case this week when he told a crowd of lawyers at a conference in Cambridge, England, about an arrest of the head of a London unit of a foreign bank, without revealing the individual’s identity or saying when the arrest took place. Nigel Kirby, the deputy director of the NCA’s economic crime unit, said that the case is being evaluated by prosecutors after a seven-month investigation found possible corruption. The person Kirby was describing was Mr Phido, according to one of the people. “Union Bank said it isn’t being investigated for bribery, nor has it been investigated in the past. It referred questions about the case to Mr Phido, who no longer works at the bank. Mr Phido didn’t immediately respond to a request to comment via his LinkedIn account,” Bloomberg reports. Also, a spokeswoman for NCA didn’t immediately provide a comment, and a spokeswoman for the CPS declined to comment. Mr Phido’s term as chief executive officer in London ended on May 26, 2017, according to the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s register of approved persons. Union Bank Plc, which has its headquarters in Lagos, has gained increasing media coverage in recent months after former Barclays Plc CEO Bob Diamond raised his company’s stake in the lender to 49 percent. Atlas Mara Ltd., which Diamond co-founded, specializes in investing in banking operations in sub-Saharan Africa. The lender is one of the companies trading its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).

Andrew,Davis,1567,http://www.mariettatimes.com/news/local-news/2018/09/marietta-voyeur-sentenced-to-10-years/,"Sep 8, 2018 The next 10 years will be behind bars for a Marietta registered sex offender. Ryan Andrew Davis, 36, of 207 Virginia St., pleaded guilty this week to multiple felonies and a misdemeanor, wrapping up an extensive case of intrusion into women’s restrooms where he would gratify himself sexually. Assistant Prosecutor Alison Cauthorn said Davis took a plea deal Thursday following negotiations in a final pre-trial and was sentenced to a cumulative 10 years in prison. He pleaded guilty to: • Burglary, a second-degree felony. • Intimidation of an attorney, victim or witness, a third-degree felony. • Trespassing in a habitation, a fourth-degree felony. • Assault, a fifth-degree felony. • Voyeurism, a third-degree misdemeanor. Davis was accused of not only hiding in a women’s restroom stall at the Lafayette Hotel on Dec. 17 but also on Jan. 9 in the Marietta City Water Department offices on Putnam Street. He was convicted on similar charges in 2010 for watching women in a bathroom in the Washington County Courthouse and was charged in 2015 with hiding in a women’s bathroom in the dining hall at Marietta College. “At the Lafayette, he was standing on the toilet so that his feet weren’t visible beyond the stall door,” explained Cauthorn. “The other trespassing is for when he was hiding in the women’s bathroom in the city building. Then the intimidation and assault are for his actions in the jail.” Davis’s arrest in January initially landed him in prison on a post-release control violation for the 2015 conviction. But then he was transferred to the Washington County Jail after being indicted in March. “This is not the first time he did this,” said Cauthorn noting that in court Thursday Davis apologized to Washington County Common Pleas Judge Mark Kerenyi for his actions. Sgt. Ryan Huffman, of the Marietta Police Department, said Thursday that he was pleased with the sentence. “It was a case that had several women (shaken) up over his actions,” he noted. “(I’m) glad it turned out well.” Davis was ordered to serve consecutively six years on the second-degree felony, two years on the third-degree felony, 18 months on the fourth-degree felony, six months on the fifth-degree felony and his misdemeanor jail time to run concurrently to the other sentences. He was also awarded 154 days of credit for time incarcerated prior to sentencing.

Andrew,Davis,1567,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/07/classical-album-of-the-week-gerald-finzi-cello-concerto-chandos-ruth-gipps,"Watkins/Lortie/BBC SO/Davis (Chandos) Andrew Clements Fri 7 Sep 2018 12.51 EDT Gerald Finzi’s Cello Concerto was his last completed work, first performed in 1955, a year before his death. It is also by a long way his most substantial orchestral score – Paul Watkins’ performance lasts 37 minutes – and for a composer whose output was so closely entwined with words and their setting, it is a rare extended essay in abstract musical thought. But after Elgar’s concerto, which it occasionally echoes,it ranks as one of the finest of all British works for cello and orchestra, standing alongside Bridge’s Oration and Britten’s Cello Symphony. When he started writing the concerto in 1951, Finzi already knew he did not have long to live, and the wistful land of lost content that never seems too far away in any of his music certainly pervades this work. Watkins’ performance, which manages to be warmly expressive while remaining slightly detached, captures that mood perfectly. Nothing is exaggerated or over-assertive, even in the hefty cadenza that provides the climax to the first movement, allowing Finzi’s very individual musical voice to speak for itself, as it does so clearly in all the other performances on this disc too. Louis Lortie is the soloist in the ruminatively beautiful Eclogue for piano and strings, and is spiritedly athletic, with full orchestra, in the neo-baroque Grand Fantasia and Toccata, which, apart from its obvious Bachian flourishes, seems a curious stylistic mix of Hindemith, Walton and Vaughan Williams. Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra make a fine job of the one near rarity in this collection, the strikingly atmospheric Nocturne (New Year Music) from 1940, inspired by a poem by Robert Bridges. There’s a second disc of British works among Chandos’s batch of September releases, this one devoted to the music of Ruth Gipps (1921-1999), who is perhaps best remembered now as a teacher and as the founder of the London Repertoire Orchestra, made up of students and freelance professionals, which she conducted for more than 30 years. Rumon Gamba’s disc with the BBC National Orchestral of Wales includes two of Gipp’s beautifully fluent symphonies, the Second and the Fourth, as well as her early symphonic poem Knight in Armour, which was premiered at the Last Night of the Proms in 1942. That work, and the single-movement Second Symphony, from 1945, are clearly both indebted to Gipps’s teacher Vaughan Williams, while the Fourth, from 1972, seems to belong securely and less distinctively in the mainstream of mid-century conservative British music.

Andrew,Davis,1567,http://www.osnews.com/story/30710/Creator_of_TempleOS_Terry_Davis_has_passed_away,"Username or EmailPassword Advanced Search Terrence Andrew Davis, sole creator and developer of TempleOS (née LoseThos), has passed away at age 48. Davis suffered from mental illness - schizophrenia - which had a severe impact on his life. He claimed he created his operating system after having spoken with and receiving instructions from god, and he was a controversial figure, also here on OSNews, for his incomprehensible rants and abrasive style towards OSNews readers and staff. We eventually had to ban him, but our then-editor Kroc Kamen worked with him in 2010 to publish an article about his operating system despite his ban. Davis was clearly a gifted programmer - writing an entire operating system is no small feat - and it was sad to see him affected by his mental illness. I mourn his passing, and I wish his family and friends all the strength they need in these trying times. His family and friends are asking people to donate to ""organizations working to ease the pain and suffering caused by mental illness"", such as The Brain & Behaviour Research Foundation or the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I hope he found peace - wherever he may be. See More

Bill,Alfond,1566,https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/09/06/colby-college-opens-new-25-5-million-mixed-use-dorm-building-in-downtown-waterville-to-the-public/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Speeches and tours marked Thursday's ribbon cutting that officially opened a new era of revitalization projects in downtown Waterville. WATERVILLE — Colby College welcomed the public Thursday to its new $25.5 million mixed-use residential complex downtown with speeches, accolades to those who made the building possible and student-led tours of the upper four floors housing more than 200 students, faculty and staff involved in a civic engagement program. About 350 city officials, state legislators, business people, Colby benefactors, students and staff, as well as area residents, stood outside the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons at 150 Main St. to listen to brief speeches before pouring into the building to mingle, partake of refreshments and tour the site. Colby President David A. Greene thanked all who made it possible for the building to come to fruition, including Bill and Joan Alfond, who made a gift supporting the effort. “We could not have had a better partner all along than the Harold Alfond Foundation and the Alfond family,” Greene said. Greene recalled that four years ago he and a group of city leaders, including City Manager Michael Roy and Mayor Nick Isgro, city councilors, business leaders and others met for several months to think about and discuss the future of Waterville and how to help it thrive. They identified as priorities addressing vacant and dilapidated buildings, drawing more businesses downtown and helping those already there, and drawing more people to live and work downtown. The group developed a plan for launching revitalization efforts and the City Council approved the proposal. The city and Colby worked together. The residential complex, which has retail as well as meeting space for the city, nonprofit and other groups on the first floor, is now largely complete. Colby bought and renovated the former Waterville Savings Bank across the street at 173 Main St., which now houses Colby offices, CGI Group and Portland Pie Co. The college also plans to build a hotel downtown and develop a center for arts and film in The Center at 93 Main St. Those developments have spurred other investors to purchase and renovate buildings downtown, jobs have been created and property values are rising, according to Greene. “We’ve seen a population increase after decades of seeing the population decrease over time,” he said. “People are moving back to Waterville. People are investing in Waterville. This building, we hope, will be another catalyst for extraordinary development here in Waterville.” Greene said $14 million spent on the new Colby building went into the pockets of businesses and people who work in Waterville and area towns. Wearing a purple Waterville Panthers cap and blue and white Colby shirt, Bill Alfond, a Waterville native, 1972 Colby graduate and member of the college’s Board of Trustees, welcomed the crowd and asked his wife, Joan, to stand. They attended with their son, former Maine State Senate President Justin Alfond. “I hope you all share the excitement as we watch our new revitalized Main Street take shape, really, right before our eyes,” Bill Alfond said. He said he was fortunate to have grown up in Waterville at a time when there were a lot of good jobs and a thriving Main Street. His uncles, Ludy and Pacy Levine, owned and operated the popular Levine’s clothing store on Main Street, and three movie theaters were busy. The original YMCA was close by and Park’s Diner was on the spot where the new Colby building stands now, according to Alfond. “So, a lot of good memories,” he said. His parents, Harold and Dorothy “Bibby” Alfond, lived in Waterville, which was his mother’s hometown — she was the Levines’ sister. Waterville also was home to other families, including the Mitchells, whose children attended South Grammar School and played at the Boys Club. “I learned a great deal from all these kids when I was a student here. I sort of felt the calling of the community and I got involved and I started the Big Brothers Big Sisters program,” he said. He recalled organizing a Christmas party for the program and seeing the excitement on the face of his “little brother,” a boy named “Sean.” “That was a moment when I learned how much I would enjoy giving back,” he said. Bill Alfond later became involved with Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, which became a partner to the development of Educare Central Maine, an early childhood education program in Waterville. Along the way, he learned that a healthy community requires things such as good jobs, profit and nonprofit organizations, a vibrant downtown, restaurants and the arts, as well as health and fitness options and opportunities. It also requires a lot of leaders collaborating to bring critical elements together. “The most important thing — you learn how to work together — teamwork,” he said. He said the new Colby building is much more than a beautiful space. “Students and staff will interact every day with the community and those day-to-day contacts will show you the relationship between the college and the community, now, and hopefully long into the future,” he said. A COMMUNITY REACTS Those who turned out for the opening Thursday and toured the new building used words such as “incredible,” “beautiful” and “awesome” to describe it. The weather held out just long enough for speeches and the ribbon cutting. After the crowd started filtering into the building, a hard rain began to pound the pavement. Bill Basford, 73, of Waterville, said he was impressed with the building and glad students will be spending time in the downtown, where Basford frequents places such as Selah Tea and Jorgensen’s Cafe. “It’s the first time I’ve been inside,” said Basford, a retired engineer who now works on energy issues. “I don’t think Colby should ever have left the downtown.” He was referring to the college’s move from downtown to Mayflower Hill many years ago. “It was 1933 when the trustees voted to build the new campus on the hill,” he said. “It was 1937 when they started and, of course, they had to take a break for World War II. It was the early 50s when the move was completed.” A University of Maine graduate, Basford recalled playing trombone in the Colby Symphony Orchestra when he was a high school student. He continues to attend concerts there and has kept abreast of Colby projects, including the new Colby building downtown. “I was very impressed by the whole construction process, really,” he said. “Paul Ureneck (director of commercial real estate for Elm City LLC, an affiliate of Colby, who oversees downtown construction) really knows what he’s doing. I was involved in a number of construction projects when I was in the Navy, and this one was much smoother as far as getting things done and not interrupting the neighbors too much.” Amanda Landry, 22, was floating among the crowd inside the building, greeting people and monitoring activities. A Colby employee who works as a building general specialist in the mixed-use residential complex, Landry said her duties include custodial work, setting up and taking down events, doing part-time security and being a receptionist. The third generation of her family to work for Colby — her grandmother is an electrician there and her father oversees the ice rink — she said she loves her work and the new building. “It’s absolutely amazing,” said Landry, of Norridgewock. “This place is gorgeous. It’s an amazing opportunity for the community and the students to be engaged, and I really think it’s going to make a difference. They put so much heart and soul into it.” Waterville mayor Isgro, who attended the meetings four years ago with Greene to discuss Waterville’s needs, was at a standing table in The Chace Community Forum on the first floor, where City Council meetings will be held starting in October. “It’s both humbling and exciting to be here today to see a plan that was drafted and developed about four years ago come to fruition,” Isgro said. “I’m speechless, really. It’s a wonderful day for the city.” State Reps. Colleen Madigan, D-Waterville; John Picchiotti, R-Fairfield; and Thomas R.W. Longstaff, D-Waterville, also were mingling in the Chace Forum. They said they were impressed with the new building and downtown revitalization in general, which promises jobs and economic development. “It’s just sort of incredible, this level of investment in the city,” Madigan said. Pichiotti concurred. “It’s phenomenal. They’ve done a really great job.” INSIDE THE BUILDING Before touring the apartments — there are 52 four- and six-bedroom student apartments and eight for faculty/staff — Longstaff summed up his thoughts on the development. “The building is beautiful. It clearly stands out as one of the first steps of the revitalization of downtown, and in it we begin to see that revitalization taking shape,” he said. Colby senior Helen Chavey led a tour that included a third-floor studio apartment featuring stainless steel appliances, living and sleeping areas overlooking Main Street, and a bathroom. As the group entered, Jordan Troisi, a visiting researcher with the Center for Teaching and Learning who lives in the apartment, was working at a desk. The professor of psychology at Sewanee, The University of the South, in Tennessee, said he loves his space. “It’s the nicest apartment I’ve ever had,” he said. Chavey, a government major with a double minor in data science and anthropology, led the group to her fifth-floor apartment overlooking Main Street, where she and three other students live, and then to a glassed-in study lounge at the corner of the building. Janice Kassman, retired vice president for student affairs and dean of students at Colby, who worked at the college for 38 years, marveled at the facility. She said the vision for what students will do and learn while interacting with the community is “incredible,” as is the building itself. Chavey was brimming with excitement at the beauty of her new digs and for what her year will look like as she is part of the program. “I feel super lucky that I get to live here,” she said. Alleen Thompson, a 1940 Colby graduate, also called the building “incredible,” as she inspected Chavey’s apartment kitchen, as well as a social lounge down the hall whose windows overlook Waterville Public Library. “I can’t believe this,” she said. “I would think every junior and senior would fight to live here.” Amy Calder — 861-9247 [email protected] Twitter: @AmyCalder17 Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

Phillip,Frost,1565,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/prominent-health-care-investor-phillip-frost-charged-by-sec-with-pump-and-dump-schemes-2018-09-07,"Published: Sept 17, 2018 9:06 a.m. ET Frost and others are accused of making more than $27 million in proceeds from alleged schemes By Billionaire and notable health-care investor Phillip Frost was one of 10 individuals and 10 associated firms charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7 with participating in extremely profitable, yearslong pump-and-dump schemes. Opko Health Inc. OPK, -7.45% , a pharmaceutical and diagnostics company that Frost founded and led as chairman and chief executive, was also named in the SEC complaint. Opko Health shares dropped 18% in extremely active September 7 trading before they were halted. Frost, Opko and others were accused of making more than $27 million in stock sales proceeds between 2013 and 2018 by organizing large stock buys and promoting the stock — including through misleading articles and manipulative trading — while failing to properly disclose their stakes. The scheme left public investors “holding virtually worthless stock,” according to the SEC complaint. Related: SEC charges multiple firms, individuals with microcap fraud schemes, including Barry Honig Frost, who is in his 80s and lives in Miami Beach, Fla., served as the chairman of generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA, -3.65% for more than four years, stepping down in late 2014. He was previously chairman and chief executive of Ivax Corporation until 2006, when Teva acquired the company, and before that he worked to reformulate an old asthma drug into a best seller at Key Pharmaceuticals, which is now a subsidiary of Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -0.70% The Florida biotech billionaire also has a Miami science museum named after him, the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science. The SEC complaint in particular notes that he “enjoys a reputation as a successful biotech investor.” Frost, for his part, denies the allegations, which he said in a statement last week “are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts.” Furthermore, the SEC did not provide him advanced notice before releasing the charges or an opportunity to answer questions, Frost said, something that it usually does. “I invested in two of the entities identified in the complaint. These investments were made because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term shareholder in both companies,” he said. “I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” The biotechnology industry plays a sizable role in the SEC complaint. Frost and others allegedly approached a privately-held biotech company in 2010, proposing to take it public, as a way of financing research into a technology the company hoped to use in large drug markets. The group merged the company with a publicly-traded shell company and effectively took over company management, but didn’t invest into the research and development that had been promised — leading to its abandonment, the SEC said. Meanwhile, in company filings, the group’s existence and majority share ownerships were not disclosed, according to the complaint, and one of the group’s members organized favorable articles that emphasized Frost’s role with the company and incorrectly said that its drug formulation was far along. Related: Meet the perfect mark for a pump-and-dump scam: the modern retiree According to a Seeking Alpha article that the SEC complaint references, that company was the microcap BioZone Pharmaceuticals, now a subsidiary of Cocrystal Pharma Inc. COCP, +1.11% , which saw shares drop 14.4% on September 7. Another company allegedly used for a pump-and-dump scheme was a private company developing cancer therapies and diagnostics. Entities owned and controlled by Frost and others, including Opko, the privately-held Southern Biotech Inc. and Frost Gamma Investment Trust, for which Frost is a trustee, were involved, according to the complaint. In later filings, Frost and FGIT did not correctly disclose the nature of their stake, the SEC said. That company was allegedly MabVax Therapeutics MBVX, +10.00% , according to the other Seeking Alpha article. The scheme brought the company’s shares up from $1.91 to $4.30 and made the group more than $5.5 million, the complaint stated. Another effort, using another Seeking Alpha article, made the group more than $2.7 million, per the SEC complaint. MabVax had shares drop 9.6% to 45 cents on September 7. Florida investor Barry Honig, John Stetson, Michael Brauser, John R. O’Rourke III, Mark Groussman, Elliot Maza, Robert Ladd, Brian Keller, John H. Ford, Alpha Capital Anstalt, ATG Capital LLC, GRQ Consultants Inc., HS Contrarian Investments LLC, Grander Holdings Inc., Melechdavid Inc. and Stetson Capital Investments Inc. were also named in the SEC complaint. The SEC is requesting that the defendants be required to give up their “ill-gotten gains,” with interest, as well as civil penalties, and that they be barred from other penny-stock offerings.

Phillip,Frost,1565,https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-billionaire-phillip-frost-charged-by-sec-sending-opko-shares-slidi/531864/,"UPDATE: Sept. 8, 2018: Following publication of this article, Opko Health on Friday posted a statement on its website responding to the charges against it and its CEO, Phillip Frost. ""The SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to filing the complaint, which contains serious factual inaccuracies,"" the company said, noting that it believes the charges will be resolved favorably after further investigation. The octogenarian Frost has spent nearly the last five decades in the science and biotech world, with a hand in several well-known companies. Opko describes itself as a healthcare company that includes the nation's third-largest clinical laboratory with BioReference Laboratories, as well as a portfolio of marketed and experimental therapeutics. Frost founded Opko and in 2007 became CEO and Chairman, positions he continues to hold. Prior to running Opko, he headed up Key Pharmaceuticals until that company was bought out in the late 1980s, when he switched roles to lead Ivax Corporation. Following Ivax's acquisition by Teva in 2006, Frost joined the board of the generic giant with stints as both chair and vice chair. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment in response to a request from BioPharma Dive. Opko later posted a statement on its website responding to the charges. ""The SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to filing the complaint, which contains serious factual inaccuracies,"" the company said, noting that it believes the charges will be resolved favorably. The 53-page SEC complaint outlines how Frost and nine others allegedly played a role in the illegal trading schemes, along with 10 associated companies, including Opko. The complaint was filed in federal district court in Manhattan and stems from an ongoing SEC investigation. The suit claims three highly profitable pump-and-dump schemes between 2013 and 2018 with three small public companies enriched the defendants but left ""retail investors holding virtually worthless shares."" The group had John Ford, a co-defendant, ""write favorable or materially misleading articles about the company whose stock price they wanted to inflate"" after investing. The three schemes raked in nearly $30 million in total proceeds. ""As alleged, Honig and his associates engaged in brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,"" said Sanjay Wadhwa, Senior Associate Director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. The complaint did not name the companies in which the defendants illegally traded in. One appears to be MGT Capital Investments, Inc., a bitcoin mining penny stock, based off the complaint's description of a Harrison, New York-based company that de-listed on Oct. 19, 2016. Another of the three schemes looks to be MabVax Therapeutics, a San Diego, California-based company. The indictment details how Honig directed one of the co-defendants to write a post on Seeking Alpha under the pseudonym ""Wall Street Advisors,"" that highlighted Opko's and Frost's stake in MabVax. The post is still available online under the same title cited by the SEC, with MabVax replacing the pseudonym ""Company C."" Frost is also the namesake of the Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in Miami, which he paid $35 million in 2011 to name,according to the museum's website. The museum opened May 8, 2017. He's also currently on the Board of Trustees of the University of Miami. On the company's yearly SEC filing, Opko called out Phillip Frost as particularly crucial to its business. ""Our success is dependent to a significant degree upon the efforts of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phillip Frost, M.D., who is essential to our business,"" the document stated. While it's not uncommon for a healthcare company to highlight a CEO departure as a risk factor, Opko placed a notably strong emphasis on the negative impact if Frost leaves, including on the company's finances. Frost has provided financing to Opko, according to the document. Subscribe to BioPharma Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.

Returns as of 11/14/2018 Shares of Opko Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) were down 18% as of 3:34 p.m. EDT on Friday after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged 10 individuals, along with 10 entities associated with these individuals, with fraud. Both Opko Health and its CEO, Phillip Frost, were named in the charges. Trading of the stock was also halted. The SEC alleged that the individuals and entities manipulated the share prices of three companies in what are commonly referred to as ""pump-and-dump"" schemes. Phillip Frost was accused of participating in two of these cases of fraud. Image source: Getty Images. It is important to remember that the SEC's charges haven't been proven yet. Opko Health has not released a public statement about the allegations as of the time of this writing. However, the charges of fraud against the company and its CEO are very serious -- and should be taken seriously by investors. The SEC stated that a group led by Florida investor Barry Honig manipulated the prices of three microcap stocks from 2013 through 2018. They allegedly acquired large numbers of shares of the stocks at huge discounts, aggressively promoted those stocks to boost the share prices, then sold the shares to make big profits. Opko, by the way, is not a microcap stock. These charges came as Opko Health had begun to regain momentum this summer after the stock fell more than 40% earlier in the year. Last month, Opko reported improving financial results for the second quarter and strong prescription growth for its secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug Rayaldee. The positive momentum has now evaporated in light of the SEC's allegations. What happens for Opko ultimately comes down to whether or not the charges are proven. The company and its CEO are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. However, quite frankly, it can be a different story in the court of public opinion. Investors can probably expect a dark cloud to hang over Opko Health for a while. It's not likely that good news for Rayaldee or any of the company's other products will be enough to overcome the stigma of the SEC's allegations. My view is that Opko is a stock to avoid until more facts are known. Keith Speights has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Sara,Burns,1564,https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/in-fredericton-a-mourning-citys-hour-of-truce/,"Sep 7, 2018 Fredericton Police badge is seen during a police memorial parade in Ottawa Sunday September 26, 2010. (The Canadian Press Images/Francis Vachon) On Aug. 18, while the eyes of the nation were trained on the regimental funeral procession for two fallen Fredericton police officers, an extended family of motorcyclists had also assembled, the pistons of their Harley-Davidsons thundering as they rode out of the city in a parade of their own. The two ceremonies—one rich with the pomp and protocol of law enforcement; the other with the rites of groups known to offend the law—honoured the lives lost in what many describe as the worst crime to ever befall Fredericton. It was, to say the least, a study in contrasts. The seemingly random shooting deaths of Donnie Robichaud, a former member of the Bacchus Motorcycle Club, his girlfriend, Bobbie Lee Wright, and Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello forever changed the small capital city of 60,000 and erased the city’s mindset that it is immune to the gun violence that’s erupted in other, larger cities. “We grew up in a way that we didn’t want to grow up,” says Mike O’Brien, the city’s mayor. “We grew up overnight to all of a sudden be a bit warier, a bit more protective and suspect.” Fredericton is a city known for its white-collar gentility, slow pace of life and stately elms. Behind the church steeples and farmers’ markets, though, crime has been getting worse, according to Statistics Canada’s crime-severity index (CSI), which factors in both the number of crimes and their seriousness. Between 2016 and 2017, Fredericton’s severity measure jumped 17.1 per cent to 85.61, higher than Canada’s overall CSI of 72.87. The city’s violent crime index rose 30.4 per cent. READ MORE: Fredericton shooting: Bystanders recount the terror they witnessed It was just after 7 a.m. on the second Friday in August when gunshots reverberated outside the quad of low-income apartments on Brookside Drive. Wright, a 32-year-old home support worker, and her new boyfriend, Robichaud, 42, had been packing her car to go away for their first weekend together when they were gunned down in the parking lot. The call came into the city police station during a shift change. Costello, 45, a father and stepfather to four, was just coming on duty. Burns, a 43-year-old mother of three, was just finishing her shift. They hopped in a patrol car together and were the first on the scene. As they ran to assist, they were ambushed by bullets from a rifle pointed out the side window of a third-floor apartment. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, a resident of the top floor of the apartment complex, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths. The week of mourning that followed was striking, because the victims and those who remembered them represented the separate faces of New Brunswick’s capital. Just a year and a half ago, Robichaud had gotten out from under the thumb of Bacchus MC, an outlaw motorcycle club linked to the Hells Angels; in July, a Nova Scotia judge declared Bacchus a criminal organization. Robichaud was in the midst of sorting out his life and finding happiness when his life was cut short, said his friend Tony Pollock, who organized the memorial ride. (There is no indication that the shooting was linked to his association with the club.) “The man had walked on the dark side a little bit and he was trying to come back out of that,” says Pollock, who is not affiliated with any motorcycle club. “For this to go south the way it did, that upsets me more than anything else.” In the days that followed, the #FrederictonStrong hashtag became ubiquitous as the city put on a brave face. But at the regimental funeral, Fredericton Police Force Chief Leanne Fitch admitted the deaths of all four had “shaken us all to the core, here at home and across the country.” RELATED: Canada’s Most Dangerous Places 2018 One consolation many, including the mayor, are holding on to is how the tragedy has brought the community together, particularly the neighbours of Brookside Drive who normally kept to themselves, the near evangelical support shown for first responders, and the thousands who turned out to join hands around the St. John River. The sentiment seemed to ease some of the age-old antagonism that exists between police and bikers—at least temporarily. Pollock says he sat down with the RCMP for 5½ hours to create a plan to ensure the motorcycle ride in honour of Robichaud didn’t impinge on the regimental funeral parade. He says police were concerned about how many so-called “one-per-centers”—a term outlaw bikers use to describe themselves—might show up. “At the end of the day, it all boiled down to respect. We wanted to respect what they were doing, and we understood what they were doing and they basically wanted to keep an eye on us,” he says. “It worked out that they had a little lighter mood toward us at the end because they knew we were doing things the way they would like them done.” At about the same time as pallbearers carried the flag-draped caskets of Burns and Costello into the arena filled with thousands of police officers from across the country, the ride in honour of Robichaud was beginning. Just a few kilometres away, 87 bikers fired up their Harleys and rumbled along a road that follows the St. John River to the steel arches of the Burton Bridge, which was one of Robichaud’s favourite places to go. The ride culminated at the exhibition centre downtown for a benefit concert and live auction to raise money for Robichaud’s three children and one grandchild. People came by the hundreds throughout the afternoon and evening, and while the vast majority rode motorcycles, a fire truck full of City of Fredericton firefighters at one point dropped by to deliver a $600 gift. (The benefit raised $26,300 in total.) As is the norm, police officers attended covertly: four of them surveilling quietly in a group while bikers in leather jackets emblazoned with the black-and-yellow Bacchus patches smoked and socialized. But there was unprecedented sympathy for the police among members of Robichaud’s crowd, Pollock recalls. “It really struck home with me to hear these big, tough biker guys—I know how they work—say everybody deserves to go home at the end of the day,” he said. “It was kind of surprising.” As the overcast sky gradually darkened, the city raised all its flags back to full staff in recognition of the end of the regimental funeral. Around the same time, in the parking lot of the exhibition centre, the deafening rumble of a Harley-Davidson starting up turned heads and elicited cheers. “That’s a tribute to Donnie,” said Pollock. “He would do that in a parking lot. He’d just fire his bike up, rev it right to the limit and then shut it off.” We've sent an email with instructions to create a new password.

Jamie,Forese,1563,https://www.euromoney.com/article/b19vfp2bns0y1z/forese-aims-high-with-cib-rejig-at-citi,"We use Cookies. If you're happy with cookies, continue browsing. Get access to all our content – subscribe today | 30 day free trial COPYING AND DISTRIBUTING ARE PROHIBITED WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE PUBLISHER: CHUNT@EUROMONEY.COM Citi is mostly playing catch-up with its new corporate and investment banking (CIB) structure: it makes obvious sense, but despite coming later than many rivals it is still a work in progress. Jamie Forese, the head of Citi’s sprawling institutional clients group, this week elevated two of his key lieutenants to co-head a newly formed banking, capital markets and advisory (BCMA) division. The move, in which capital markets origination (CMO) head Tyler Dickson joins EMEA CIB head Manolo Falco at the top of the new unit, also sees global CIB head Ray McGuire shift to be chairman of BCMA, focusing on senior client relationships. In the pantheon of divisional reorganizations at banks, Citi’s latest change fits into the category of the entirely logical rather than the downright odd. There is little good reason these days to have capital markets split out from investment banking – doing so in fact goes against the way in which most big banks, including Citi, claim to approach clients. In a memo announcing the changes, Forese referenced the bank’s slogan to ‘be the best for our clients’. That gets a lot of airtime within Citi – CEO Mike Corbat even gives the phrase pride of place in the opening paragraph of the bank’s code of conduct. Jamie Forese Forese said that the alignment of capital raising and advisory offered by the new change would help the firm to achieve this. It’s not clear what has triggered this thinking specifically now: being the best for clients is, after all, not a new target for this bank or for any other. However, reconstruction is a difficult job: the tottering post-crisis Citi needed careful management focus on each constituent part if it was to rebuild. The firm’s scale – whether in product or geographic reach – was also in a different category to most rivals. That the bank is now in a position to be able to bring more pieces under one umbrella is a sign of progress, albeit progress that has – perhaps because of the firm’s size and complex legacy – taken longer at Citi than at some rivals. It’s also not clear whether the change is the result of detailed discussion or has been sprung as something of a surprise by Forese. Dickson and Falco are not yet in a position to disclose even the very next level of the structure of the combined division, let alone anything further down the chain. Both are now expected to take some time touring the global operation to establish where management resource is needed and how that should be organized. An indication of the significance of the move may well come from how that structure plays out. If Dickson and Falco dispense with regional BCMA roles below them on the basis that they are already in those regions, for instance, they could leave themselves open to the accusation that there is little substance to this shiny new co-ordinated approach. That said, it’s also the case that capital markets and investment banking have in many ways been integrated in all but name for at least a couple of years at Citi. Decisions around staffing and compensation have been made by McGuire and Dickson working together, for instance. And the big pieces have fallen happily into place for Forese. In Dickson and Falco, he has two proven executives who represent the mix of both businesses and have been in their current roles for a decade. And by opting for Falco over McGuire for the second co-head role, he also neatly balances the US and Europe. Giving him the freedom to do that is the fact that Dickson already has a formidable CMO ally in Europe in the shape of regional head Phil Drury, whom Dickson moved from the US in 2015 to shake up the European capital markets business. Dickson was already running a global business – he has been at the helm of CMO since it was formed in 2008 – so Falco’s looks like the bigger promotion. McGuire’s move opened the door for Falco’s elevation, which leaves Drury as the most obvious manager from the old structure for whom a senior role needs to be found. Citi’s latest move perhaps makes most sense when viewed as part of a longer continuum rather than something to be scrutinized too hard in isolation. In keeping with the post-crisis realization that banks had to be seen as less self-serving, Forese’s objective in institutional client services was to reconfigure the post-crisis Citi around what it could do for clients. ""When you look at our unique history, this move make sense,"" says Dickson. ""Prior to the financing crisis, Citi's collection of banking coverage and capital markets product resources were the result of series of complex mergers and acquisitions."" The creation of the institutional client services division at least brought all of those disparate CIB businesses together and instilled some sense of partnership, but the silo mentality that had grown up around the firm still needed to be changed. ""Given our scale, It naturally took time for each of these units to come together,"" adds Dickson. ""Our integration of the corporate bank and the investment bank has made our coverage more effective and our integration of ECM, DCM, levfin, structured finance and issuer services has allowed us to deliver better solutions."" A lot of the gelling of corporate and investment banking was done on Falco’s watch in Europe. Since the financial crisis, he has been one of the key players in transforming the bank’s coverage and advisory business in that region into a credible competitor. Much of the hard work was achieved in the days when he was jointly running the business with James Bardrick. They were different, but complementary: Falco an out-and-out client man; Bardrick, originally an engineer, was more of an operations manager. They ran EMEA investment banking together from 2009 until 2014, navigating the immediate post-crisis period when it was far from clear what Citi would be able to do for clients in big parts of its global network, let alone its home market. Bardrick has now been chief country officer for Citi’s UK business since 2014 and could be one of the candidates to replace Jim Cowles as EMEA chief executive after it was announced this week that Cowles was retiring from the bank. Bardrick will have one less rival for that role now that Falco has already been promoted. Cowles’s departure emerged alongside news that CFO John Gerspach will also be leaving the bank, as well as North America CEO Bill Mills. Coupled with the CIB changes, there is a sense of a firm preparing for its next stage. “We are a very large and complex firm, in some senses more complex than any of our competitors, so more alignment of our businesses makes a lot of sense,” says Falco. “When you have the assets that Citi has, putting them closer together helps to break down barriers and drive that logical focus on clients.” There is work to be done. It was in part Citi’s remarkable ability to respond to an environment of globally synchronized growth that helped secure it the accolade of World’s Best Investment Bank in Euromoney’s Awards for Excellence 2018. However, Dickson argues that to maintain that ability will require the firm to get better at collaboration in delivery of ideas and content – and in execution. ""As a result of progress over a decade after the financial crisis, Citi is one of the best banking, capital markets and securities firms on the Street,"" says Dickson. ""But Jamie is raising the bar for Ray, Manolo and me to take this firm from one of the best to the best and our new business unit will help us get there."" Earlier this year, Forese was telling Euromoney that Citi didn’t need to be spectacular or always beat its peers. “But we contend in everything that we do, and we contend in more areas than our competitors,” he said. That’s doubtless still the case, but Dickson and Falco certainly sound like men on a mission to bring another layer of focus to that objective. There will also be work to do in ensuring that while global growth and trade has been the bedrock of a firm with a network such as Citi’s, any disruption to that environment does not hurt the firm unduly. There are obvious areas to do that: first, lifting the all-round game. Citi is not yet in the top three in global M&A, as it should be given its combination of US heritage and global reach. It is inching up, however. It sat fifth for completed deals in 2017 – in the 12 months to September 2018 it is fourth. It is also fourth so far this year in global ECM, a business where Europe under Drury is improving well.It stands third in the region, and top in IPOs. In global DCM, the bank ranks top. “We need to aspire to be top three in every one of our products,” says Falco. “We need to align ourselves better on coverage if we want to cover the largest clients in the world.” Falco should know: as he notes, some 40% of the EMEA wallet each year comes from just 200 clients. And it was under him – and Cowles – that Citi finally broke into the top three in capital markets and M&A revenues in Europe in 2017. Dickson and Falco are reluctant to point to gaps as they consider their priorities in their new roles, but it’s clear that one area where they think they can add value in their new joined-up division is in spotting potential clients before others do – and they won’t come from where Citi has been used to finding them. “Historically, we have always naturally been more dominant with clients that are the most capital intensive, and when those sectors go through pockets of restructuring, that’s good for us,” says Dickson. “But when you see the world in a global growth paradigm shift like it is, when you see the disruption from certain players in tech and healthcare, you see major platinum clients for the bank today that didn’t even exist 10 years ago. That’s why we need to focus on identifying future winners.” To receive similar stories, sign up for Banking emails.

Gordon Jr., age 82, passed away Sunday, Sept. 2, 2018, after a long illness. He was born March 5, 1936, to Donald B. Gordon Sr. and Amy F.(Smith) Gordon, in Meredith, where he resided most of his life. In 1959, he was married to Lorraine Y. (Fortin) Gordon (predeceased) and enlisted in the U.S. Air Force until he was honorably discharged in 1963. Don retired from the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative where he worked for over 36 years. He was a lifelong member of the Meredith American Legion Post 33, a hunter safety instructor and an avid gun enthusiast. He loved hunting, snowmobiling and camping with his family and friends throughout the years. Although he was not a religious person, many will remember him for his “Sunday Church Services.” The more people he had at his home, the happier he was. As voiceful as Don was, he was challenged when he lost his voice to his disease; however, that didn’t stop him. He was introduced to Facebook, which he used to stay in touch with family and friends on a daily basis and continued to express his passion for life. Don was a loving, devoted father and friend who had an incredible infectious smile. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him. He is survived by his four children, Kevin Gordon of Corvallis, Montana, Donna (Gordon) (Sturgeon) Dunleavy of Moultonborough, Darlene (Gordon) (Leighton) Moore of Somersworth, and Michael Gordon of Meredith; two sisters, Beverly Pocock of Laconia and Cheryl Doyle of Bethel, Maine; and another sister, Margaret Scott (predeceased).

She was escorted by her 16-year-old son Duff Haffenreffer. “It happened!!!” she shared after the wedding on social media. “Best. Day. Ever.” Spencer, 49, carried a hand-tied bouquet that included white dahlias, freesia and garden roses. Spencer first met McVey after a mutual friend set them up on a blind date. McVey is the founder, chairman and CEO of MarketAxess, a publicly traded and successful financial technology company. He popped the question in January. This is the second marriage for both.

Jason,Hogg,1560,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/09/06/wealthy-investors-have-a-big-cybersecurity-problem/,"Copyright © 2018 ALM Media Properties, LLC. All Rights Reserved. Cybertheft is important to all investors, but especially to high-net-worth individuals who might have greater exposure, less knowledge and more endpoints of access for thieves, according to Aon’s Cyber Solutions CEO Jason J. Hogg. In fact, more than half of 664 high-net-worth respondents of a 2017 Aon online survey said they had either experienced a cybersecurity event or knew someone who had. Most interesting to Hogg was the survey found that 77% of respondents were concerned about risks posed to their finances by cybersecurity, and 78% were concerned about related issues on identity theft, numbers far above traditional financial worries such as market volatility (60%), or changing interest rates (39%). “People are more concerned about cybersecurity than they are with regard to their actual wealth,” Hogg told ThinkAdvisor. “That was incredibly telling and most resonating to me.” Be Proactive Despite the high levels of concern with cybertheft, 55% of those surveyed didn’t know about cyber insurance, and only 5% had a solution in place in case they were attacked. Instead, most relied on virus and malware protections. But that doesn’t go far enough, Hogg said. “Some tactical things people can do is making sure they have banking alerts set up so that if any type of financial transaction or activities [occur], they receive notification,” he said. He added that investors should work with credit bureaus to “lock up” their information. “Also, people do not take their password management as seriously as they should; they need to make sure they have multi-factor identification across all accounts, that’s critical,” Hogg said. “That’s something that is quite simple and is not taken advantage of … they are embedded in services [like Google], and there is the capability that people can turn them on.” From a home perspective, people need to separate their business from home networks, as well as business activities from guests, internet devices and even kids. The study found that only 31% of HNWIs use endpoint protection, and only 25% use identity protection services. “Often times, high-net-worth individuals have digital footprints akin to a small business,” Hogg said. “There’s a whole series of services and measures they can take, such as risk assessment, to understand where vulnerabilities are, and being proactive to close those vulnerabilities, whether it’s their home network or social media or passwords, for example.” He also recommends educating children to the ramifications of what they are doing on different devices, especially with the “proliferation in the past five years” of endpoints. These include the usual suspects, such as computers and smartphones, but now include Alexa-type products, cars and even some appliances. Parents also should “give guidance on what kids can and cannot share [on social media].” Further, at least one parent should monitor a child’s social media, and if they see the wrong type of behavior, change it, he said. Hogg wasn’t surprised that the survey found that a majority of respondents thought that banks, wealth management companies and credit card firms were the most “trustworthy” when it came to cybersecurity. “I’ve spent a good portion of my career in banking, payments and credit card industries, and it makes sense because when dealing with people’s money, that’s the first frontier of the cyberbattle … so as a result, they have been working the longest, ….[so have] best in class security measures and methods.” However, he does state that advisors, who he calls “nodes” as they handle so many clients, need to “take note of the responsibility they have in helping to play a role in securing their clients information and help in educating them with regard to best practices and what tools are available,” he said. — Related on ThinkAdvisor: Ginger Szala is executive managing editor of Investment Advisor magazine.

Profits rose to US$28.6mln (US$11.5mln), with the contribution from UBN accounting for most of the increase. Atlas Mara now owns close to 49% of the Nigerian bank, with a substantial reduction in its bad debts lifting UBN’s contribution to US$17.4mln. Elsewhere, appetite for loans in other African countries was subdued with the loan book declining to US$1.28bn and total income down 8.1% with some margin pressure. Diamond, chairman, said he was cautiously optimistic about the future even so and it had maintained a largely stable balance sheet over the first half of the year while weathering substantial macroeconomic challenges in some key markets. Atlas appointed John Staley as chief executive in May. Diamond set up Atlas Mara in 2013 and at that time UBN was its largest investment. In June, it upped its holding further after a US$200mln fund raise and subscription by Fairfax Africa. Diamond established Atlas Mara following his resignation as chief executive at Barclays following the scandal over the bank’s manipulation of Libor interest rates in 2012. Barclays was fined £59.5mln by the Financial Services Authority for rigging Libor and Euribor rates. In May last year, Diamond was part of a group that took control of old-school London stockbroker Panmure Gordon. Shares rose 2% to US$2.40.

Atlas Mara made a pre-tax profit of $36.1 million in the first six months of the year, up sharply from the the $16.8 million the Africa-focused banking industry investment business made in the same period in 2017. Profits were boosted largely by improved financial results from Union Bank of Nigeria, Atlas Mara’s largest investment. During the first half of the year, the company completed the acquisition of an additional stake in UBN, increasing its shareholding to 49 per cent.

That’s like asking if Alex Ferguson knows his way around Old Trafford. The 74-year-old Watford-born maestro may not have conducted this weird musical ritual for 18 years, but when he steps out into the balloons, streamers and flags festooning the Royal Albert Hall tomorrow it will be to preside over his 12th Last Night. Presumably, therefore, he doesn’t mind all those jingoistic ditties that end the concert. “Well, who on earth takes all that seriously?” he says. “Does anyone in 2018 actually think that Britannia rules the waves?” Perhaps Nigel Farage? “Ooh, no politics please!” Davis says with a giggle. “Actually, I’ve been out of the country so long that I have… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most.

The opening concert highlights the Orchestra through the music of Berlioz: the epic Symphonie Fantastique, and the lesser-known Fantasy on Shakespeare's The Tempest, featuring the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir. Both works will be recorded live by Chandos Records for future release. The program, which is repeated on September 21 and 22, also includes Variations concertantes by Canadian composer Jacques Hétu-a remarkable work that was commissioned and premièred by the TSO in 2006. Romantic Rachmaninoff (September 26 & 29): Superstar violinist Nicola Benedetti, praised as a ""powerhouse musician"" for her performance of Szymanowski's Violin Concerto with the TSO in 2017, returns with Prokofiev's spirited Violin Concerto No. 2, in a program of music by Ukrainian and Russian composers. Hailed in The Telegraph as ""an inspired architect"" with ""an energizing presence,"" Kirill Karabits, the Ukrainian-born Chief Conductor of England's Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, makes his TSO début. The September 29 evening includes a free pre-concert performance by The TSO Chamber Soloists at 6:45pm. Mahler Symphony 5 (October 3 & 4): Mahler's mighty Fifth Symphony charts a potent emotional arc from chilling darkness and thunderous despair to the blazing summit of joyous ecstasy. Making her TSO conducting début, Han-Na Chang (Artistic Leader and Chief Conductor of the Trondheim Symfoniorkester) is joined by the Spanish pianist Javier Perianes for Ravel's Concerto in G. Blue Suede Tunes (October 9 & 10): Kicking off this season's Pops Series, the charismatic vocalist Frankie Moreno, who has been named the Las Vegas Headliner of the Year three times, teams up with TSO Principal Pops Conductor Steven Reineke and the Orchestra for an electrifying retrospective for the ages, featuring the music of Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bobby Darin, Chuck Berry, and more golden-age rock 'n' rollers. Frankie Moreno is also a prolific and eclectic songwriter, and this program will include one of his songs, written for the legendary Ray Charles. Dvo?ák New World Symphony (October 13 & 14): For his TSO début, Uzbek conductor Aziz Shokhakimov leads the Orchestra in a performance of Dvo?ák's much-loved symphony, which the composer wrote while living in America. The work is a touching love letter to Dvo?ák's far-off homeland. Pianist George Li, winner of the Silver Medal at the 2015 International Tchaikovsky Competition, delivers Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini-a breathtaking showpiece for piano and orchestra. Beethoven's Overture to Fidelio and Symphonie minute, by Canadian composer José Evangelista, round out the program. Debussy La Mer (October 18 & 20): Danish conductor Thomas Søndergård returns to the TSO to lead a program that includes Debussy's majestic portrait of the sea in all its moods, and Poulenc's Les animaux modèles-a playful fairy-tale dance score. Latvian violinist Baiba Skride brings her artistry to Britten's stirring Violin Concerto, composed as the Second World War loomed. The concert opens with Dances from Powder Her Face-a work with powerful theatrical impact by British composer Thomas Adès. Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty (October 24, 25, 27 & 28*): Making her TSO début, brilliant Russian violinist Alina Ibragimova performs the exquisite Violin Concerto by Mendelssohn. Guest conductor Andrey Boreyko returns to the TSO stage for this program anchored by Tchaikovsky's sumptuous ballet score, Suite from The Sleeping Beauty. With its bright, airy textures and innocent, joyous mood, The Smile of Maud Lewis reflects the artistry of the celebrated Nova Scotia painter (1903-1970) who Canadian composer Nicolai Korndorf admired deeply. *Oct 28 at George Weston Recital Hall, Toronto Centre for the Arts The TSO Season Presenting Sponsor is BMO Financial Group.

Updated: November 14, 2018 @ 4:12 pm McDowell receiver Steven Webb pulls away from a defender after making a catch in last week's loss to Patton. The Titans (2-1) travel to Mitchell tonight (Friday) for their final non-conference game of the season. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell receiver Steven Webb pulls away from a defender after making a catch in last week's loss to Patton. The Titans (2-1) travel to Mitchell tonight (Friday) for their final non-conference game of the season. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. The McDowell Titans and Mitchell Mountaineers have played their share of thrillers against each other over the years. The last three have definitely not been among them. McDowell (2-1) travels to Ledger tonight (7:30) to meet a Mountaineers team that has had its way with the Titans the last three seasons and has taken seven of the last nine in the series. Mitchell (2-1) has undergone a gridiron renaissance of late, going 41-7 over the last three-plus campaigns. The 1A Mountaineers have taken the last three meetings with the 4A Titans by a combined score of 143-32. And although Mitchell may not be quite the powerhouse it has been over that time span, McDowell head coach Andy Morgan knows what kind of game his club will have to play in order to have a chance. “It’s going to be a physical game for sure,” said Morgan. “Mitchell is big on offense and defense and they do what they do very well. They will be fundamentally sound. We have to stop the run to have a chance. “We feel good about our game plan, but we have to execute and we can’t make mistakes. I always say, McDowell can’t beat McDowell. We’ve got to be good on special teams and we can’t turn it over.” One needs look no further than last Friday night for an example of what Morgan is talking about. The Titans out-gained the Patton Panthers 254-242, but gave them a short field four times – including two possessions that came off interception returns inside McDowell’s 10-yard line. The result was a 35-13 loss that should have been much closer. “We had a brutal film session Monday,” said Morgan. “And we’ve had good practices this week. I think the kids have put it behind them.” Despite last week’s loss, the Titans have been solid in almost every aspect of the game so far in 2018. McDowell has outscored its three foes 87-69 and outgained them 1,074-719 in total yards. The Titans have been especially effective throwing the ball. Senior quarterback Adam Randolph is 43-of-62 passing for 698 yards and seven touchdowns with three interceptions – two of which came on balls tipped at the line of scrimmage. Randolph has spread the wealth around, with three different receivers making at least nine catches, including Andruw Randolph (15 receptions, 235 yards, 3TDs), Dakota Effler (10-176-2TDs) and J.C. Olivo (9-163-2TDs). Senior Steven Webb returned last week after an offseason shoulder injury and caught five passes for 67 yards. On the other side of the football, senior linebackers Andrew Davis and Johan Ayala have been impressive. Davis (26 tackles, 2 TFL, 1 sack, 1 INT) and Ayala (24 tackles, 3 TFL, 1 sack) are 1-2 on the team in tackles. Defensive lineman Nick Ivy (20 tackles, 3 TFL, 1 sack) has also been busy. They’ll encounter some familiar names on the Mitchell roster. Junior quarterback Noah Pittman (5-10, 190), a former running back, moved under center after standout Ben Young, a four-year starter, graduated. The switch in positions hasn’t slowed down Pittman, who leads western N.C. in rushing (40-380-3TDs). As a running back last season, he ran for 184 yards and three scores on just 12 carries in a 49-19 win over the Titans. Senior Landon Miller (6-0, 205) has rushed for 274 yards and four scores on 42 attempts this season, and also leads Mitchell in tackles with 33 from his linebacker spot. Up front, the Mountaineers have five players in the 270-310 pound range. Junior Michael Robertson is the biggest at 6-foot-6, 305. Mitchell dropped its opener to Erwin 34-21, but has since bounced back to defeat Cannon School 27-6 and Trinity Academy 44-25. The Mountaineers really got their running game untracked against Trinity, going for 338 yards and five scores on the ground. Notes: This week marks the final non-conference outing of the year for the Titans…McDowell is idle next Friday and travels to Hickory for the Northwestern 3A/4A Conference opener Sept. 21…The Titans lost the services of junior running back/defensive back Kurtis Padgett, who suffered a torn ACL and will miss the rest of the season…Padgett is the second McDowell running back to go down with a season-ending knee injury.

Sara,Burns,1557,https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/09/05/matthew-vincent-raymond-charles-leblanc-fredericton_a_23518489/,"FREDERICTON — The Fredericton man who allegedly murdered four people last month in a shooting spree was captured on video criticizing Muslim immigration in a 2017 protest outside the provincial legislature. The seven-and-a-half minute interview with Matthew Raymond was filmed on June 3, 2017, by blogger Charles LeBlanc, who said Wednesday he only recently realized who he had spoken to. On the video, LeBlanc repeatedly questions the truth of various statements from the 48-year-old Raymond, and his tendency to rely on the internet as a source for his assertions. Raymond is alleged to have fired down upon four people from his apartment window with a long gun, killing two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip and two police officers who responded to the scene on Aug. 10. In the video, Raymond states that Muslim immigrants in St. John's, N.L., had successfully demanded the removal of a cross from a church, citing the internet as his source. The Canadian Press can find no record of a cross removal, though five years ago a high school removed a crucifix from the side of a building. A spokeswoman for the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District says the cross was removed during a renovation and wasn't reinstalled in 2013, ""given denominational education in Newfoundland and Labrador had ended in 1996."" ""The original complainant was a proponent of secular education. We have no information to indicate a complaint was made by anybody of the Muslim faith, or any other particular religious faith,"" wrote Cheryl Gullage. Charles LeBlanc/YouTube In a newly surfaced video, alleged Fredericton shooter Matthew Vincent Raymond tells interviewer Charles LeBlanc that media outlets are ""told be hush-hush"" about immigration. The footage was shot on June 3, 2017. In the video, Raymond bases his assertions on what's he gleaned from his memory of online searches. ""I've heard in St. John's they were told to take down the cross off a Catholic church. It's happening in Britain. It's happening worldwide,"" he said. When LeBlanc asked for his source, Raymond replies, ""the internet,"" but doesn't provide further details. Raymond goes on to assert that a ""whole group"" of Muslims are coming into the country and making demands. Pressed on the accuracy of his statement, Raymond shifts his position, saying, ""wherever that cross is, it has been removed."" Raymond was also wearing a sandwich board with statements opposing Sharia law and criticizing Motion 103 — a federal motion that condemned Islamophobia and passed in the House of Commons. LeBlanc grows frustrated with Raymond in the interview, and asks him if he had mental illness. Raymond replied that he did not. Andrew Vaughan/CANADIAN PRESS Matthew Vincent Raymond, charged with four counts of first degree murder, arrives at provincial court in Fredericton on Aug. 27, 2018. Former friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered varying memories of the accused murderer, ranging from a boy who retreated into video games, a pleasant supermarket co-worker and an increasingly isolated loner in recent years. Some business owners have described Raymond as becoming reclusive and occasionally unpleasant in the year before the alleged shootings. A bicycle shop owner said on several occasions he asked Raymond to leave the bike shop due to his behaviour. Raymond was frequently seen riding his fat-tire bicycle around the city. Darren Calabrese/Canadian Press Fredericton police officers salute the hearse carrying slain colleague Const. Sara Burns on Aug. 18, 2018. Brendan Doyle, owner of a now-defunct Fredericton cafe, has said that Raymond had been a long-time patron, coming in almost every day for eight years and staying an hour or two on the patio in the evenings. He'd called him a lonely person who would look at magazines about bikes and about guns, and who had to be asked to leave after disturbing other customers with anti-Islamic opinions.

Sara,Burns,1557,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/matthew-vincent-raymond-fredericton-1.4810464,"A new video has surfaced of Matthew Vincent Raymond, the man accused of firing the shots that killed two Fredericton police officers and two civilians on Aug. 10. Fredericton blogger Charles LeBlanc knew Raymond only as ""Matt"" and said he did not realize until a few days ago that he had recorded him last year. ""I almost fainted when I found out that Matt … was my street buddy that I would call,"" LeBlanc said. ""I couldn't believe it."" Raymond is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton constables Robb Costello, 45, and Sara Burns, 43, and civilians Donnie Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. On June 3, 2017, Raymond drew LeBlanc's attention because he was wearing a sandwich board in front of the New Brunswick Legislative Building, protesting the recently passed motion known as M-103, which calls for a national action plan against racism, including Islamophobia. His sandwich board read ""No Sharia-law."" ""He was just standing there by the legislature and then he gave me his views,"" LeBlanc said. ""He had lots to say about his beliefs of how the Muslim world and the immigrants are going to destroy Canada in his views."" The video spans seven and a half minutes, and in it LeBlanc challenges Raymond by asking where he got his news, and whether he was on any drugs. Raymond says he gets his news from ""the Internet."" ""Duh, where? Where from? Are you afraid to say where from? What made you so upset?"" LeBlanc says in the video. To which Raymond replies: ""I don't go with every bit of info. They talk about the borders and stuff. And they talk about it on Rebel Media."" Raymond also says media outlets are ""told be hush-hush"" about issues of immigration. When LeBlanc asks if Raymond is ""paranoid,"" he says no. When he asks if he has mental illness, he says no. When LeBlanc asks him if he's smoking marijuana, Raymond says ""[Justin] Trudeau has, so yeah, there you go."" About a week before the shooting, LeBlanc said he saw Raymond at a local coffee shop where ""lately he would just sit down and just focus straight ahead, he didn't move for about an hour."" ""He was not moving at all. I took a picture and he never even smiled. So I crossed the street and said, 'Hey, how are you doing? Are you still paranoid?' And I showed him the picture, and he asked me to delete it, and that's what I did."" LeBlanc said from what he could tell, a man he simply knew as Matt seemed changed. ""There, in that video, he was laughing, he was talking away. But when I saw him a week before the tragedy, when I was talking to him and took his picture, I'm telling you, this guy was different.""

Michael,Gordon,1556,https://www.marinij.com/2018/09/06/fbi-raids-fairfax-home-in-3-d-gun-printing-case/,"Trending: A Fairfax man was arrested in an FBI raid Thursday to face an indictment on assault weapons charges. Related Articles FBI raids Fairfax home in weapons case Michael Christian Gordon, 47, is charged with manufacturing and possessing an AR-15 rifle with a 10.5-inch barrel and no serial number. He is being prosecuted in federal court in San Francisco. The case stemmed from a traffic stop by the California Highway Patrol on July 29. A tipster called authorities to report a potential drunken driver on southbound Highway 101, and the CHP stopped the car near Marin City. While taking an inventory of the car prior to having it towed, police found an illegal assault weapon inside, said CHP Officer Andrew Barclay. Police notified federal authorities. Gordon allegedly told police he made the weapon at home, said Fairfax police Chief Christopher Morin. At about 6 a.m. Thursday, the FBI executed the warrant at Gordon’s property on Tamalpais Road in a raid involving more than a dozen investigators, Morin said. Developments from court on Thursday were unavailable and it was unclear whether Gordon was released pending further hearings. Sign up for email newsletters

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev Ittycheria Thanks, Brian. Thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our second quarter results. We are incredibly pleased with our second quarter performance, which reflects the positive impact the investments in our product and go-to-market efforts are having on the business. To quickly summarize our second quarter results, we generated revenue of 57.5 million, a 61% year-over-year increase, which was above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenues 63% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with over 7,400 customers, up 72% compared to a year ago. We saw strong growth across all major regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia. Atlas revenue grew more than 400% year-over-year and now represents 18% of revenue and we raised 254 million in net proceeds from our successful convertible notes offering. Our second quarter results further demonstrate MongoDB's clear leadership as the modern database platform of the future. Customers recognize that MongoDB offers the best way to work with data, to put data intelligently where it's needed and to allow customers to run applications anywhere. The MongoDB platform offers sophisticated ways to manage data and we are extending that further with the introduction of Global Clusters and MongoDB Atlas. This groundbreaking technology allows customers to easily create policies to strategically distribute data closer to their users for low latency of read and write operations. In addition, with this feature, customers can easily comply with the ever-changing and increasingly demanding regulatory environment for managing data like Europe's new GDPR rules. This is a big competitive differentiator for us, as it is incredibly challenging, if not impossible for companies to orchestrate these types of sophisticated data policies with legacy databases. Our ability to address these types of complex data problems is a significant driver in the increasingly strategic nature of our conversations with customers. Turning to second quarter results in more detail. We again saw a healthy mix of new logo wins and strong upsell activity, both of which included customers migrating existing workloads from legacy databases to MongoDB. Our performance in the second quarter exemplified the power of our land, expand and expand model and our multiple vectors of growth. During the second quarter, we added a number of new enterprise customers including Canon USA, Coinbase, Monotone [ph] International, IPC Systems, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Service New South Wales. We also expanded our relationship with customers such as Apervita, Cisco, Fresenius Medical Care North America, HSBC, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Partnership, Squarespace, the Bank of Nova Scotia and Click Deck [ph]. As we expand the functionality of the MongoDB platform and build deeper relationships with our customers, we are seeing those customers turn to MongoDB to support an ever increasing variety of use cases. Coinbase, a leading global digital currency wallet and platform, made a strategic decision to build its business on MongoDB, in order to rapidly develop its capabilities and fuel the growth and scale necessary to be the market share leader in the hypercompetitive cryptocurrency exchange industry. The company continues to invest in MongoDB to extend its platform, better handle traffic spikes at peak trading hours and to serve a growing global customer base. Squarespace, one of the largest SaaS based website building and hosting platforms, chose MongoDB as the standard for its core website platform. This is a great example of an innovative company, building an integral part of its business on top of MongoDB. Medable, a platform enabling users to build hipaa-compliant applications and services was recently approved by the FDA to collect and analyze data from clinical trials, has built their system on MongoDB. Due to the nature of the data managed, Medable relies heavily on MongoDB's robust security features and flexible data model to rapidly add features and make schema changes to serve the needs of their business. Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the largest sports and entertainment company in Canada and owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Raptors, Argonauts and Toronto FC, needed to consolidate customer information that was spread across more than five different sources into one holistic view. The lack of a unified customer repository was leading to inefficiencies, lost revenue and the potential for missed customer service opportunities for MLSE. They chose MongoDB, due to our proven track record with other large entertainment companies and our ability to support their cloud first mandate. HSBC, a longtime MongoDB customer, once again expanded its relationship with us as it continues on the path of its digital revolution. Embracing a board level directive to use technology that makes its operations simpler, better and faster, HSBC is migrating several trading app platforms from relational databases to MongoDB in order to simplify, migrate and manage complex financial data transactions. Hancom, a Korean provider of office productivity tools, is using MongoDB as a core component of its ThinkFree Office Online Suite. The company needed the scalability and flexibility of MongoDB to support its micro services architecture with a low total cost of ownership to address their key strategic priority of offering a cloud-native version of ThinkFree. Turning to Atlas, we saw a large number of new customer wins during the quarter as well as better than expected usage from a number of existing customers. Atlas now represents 18% of revenue versus 5% a year ago and 14% last quarter. In two years, Atlas has scaled from zero to 40 million revenue run rate and generated more than 400% growth over the past year. In addition to offering lower operating costs and improved development velocity, a key attribute of Atlas is that it provides elastic capacity for customers when they experience spikes in usage for their applications. There is a particularly strong product market fit for Atlas with customers who have a cloud-first strategy, which enables our sales reps to sign more deals, bigger deals and quicker up sales within this market segment, which all contribute to meaningful productivity increases. FTD Companies, a premier floral and gifting company, is leveraging MongoDB Atlas as part of its digital transformation initiatives. Specifically, FTD is using -- utilizing Atlas to deliver new experiences for its customers and network of member florists, provide true omni-channel customer service, while also beginning the process of moving to a cloud infrastructure. During the quarter, we introduced many of the premium features of Enterprise Advanced into Atlas, including sophisticated new security features like encryption and key management, LDAP integration and database auditing. We also introduced a secure Atlas environment for healthcare customers that is fully hipaa compliant. Apervita, a leading healthcare cloud analytics platform serving over 1,200 hospitals, expanded its use of MongoDB after Atlas became hipaa compliant. By leveraging the complex data to create predictive models, the company helps healthcare professionals deliver more effective care. MongoDB powers the Apervita platform, massively simplifying the process of connecting health data to analytics. By providing the scale and robustness required for real-time big data environment, clinicians have the ability to run analytics, sending algorithms against patient data and deliver improved clinical outcomes. We expect the introduction of enterprise features in Atlas to be a catalyst for our sales organization. With enterprise features, Atlas can now serve the needs of the most demanding and sophisticated customers who want to consume MongoDB as a service. Royal Caribbean, one of the world's largest cruise lines, chose MongoDB Atlas to optimize the cruise search application on its e-commerce platform to increase revenue and reduce churn. One of the exciting aspects of this win is that it was driven by the e-commerce team inside Royal Caribbean's marketing organization, who within three months went from having zero MongoDB experience to launching a mission critical application on Atlas. While our second quarter results were impressive, we are not standing still. We continue to invest in our platform to push the innovation -- push the pace of innovation and deliver even greater value for our customers. During the quarter, we hosted our Annual User Conference, MongoDB World in New York. More than 2,000 developers, customers, partners and investors experienced a day of product introductions, training, customer testimonials and most importantly, shared ideas and best practices among the MongoDB community. The highlight of the event was the formal introduction of MongoDB 4.0. As we have discussed in the past, 4.0 includes multi-document asset transactions, which combines the speed, flexibility and power of the document model with ACID guarantees. ACID is having a positive impact in our conversations with prospective and existing customers by enabling a greater number of discussions about the strategic role that MongoDB can play in their digital transformation initiatives. MongoDB 4.0 included far more than ACID transactions. I would like to call out a few of the highlights. Stitch, our new serverless platform, is now generally available. Stitch makes it easy to build modern cross platform applications on MongoDB without developers having to do the tedious work of managing the back end of an application. With Stitch, the app server is no longer required and developers can use the MongoDB query language directly from front end code as well as to connect to third-party services. Stitch will dramatically increase the velocity of development, while allowing teams to focus on only value-added code. We announced the beta of MongoDB Mobile, which will extend the power of MongoDB all the way to the network edge on IoT assets, as well as iOS and Android devices. MongoDB Mobile enables real time automatic syncing of data between the device and the back-end database, which will significantly enhance development velocity and application performance. To support our mission of giving customers the freedom to take advantage of an on-premise hybrid and public cloud infrastructure, we have also introduced a new MongoDB Kubernetes operator in beta. This solution will support provisioning and orchestration of MongoDB within a Kubernetes environment. We are incredibly proud of the innovations introduced in MongoDB 4.0 and we believe it will significantly raise the bar for the value we deliver to customers. With 4.0 successfully launch and generating significant customer interest, our engineering team is already hard at work, executing on the robust product road map we have laid out for the coming years. To summarize, we delivered terrific results in the second quarter. We are executing well across all aspects of the business and we're seeing strong returns on the product and go-to-market investments we are making. We are in the early stages of disrupting one of the largest markets in technology and our position continues to strengthen with each passing quarter. With that, let me now turn the call over to Michael to review the financial results. Michael Gordon Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance and it was our fourth strong quarter as a public company. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019. Total revenue in the quarter was 57.5 million, up 61% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was 52.9 million, up 63% year-over-year and professional services revenue was 4.6 million, up 48% year-over-year. In addition to our strong net customer acquisitions and expansion activity, we also recognized approximately $1.5 million of revenue that we had not anticipated during the second quarter. This was primarily due to a greater contribution to revenue from new contracts signed in the quarter, as well as the favorable impact related to bundled services subscriptions. Recall, when we sell software and services on a bundled basis, we do not begin recognizing subscription revenue from customers until the delivery of services has commenced. In Q2, this led us to start recognizing revenue from these customers in the second quarter versus our expectation that they would begin in the third quarter. The second quarter was also another strong quarter for MongoDB Atlas. Atlas represented 18% of revenue during the quarter, up from 5% in the year-ago period and 14% last quarter. During the quarter, we experienced some large Atlas wins, a few of which generated additional revenue as a result of testing, launching or migrating their applications. This reflects the elastic nature of cloud-related workloads and serves as a reminder that customers can have periods of elevated or reduced usage based on customer specific factors, including the application's lifecycle. We continue to see strong global demand for our offerings. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 800 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 7,400 customers, which is up from over 4,300 customers in the year-ago period and over 6,600 customers at the end of last quarter. Of our total customer count, over 1,600 are direct sales customers which compares to over 1,550 at the end of the prior quarter and over 1,350 in the year-ago period. The growth at our total customer count is driven largely in part by Atlas, which had over 5,300 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 4,400 customers at the end of the first quarter. The growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers, and it's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects both new customers to MongoDB as well as existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from our existing customers. Our net AR expansion rate in the second quarter remained above 120% for the 14th consecutive quarter. We ended the quarter with 438 customers with at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue and annualized MRR, which is up from 394 in the first quarter and 296 in the year ago period. Driving expanded adoption and spend among existing customers is a key component of our growth strategy and has been a consistent area of success. Even among our largest customers today, we believe MongoDB comprises a small fraction of their total database spend, which represents a large and attractive growth opportunity for us over time. Moving down the P&L. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $41.8 million, representing a gross margin of 73%, which was slightly better than the year ago period. We are pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter, particularly in light of Atlas's growth. Atlas includes the underlying infrastructure and our success in reducing the infrastructure costs related to Atlas have resulted in improved Atlas gross margins. We have now begun to introduce the premium Enterprise Advanced features into Atlas, starting with advanced security and we expect this will be an incremental benefit to revenue and gross margins going forward. We still anticipate Atlas will be a modest headwind to gross margins overall, but we are tracking well relative to our original expectations. Our operating loss was 21.6 million or negative 38% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 60% margin in the year ago period. The more than 2,000 basis point improvement in operating margin reflects the benefits of our increased scale, while we invest in the continued growth of the business. Net loss in the second quarter was 21.1 million or $0.41 a share based on 51.2 million average weighted shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $523.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. The increase in our cash balance reflects the 254 million of net proceeds from our successful convertible notes offering in June. These notes are due in 2024 and have a coupon of 75 basis points. We entered into capped call transactions that raised the effective conversion price of the notes to $106.90, a 100% premium to our share price at the time of the transaction. This was an opportunistic financing to raise additional capital at advantageous terms. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative 16.9 million. After taking into consideration approximately $1.2 million in capital expenditures, free cash flow is negative 18 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the low point in the year for operating cash flow, due to seasonally low collections and the second quarter is usually our heaviest investment in marketing events like MongoDB World. In addition, in the second quarter, we began to incur capital expenditures associated with our New York City office move, and we expect to see capital expenditures in elevated levels in the third quarter as a result. Short-term deferred revenue was 125.5 million, up 44% year-over-year, while total deferred revenue of 145.8 million was up 38% year-over-year. We believe longer-term trends in deferred revenue are directionally correlated to the underlying momentum of our business. That said, as Atlas continues to become a larger portion of our business, it is important to appreciate that it is a usage based model and does not generate meaningful deferred revenue. Also as a reminder, Atlas is often billed monthly in arrears versus the annual and advanced billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. Lastly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to the timing of events that may occur. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019. Beginning with the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $59 million to $60 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of negative $21 million to negative $20 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $0.40 to negative $0.38 a share based on 52.3 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full year fiscal 2019, we are raising our revenue outlook to 228 million to 230 million. We are reiterating our non-GAAP loss from operations, is expected to be in the range of negative $84 million to negative $82 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of negative $1.66 to $1.62 per share based on 51.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our increased revenue guidance reflects strong underlying trends in the business and given the high ROI investment landscape we see, we've maintained our full year outlook for non-GAAP loss from operations. Please note that our updated outlook reflects approximately $1.5 million of incremental public company expenses in the second half of the year, in part driven by the anticipated loss of our emerging growth company status under the Jobs Act. In closing, MongoDB delivered a strong second quarter performance and we're well positioned as we enter the second half of fiscal 2019. The company is performing well at a high level and we are pleased with the attractive returns we are generating from our investments and the resulting growth. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We’ll hear first from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow Hey, congrats from my side. Two questions on Atlas, if I may. First, Dev, can you talk a little bit about the partnerships and what they are bringing to the table that you're seeing around Atlas distribution around AWS and IBM. I know IBM is a little bit early, but just what has been the reception there. And what's AWS doing to help you? That's my first question. Dev Ittycheria Sure. So just to be clear, so with regards to IBM, our relationship with IBM today does not include Atlas. And so it is designed for our on-prem enterprise advanced product. In terms of AWS, well, AWS has really helped on the demand fulfillment side, because customers can choose to procure Atlas to their marketplace program and so what it allows a customer to do is really reduce the friction in the process of basically procuring Atlas when they decide that MongoDB is a preferred choice. We also do obviously participate in a number of AWS Summits around the world. Obviously, they tend to bring lots of people, especially developers to these conferences and we view that as an opportunity to basically speak about what we're doing with MongoDB and Atlas in particular. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. And then the next one on Atlas is, if you think about the -- now that you have -- trying to have the enterprise features available, how do you -- what are the first examples in terms of how people are going to adopt? Is this kind of going to be like a lot of test and development initially or are people kind of quickly moving over and using it? Can you just kind of give us a little bit of feedback how you see that? Dev Ittycheria Yeah. I think -- so the enterprise features in Atlas are just allowing us to go after it, even workloads that have very strict, for example, security requirements. With the new features we have in Atlas, like enterprise key management, customers can bring their own keys and have comfort that no one else can see their data. We allow integration to LDAP. We allow you to do very sophisticated auditing of the database. So for those customers who have those extra level of security requirements, it really enables them to feel very comfortable of moving their workloads to the cloud on Atlas. And so it really expands the, what I'd say, the addressable market of Atlas, and allows customers to just be more and more comfortable of going to the cloud, using MongoDB Atlas. Operator We’ll hear next from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Sanjit Singh Thank you for taking the questions. Congrats on the accelerating growth trends of this quarter. I wanted to follow up on Raimo's question. I'm just trying to talking about the enterprise opportunity, not just with Atlas, but given a multi-document ACID support, you're rolling out Global clusters. Could you help -- Dev, can you help us understand like where does a customer lean more towards Enterprise Advanced versus Atlas. And what is your sort of view on how enterprise adoption is going to unfold throughout the balance of the year versus your commercial business? Dev Ittycheria Yes. So, our strategy, one of the key differentiating points about MongoDB is really give customers the freedom to run their workloads anywhere. And today, we have customers who run MongoDB on the mainframe. We have customers -- we have lots of customers who run it on-premise and as you can obviously see with the Atlas results, we have lots of customers who are now consuming MongoDB as a service. I should also say we also have lots of customers who buy Enterprise Advanced, but self-manage it in the cloud as well. So, we literally run the gamut of all the variety of options and we just believe that it's important to give customers choice. Every customer is at a different stage in their journey to the cloud. We have lots of government agencies, who are very, very careful and frankly cannot use the public cloud infrastructure today. We have lots of financial services customers, who for regulatory reasons, cannot use the public cloud today and so, we address their needs through our capabilities on-prem, and then we have lots of other customers even large enterprises to emerging startups, who are moving either select workloads or the entire business to the cloud, and having that choice really allows us to serve in a wide spectrum of needs. In terms of directionally, we clearly see everyone is on some journey to the cloud. So, we see the cloud becoming an increasingly important part of the business for MongoDB. Obviously, the Atlas results speak for themselves. The other advantage I think that we give customers is not just freedom to run the cloud, but to run on any cloud provider. And so, one of the things that we hear and we see a lot of enterprises do now is try and work with multiple cloud providers. They may have a primary and then a secondary, and the comfort they have going with MongoDB is that it's very easy to move applications from one cloud provider to another cloud provider. So, they don't have to worry about being locked into any one particular cloud. So, that's another big advantage of using MongoDB. Sanjit Singh I appreciate the answer. Maybe a follow-up question and sort of thinking down the road in terms of serverless. I know on Stitch, you guys are rolling out Stitch as well. But just, maybe more higher level, what does serverless, as customers gravitate more towards serverless computing methods, what do you see as sort of the impact on the business in terms of the demand for database services from MongoDB’s perspective? Dev Ittycheria Yes. I mean, the company was basically founded to make a developer’s life really easy. To really let developers and organizations move very, very quickly and being able to develop applications that drive the business. And what basically serverless does for us is that it really allows developers to avoid all the mundane and tedious back end work that they normally have to do and basically only focus on value-added coding. And that becomes really, really important, because as customers and specifically developers think about what platform to use, they'll naturally gravitate to platforms and make their lives significantly easier. So MongoDB's popularity was driven by the fact that the document model and our approach just makes a developer’s life so much easier by giving them a very easy way to work with data, by making it very easy to move and put data where you want it from a scalability, reliability, availability point of view, and Stitch just takes that next level where they can basically not have to deal with all of the backend TDM work they have to do to build any web or mobile app. And so what Stitch does is allow you, for example, to essentially expose the power of a database through front-end code where you can basically create a database from the client side. It allows you to easily integrate to third party services whether it’s a payment service like Stripe or a notification like Twilio or even a third party service, an internal third party service that you may have. With Stitch now, you can use Stitch to sync data between your mobile device with MongoDB Mobile to the back end. And there's even things like with triggers or what used to announce previously with change streams, you can now easily enable the ability to take action on events or changes in your database. So when you think about where the world is going, JSON is becoming the synonymous with the word modern applications. MongoDB is the pre-eminent JSON database and Stitch basically, you should think about Stitch as really the lubricant that allows people to move very, very quickly and faster in building applications. Operator We’ll hear now from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Hi, great. I had a few questions if you will. I wanted to follow-up on what you were talking about with Stitch and talking about serverless. I was just wondering if you could give any color on how you are seeing people to deploy applications, kind of momentum between serverless and containers, if you can just give us your take. And then also I wanted to ask a little bit about NoSQL competitive landscape and just see how you would kind of stack things up right now and kind of the breadth of your product offering and how it stacks up versus the competitive universe, if you’ve noticed any changes in you guys pulling ahead of the competition. Dev Ittycheria Yes. Sure. So I want to just clarify. So containers, basically, the world is moving to containers because it's just an easy way to manage infrastructure. Kubernetes has become the de facto platform that everyone is gravitating to. There were a few other options a few years ago, but Kubernetes has become the standard. What we have done is basically create an operator for Kubernetes where people from the Kubernetes platform can basically manage provisioning and orchestrating and basically migrating databases on a kind of a containerized environment. So, that makes -- so customers are incredibly excited about that, because as people move to containers, it becomes as easy to manage MongoDB, because we support those containerized environments. Stitch is all about enabling developers to basically become much more productive and move much more quickly in building applications. Everyone is under pressure to try and increase the development velocity of the development teams and the way you can do that is by giving them a very modern platform that allows them to build applications quickly, to add features quickly, and to basically reduce the need to do a lot of what developers consider a lot of mundane and tedious tasks. And so, for example, with Stitch, you don't have to use an app server anymore because typically the app server is where you program the application logic. Now, you can do that from front end code where the intelligence moves to the client side and basically, query the database and basically eliminate the need for that middle tier. So, that makes a developer’s life very easy. Plus invariably, as you move to a micro services architecture, there may be third-party services or internal services you want to integrate to. Stitch makes that incredibly easy. There may be things that you want to do when like those changes happening to your database. For example, I'll use example where like say you're an airline company and you decide to move the flight from New York to Phoenix, from one gate to another, when that database event happens, you can automatically generate a trigger that sends a notification to everyone's mobile app saying, this gate has changed. Today, it's done on a pull notification. Now, you can push those notifications out. So, these are all things that if you didn't have Stitch would make a developer’s life a lot more complicated and they have to spend a lot more time coding these applications. Stitch allows developers to really abstract all that mundane work and really focus on value added development. Heather Bellini Right. And then just the competitive tier kind of with all this that you're putting out there, have you noticed a widening in your weed? Any comments on kind of the competitive universe that you could share? Dev Ittycheria Yes, I mean, we do not frankly see other NoSQL vendors in deals anymore. I mean, I'm sure that they're getting deals, but we frankly see them less and less. I can't remember the last time, I had a sales rep complain to me about a competitive situation with another NoSQL competitor. I think it's become clear to everyone that we have become the de facto leader in the modern database space and now customers are just contemplating what workload should they move to the cloud and what new app should they build on MongoDB. And that's where our salespeople are spending the most time. Operator From Stifel, we’ll hear from Brad Reback. Brad Reback Great. Thanks very much. Dev, the last few quarters, I think the last three in a row, you batted about a 1,000 average customers sequentially. Should we think about that as the sustainable rate going forward or is there an opportunity to step that up? Dev Ittycheria Again, there's two parts to our Atlas business. It's our self-serve business and our sales-force [ph] business. Our self-serve business, we started first and we got a lot of traction very, very quickly. And for the last, I would say, year, have been really focused on enabling our sales force to drive Atlas deals and those deals tend to be significantly bigger than the self-serve deals. And so we're seeing -- we've seen material progress and growth on the sales side. I think you're going to see us continue to invest and innovate on both sides of the business. We think the self-serve channel is a very unique channel for us. It's basically servicing the long tail of our business, especially in markets that we don't necessarily have a presence in. And so you'll see us and we already are investing even more aggressively in our self-serve business. So you are going to see us invest in both parts of the business. But I think what we're really pleased with today is just the uptake on the sales side where we're seeing material contribution and bigger and bigger deals, deals happening more quickly and quicker up sales from the sales organization, which we're very happy about. Brad Reback And then maybe one quick follow up. As you think about your future acquisition strategy, given the recent capital raise, are there any real pressing needs or will it be very much a tactical type of execution going forward? Dev Ittycheria Yeah, we really consider the ability to raise capital last quarter as really opportunistic. We didn't have any kind of near term kind of needs to use that cap -- deploy the capital for either M&A or any other kind of operational needs. We just found, saw an opportunity to raise a lot of cheap capital. It clearly allows us to be more aggressive, should the opportunity arise. But right now, we have no near-term pressing needs to use that capital. Operator [Operator Instructions] We’ll hear now from Jack Andrews with Needham. Jack Andrews Dev, on the last earnings call, you talked about -- you referenced some 20 plus conversations you were having with C level executives in terms of just the increasing strategic importance of MongoDB. I was wondering if you could kind of update us on the amount of conversations you're having and just what is the -- where are those conversations leading today? Dev Ittycheria I would say that those conversations are frankly increasing. We have changed our sales methodology, where we're asking our sales people once they do sufficient kind of homework on an account to go high in the implementation as quickly possible for a number of reasons. One, to qualify where the real demand and interest is in kind of potentially using MongoDB. Two, to kind of educate those senior level stakeholders on our differentiation and value proposition. And three, to basically increase the velocity of business, even if you get a deal, if you have the air cover, it's much easier to go and ask for the follow-on deal because the senior level stakeholders are now fully aware of the value we can add. So, now, we've changed our engagement model where we’ve kind of institutionalized that where we try and get high very early in the sales process and that's starting to pay big dividends for us. Jack Andrews And then just as a follow-up, could you update us in terms of how you're thinking about the mainframe modernization opportunity in particular? I mean, what's the sense of urgency from customers around mainframe based applications? Dev Ittycheria Yeah, I mean, so it really varies. As I said, we do have some customers who are happily running the mainframes and want to run MongoDB, because at some point in time, they do recognize that there's a certain half-life to their mainframe real estate and so they want to potentially migrate their applications, while running on the mainframe, but then have an easy glide path to a more modern, compute environment, whether it's on-prem or in the cloud. That's point number one. Point number two, we do see, in many situations where the use cases or the changing nature of their needs of the business is requiring them to consider offloading workloads from the mainframe to a more modern kind of computing architecture. And that's where customers are very interested. We have lots of proof points, where we have customers, large banks, large tech companies, service companies and so forth who are moving workloads off the mainframe on to MongoDB. And so, what we try and figure out is what is the problem of the pain that customers are having, whether it's a cost problem, because the mix utilization on the mainframe is getting too high, whether it's a performance problem because they can't really address the needs of the users and then, we will then obviously work with them and help them think through all the available options. And so, the mainframe offload use case is a very popular one in our sales force, but there are as many others as well. So, it's really depending on what's going on in that particular account. Operator We’ll hear next from Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc. Brent Bracelin Thanks for taking the question. Dev, maybe for you, I wanted to go back to the quarter. If I look at just the revenue growth, 61% growth is the highest we've seen here in two years, on a sequential basis, 19% growth is the highest we've seen also on record here in the last couple of years. So my question is why now? Why are you seeing this acceleration in the business? Is it a confluence of internal factors that are driving it, even if I look at the MongoDB business, ex Atlas, it also accelerated? So walk us through why you think this is happening? How much of it is kind of company-specific things you're doing internally versus just the external factors and the market being kind of ready for a more modern database? Dev Ittycheria Thank you. So we do feel good about our position. We do feel good that every quarter we're getting more and more credible with customers and being really the default modern database for all the use cases. We do feel like, we as an organization are executing better. We're getting -- the efficacy of our go-to-market efforts are just getting better. We are expanding to different regions. We also think the product road map and product execution has been incredibly strong, and so we feel very good about, not just the core product, but obviously Atlas has grown really, really quickly. We've added new features and capabilities. We’ve rolled out new products like Stitch and Mobile. So we feel like it's not one thing. I would also say and Michael talked a little about this in his prepared remarks, there were some one-time events that happened, I would say, in Q2 that we just didn't expect. So I wouldn't want you to extrapolate that this is the new normal. But we obviously feel very good about the state of the business and the trajectory of the business. Brent Bracelin And then as a follow-up for Michael. Maybe if I look at the gross margin profile here, I guess it's a little surprising that you're able to kind of hold the gross margins even with the strength that you're seeing in Atlas. So can you just walk us through with that material mix shift to Atlas, how you're able to kind of sustain the gross margin profile here. Michael Gordon Yes, sure. So as I mentioned earlier, we've made very good progress on the Atlas gross margins, relative to our expectations and we're tracking well ahead of plan in terms of gross margins. Atlas's still lower gross margin than the balance of the business. And so we still have plenty of levers to flip or turn and dials to adjust. On the business, we mentioned that the first thing that we had done which we'd said we'd do by the end of the year is we've introduced some of the premium features and Enterprise Advanced, meaning principally the advanced security features into availability in Atlas. We've not yet seen the benefit of that, because we only just introduced that. But over time, that should be very accretive both from a revenue perspective as well as from a gross margin perspective. And there are some internal cost optimizations that are also available to us. So, I think the short answer is, we've had very strong execution relative to our kind of margin game plan for Atlas, but we've got more work that we want to do on that front, but we're very pleased with the progress to-date. Operator And from JMP Securities, we’ll hear from Pat Walravens. Pat Walravens Okay. Thanks. And let me add my -- Dev Ittycheria I think we lost you, Pat. Pat, are you still there? Operator, I think we may have lost Pat. Operator Okay. We’ll move on to Brian White with Monness, Crespi. Brian White Dev, I'm wondering how we should think about competition from the leading public cloud vendors? They both had conferences over the summer. Database was a major focus, a lot of new innovations and I know Google was playing up the Cloud Firestore NoSQL database, and they did an update recently. So, maybe if you could just give us some color on how we should think about these big competitors? Dev Ittycheria Yes. Obviously, we have great relationships with the cloud providers themselves. They're the ones -- just to remind you, they're the ones who help fund development of Atlas onto their particular cloud platforms. They did so, because it saw the amount of MongoDB usage on their specific clouds. I think the second thing I would say is that one of the things that's always been a strength of MongoDB is the developer mind share that we've had and the popularity of the platform. And so, I would say that doesn't happen overnight and we've been shipping product for over 10 years now -- almost 10 years now and so, that -- and the people are very familiar with the product. The feature set is far superior to any other kind of other modern database. I would say most of the database offerings from the cloud providers have two core limitations. One, they tend to be built on key value stores, which have a lot -- have far more limited functionality in terms of the expressiveness of the query language and other features that they just don't have. The second thing is they really lock in a customer onto that specific cloud platform. And I think most customers today are much more sensitive about locking than they have been in the past, especially given the state of their relationships with legacy database vendors. And so that's another consideration. So with MongoDB, you truly have the freedom to run MongoDB anywhere. It is truly one of the most popular -- in fact is the most popular modern database in the world today. And they've also seen just the rapid innovations that we've had to offer and so we feel very good about our positioning. Brian White And with support for ACID on 4.0, are there new use cases. I know it's early, but that are coming into the conversation that maybe you didn't see before? Dev Ittycheria Oh, most definitely. The level of conversations and the tone of conversation has changed radically since we announced support for ACID. And so I think it's taken off the potential objection people had, is that could they really use us for certain use cases where ACID type data guarantees was required. And so it's really helped change the nature of the conversations and we feel like it's only expanding the aperture of use cases we can go after. Operator [Operator Instructions] We’ll move next to Tyler Radke with Citi. Tyler Radke I was running around different calls today. I apologize if my question has been asked already. I just wanted to ask you about the -- among your existing customers, just what that looks -- or I guess in terms of Atlas, what that looks like in terms of adoption by existing customers that are using the self-managed version of MongoDB versus net new how that's kind of split today. Dev Ittycheria Well, Atlas, just as so we're all clear, Atlas is a different consumption model. So you have to have chosen MongoDB for your database, for your application before you would consider using Atlas. What Atlas does, it allows you to basically outsource all of the ongoing provisioning management, backup, patching, updating of your infrastructure and really allow you to focus on allowing you to build better apps that can address the needs of your business. And so we tend to see customers who are -- we tend to see all types of customers. Customers moving new workloads onto Atlas. We see customers migrating existing workloads onto Atlas. We see customers who are using MongoDB on-prem, spin out new instances on Atlas. We see development workloads on Atlas. We see test workloads in Atlas and we see production workloads in Atlas. And we see this globally. So Atlas is the most widely available database or service offering. Today, I believe it's available in like 57 different regions. No other database or service vendor can claim that because of the virtue that we can run across Amazon, Google and Microsoft's real estate. And so, in terms of geo-coverage, we are the most widely available offering. And so we tend to have customers almost across every industry, nearly every geography using Atlas in some way, shape or form. Tyler Radke Great. So, it sounds like a combination of existing as well as new. Just a follow-up on the competitive environment, I was just wondering if there's any update there on either from the legacy players, and maybe a comment I might have missed it on, what percent of your deals are involved in legacy displacements? But also, I'd be curious to hear your take on the competitive environment in a non-legacy world and kind of the NoSQL world if you will? Dev Ittycheria Yeah. So we tend to see about 30% of our business typically on average every quarter be migrations of legacy workloads to MongoDB. And so, we continue to see lots of existing workloads move to MongoDB. And obviously, we also see lots of new workloads coming to MongoDB, because it's so much easier to build application in MongoDB than a relational database. In terms of the new vendors, this question was asked before, we typically are not seeing some of the other NoSQL players anymore. I think the market has clearly consolidated around MongoDB and we feel -- we see that in terms of people kind of standardizing on MongoDB at least -- at minimum as one of the core database platforms as they plan to use in their enterprise. And so, from a competitive point of view, I would say the legacy vendors are more competitive from a wallet share where they have an existing share of the wallet, but from a technology point of view, they're becoming less and less relevant. Operator And we’ll go back to Pat Walravens. Pat Walravens So, I have two questions. One is sort of following up on these competitive questions. If you look specifically like, Oracle seems to be trying to react, they have the self-healing functionality and they're pushing the database on cloud and the database in the cloud is cheaper. What's the customers’ reaction to that? Is it going to work? And do you think the pace of migration from workload to Mongo accelerates? Dev Ittycheria Well, I mean, I would tell you that since I've been with the company now, I'm coming close to my four year anniversary, I would say the antipathy towards the legacy vendors has never been higher. So we do see customers very, very motivated to move off their legacy platforms as a function of their relationships with those vendors. And so that's one big reason. The second big reason is that the architecture of these legacy databases is frankly old. The relational database, the first white paper came out 50 years ago and Oracle was founded 41 years ago. And so, yes, they obviously add a lots of features and capabilities. But if you want a very modern platform that allows you to scale gracefully, that allows you to add features very, very quickly, that allows you to move data easily all around the world to serve your user base, you can't really do that easily on a legacy database. And so when you look at like the computer science programs that the leading colleges have, MongoDB is one of the most popular technologies that students develop on today. I had one customer state publicly at MongoDB World that once you go MongoDB, you can't go back. So the MongoDB is a much more compelling platform to build applications on than relational databases. And so until we see that happening as well, that's a big driver to why customers are going with MongoDB. Pat Walravens Great. And then my follow up is more specific. So how important are graph databases and how does that work for Mongo? Dev Ittycheria Yes. So graph databases were designed for certain use cases around mapping, kind of say social profiles and independent relationships between -- who your friends are or social interconnections. We've actually already embedded a bunch of graph functionality into MongoDB, and you'll see us continue to add more functionality over time. And so we don't believe it makes sense for a customer to choose a net new database for every net new use case. It just doesn't become scalable, it's hard to manage, hard to support. It's hard for your developers to learn all these different technologies. And so we see customers increasingly standardize on MongoDB, because we address the widest set of use cases available in the marketplace. Operator And at this time, I’d like to turn things back over to Dev Ittycheria for any closing remarks. Dev Ittycheria Well, thank you again for joining us on this call. I'd like to reiterate we feel really good about the business. We're very proud about what we accomplished in Q2, but we know that we have a huge opportunity in front of us and it's back to the [indiscernible] for us. So thank you again for joining the call and we wish you well. Take care. Operator And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.

Robert,Hoopes,1554,http://www.buckscountycouriertimes.com/news/20180905/former-lower-southampton-public-safety-director-pleads-guilty-to-extortion-conspiracy,"Robert Hoopes' guilty plea leaves former Lower Southampton District Judge John Waltman as the only defendant scheduled for a jury trial. Lower Southampton’s former director of public safety has admitted to attempting to launder money, accepting a bribe and extorting business owners while he was a public official in what has become an ongoing federal corruption probe that has ensnared a former district judge, state deputy constable and township solicitor, among others. Doylestown attorney Robert P. Hoopes, 71, pleaded guilty in Philadelphia’s U.S. District Court on Wednesday to conspiracy to commit money laundering and four counts of Hobbs Act extortion. He is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 17. He faces a potential maximum sentence of up to 100 years in federal prison, according to federal officials. Hoopes had faced multiple counts of offenses including money laundering, honest service wire fraud and witness tampering stemming from an undercover federal investigation that prosecutors allege started in 2015 while he was working as a conflict attorney for Lower Southampton. Less than a year later, Hoopes was hired as the township’s first director of public safety, a position he held for less than a year until he was terminated shortly after he was indicted on federal money laundering charges in December 2016, along with former Lower Southampton District Judge John Waltman, 60, of Lower Southampton and former state deputy constable Bernard Rafferty, 63, also of Lower Southampton. The trio of former public officials were accused of laundering $400,000 that they believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and health care fraud that were given to them by undercover federal agents in 2015 through 2016, while they were working as public servants. In two superseding indictments, Hoopes and Waltman were accused of accepting bribes from business owners in an alleged pay-to-play scheme and conspiring to fix a traffic ticket for an undercover agent that was before Waltman’s court. Hoopes' plea leaves Waltman as the only defendant scheduled for a jury trial. That's set for next month, though his attorney last week filed paperwork asking the court to move the trial date to next year. Waltman faces charges including money laundering, conspiracy, honest service wire fraud and honest service mail fraud and Hobbs Act extortion. Rafferty is awaiting sentencing later this year after admitting in March that he helped Waltman and Hoopes launder cash using a consulting business he had and helping with the ticket-fixing scheme. Also awaiting sentencing after entering guilty pleas for charges related to the probe are former credit union manager Kevin Biederman, of Philadelphia, former digital sign salesman Robert DeGoria, of New Jersey, and former Lower Southampton solicitor Michael Savona, of Newtown Township. Biederman admitted to charges he used his position at the Philadelphia Federal Credit Union to produce phony documents to facilitate the money laundering operation. DeGoria admitted to lying to the FBI and IRS about his financial dealings with Waltman and Hoopes. Savona, whose Pennsylvania law license has been suspended, admitted lying to federal investigators about his knowledge of an alleged $10,000 bribe from DeGoria to Waltman and Hoopes. Hoopes worked as a Lower Southampton police officer from 1969 to 1988 before retiring on disability. He returned to law school to become an attorney practicing civil and criminal law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Choose the plan that's right for you.

The New York-based company merged its corporate and investment bank with its capital markets origination business and named a pair of veterans, Tyler Dickson and Manolo Falco, to run the new division, according to a Thursday memo from Citigroup President Jamie Forese. Citigroup, run by Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat since 2012, appears to be in the throes of a management overhaul. These are common on Wall Street when executives are shuffled or depart to make way for younger managers. The investment bank overhaul comes days after the firm said longtime Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and a pair of regional heads were leaving the company. As part of the most recent announcement, Ray McGuire, who was global head of corporate and investment banking and led the division for 13 years, will become vice chairman of Citigroup and chairman of the new business, according to the memo. ""In his new role, he will report to me and will focus on managing senior global client relationships to deliver our global network and solutions across the Citi platform,"" Forese said. Dickson, who has worked at Citi for nearly three decades, previously ran the capital markets origination business, which helps corporate clients issue stocks and bonds. Falco, a 20-year veteran, ran the corporate and investment bank in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Business Insider first reported the news. The bank will announce more appointments in the new banking, capital markets and advisory division in the coming months, Forese said. The larger group that contains this new division, called the institutional clients group, also has separate businesses for trading, treasury services and wealth management.

Bill,Alfond,1550,http://www.sunjournal.com/colby-college-unveils-new-dorm-to-public/,"WATERVILLE — The public will have a chance Thursday to tour Colby College’s new $25.5 million mixed-use residential complex downtown. The 10 a.m. event at the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons will include speeches by Colby President David Greene and Bill Alfond, a 1972 Colby alumnus and member of the college’s board of trustees, who, with his wife, made a leadership gift toward the effort. Colby officials say Thursday’s event marks an important moment in Colby and city history because it’s the first time in more than 60 years that Colby students have lived downtown. The college completed its move from what is now Colby Circle downtown to Mayflower Hill in 1952. More than 200 students and faculty and staff members recently moved into the building at 150 Main St. and will be part of a civic engagement program that ties their academic pursuits to work with local organizations. Construction of the complex is part of a broader revitalization effort by Colby officials, city leaders, local business people and community organizations. The goal is to draw more people to live and work downtown, spur economic development, enhance the arts and help deepen the connection between Colby and the city. Colby is investing millions of dollars in revitalization efforts, including renovation of a historic bank building at 173 Main St., across the street from the new residential complex. Colby plans to build a hotel farther south on Main Street and develop a center for contemporary art and film at the site of The Center at 93 Main St. The ground floor of the new residential complex will be home to Camden National Bank, which plans to move into the southeast corner this fall. Part of the ground floor also will be used for retail businesses, and the Waterville City Council, Planning Board and other groups will use the Chace Community Forum, a glassed-in area in the northeast corner, for meetings. The building has 52 student apartments and eight faculty and staff apartments on the upper four floors.

Michael,Gordon,1549,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1809/S00116/building-activity-falls-short-of-expectations.htm,"Video | Agriculture | Confidence | Economy | Energy | Employment | Finance | Media | Property | RBNZ | Science | SOEs | Tax | Technology | Telecoms | Tourism | Transport | Search Building activity falls short of expectations in June quarter By Rebecca Howard Sept. 5 (BusinessDesk) - The volume of total building work in the June quarter fell short of expectations and a series of constraints hitting the construction sector may mean future increases are gradual. The seasonally adjusted volume of total building activity, which excludes the effects of higher construction costs and typical seasonal patterns, rose 0.8 percent in the three months ended June 30, with non-residential building work expanding 1.2 percent and residential building work increasing 0.5 percent, Statistics New Zealand figures show. That fell short of the 2.9 percent tipped by seven economists polled by Bloomberg. Westpac Banking Corp senior economist Michael Gordon said it was ""not a big miss, given how much this survey can jump about,"" and noted timing can be an issue, especially for commercial projects. A recent increase in Auckland building consents was driven by apartments and ""the timing of when the work is actually done tends to be lumpier and slower than it would be for stand-alone houses,"" he said. Auckland residential building consents jumped 28 percent in the year to the end of July to 12,845 and of which just half were stand-alone houses. Stats NZ said the value of total building work rose 1.8 percent in the quarter after a 0.1 percent increase in March. Of that, the value of non-residential work rose 2.5 percent in the quarter after falling 0.4 percent in the prior quarter. The value of residential work increased 1.4 percent following a 0.3 percent gain in March. Gordon said while the level of work remains high, ""we are increasingly seeing constraints on future growth with issues around capacity constraints, access to finance, rising costs, all weighing on the potential for growth from here"". ""We are assuming the pace of growth will continue to be gradual,"" he said. Escalating labour and building product costs have made it harder for commercial construction companies, especially in vertical buildings. Fixed price contracts, leaving construction firms carrying the risk, prompted Fletcher Building to exit the market for now after taking on several unprofitable projects, while other firms buckled under the weight, such as Ebert Construction. The value of construction work on office, administration and public transport fell 3 percent to $375 million in the June quarter from a year earlier, bucking a 9 percent increase across non-residential activity to $1.96 billion. Of that, farm building construction work jumped 28 percent to $104 million, factories and industrial building work lifted 17 percent to $209 million and work on shops, restaurants and bars rose 30 percent to $261 million. Some $202 million of work was carried on hotels, motels, boarding houses and prisons, up 40 percent on the year. The actual value of all building work rose 8.1 percent to $5.57 billion in the three months ended June 30 from a year earlier, with the value of residential work up 7.6 percent to $3.62 billion.

Karen,Cummings,1548,http://www.tribtown.com/2018/09/05/clearspring_alumni_gather_for_reunion/,"Tribune staff reports The annual Clearspring School reunion was Aug. 26 at Brownstown Elementary School with 86 people, including former teachers and coaches, in attendance. President Darrell Branaman welcomed the group, and the Rev. Lawrence Goen gave the invocation for the pitch-in dinner. Special recognition was given to the veterans present, and the Pledge of Allegiance was recited. The meeting was called to order, and a special thank-you was given to all who volunteered with setting up, decorating and helping serve the food and drinks. Secretary-treasurer Rose Wray read the minutes and gave the treasurer’s report. The floor was opened for nominations for officers to be elected for the coming year. The present officers all were nominated to serve another year, and each accepted. A candle was lit by Wray, and Jim Cooper and Dennis Campbell played soft music as the memorial roll of 28 names of students and teachers who had passed away this past year was read. Special recognition was given to the 1968 graduating class, which is celebrating its 50th year. Class members present were Louise Cobb Bowling, Wayne and Janet Edwards, Ernie Estes, Lonnie and Wilma Goen, Daryl L. Lucas, Jeanette Yeary Sitterding, Ronald and Karen Cummings Terrell, Brenda Weddell and Jim Wilson. Past cheerleaders who were present, Sue Curry Isaacs, Patty Lawson Johnson and Karen Cummings Terrell, led the group in the school song. Baskets were then passed around for donations to cover expenses, and an announcement was made about the Houston Fall Festival on Oct. 13. Gene Pearson, who graduated in 1944, received a potted plant for being the oldest present. Ray Jones from Wisconsin received a potted plant for traveling the farthest distance. Mary Jane Fleetwood, with Joan Fleetwood, received the grand door prize. Jim Cooper and Dennis Campbell entertained the group with special music.

Andrew,Davis,1547,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SAVOR-Brunches-at-Kit-Kat-Lounge-and-Lark-/63934.html,"For almost two decades, the Boystown spot has a very lively brunch, complete with a stable of seasoned drag performers who know how to command a crowd's attentionand my recent visit was no exception. Performer Madam X thrilled the crowd by dressing as Miley Cyrus, Cher, Lady Gaga and others, and singing ( not lip-synching ) their songsand, at one point, deftly taking all the money several women had, including the dollar bills sitting on the table. ( Interestingly, Madam X told Windy City Times after her performance that she doesn't want to be famous, for fear of losing her connections with the audience. ) If you're looking for a drink, this is DEFINITELY the placeas Kit Kat boast s more than 200 different cocktails, including an enviable list of martinis, such as the Peggy Lee ( vodka, orange, banana liqueur and cranberry ), Hopscotch ( vodka, butterscotch schnapps and cream ) and Sangria ( red wine and brandy ) martinis. As for the food at the ""Divalicious Brunch""well, what can I say? It was pretty much hit-and-miss. The beignets were solid and my friend really enjoyed her Rice Krispie French toastbut the steak in my skillet dish was tougher than a calculus assignment, and I basically ate around it. Service was also noticeably slow ( and with a two-hour limit at each table, patrons might be at the mercy of the servers ), although the telegenic server was very nice. ( Other offerings range from coconut shrimp salad to Avocado Two Ways to, of course, the Kit Kat Burger. So I would recommend Kit Kat Lounge & Supper Clubas far as the entertainment and drinks go. As for the cuisine, overall, it's not quite diva-worthy. Larkunder new management Meanwhile, there's a different kind of fun at nearby restaurant Lark ( 3441 N. Halsted St.; larkchicago.com/ ), which, intriguingly, has been under new management since February ( supplanting LKH )Kit Kat co-owners Edward Gisiger and Ramesh Ariyanayakam, and Managing Partner Ralph Fasano. Disco music greets you upon entering, daring you not to at least tap your feet even while waiting for a seat. However, there are also all sorts of games, including Jenga. ( The people at the table next to us in the impressive patio area played Mystery Date. ) Even if the large-screen television outside switches to sports, tunes by Donna Summer, Chaka Khan and others continue playingproviding a surreal, yet sill enjoyable, feel. As for the food, it's interesting that Kit Kat's management is involved at Lark as well, because the food was definitely tastier ( not exotic, but well done ) than at the other spot. My friend absolutely loved the BELT ( bacon, egg, lettuce and tomato sandwich ), while the turkey club put a smile on my face ( in part, thanks to some supremely wonderful … tater tots ). The avocado toast was quite delicious as wellbut the crowning glory was the Margherita pizza, complete with a wood-fired Neapolitan crust. However, if that's not your thing, several burgers are available, including the Lark Smash ( a tantalizing item with two quarter-pound beef patties, applewood smoked bacon, ham, white cheddar, crispy onion rings, lettuce, tomato, and onions on a buttery brioche bun ). And if you have the willpower/stomach room to try a S'mores pizza for dessert, then more power to you.

Andrew,Davis,1547,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SAVOR-Vinnys-Pizza-Bar/63935.html,"The year-old concept is based on ""Vinny,"" an old-school Italian owner who aims to bring the fun while being serious about the quality of the food. For example, the decor includes portraits of celebrity lookalikes ( including impersonators of Michael Jackson and Angelina Jolie as well as presidents Trump and Obama ). Telegenic Director of Operations Nick O'Meara told Windy City Times: ""The portraits are about satire. Some people don't get them, but Vinny's is about fun [as well as] being low-key and casual."" As for the food, the crush of pedestrians clustering around the restaurant as the server presented free samples provided my initial clue. Chef Jose Ramirezwho heads Vinny's as well as Ovie Bar & Grill next doorhas concoted some dishes that run from solid to spectacular. The pizzas are unique in that the crusts are combinations of Neapolitan and New York styles. The smoked pork-shoulder pizza is basically a Cubano in pie form, and it was very satisfying. However, the version that brings everyone in is the brie-and-apple version, with white sauce, brie cheese blend, Gala apples and balsamic roasted shallots. It was amazingand I'd certainly return for this. Soft breadsticks came with smoked tomato sauce and goat-cheese marinara, and the capicola and cheese fondue made for a tasty combination. Also, feel free to ask for the cheesecakealthough, interestingly, it started okay and became better-tasting as wel went through our slices. By the way, another reason has emerged to check out Vinny's: the spot's Progressive Happy Hour, in which drinks are $4 each at 4-5 p.m., $5 at 5-6 p.m., and $6 at 6-7 p.m. Bottoms up!

Michael,Gordon,1546,https://www.bannergraphic.com/story/2548814.html,"New York’s electric chamber ensemble, the Bang on a Can All-Stars will perform selections from their ongoing multimedia project Field Recordings for opening night of DePauw University’s Green Guest Artists Series at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 15 in Kresge Auditorium. BOAC co-founder and composer David Lang describes the program planned for DePauw as a kind of “ghost” story. “We asked composers from different parts of the music world to find a recording of something that already exists — a voice, a sound, a faded scrap of melody — and then write a new piece around it.” Using archival audio, found sound and video, Field Recordings builds a bridge between the seen and the unseen, the present and absent, the present and the past, channeled through the “unstoppable” Bang on a Can All-Stars. Now including more than 30 commissioned works and two double-disc album releases on Cantaloupe Music — Field Recordings (2015) and More Field Recordings (2017) — the project has almost become a genre in its own right, a new adventurous palette of sound that includes film and electro-acoustic forays into the future. The All-Stars’ Field Recordings program on Sept. 15 will feature the following works: -- Julia Wolfe: “Reeling” -- Florent Ghys: “An Open Cage” -- Michael Gordon: “Gene Takes a Drink “with film by Bill Morrison -- Christian Marclay: “Fade to Slide” with film by Christian Marclay -- David Lang: “unused swan” -- Todd Reynolds: “Seven Sundays” -- Caroline Shaw: “Really Craft When You” -- Steve Reich: “The Cave of Machpelah” -- Bryce Dessner: “Letter 27” with film -- Anna Clyne: “A Wonderful Day” Known as some of the best contemporary musicians in the world (multi-instrumentalist Mark Stewart also is music director for Paul Simon), the All-Stars are recognized for their ultra-dynamic live performances. Freely crossing the boundaries between classical, jazz, rock, world and experimental music, this six-member amplified ensemble not only has forged a unique category-defying identity, but one with a massive repertoire of works written specifically for the group’s distinctive style and instrumentation. Performing throughout the U.S. and internationally, the All-Stars’ celebrated projects include the landmark recording of Brian Eno’s classic “Music for Airports” and Terry Riley’s “In C,” as well as live performances with Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Don Byron, Iva Bittova and Thurston Moore. The All-Stars have worked in unprecedented close collaboration with some of the most important and inspiring musicians of our time, including Steve Reich, Ornette Coleman, Burmese drum master Kyaw Kyaw Naing and Tan Dun, among many others. The group was awarded Musical America’s “Ensemble of the Year” and has been heralded as “the country’s most important vehicle for contemporary music” by the San Francisco Chronicle. Bang on a Can also has contributed to creating an international community dedicated to innovative music, wherever it is found. According to The New York Times, the group has played “a central role in fostering a new kind of audience that doesn’t concern itself with boundaries. If music is made with originality and integrity, these listeners will come.” And since its first Marathon concert given in 1987, come they have. Bang on a Can has grown from a one-day New York-based Marathon concert (on Mother’s Day in a SoHo art gallery) to a multi-faceted performing arts organization with a broad range of year-round international activities. “When we started Bang on a Can, we never imagined that our 12-hour marathon festival of mostly unknown music would morph into a giant international organization dedicated to the support of experimental music, wherever we would find it,” writes BOAC co-founders Michael Gordon, David Lang and Julia Wolfe. “But it has, and we are so gratified to be still hard at work, all these years later. The reason is really clear to us — we started this organization because we believed that making new music is a utopian act — that people needed to hear this music, and they needed to hear it presented in the most persuasive way, with the best players, with the best programs, for the best listeners, in the best context. Our commitment to changing the environment for this music has kept us busy and growing, and we are not done yet.” Current projects include the annual Bang on a Can Marathon; The People’s Commissioning Fund, a membership program to commission emerging composers; the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who tour to major festivals and concert venues around the world every year; recording projects on Cantaloupe Music; the Bang on a Can Summer Music Festival at MASS MoCA — a professional development program for young composers and performers led by today’s pioneers of experimental music; Asphalt Orchestra, Bang on a Can’s extreme street band that offers mobile performances re-contextualizing unusual music; Found Sound Nation, a new technology-based musical outreach program now partnering with the State Department of the United States of America to create OneBeat, a revolutionary, post-political residency program that uses music to bridge the gulf between young American musicians and young musicians from developing countries; cross-disciplinary collaborations and projects with DJs, visual artists, choreographers, filmmakers and more. Each new program has evolved to answer specific challenges faced by today’s musicians, composers and audiences, in order to make innovative music widely accessible and wildly received. Bang on a Can’s inventive and aggressive approach to programming and presentation has created a large and vibrant international audience made up of people of all ages who are rediscovering the value of contemporary music. General admission to the Green Guest Artist Series is $20; tickets for seniors, children and all students are free. For online purchases, visit music.depauw.edu. The GCPA box office also will be open 90 minutes prior to the performance in the Green Center for the Performing Arts (605 S. College Ave.).

Michael,Gordon,1546,http://www.beyondchron.org/8th-san-francisco-green-film-festival-preview/,"Sharp-eyed filmgoers will note the 8th annual edition of San Francisco’s Green Film Festival takes place later than usual in 2018. The Festival’s timing, running from September 6 to 14 this year, coincides with the Global Climate Action Summit. This event, taking place in San Francisco from September 12-14, 2018, gathers world leaders who are supportive of the Paris Climate Agreement. Needless to say, President Trump is highly unlikely to be represented at this summit. On the other hand, the Festival has been listed as one of the Summit’s official Affiliate Events. Festival viewers will be taken to such places as the Okavongo Delta, the Bel Monte Dam, Paris’ La Louve Coop, and even the skies of Earth. Such venues as the Castro Theatre, the Cowell Theatre, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, and the San Francisco Main Library will host Festival screenings, Quite a few of these screenings will feature one of the more than 100 guest speakers. “It’s Elemental” has been adopted as this year’s official Festival motto. The slogan balances the interplay between one of the four classic elements (earth, air, fire, and water) and a major environmental issue. Hopefully, the Green Film Festival attendees will walk out of these screenings determined to make real political improvements in human protection of the environment (e.g. participating in the September 8 worldwide Rise For Climate march). Here’s a sampling of this year’s Festival offerings: Neil Gelinas’ documentary “Into The Okavango” opens the Green Film Festival festivities. Botswana’s Okavango Delta provides water to over a million people. It’s also one of Earth’s last wildlife refuges that’s untouched by human development. Gelinas’ film captures highlights from conservation biologist Steve Boyes’ four-month journey down the Delta’s rivers. More visual splendor can be found in the Anne Flatte short “Symphony For Nature.” Michael Gordon’s symphony “Natural History” was inspired by Oregon’s Crater Lake. Now a performance of Gordon’s piece requires coordinating the classical Britt Orchestra and the Klamath drum group Steiger Butte Singers. America’s Red Power Movement would not have thrived and survived without the presence of Native American matriarchs. Elizabeth A. Castle and Christina D. King’s “Warrior Women” looks at how matriarchs such as Madonna and Marcella Thunder Hawk played crucial roles in everything from the early days of the American Indian Movement to the present-day protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline. Green Film Festival Young Filmmaker award winner “Youth Unstoppable: The Rise Of The Global Climate Youth Movement” is what it says on the outside tin. Director Slater Jewell-Kemker records how youth around the world push their local politicians to enact stronger legal protections for the environment. Soumyaa Kapil Behrens’ “Nail House” is also a political film. But its San Francisco politics focus doesn’t detract from the universality of its grassroots groups’ fight against gentrifiers over how a piece of local public property will be used. A headline-grabbing statewide problem has global implications in local Bay Area filmmakers Kevin White and Stephen Most’s documentary. “Wilder Than Wild: Fire, Forests, And The Future” examines how human fire suppression and extreme climate change led to such disasters as California’s Rim Fire. Could carbon “draw down” strategies help reduce global warming by shrinking atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and replenishing Earth’s soil? That’s the argument made by Marcy Cravat in her documentary “Dirt Rich.” Brooklyn’s 16,000 member strong Park Slope Food Coop puts into everyday practice building non-capitalist based food production and distribution. Tom Boothe’s “Food Coop” tells the Coop’s inspirational story, which has sparked the opening of a similar Coop in Paris. A couple of Festival offerings make repeat appearances after screenings at earlier festivals. These films are “The Human Element” and “Complicit.” Matthew Testa’s “The Human Element,” which previously screened at the recent San Francisco International Film Festival, follows photographer James Balog as he shows how the abstraction of climate change translates into concrete impacts on everyday Americans. Heather White and Lynn Zhang’s “Complicit” makes a return visit to San Francisco after screening at this year’s San Francisco DocFest. This still rage-inducing film follows Chinese activist Yi Yeting and several other workers in Chinese electronics manufacturing companies as they seek recompense for occupational leukemia and other diseases contracted thanks to heavy chemical exposure during the manufacturing process. The film’s title refers to the guilty culprits responsible for these workers’ illnesses, ranging from corrupt Chinese government officials to Western consumers who don’t think twice about the human cost of building electronic devices. Attendees with further interest in Chinese environmental issues should check out the shorts program “Pushing Change: Shorts From China’s Environmental Edge.” This collection of five short films deal with such subjects as dislocation via ecosystem destruction and panda habitat conservation. Cinephiles will particularly look forward to Jia Zhangke’s portrait of China’s pollution-plagued cities. The Bruce Parry documentary “Tawai: A Voice From The Forest” shows life outside of urban zones and pollution is possible. “Tawai” refers to the inner connection to nature experienced by Borneo’s nomadic hunter-gatherers. Life lessons are offered from people around the world whose existences greatly differ from urban inhabitants. Closing out this year’s San Francisco Green Film Festival is “The Condor And The Eagle.” Sophie Guerra and Clement Guerra’s documentary follows the journey of four Indigenous leaders from the Canadian plains to the heart of the Amazonian jungle. The aim is uniting the people of North and South America, but the leaders’ attachment to the Earth and one another also changes. Finally, make time for such sister events as “Reel Science Challenge,” which pairs filmmakers with climate scientists to make movies, or the “Coal + Ice” photographic exhibit. Whatever event you attend to raise personal awareness, you’re doing more than submitting to the greed and neglect promoted by Trump. (The 8th San Francisco Green Film Festival runs from September 6-14, 2018 at such venues as the Castro Theatre and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.

Get access to all our content – subscribe today | 30 day free trial COPYING AND DISTRIBUTING ARE PROHIBITED WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE PUBLISHER: CHUNT@EUROMONEY.COM As the 10th anniversary of the failure of Lehman Brothers arrives, I have been asked to share my reminiscences of when I realized a global credit crisis was looming and why so many senior financial figures ignored my warnings. In the early summer of 2007 I was by the pool at the Hotel Arts in Barcelona, recovering from an all-night session at the casino after a securitization conference, when none other than JPMorgan investment bank head Bill Winters came into view. “Bill!” I said. “What are you doing here? Surely you aren’t mixing with the nerds who put together the synthetic collateralized debt obligations that will soon undermine the global economy?” Winters smiled ruefully. “I’m afraid so. Jamie Dimon personally told me to increase our share of CDO revenues and claims I’m spending too much time in the London office having new suits fitted,” he said. “Bill, old friend,” I replied. “Mark my words: 15 months from now – probably at the end of the second week of September 2008 – this whole thing will blow up. If you can get JPMorgan out of CDOs in time, Jamie Dimon will thank you in the end. Or he might not, knowing Jamie, but you should still cut your exposure.” A young Deutsche Bank trader who had attended the conference was listening to our conversation. “You mean I should start putting together derivatives trades that pay off if mortgage-backed CDOs collapse in value?” he asked. “That’s exactly what I mean,” I told him. “I don’t believe we’ve been introduced, though – what is your name?” He looked up from his latest model Blackberry, which he was tapping furiously. “The name’s Lippman,” he said. “Greg Lippman.” I returned to New York confident that I had told enough senior officials about the risk of a credit crisis for disaster to be averted. I wasn’t as close to the new Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, as I had been to his predecessor, Alan Greenspan. But I made sure to explain the dangers to both Ben and treasury secretary Tim Geithner, who had just graduated from Dartmouth, and relied on me to explain exactly how the mortgage markets worked. I also stressed the importance of character on Wall Street. “I was playing bridge with Jimmy Cayne last night and he told me that our old friend Dick Fuld is going completely off the rails,” I said. “Apparently he has commissioned a portrait of himself to hang in the lobby of the Lehman Brothers office on Seventh Avenue and ‘The Only Way Is Up’ plays on a constant loop on the trading floor.” The regulators looked alarmed. “What should we do?” they asked in tandem. “You should arrange mergers of Bear Stearns and Lehman with stronger banks, and maybe Merrill too, just to be safe,” I told them. “Then encourage dealers to gradually wind down their CDO books and stand ready to cut interest rates if required.” They didn’t listen, of course, and conditions steadily deteriorated over the following year. I felt duty bound to make one last attempt to save the global markets and in the late summer of 2008 I brokered a meeting between Dick Fuld and Bob Diamond from Barclays. Dick was showing signs of distress. He had shaved the little hair left on his head and kept muttering that it was all Joe Gregory’s fault. Bob Diamond couldn’t contain his impatience to do a deal. “I’ll give you $30 a share,” he blurted out. “$60!” But Dick was in no fit state to close a sale and his nurses brought the conversation to a close. I consoled Bob on our way out. “Don’t worry old man,” I said. “The game is up for Lehman, but if you can hold tight for a few weeks you can probably get their best traders for free. Just make sure you keep a close eye on your dealing rooms in the next few years. The last thing you want to do is let some low-level price-fixing scandal undermine confidence even further.” The remainder of ‘Dick Fuld: My part in his downfall’ is available on Kindle and iPlayer.

Andy McGrath Matteo Trentin – Mitchelton-Scott This nagging uphill finish will favour the Italian. If Sagan falters, expect the Mitchelton man to profit. Ian Cleverly Steve Cummings – Dimension Data He’s not exactly set the world alight this season but Cummings has not forgotten how to win a stage. Hopefully inspired by Ben King’s excellent stage 4 victory, I’m backing the king of the back of the pack lurkers to hit the front once again. Nick Christian Pello Bilbao – Astana I think the finish is too tricky for the real fast guys, so I’m following in Ian’s footsteps by going with a likeable longshot who also happens to be a capable all-rounder. I know exactly what the Mole is going to say and I don’t care. Cycling Mole This is designated a sprint stage, but in classic Vuelta style, it is a little complicated. The final 2km kicks up to 4% and the riders end the stage on a narrow uphill road. Not only that, but they have a switchback with around 300m to go. Riders should be concerned with three things: positioning, positioning, positioning. Hugo – the man had first pick and goes with Viviani, I think we’d all have done the same. After making a royal mess of the last sprint, the Wolf Pack will be hungry for success. Hannah – the pick of Bouhanni is the form selection. After an awful season, he took a brilliant win on Thursday. Sprinting is 90% confidence, that should help him. Andy – the choice of Trentin frustrates me. The Italian was brilliant in 2017, but he’s failed to live up to those expectations in 2018. I would be amazed if he wins a stage in this race. Ian – the classic Cummings pick. The man who punters continue to waste good money on. Expect to see big Stevo come home in last place. Nick – he might not care, but here goes… Nick has picked Pello Bilbao. We’ve had some dodgy selections this week, but this takes the biscuit! The Basque rider is clearly out of form and having a poor race. There you go, Nick. My pick – has to be Viviani. The Italian will be smarting after Thursday’s performance and he has the power required for the uphill sprint.

Please turn on JavaScript for the best possible experience. Quick links By Gareth Dennison | 31/08/2018 “SCREECHING” cars cutting through an estate have left residents feeling like their road has become a race track. The number of vehicles using Brierley Road at Dalton has increased with Oldgate Lane at Thrybergh closed for summer gas works. Resident Joanne McCreath (38) said: “It’s always been a problem. People use it as a cut-through up to Thrybergh. But it seems to have become more and more. “Maybe with the good weather and having the door open, we’re noticing it more. “But drivers come screeching along with no regard for this not being a main road and tearing onto Magna Lane, where we regularly see accidents. “It feels like our road has been turned into a racetrack.” Independent campaigner and Thrybergh resident Michael Sylvester said: “Brierley Road is very much a residential road with a mix of families used to having children out playing, but also with a large number of older persons’ bungalows. “Drivers have started using this and Wilson Drive as a cut through following the Oldgate Lane closure and often at speed to make up a few seconds on the extra distance they are needing to cover to get to Doncaster Road. “I’m calling on the police to organise extra patrols and speeding enforcement in the area to help tackle the problem.” South Yorkshire Police said residents with strong concerns were able to contact South Yorkshire Safety Camera Partnership to request a speed survey. Mr Sylvester said the request had now been made and volunteers were being sought to take part in a community speedwatch patrol. He said the issue emerged as he spends 40 weekends on “street surgeries” covering Dalton, East Herringthorpe and Thrybergh. He added: “My aim is to get opinions and viewpoints from every road and street. “When you consider the levels of deprivation locally, these tend to be opinions that are not represented well at any level of politics.” We want to continue holding local authorities to account, attending court and council meetings, as well as providing breaking news, competitions and offers – but it costs money.

Joel,Cutler,1534,http://thecourier.com/local-sports/2018/08/30/prep-football-fhs-prepping-for-senior-night/,"By DAVE HANNEMAN STAFF WRITER Findlay plays its home opener on Friday when the Trojans host Upper Arlington on senior night. WHEN & WHERE: 7 p.m. Friday at Donnell Stadium. COACHES: Mark Ritzler has posted a 66-57 record in his 12-plus seasons at Findlay High. Joel Cutler, in his fifth season as Upper Arlington’s head coach, owns a 26-17 record at the school. LAST MEETING/OVERALL SERIES: Friday’s matchup will be the tenth meeting between the two schools, who met every year in a home-and-home series from 2001 through the 2009 season. Findlay won the last game 24-7, but Upper Arlington has a 5-4 edge in the overall series. Upper Arlington, Ohio’s Division I state champ in 2000, was 4-6 last season. It was the school’s first losing record since 2004 and only the second since 1963. The Golden Bears actually went 5-5, but had to forfeit a 24-19 win over Central Crossing because of an ineligible player. TALE OF THE TAPE: Both teams are coming off tough opening night losses. Hilliard Bradley scored the tying touchdown with 23 seconds left in the fourth quarter and beat Findlay 34-28 in overtime last Friday. Upper Arlington had a late drive halted by an interception and fell 17-14 to Reynoldsburg in its season opener. BREAKDOWN: Findlay overcame a 7-0 deficit against Hilliard Bradley and went up 28-21 when, after Ryan Sweat recovered a fumble at the 1-yard line, quarterback Tanner Rickle plunged over for his fourth touchdown of the game. In the final six minutes, though, Hilliard Bradley drove 68 yards in 16 plays to tie it. The Jaguars completed a 30-yard pass on third-and-15 from their own 27 and converted three fourth-down situations, the last when Jack Richards ran 3 yards into the end zone with 22 seconds left in regulation. “When we look back at it, we needed one more play,” Ritzler said. “We had some chances during that fourth-quarter drive to get them off the field and couldn’t do it. That’s what you have to do against good teams, you have to find a way to get over the hump. “Coach (Todd) Armstrong and I talk about being the Jimmy Chitwood guy, the guy in the movie Hoosiers who says he wants the ball at the end of the game. You can’t wait for somebody else to take the initiative. We need someone who wants to be that guy — offense, defense, whatever — who’s going to step up and make that play.” Defensively, Findlay held Bradley to just 67 yards rushing. But Jaguars’ quarterback Griffin Veil completed 23 of 35 passes for 264 yards. Jack Duffer caught eight passes for 181 yards, including a 13-yard catch for the winning touchdown in overtime. Rickle carried 22 times for 67 yards and RJ Nunn ran 14 times for 50 yards. Rickle completed 11 of 23 passes for 130 yards. Parker Fetterman had three receptions, with Adam Gilbert, Pat Dillon and Isaiah Moore snaring two each. “Offensively everything is kind of a grind right now. Nothing is coming real easy,” Ritzler said. “We’re not going to break off any 60-yard plays. We’re not going to throw the ball 50 times a game and beat people. We’ve got to have some balance because we’re more of a grind-it-out team. The plus side of that is it keeps the ball out of the other team’s hands.” In addition to Sweat’s fumble recovery, Findlay linebackers Cross DeLaCruz and Grant Morman teamed up four total sacks. Linebacker Aiden Eubanks, defensive end Khail Stokes and safety Owen Mullins had tackles for zero or minus yardage as well. “I thought our linebackers played great,” Ritzler said. “Defensively, I thought we applied pressure and did a pretty good job of keeping the edge. We contained their run game for the most part, which is something we knew we had to do.” SCOUTING REPORT: This season Upper Arlington returned eight starters on offense, including quarterback Sammy Sass, receiver Steve Bair and Brown University recruit Jud Utgard, a 6-foot-4, 275-pound lineman. Another big man up front is Sean McRae, a 6-5, 290-pound junior. “I think Upper Arlington is a little better at running between the tackles (than Bradley) because they have some big kids up front that can move,” Ritzler said. ” “The key to their offense, though, is their quarterback. He’s maybe a little more active with his feet, but he has a strong arm like Bradley’s quarterback and is just as accurate. He can throw on the run, he keeps his eyes down field when he scrambles …. he’s just a great athlete.” Seven starters are also back on defense, including 6-5, 270-pound defensive end Jackson Ness, a Boston College recruit, and senior linebackers Tommy Dilz, Nick Fisanick and Ben Krimm. Following Friday’s contest, Findlay hits the road for away games at Toledo Start (Sept. 7), Fremont Ross (Sept. 14), and Toledo St. Francis (Sept. 21). “This is our only home game in the first five,” Ritzler said. “Weather-wise it looks like it’s supposed to be a great night. It’s senior night and hopefully there will be a good crowd that will get us energized a bit. “We saw some of that emotion and intensity come out at times. There’s a fine line between playing up on that edge and knowing when to pull back a bit, but they played hard, they fought, they battled, they got after it.” KEYS TO THE GAME: “Offensively, we have to be able to run the ball between the tackles, and I think we have to be a little bit better in the screen game,” Ritzler said. “The screen game is area we talked about in the preseason. That helps alleviate some numbers in the box, which helps the running game. “Defensively, Upper Arlington is a run team first so we have to be able to stop the run like we did against Hilliard Bradley. We also have to keep teams from going over the top. We’ve got to do a better job on deep plays down the field.” Hanneman, 419-427-8408 Send an E-mail to Dave Hanneman Privacy Guidelines | Commenting Policies | Ad Rates | Sales Locations | Member Service | Subscribe Now All contents © 1996 – 2018 The Findlay Publishing Company More News Updates…

Andrew,Davis,1533,https://news.uga.edu/uga-unveils-sanford-stadium-enhancement/,"The University of Georgia formally unveiled a major enhancement to the west end zone of Sanford Stadium Friday morning as officials from the university and UGA Athletic Association held a ceremony to highlight the updated facilities. The west end zone enhancement project includes a new locker room, hospitality lounge, larger video board and new upper and lower plazas for fans. “This extension, renovation, and expansion project has made Sanford Stadium, already one of the finest college football environments, even better,” said President Jere W. Morehead. “It is one more step that the University of Georgia is taking to reach new heights of excellence across all our athletic programs, and I want to thank each and every donor who contributed to this important project.” (Gallery photos by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) “We are thrilled to officially dedicate the new west end zone project, which will create a new game-day experience for our current and future student-athletes, as well as our fans attending the game this Saturday,” said Greg McGarity, J. Reid Parker Director of Athletics. “This facility is unique to Georgia and to Sanford Stadium. We are especially grateful to the members of the Magill Society who have helped generate the gifts necessary to make this project a success.” The $63 million project, funded largely by donor support, covers 120,000 total square feet of new and updated space. Part of that space is a 10,500-square-foot hospitality lounge that is used for hosting prospective student-athletes and their guests on game days. The lounge is the first of its kind at Sanford Stadium for the Georgia football program. “We’re very excited to open our new West End Zone facility. I certainly think it’s a first-class facility, best in the country when it comes to hosting student-athletes and prospective-student athletes on game day events,” said head football coach Kirby Smart. “Sanford Stadium is one of our feature showpieces, so to be able to enjoy that environment and have a great place to host them on game day, that’s a great advantage. Downstairs our locker room will give our players a tremendous place to be able to get ready for a game.” In the past, the football team occupied a dressing room on the east end of Sanford Stadium, but it was only used as a staging room for pre-game, halftime and post-game activities. The new facilities on the west end nearly doubled the amount of square footage for the team and includes fully equipped locker and shower facilities. There also are a number of additional support spaces for things such as sports medicine, equipment and coaches’ locker rooms. The fan experience also received a major boost with the new plaza replacing all existing entrances in the stadium’s west end. The plaza includes expanded and enhanced concession and restroom facilities as well as a new video board that is 33 percent larger than the previous one.

MUSICHOLST’S THE PLANETS ★★★½Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, Hamer Hall (Melbourne) and Costa Hall (Geelong), August 30-September 1 Although Sir Andrew Davis gave Holst’s super-suite naming rights for his latest program with the MSO, the more interesting element of Thursday night’s work was Carl Vine’s brand-new Symphony No. 8, The Enchanted Loom, commissioned by the orchestra from its composer-in-residence for 2018. Each score generates pleasure in its orchestration and fluency of movement but this new construct of five unbroken movements is testament to Vine’s talent for shifting between weighty and gossamer-light textures with engrossing skill and theatricality. This fresh-faced symphony takes its subtitle from Sir Charles Sherrington’s metaphor for the human brain, Vine focusing his (and our) attention on its activities and potentialities. Mind you, while listening to the piece in live performance, you tend to forget this illustrative backdrop as the composer presents a brilliant spectrum of timbres, throwing around melodic scraps and motives as the music moves from muddy, menacing bass work to effervescent sparks and broiling, full-bodied textural landscapes. It might not figure among the more cerebral of Vine’s compositions but it fascinates through its emotional sincerity and compelling craftsmanship. Significantly, Thursday night’s premiere audience clearly approved of the piece, so here’s hoping it enjoys further performances. Sir Andrew trod a familiar path in his production of The Planets , taking his time over the broad strokes and making briskness his trademark in Venus and Saturn where the initial slow pace gave way to a quicker underpinning pulse. Some rhythmic clumsiness and glaring intonation errors didn’t help – but the audience applauded long and loud. Our weekly podcast giving you insight into the stories that drive the nation.

Sara,Burns,1532,http://blackburnnews.com/sarnia/sarnia-news/2018/08/31/city-police-attending-funeral-slain-port-huron-officer/,"A delegation of city police officers, including Sarnia’s chief and deputy chief, is attending Friday’s regimental funeral for a slain Port Huron police officer. Joel Wood, 45, was shot and killed, while he was off duty, early last Friday morning in Clyde Township, Michigan. Chief Norm Hansen says they like to show their support whenever they can. “We sent two officers out to Fredericton,” says Hansen. “It’s a reminder to all of us that it can happen anywhere and anytime. The lieutenant in Port Huron was a 22-year member, and our service and Port Huron often work hand in hand. We help each other with parades and we help each other with ceremonies, so we certainly feel the loss that they’re feeling.” He expects thousands of emergency responders will attend. “It’s quite a sight. It’s a sad day and a bad reason to all get-together, but when you see all of the uniforms — usually from across North America — it’s very touching.” Funeral services at Colonial Woods Missionary Church on Pine Grove Ave. in Port Huron start at noon. Fredericton police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns were killed in the line of duty earlier this month, in New Brunswick.

Sara,Burns,1532,https://www.interior-news.com/community/lets-show-appreciation-for-emergency-service-workers/,"Aretha Franklin said it best: Respect I’m not inclined to getting chocked up but the other day a big lump in my throat chocked me up. I was watching a bit of the funeral procession for Constable Robb Costello and Sara Burns. Both of these heroes were members of the Fredericton police force. I looked at the line of mourners along the route standing in the pouring rain. Umbrellas up , rubber boots on and a few signs showing sadness and respect. Aretha Franklin said it best -“Respect”! Why do we wait for a tragedy before we can show how much we respect those who put their lives on the line for us? Smithers has a small RCMP force of 20. I know I am thankful for all they do in this area. Next time I see an officer I will tell him of her thank you and I do respect you. All this makes me think of those who battle the wildfires in this area. How much do you respect those folks? Day after day they do all they can to protect us and our homes. Firefighters come from far away or close to home to help us.I certainly respect that. Our first responders are at the ready to make sure we are assisted with a medical issue. Rescue crews put their own lives at risk to save someone from a mountain top or a valley. Here ‘s another group who deserve our respect during this time of fires and turmoil. Volunteers!! Refuge from fires is organized. Food is in place. Clothing is gathered for those in need. I really don’t have a lot to say this week. I just wanted to make sure we all find it in our hearts to say thank you to a firefighter ,police officer, first responder etc. Show all those who give of themselves a lot of respect. Goodness , I seem quite philosophical this week. I suppose the death of Aretha Franklin spurred me with her iconic song “Respect. Hope all of you managed with the smoke and heat.
