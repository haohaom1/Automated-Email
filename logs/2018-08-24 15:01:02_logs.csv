Technical FAQ: Tour de France tech Louis Meintjes will lead Dimension Data at the Vuelta a España, which gets underway this weekend in Málaga. After abandoning the Giro d’Italia this spring due to illness, Meintjes is hoping to bounce back in the race that saw him make his grand tour debut back in 2014. “It’s been a challenging year for the team and for me personally too, but we have worked hard to prepare well and build up nicely ahead of La Vuelta,” Meintjes said via a team press release. “At Vuelta a Burgos I think we definitely showed that we were on the right track as the entire team was riding really well. With the same team as in Burgos, now heading to La Vuelta, we have some positive momentum going into the race.” Meintjes counts three grand tour top 10s on his career palmares, with one at the 2015 Vuelta to go with two at the Tour de France. He returned this season to Dimension Data — the team that gave him his start on the WorldTour — after two years with the UAE Team Emirates organization, but he has not had the homecoming he’d hoped for thus far in 2018. Meintjes will have climbers Igor Anton and Merhawi Kudus at his disposal in Spain. American Ben King and British former British time trial and road champ Steve Cummings will give the team firepower for the intermediate stages. Sprinter Ryan Gibbons, Johann van Zyl, and Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier round out the Vuelta selection for Dimension Data. “We have three very difficult weeks ahead of us but this is exactly what we have prepared for,” said sports director Alex Sans Vega. “The team is really motivated to be part of the action and there is the feeling that we definitely have unfinished business with the 2018 season.” Sagan on the hunt for stage wins at a Vuelta full of opportunities Frame-building icon Pegoretti passes away at age 62 Bookwalter begins new chapter with Mitchelton-Scott in 2019 Week in Tech: Aluminum gravel, Amy D.

While we’d hardly say it’s been a dreadful season (as some California summers can be), we also haven’t really had anything that’s completely blown our minds. With some curious angles and periods, nothing’s really lit up the coast quite yet. The Wedge has been no exception to that experience. She’s woken up and had plenty of waves, but we’ve still been waiting for the place to go off in classic fashion. “This was by far the biggest I’ve ever seen Wedge get,” said videographer Steve Cummings. “I know there’s been bigger days, but this was enormous.” Well, cheers to that. We’ll take as many macking days inside that not so little armpit of the Balboa peninsula as we can get. Besides, we still have plenty of time in that annual south swell window left. ﻿"

Delivered daily to your Inbox! Get Sport24 on your mobile Cape Town - Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka will head to the final grand tour of the season, La Vuelta a Espana, with a strong team spearheaded by South African climber, Louis Meintjes. The 2018 La Vuelta a Espana gets underway on Saturday, August 25 with an 8km prologue in Malaga. Riders will then have to complete a total distance of 3 254km over 21 stages before reaching the finish in Madrid, on September 16. Team Dimension Data will rally around Meintjes as he targets a top general classification result. Meintjes said, “I am looking forward to this year's Vuelta a Espana with Team Dimension Data. It's been a challenging year for the team and for me personally too, but we have worked hard to prepare well and build up nicely ahead of La Vuelta. “At Vuelta a Burgos I think we definitely showed that we were on the right track as the entire team was riding really well. With the same team as in Burgos, now heading to La Vuelta, we have some positive momentum going into the race. Certainly, three weeks of racing is a different kind of beast but the goal for me is to be consistent throughout, take advantage when I am feeling good and try to achieve the best GC result possible.” The tough final week of La Vuelta will certainly suit Meintjes, as his tendency to get stronger as a three-week tour progresses will be further buoyed by the fact that the queen stage, stage 20, takes place in his home European base of Andorra. Alex Sans Vega, sport director for the team, added, “We have three very difficult weeks ahead of us but this is exactly what we have prepared for. We know La Vuelta always produces some of the most difficult grand tour stages, but that also makes it one of the most exciting races of the year. “The team is really motivated to be part of the action and there is the feeling that we definitely have unfinished business with the 2018 season. Louis has been getting better and better, he is a world class rider and grand tours are what he specializes at. We will back him 100 percent at La Vuelta and we have a strong team to do so.” Igor Anton and Merhawi Kudus will be alongside Meintjes in the high mountains, but, as the trio proved at the recent Vuelta a Burgos, they are all able to challenge for stage victories on the most difficult of days too. South African sprinter, Ryan Gibbons, will start his second grand tour of the season, and will have free reign on the sprint stages of this year’s La Vuelta. While the sprinters stage options are limited, Gibbons’ inclusion ensures the African team will be in regular contention for top stage results throughout the race. Steve Cummings, Ben King, and Johann van Zyl will form the backbone of a strong climbing line-up. With 46 summits spread across the 21 stages, the trio will be tasked with laying down the foundation to the team’s overall race ambitions. Completing the line-up will be Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier. The young Eritrean has been impressive in his first season as a neo pro and starts his debut grand tour primarily to gain valuable experience, while supporting the protected riders.

Shake Shack's Andrew Davis discusses the burger chain's plans for Nashville, including partnering with Little Mosko's and Peg Leg Porker.

The 4,000-square-foot restaurant at 4031 Hillsboro Pike fills a high-profile, long-vacant space in the Hill Center Green Hills, steps away from Whole Foods, Lululemon, Anthropologie and Pottery Barn. The restaurant will officially open at 11 a.m. Aug. 23 following a couple of soft opening events earlier in the week. The first 100 people in line Thursday will receive a free make-your-own bouquet from Amelia’s Flower Truck. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. “We’re excited to be here,"" said Andrew Davis, area director of Shake Shack. ""I think it’s a booming time for Nashville — just everything seems to be growing — it’s a huge restaurant scene, and it fits in very well with where we are as a company right now. We’re growing fast and looking for new opportunities.” The restaurant has capacity to seat about 200 people, including a large outdoor patio. Customers can play foosball and shuffleboard in the bright, open space. The interior of the new Shake Shack store at Hill Center in Green Hills, Nashville, Tenn., Tuesday, Aug. 21, 2018.

Bourbon Nib Brittle, chocolate sprinkles and salted caramel sauce. Menu Shake Shack by Dustin Barnes on Scribd “We’ve made some great connections down here,” Davis said. Five percent of sales from the Pie Oh My will support Room In The Inn, which offers emergency support and long-term solutions to the homeless population. When you walk into Shake Shack, you place your order at the counter and pick up your food once it’s ready. You can also skip the line by ordering in advance on the company’s mobile app. The opening of a Nashville Shake Shack outpost has been a long time coming for the roughly 180-unit company — and for Nashville diners who have eaten at the fast-casual eatery in other cities and yearned for a location to open here. A single ShackBurger from Shake Shack (Photo: Courtesy of Shake Shack) The brand was born out of a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park in Manhattan. The success of the cart — which started as founder Danny Meyer’s contribution to help revitalize the park — led to a permanent kiosk in 2004. The concept quickly took off and regularly drew long lines for the simple menu modeled after classic Americana roadside fare. “We’ve always believed in finding the best ingredients, and so our classic ShackBurger is very simple. It’s a cheeseburger, lettuce, tomato and our special ShackSauce but it’s just made with great quality ingredients and we have a lot of integrity with how we source our product,” Davis said. Crinkle-cut fries topped with cheese from Shake Shack (Photo: Courtesy of Shake Shack) Shake Shack’s burgers are made with all-natural Angus beef with no hormones or antibiotics and served on a non-GMO Martin’s potato roll. Other menu items include a crisp-fried portobello mushroom sandwich that is filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese; a crispy chicken sandwich; all-natural Vienna beef hot dogs; frozen custard with no corn syrup and milk from dairy farmers who pledge not to use artificial growth hormones; and the uber-popular crinkle-cut French fries. In Nashville, a ShackBurger costs $5.29 for a single and $7.99 for a double. The ‘Shroom Burger costs $6.89 and crinkle-cut fries cost $2.79. Shake Shack also serves beer and wine, including its own ShackMeister Ale made in collaboration with Brooklyn Brewery. The Nashville restaurant serves local brews from Yazoo, Jackalope, Black Abbey and TailGate. Reach Lizzy Alfs at lalfs@tennessean.com or 615-726-5948 and on Twitter @lizzyalfs.

A high-water mark visible on the garage wall of Andrew Davis' home in the aftermath of flooding in the 3700 block of 4th Avenue in Council Bluffs on Tuesday. The water rose so high in the basement of Christina Prine’s home that her washing machine was floating. The water stood more than 7 feet deep, nearly reaching the ceiling of her 1920s Craftsman-style home in western Council Bluffs, damaging her furnace and water heater and leaving a mess. “It’s terrible,” she said. She and other residents of Council Bluffs and other parts of the Omaha area are cleaning up after Monday’s deluge flooded basements, crept into living rooms and turned some Council Bluffs streets into creeks and yards into ponds. Monday’s 6.16 inches of rain in Omaha was 0.3 of an inch shy of making it the rainiest day in 147 years of record-keeping. More than 10 inches of rain fell in Pottawattamie County over Sunday and Monday. Water restoration businesses said the calls started arriving early Monday from homeowners seeking help for flooded basements. But other people tackled the job themselves, pumping out water and running fans to dry out carpet, furniture and other possessions. Neighborhoods like John Pierson’s in western Council Bluffs were among the hardest hit. He lives on Fourth Avenue near 37th Street and said he had more than a foot of water in the basement, damaging carpeting, furniture and his grandmother’s hutch, which is more than 100 years old. The two sump pumps in the basement couldn’t keep up with the torrents of rain. Andrew Davis lives just a few doors down. His garage had more than a foot of water, damaging a dresser, refrigerator and power tools. His home doesn’t have a basement, but he was worried about the floodwaters that rose up his front steps and eventually crept into the living room. He rushed out Monday morning and bought sandbags for the entries to his home, a last-minute effort that helped. He faced a mess to clean up but was thankful the water didn’t cause much damage to his house. “I consider myself lucky,” he said. Western Council Bluffs is prone to flooding when heavy rain coincides with a high Missouri River. That’s because the west end of the city sits below a levee. If the river is high, the city can’t open the gates that allow water to flow through the levee into the river. Instead, the city has to pump pooling rainwater up over the levee and into the river. That creates an opportunity for water to back up. A vehicle passes through flooded 16th Street near its intersection with Avenue D on Monday in Council Bluffs.

The 24-year-old was given his first chance since round seven, during Saturday's heart-breaking 17-16 loss to Penrith, through a training injury suffered by fullback Michael Gordon which could be season ending. It meant AJ Brimson switched to fullback, allowing Elgey to combine with Ash Taylor in the halves. While there was speculation Elgey may be forced to move to the English Super League to rebuild his career, he said he always wanted to stay in the NRL and is relieved he has some security. Three years ago Manly chased the then 21-year-old during his outstanding rookie season in response to Daly Cherry-Evans moving to the Gold Coast. After Aidan Sezer had departed for Canberra and Cherry Evans reneged on his Titans deal, Elgey stayed loyal to his home club after fans signed a petition to keep here. However, after a pre-season accident forced him to miss the entire 2016 season (coinciding with Taylor's arrival) and he struggled with confidence and a sternum injury in 2017, he has largely been the Titans' forgotten man after new coach Garth Brennan dropped him after the round seven loss to the Cowboys and told him to work on his defence. Brimson took full advantage of his opportunities in the No. 6 jersey and it looked like Elgey would never wear the Titans colours again. He was solid in his return, combining with Taylor to set up a try for winger Phillip Sami and was a dominant ally for Taylor in attack. He was willing in defence despite being targeted but was pushed off by Panthers centre Dean Whare late in the game as Whare squeezed between Elgey and Brendan Elliott to set up a try for Nathan Cleary. ""It's been hard and pretty nerve-wracking,"" said Elgey of the past few months while he knew the Titans would not offer him a contract. ""Of course I was worried [he mightn't get an NRL contract], but I just had to keep at it in 'Q Cup' and hope my manager could get something for me and in the end I had a few options, which was good. ""It is what it is, it's a business. My type of football wasn't what they wanted here and you have to accept that but hopefully I can go down to Manly and get better and better and I just want to keep learning. ""Having [former Titans head coach] John Cartwright at Manly had a lot to do with it, and Trent Barrett, being a five-eighth, as head coach is great. ""I'm hoping I can stay in the Titans team for the next few games and get some confidence to take into next year but if I'm not I'll go back to Tweed and do my best there. ""All my family came out today and treated it like my last game [for the Titans]."" Gordon's injury is tough luck for the 34-year-old veteran who has been in outstanding form. He has a two-hour operation to put his wrist back in place after it became entangled in another player's body in a defensive drill on Wednesday. The Titans announced on Friday Tyrone Roberts will return to the club for two years after he completes the season with Warrington, who are on the way to the Challenge Cup final at Wembley. They are also interested in Melbourne Storm's Riley Jacks as a further back-up in the halves. Brennan confident Peachey will honour Titans deal Peats not letting Slater and Smith distract Titans' focus Titans join forces with NSW Northern Rivers region in historic deal Brimson providing welcomed headache for Brennan Forgotten man Elgey still has plenty to offer"
