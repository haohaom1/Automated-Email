Bob,Diamond,2040,https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/03/fintech-investors-and-founders-to-judge-startup-battlefield-africa/,"TechCrunch will soon be returning to Africa to hold its Startup Battlefield competition dedicated to the African continent. The event, in Lagos, Nigeria, on December 11, will showcase the launch of 15 of the hottest startups in Africa onstage for the first time. We’ll also be joined by some of the leading investment firms in the region. The event is now sold out, but keep your eyes on TechCrunch for video of all the panels and the Battlefield competition. Here are just some of the investors and founders who will be judging the startups competing for US$25,000. Olugbenga Agboola is the CEO of Flutterwave, a payments technology company headquartered in San Francisco with operations and offices across Africa and Europe. Prior to co-founding Flutterwave, Olugbenga contributed to the development of fintech solutions at several tech companies and financial institutions such as PayPal and Standard Bank, among others. He is a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits under his belt. He is a software engineer with a Master’s Degree in Information Technology Security and Behavioral Engineering, as well as an MBA. Barbara Iyayi is the chief growth officer and managing director of Africa for Element, which deploys AI-powered mobile biometrics software to develop digital platforms globally. Barbara was part of the founding team of Atlas Mara, a London stock exchange-listed company, co-founded by Bob Diamond, ex-CEO of Barclays Bank, which was the first-ever entity to raise more than $1 billion to invest in, operate and manage financial institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the Regional Lead for M&A and Investments, she led investments into banks and developed the banking platform’s entry into seven countries in Africa. Notably, she led the acquisition and first-ever merger of two banks in Rwanda, to be the leading innovative retail bank — Banque Populaire du Rwanda — and led a $250 million equity investment in Union Bank of Nigeria. Aaron is an early-stage investor, entrepreneur and strategic advisor to both startups as they scale and corporates as they transform to gain agility for disruptive innovation. Over the last five years he has specifically focused on innovation in Africa, working with global brands and entrepreneurs across diverse industries, from financial services to health to mobile to agriculture. As managing director at MEST, he is dedicated to training, investing in and incubating the next generation of global software entrepreneurs in Africa. He manages a portfolio of 30-plus startups spanning fintech, media, e-commerce and agritech. Sam Gichuru is founder and CEO of Nailab, one of Kenya’ s leading business incubators. His contribution in establishing the startup business ecosystem in Kenya, through Nailab, has been significant, and as a result was invited as a key speaker during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, held in Nairobi and officiated by then U.S. President Barack Obama. Sam has been instrumental in propagating the development of a strong and vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it’s through this engagement that he was most recently selected by Jack Ma to lead, through Nailab, the Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a $10 million Initiative that seeks to discover, spotlight and support 10 African entrepreneurs every year for the next 10 years. Olufunbi Falayi is a partner at Passion Incubator, an early-stage technology incubator and accelerator that invests in early-stage startups.

Please turn on JavaScript for the best possible experience. Quick links By Gareth Dennison | 03/12/2018 HOUSE-building is finally expected to start on the site of a notorious estate — 11 years after the old properties were demolished, the council has said. The former Chesterhill area at Thrybergh (pictured) was promised regeneration after the bulldozers arrived in 2008 and attracting developers has proved difficult. There has been criticism that Rotherham Borough Council’s local plan — moving land out of greenbelt — has meant developers’ heads have been turned elsewhere. Work on Chesterhill and nearby Whinney Hill had been expected to begin in 2016 but the scheme from Keepmoat — announced in 2013 — fell through. Rotherham Borough Council has said a procurement exercise to find a new partner will begin before the end of the year. A spokesman added: “These are strategically important sites and will make a significant contribution to the borough’s housing growth target. “The council will ensure that development commences as soon as possible and it is anticipated that work will start during 2019.” It is expected that the sites will accommodate about 240 homes when finally developed. Campaigner Michael Sylvester raised the matter with cabinet members earlier this year — pointing out that RMBC’s website still had the 2016 start date target. He has now been offered a meeting with Jane Davies, head of strategic housing and development, to discuss the efforts being made to find a development partner. Mr Sylvester said: “There are still questions around why the last scheme failed, and what lessons have been learned. “Why did the failure only became public after my questioning at cabinet in May? Why was the 2016 story published if proposals were not at an advanced stage?” Mr Sylvester welcomed the meeting offer — but asked that the invitation be extended to the chairmen of Dalton and Thrybergh parish councils. “They were heavily involved in the failed Keepmoat proposals and have not been kept well informed with regards to the development status,” he added.

Paula,Lunder,2037,https://www.macon.com/news/business/article222523650.html,"December 02, 2018 02:39 PM The Maine College of Art has received a $3 million donation to help pay tuition and plan for its future. MECA President Laura Freid tells the Portland Herald Press the gift from Peter and Paula Lunder through the Lunder Foundation is the largest donation for financial aid in the school's history. The college will use $2.5 million of the donation to pay for tuition for students from low- and middle-income families. The gift is a challenge match and could increase to $6 million. MECA Vice President Matt Goetting says it will allow the school to expand its financial aid program and recruit more students from Maine. Goetting says reducing the debt burden is a nationwide issue.

Andrew,Davis,2034,http://www.wdrb.com/story/39572870/as-ntsb-gets-to-work-mentor-figure-killed-in-plane-crash-remembered,"MEMPHIS, Ind. (WDRB) -- At the Mockingbird Valley Soccer Club, a Saturday night match of youth soccer felt different. ""I think it's still shock,"" said Scott Budnick, the Kentucky Fire Juniors boy's program director. ""I'm still struggling to get my head around it."" Wayne Estopinal, one of the three who died in a Friday plane crash, made the complex possible with lots of money, love and energy. ""You knew you were in the presence of someone with a lot of influence and with a lot of passion,"" said Tim Nowak, the girl's program director. ""He wanted to share the game, most particularly, with the youth, because I think he wanted to share his love of the sport and the culture with the future players of tomorrow,"" added Budnick. Both Nowak and Budnick worked for Estopinal and learned a lot from him. ""Wayne's made me a better coach. There's no doubt about,"" Nowak said. ""He challenged me personally to be better at what I do."" Clark County's coroner has now officially identified 63-year-old Estopinal as one of the three who died in the crash, along with 54-year-old Sandra Johnson and 32-year-old Andrew Davis. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board now has boots on the ground to investigate the crash. ""Typically, what happen is the investigator will arrive on scene and will begin documenting the scene and examining the aircraft. They will be looking for the four parts of the aircraft: that's the nose, two wings, and the tail,"" said Keith Holloway, a spokesperson for the NTSB. Holloway says the investigator will work to recover those bits and pieces quickly, especially evidence that's perishable, in an effort to determine a cause. ""Our goal is to determine what caused it and to prevent it ... possibly prevent it ... from happening again from a safety perspective,"" he said. ""We don't assign blame."" He says no two crashes are the same. Investigators will determine if weather, human error, mechanical issues, or a combination played a part. ""I suspect the investigators should probably be on the scene for the next couple of days,"" he said. Holloway wants anyone who witnessed the crash and has information about it to call authorities or e-mail the NTSB at witness@ntsb.gov. Related stories: Copyright 2018 WDRB Media.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://www.nola.com/news/2018/12/shreveport-woman-among-three-killed-in-indiana-plane-crash-ap.html,"By The Associated Press MEMPHIS, Ind. â Coroners have identified the final two people killed when a small Chicago-bound jet crashed shortly after taking off from a southern Indiana airport. The Clark County coronerâs office said Saturday the crash on Friday (Nov. 30) killed the pilot, 32-year-old Andrew Davis of Sellersburg, Indiana, and 54-year-old passenger Sandra Holland Johnson of Shreveport, Louisiana. Authorities had previously identified the third person killed as 63-year-old Wayne Estopinal from Louisville, Kentucky. He was an architect and a board member of Ball State University. A cause for the crash hasn't been determined. The Federal Aviation Administration says flight plans indicate only three people were on the small plane when it left Clark Regional Airport late Friday morning en route to Chicago's Midway Airport. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Cessna Citation.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/marie-mitchell/,"Marie Mitchell, an associate professor in the Terry College of Business, conducts research that helps organizations promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Where did you earn degrees and what are your current responsibilities at UGA? I have a bachelor’s degree in political science, minoring in English literature, from George Mason University, a master’s degree in human resource management from Rollins College, and a Ph.D. in business administration, specializing in organizational behavior, from the University of Central Florida. I teach a variety of management topics (e.g. negotiations, leadership and human resource management) at all levels—undergraduate, MBA (full-time, professionals and executives) as well as doctoral students. Beyond teaching, my research focuses on social and ethical issues within organizations, such as mistreatment and unethical behavior in the workplace. I work closely with students—mentoring scholarship, sitting on dissertation committees and advising Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities projects. I also enjoy other service-oriented activities, such as being a member of the Terry College Diversity Advisory Council, and serving as the faculty advisor for the UGA Chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management. When did you come to UGA and what brought you here? I joined UGA in 2009 as an assistant professor, coming from the University of Nebraska. I was thrilled to join the Terry College of Business’ department of management, which is filled with smart, productive and friendly colleagues. It was clearly the right fit for me. What are your favorite courses and why? Negotiations is one of my favorite courses to teach. The material is immediately applicable to students, and it is fun to watch them develop over the semester. Many students have followed up with me, seeking advice on how to improve on topics like traversing job offers, organizational conflicts and career development. I also have had students send me updates on successes, negotiating more to their base salary or discussing win-win solutions at work. It makes me proud. Teaching doctoral students is another favorite. My doctoral seminars emphasize theory and methods, and so we engage in lively conversations about how to evaluate published work and developing research ideas. It’s enormously satisfying when students bring their ideas to life in a research publication. Those types of teaching moments are enriching because they make a lasting impact on the students’ lives. Marie Mitchell meets with doctoral students in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) What are some highlights of your career at UGA? I have had a number of highlights in my research, teaching and service. My research has contributed to strides in the management literature by demonstrating the implications of abusive supervision and the causes of unethical work behavior. There are many teaching high points—e.g., each time a student emails a success story, and publishing with Ph.D. students. Teaching recognitions are also meaningful. In 2017, I received the Terry College Outstanding Teacher Award and the Executive MBA Teacher of the Year Award. This year, I was selected to receive the Teaching Excellence Award for the Terry College. Lastly, there are many meaningful roles I have served for the university (e.g., Academic Honesty Panel), Terry College (e.g., Diversity Advisory Board, Special Certificate Programs), and my department (e.g., Society for Human Resource Management Faculty Advisor), as well as serving as an associate editor for the journal Personnel Psychology, where I shape scholarship for the organizational sciences. How do you describe the scope and impact of your research or scholarship to people outside of your field? My research appeals to outsiders because I study deviant, unethical and dark work behaviors. These behaviors can create a lot of dysfunction for organizations, their members and society more generally. As a recent example, I gave interviews on my research that explained why performance pressure motivates workplace cheating behavior. Interviewers understood the impact of the study, given high-profile examples (e.g., Wells Fargo employees opening fraudulent accounts, the Volkswagen emissions scandal). I also relay how costly these behaviors are and highlight how organizations can dissuade employees from engaging in these behaviors and how to promote functional, productive and ethical work behavior. Organizations and their employees can impact society because, when they act inappropriately, it can send a ripple across society that promotes new laws and regulations and a general sense of distrust in business. Accordingly, outsiders “get” the scope and need for what I study. How does your research or scholarship inspire your teaching, and vice versa? My research on workplace relationships feeds into my course material on cultivating relationships, leadership and performance management. Developing and maintaining strong work relationships are critical for heightening employee performance and effective work environments. My research on ethics is highlighted in every course I teach—ethics is a foundation by which all management topics should align. Likewise, the topics discussed in my courses enrich ideas for my research, fine-tuning the applicability of what I study to practitioners. What do you hope students gain from their classroom experience with you? I am very hopeful that students gain skills, knowledge and abilities that will enrich their lives. Describe your ideal student. The ideal student is curious, engaged, dedicated and coachable. Students who approach their studies with zest and ask critical questions set a high bar in the classroom. However, coachability—the ability to learn and develop—also is needed for success. Being able to identify what works and what can be improved upon is critical for a student to grow and for them to pay it forward by developing others. Favorite place to be/thing to do on campus is… One of my favorite things to do is walk through campus, particularly during the fall. Campus is beautiful. Watching the students hustle to class, play with their dogs, study on the lawn and engage with one another is fun. Marie Mitchell listens to a doctoral student during a meeting in one of the team rooms inside Amos Hall. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) Beyond the UGA campus, I like to… I love spending time with my family, and enjoy traveling and cooking. Community/civic involvement includes…. I am actively involved in the academic community outside of UGA, sitting on journal editorial boards, being associate editor at Personnel Psychology and serving in a variety of roles for the Academy of Management. I also give time to the overall UGA community by guest speaking as an ethics expert or providing job negotiation workshops to student groups. Favorite book/movie (and why)? As an undergraduate minor in English literature, one book had a lasting impact: “The Wide Sargasso Sea” by Jean Rhys. This book explains how the crazy wife ends up in the attic in Charlotte Bronte’s novel, “Jane Eyre” (which I also love). There are two key learning moments from it. First, the book provides a cautionary tale of getting caught up in pressures from society and of relationships that can impair a person’s development and freedom. Second, I had to write a paper about this book, comparing it to another. I can’t even remember the name of the other book, and that stood out in my analyses, forcing my teacher to ask me to redo my paper. What sticks with me from that experience is that when you are passionate about something, it shows. Be passionate and interested in what you do. The one UGA experience I will always remember will be… I have had many memorable experiences at UGA. In participating in various graduations, though, I truly enjoyed hearing Alton Brown speak. He was entertaining and funny, while also relaying good takeaways for students. Is there anything else you’d like to add? (Other pertinent information to share) I’m a mom of two—both are UGA students—and a wife of my supportive and loving husband, Chad. Our family also includes our two dogs, who keep us smiling.

Andrew,Davis,2034,https://news.uga.edu/gallery-sec-championship-2018/,"Three unanswered touchdowns from No. 1 Alabama lifted the Crimson Tide past No. 4 Georgia Bulldogs in a 35-28 finish Saturday in the 2018 SEC Championship Game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Bulldogs will represent the Southeastern Conference and play Big 12 runnerup Texas in the Allstate Sugar Bowl scheduled for Jan. 1, 2019, in New Orleans. Kickoff for the game between the fifth-ranked Bulldogs (11-2) and the Big 12 Longhorns (9-4) is scheduled for 8:45 p.m. and be televised on ESPN. This will be the fifth all time meeting between the programs. “It was a tremendous atmosphere, the SEC Championship Game once again is one of the best games of the year,” Georgia head coach Kirby Smart said. “A lot of credit goes to Alabama, they outperformed us in the second half. The game had a lot of momentum swings – up and down, back and forth, which we knew it would. We have a lot of champions on this team and a lot of kids that have a heart of a lion like these two [Jonathan Ledbetter and Jake Fromm at the podium] right here, especially. They lead this team and care about this university and play really hard.” “[The Sugar Bowl] will be an outstanding experience for our coaches, players, and fans,” Smart said. “Most of our coaches and none of our players have had the opportunity of a Sugar Bowl trip and I’m especially proud for our seniors who have worked so hard over the last 12 months. It also presents a great opportunity for our fans who have been so supportive of our team throughout the season.” UGA photographers Andrew Davis Tucker, Peter Frey and Dorothy Kozlowski captured Bulldog Nation supporting the team in the gallery above.

Michael,Gordon,2032,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/environment/article_7da69ba8-f4c2-11e8-b613-0fae15bf505f.html,"Though Louisiana enjoyed a quiet hurricane season — which ended with the turn of the calendar — there was an above-average number of Atlantic storms. Meteorologists kept expecting an El Niño system, the development of particularly warm water in the Pacific Ocean, to form and beat back tropical storm formation in the Atlantic, but it never came, explained state climatologist Barry Keim. Instead, the season became more active toward the end, he continued. That's good news for Louisiana, which normally faces the most danger from hurricanes earlier in the season. Toward the end of the season, more storms are shunted up the East Coast. A hurricane has never made landfall in Louisiana in the month of November, Keim said. Just three storms struck the Gulf Coast in 2018 — Alberto, Gordon and Michael. Gordon came closest to Louisiana, prompting an emergency gear-up that included the mobilization of the National Guard, but it veered east of the state. ""We kind of dodged a bullet there. ... It had almost no effect on Louisiana,"" Keim said. Nevertheless, 2018 was a notable season. For the fourth year in a row, tropical storms formed prior to the official June 1 hurricane season start date, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration pointed out. And for the first time in a decade, four storms were active at the same time. The 15 total tropical storms were higher than the average 12. Florence and Michael were the most destructive, ravaging the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle, respectively. Keim expects both names to be retired, as is done with storms that are particularly strong or do significant damage. He emphasized that just because this year was slow doesn't mean 2019 will be as well. ""You just never know,"" Keim said. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Joel,Cutler,2031,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20181201/football-joel-cutler-wont-return-as-coach-at-upper-arlington,"Joel Cutler is looking to his future, one that will not include a sixth season as Upper Arlington High School football coach. Cutler led the Golden Bears for almost five full seasons but was placed on administrative leave Oct. 17 while the handling of health and wellness issues for his players was investigated. The school district posted the supplemental contract for his position Nov. 30. Cutler said he contacted the district office earlier in the day and informed them he did not intend to re-apply for next season. “At this point, I’m just focusing on my future and the next chapter of my career,” said Cutler, who did not comment on the investigation. “It’s been a trying situation. I’m very lucky to have a supporting, understanding wife (Elaine) and two wonderful sons (T.J. and Zack) and great family and friends. I’m very grateful for any and all support I’ve received throughout the whole process.” According to district director of communications Karen Truett, Cutler notified the district Nov. 30 that he was not going to re-apply for the job. “Coach Cutler does not intend to apply for the head football (coaching) position in 2019,” athletics director Tony Pusateri said. “We’re just going to go on from here.” UA went 1-1 in Cutler’s absence but lost to Dublin Coffman 17-0 on Oct. 26 to end the regular season and fall short of making the playoffs in Division I, Region 2. The Bears finished 5-5 overall and 3-2 in the OCC-Central Division and placed ninth in the Region 2 computer ratings as the top eight teams qualified for the postseason. Not counting the games he missed this season, Cutler went 29-21 overall and 14-13 in the league at UA. The Bears made the playoffs just once, in 2015, and went 0-11 against their two biggest rivals, Coffman and Hilliard Davidson. Assistant coach Barry Fox led the team in Cutler’s absence. “The whole time I’ve been here, I’ve been blessed with a great group of men, both coaches and players, who always strived to do the right thing,” Cutler said. “I’m pleased with and proud of how they handled the situation.” Cutler will continue to teach physical education at Greensview Elementary School in the UA district. Applicants to succeed Cutler should send a cover letter, résumé and references to Kristy Garrison at kgarrison@uaschools.org by Dec. 8. dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Nov. 30, 2018.(Photo: By Pat McDonogh, Courier Journal)Buy Photo The pilot killed in a small jet crash in Southern Indiana with two others was a beloved husband and father who had only this year joined the architectural firm that owned the plane. Andrew Davis, 32, was taking passengers Wayne Estopinal and Sandra Holland Johnson to Chicago from Clark Regional Airport on Friday when it crashed in a rural area a few miles from the airport. All three died and investigators are still determining what caused the crash. Davis, of Sellersburg, was an associate corporate pilot at TEG Architects, a firm led by Estopinal. The company announced in September that he had joined the firm this year, according to a news release on TEG's website. Sarah Barlowe, his sister, told the Courier Journal that he had started at the beginning of the year. He was married and had two young children, according to a Facebook post by a friend. Related: Indiana jet crash victim Sandra Johnson had zest for life, friends say Around 2 a.m. Saturday, his wife, Erica, posted on Facebook about the crash. Hundreds of people commented on the post with condolences. Please tell me this nightmare is over.... I’m waiting for his never ending flight to land. I’m waiting for our celebration weekend we were going to have. I’m waiting to make more adventures with you. We waited there for you, but you didn’t show. You always show. Time has stopped, my body is numb, my stomach aches, my beautiful cloud is dark. I’m hoping to see Jesus through this all. So many things I don’t understand. Just please come home we miss you!!! — Erica Davis on Facebook Earlier this year Andrew Davis traveled on a mission trip to Salcedo, Dominican Republic, with a group from the New Albany-based Northside Christian Church, according to a post on his Facebook page. Davis was part of a team of 300 people that helped build homes and host sports camps, among other activities. According to a Facebook post by his wife, his project was to help build a house in four days. Sam Thomas, Northside's executive pastor, said Andrew Davis' family has been attending Northside for almost 20 years. In addition to going on the mission trip, he was also involved with the church's college-aged ministry. ""When we found out about this, you could just feel the loss,"" Thomas said. ""He was by all accounts really gregarious and got to know a lot of people very well."" On Sunday, Davis' family and his wife Erica were in attendance. After the service, churchgoers lined up to hug them, hold them and pray with them. His wife Erica's Facebook page is filled with loving pictures and videos of her husband and children and odes to his support. In October, she wrote: ""He brings balance to my life, what more could I ask for. He is a rare kind."" And in September: ""I'll fly with you till the ends of the Earth."" Read this: A normal takeoff then silence. What air traffic heard before plane crashed Davis graduated from Indiana State University with a degree in professional aviation flight technology and aerospace administration. Previously, he was a lead captain and corporate pilot at Soin International and Muncie Aviation Co., according to TEG. He was taking Estopinal — an influential local figure who helped design University of Louisville sports facilities and bring Louisville City FC to the city — and Johnson to Chicago's Midway International Airport from Clark County Regional Airport. The plane, which was based in Clark County, never made it. Some six minutes after taking off, the plane turned back for the airport shortly before crashing near Memphis, Indiana. There were no survivors. It still isn't clear why the plane went down. Air traffic control chatter around the time of the crash appears to show a normal takeoff for the Cessna from Clark County Regional Airport. A few minutes later, though, a Louisville air controller is heard asking the plane to call back. Only silence followed.

Background: Indiana plane crash kills 3, including LouCity founder Wayne Estopinal More: Pilot of crashed Indiana jet also worked for Wayne Estopinal's firm The Chicago-bound jet lost contact with air traffic controllers and tried to return to the Clark Regional Airport just before it crashed in a wooded area around 11:30 a.m., authorities said. There were no survivors. It is not yet clear how the plane went down. Investigators worked through the night and were still on the scene Saturday afternoon combing through what was left of the plane. Clark Regional Airport Manager John Secor said the 300-yard debris field indicated that the plane, a Cessna 525, did not break up in air but was torn apart when it hit the trees. The three victims worked for TEG Architects, where Estopinal was the president. His company owned the jet.

Andrew,Davis,2030,https://www.gazetteseries.co.uk/news/17269505.yate-and-sodbury-scooter-club-makes-huge-donation-to-hospital/,"Dursley 6°c Yate and Chipping Sodbury Scooter Club have been thanked by the Bristol Children’s Hospital after donating £1000 to the facility over the last two years. The club, which has been running for just over three years, was started by Yate residents Kevin Milford and Andrew Davis. Originally starting with just the pair of them, the group has grown to have over 150 members on their Facebook page and regularly have 15-30 scooters attending monthly meetings. Existing members of the group range from 5 to 75-year-olds, with enthusiasts being able to show off their classic, vintage scooters to one another. In October this year the club held their 2nd annual charity soul night, this gave members and guests a chance to enjoy classics from the 60’s and 70’s. Sponsored by Mark’s Mobile Butchers, the event raised an incredible £650.00 for the hospital, on top of the £350 raise from the original event in 2017. The club are however looking for a new sponsor for next year’s events after every single bit of profit made from the two events was given to the BRCH. Andrew Davis revealed after handing over the cheque for the money that the club would love to see new faces join. “We are a community club that welcomes anyone with an interest in Scooters,” he said. “Everyone is welcome to come along to our monthly meetings and become involved in a very social community. “We attend scooter rallies around the UK and often meet other clubs around the South West.” Anyone wanting more information can find the group on Facebook and Instagram under Yate and Sodbury Scooter Club Lydia McGivern of Above & Beyond said: “Thanks so much to everyone at the Yate and Sodbury Scooter Club for all their amazing fundraising for the second year in a row. “They were really dedicated and have raised an incredible amount for the Play Centre at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. “The funds they have raised will be invaluable to the team at the hospital.""

Andrew,Davis,2030,https://www.broadwayworld.com/chicago/article/Photo-Flash-TheLyric-Opera-of-Chicago-Presents-CENDRILLION-20181130,"The Lyric Opera of Chicago premiere of Jules Massenet's charming fairytale opera Cendrillon (Cinderella) opens Saturday, December 1 at 7:30pm. There are six performances Dec. 1 through Jan. 20 at the Lyric Opera House, 20 N. Wacker Dr., Chicago. Tickets start at $49 for adults and just $20 for children, and are available now at lyricopera.org/Cendrillon or at 312-827-5600. Lyric's presentation of Cendrillon features a fabulous international cast of new and returning artists to portray the colorful characters of this familiar and beloved fairytale. Australian soprano Siobhan Stagg makes her American debut as the titular Cinderella, English mezzo-soprano Alice Coote returns to Lyric in a signature portrayal as the pouting prince whose passions are awakened, and Canadian soprano Marie-Eve Munger (Lyric debut) sings stratospherically high notes as the glamorous and sassy fairy godmother. Cinderella's henpecked father Pandolfe is sung by Australian-born bass-baritone Derek Welton (Lyric debut). American mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Bishop(Lyric debut) portrays the bossy stepmother, while Ryan Opera Center soprano Emily Pogorelc (Lyric debut) and mezzo-soprano Kayleigh Decker play the absurdly funny stepsisters. Members of the Lyric Opera Chorus nearly steal the show with their hilariously exaggerated movements and outlandish costumes, portraying courtiers, servants, and a parade of hopeful princesses. Sir Andrew Davis conducts the Lyric Opera Orchestra in the production he led previously in Barcelona. French director Laurent Pelly (Lyric debut) is also the costume designer, and the whimsically sculptural attire onstage is sure to draw gasps of astonishment and delight. Belgian native Barbara de Limburg (Lyric debut) has created scenery incorporating giant storybook pages. Duane Schuler is lighting designer, Michael Black is chorus master, France-based Laura Scozzi (Lyric debut) is the original choreographer, and French choreographer Karine Girard (Lyric debut) is the revival choreographer. Cendrillon is performed in French with projected English translations.

Steve,Cummings,2028,https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/andrea-tafi-not-listed-dimension-data-roster-2019-despite-rumours-will-join-team-401515,"The 52-year-old says he has found a team to support his Paris-Roubaix return Andrea Tafi Andrea Tafi has not been listed in the 2019 Dimension Data roster despite rumours he would ride for the South African team. Tafi plans to ride Paris-Roubaix next year, 20 years after he took home the coveted cobble trophy. The 52-year-old has registered with the UCI testing pool and says he has found a team to support his ambition. >>> Bradley Wiggins takes full control of Team Wiggins Rumours had circulated that Tafi would join Dimension Data for the 2019 Monument, but the team has denied that. The 2019 rider roster for Dimension Data, published last week, includes Brits Mark Cavendish and Steve Cummings, as well as new signings Enrico Gasparotto and Giacomo Nizzolo, but no Tafi. Head of performance at Dimension Data, Rolf Aldag told Cyclingnews that Tafi will not be riding for the WorldTour team. Aldag said: “He’s not with us, I can guarantee you that.” Tafi won the French cobbled Monument in 1999 as Italian champion, then 32 years old, with Team Mapei. The Tuscan retired in 2005. His last participation, 14 years ago, he placed 42nd racing for Team Saunier Duval. >>> Team Sky unveil 2019 kit Australian Mathew Hayman (Mitchelton-Scott) won the race in 2016 at 37 years old. The oldest winner is Frenchman Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle, who won twice, the second time in 1993 at 38 years old. No one ever retired and returned 20 years later to race, let alone win. Tafi’s former team-mate Paolo Bettini recently spoke publicly to discourage Tafi from riding the cobbled Classic. Bettini said: “To Andrea I say, I hope you don’t race, you need to do something else in your life at 52 years old.” Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

Sara,Burns,2024,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-shooting-city-budget-taxes-1.4925871,"Fredericton council has voted against relying only on a tax increase to cover a $2.1 million budget shortfall partly caused by the shootings of four people in August. Council may also try scaling back or postponing projects such as the Officers' Square revamp, the all-wheel sports plaza, a new performing arts centre and a new swimming pool, said finance committee chair Greg Ericson. ""Everything's on the table,"" Ericson told Information Morning Fredericton. Residents could still see a tax increase alongside budget cuts, but Ericson expected it would be less than the three per cent proposed by staff earlier this month. If councillors can't find enough suitable cuts to pay for the deficit, they may revisit the three per cent increase, which would cost the average Fredericton homeowner $66 a year. According to a Nov. 19 city report, the shooting of two police officers and two civilians will cost the city up to $1.5 million over the next two years, but that's not counting the cost of the regimental funeral and the special investigation. Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were shot death outside a north-side apartment building on Aug. 12. ""The year 2018 has seen some extraordinary events that have had some really serious impacts on the city's budget,"" Ericson said. Ericson said the Officers' Square revamp is likely safer from cuts than other public works projects because of the safety elements involved, including failing infrastructure. A renovated square is also ""part of a larger vision for helping the economic development of the downtown,"" he said. Ericson said the city is trying to stay away from cuts in projects to replace aging infrastructure because if something fails, it is much more expensive to repair. ""There's that renewal portion that's on the table, but we're loath to go at it because that's what offers the ounce-of-prevention-equals-a-pound-of-cure dynamic,"" Ericson said. He said there's no time for public consultation on this issue, so they will have to look back on previous public consultations to create priorities. ""I think what we have to do is consult what we've done for public engagement leading up to this moment and to assess how broad the support is for these projects,"" he said. Ericson said he understands that raising taxes may have an impact on Fredericton residents, especially people with low income, but the shootings were unforeseen. ""We've got a lot of time still in the budget process to make sure that at the end of it, no one can doubt our thoroughness and know how much time and attention we've put into trying to avoid a tax increase.""

Michael,Gordon,2023,https://www.theage.com.au/national/a-welcome-chance-to-strengthen-australian-journalism-20181129-p50j8t.html,"Billionaires are becoming increasingly strategic in their philanthropy. They are not only giving to the poor but also looking for ways to deliver long-term change in our society. Frank Lowy blazed a trail when he endowed his foreign policy think tank, as did Andrew Forrest when he endowed a fund to fight global slavery. Judith Neilson – a Sydney-based property billionaire and art-gallery owner – set a new precedent on Monday by pledging $100 million for ‘‘targeted funding and education’’ to ‘‘strengthen Australian journalism and help restore faith in its central role in a healthy democracy”. Billionaire Judith Neilson has pledged $100 million to further the cause of journalism.Credit:Janie Barrett The Age welcomes the initiative, which is obviously close to our hearts, and wants to highlight what might be required to maximise the impact of this generous fund. The entry of not-for-profit organisations into journalism is not new. In Europe and the US, many news organisations operate as not-for-profits. Some web-based news organisations are financed by donations and bequests. Australia already has a huge not-for-profit news organisation called the ABC, and various think tanks and journalism faculties also popularise research via online sites such as The Conversation. It sounds easy to make good journalism but it is actually hard. And expensive. The challenge is not just to produce information but to package it and focus it so that it has an impact on society and brings about concrete change. This is something we aim for every day. Ms Neilson has indicated her institute will start by encouraging reporting on Asia. The Age is right there and maintains correspondents in Jakarta and Beijing. If the Neilson Institute is to make a difference, it must think how to complement, rather than simply reproduce, what other foreign correspondents already produce. The Australian media did a fine job covering the drama of the cave rescue in Thailand, without help. The Age argues that the institute’s focus should be stories that have a measurable impact on Australia’s relations with the region, but the money must also be directed to the stories that take a long time to report and require costly travel outside the big cities. Offering journalists, including Age journalists, help in that task could be invaluable, although we have been managing well without it. The freshly launched Michael Gordon Fellowship will also help journalists cover social interest stories in Australia that may not be reported on without extra funding. If the institute promotes journalism, it will quickly discover that everything it does will be political. The Age strives for evidence-based, impartial public-interest journalism but still comes under attack from all sides of politics. The institute must have a board that ignores these jibes, but it will be able to do so only if it steers away from the flood of opinion and promotes real investigative journalism. As for-profit news organisations have cut budgets, coverage of some topics has been stretched thin. Journalism on Indigenous and rural affairs could do with help, and there is a need for forensic, time-consuming investigations into business. If the institute produces its own journalism, it should complement what we already do. It can help the whole journalism world, too, by offering resources and infrastructure such as public databases so we can push the boundaries further. Copyright © 2018

James,Crook,2022,https://www.pendletoday.co.uk/sport/more-sport/trawden-athletics-club-youngsters-steal-the-show-1-9467949,"Some of the best runners in the country converged on Liverpool on Saturday with places in the British Athletics team for next month’s European Cross Country Championships in Holland up for grabs. And again it was the youngsters from Trawden AC who stole the show. Stan Stephenson was second in the Under 11 boys’ race, with Harry Smith sixth and Harry Jordan 25th; Joss Waiting, Eve Hartley and Isabel Holt ran well in the Under 11s girls’ event; Abigail Stratton, Amelia Dugdale and Ellie Singleton were the pick of the Under 15s’ girls, with Harry Beechey giving a strong performance in the Under 15s’ boys, and Jasmine Aherne was the pick of the Under 17s girls. In the men’s race, Jamie Osborne, Adrian Blackledge, David Howard, John McDonald, Chris O’Brien and Allan Boult were the leading Trawden runners with Katie Lomas, Dawn Tibbs, Julie Townson, Caroline Fleming, Jenny McAndrew and Jen Townson putting in strong team runs in the ladies’ race. One of the most eagerly-anticipated events of the running calendar followed on Sunday with the Lee Mills Fell Relay at Stacksteads. The testing 10.7km route sees teams of four running in relay format. Kevin Salter, Mark Storey, Paul Redman and David Fort were 18th team, with Jamie McIlvenny, Craig Storozuk, Adam Wallwork and James Crook 20th. Shaun Heys, Martin Greenwood and Kevin Fenton-Clough were 38th and there were also good performances from the ladies teams – Claire Storozuk, Lucy Brown, Emily O’Connor and Vic Rogan, and Tracy Parkinson, Karen Windle, Elaine Corcoran and Liz Allison. Also on Sunday, the Kong Mini Mountain Marathon series concluded with a four-hour race in Derbyshire with Mick Dobson and Kerrie-Anne Bretherton winning the mixed veteran 40 category, to earn a series win. Fionnuala Swan and Fiona Hall were fifth, to earn them a seventh in the series. Saturday saw the Wesham 10k with David Lord claiming 32nd and the V55 prize and Robert Smith making a welcome return to racing, and on Sunday Stephanie McArdle-Watson put in a strong performance in the Wilmslow 10k. Saturday also saw more than 60 Trawden runners in parkrun action - the majority at Pendle, where Adam Holda was second and Isabel Hartley first lady and the furthest afield being Linda Ensby and Graham Denney at the Western Springs event in New Zealand. ©2018 JPIMedia Ltd.All rights reserved.

Commercial real estate brokerage CBRE|The Boulos Co. of Portland is dropping its affiliation with international brand CBRE Group Inc. after 17 years. Boulos, which operates brokerages in Maine and New Hampshire, said Thursday that going independent will allow it to have more autonomy and build new relationships. The company, founded by Joe Boulos in 1975, said it will drop CBRE from its name as of Dec. 31 but will not make any changes to its ownership, management or personnel. The company has over 30 employees working at its Portland headquarters. “Our relationships with local developers, business owners and property owners will not change, nor will our commitment to their success or our ability to tap into the national marketplace,” said Boulos Managing Director and Partner Drew Sigfridson in a news release. Boulos said the change will allow for more flexible, local advertising and marketing decisions. The company said it plans to enhance its property listing service and deploy more creative and agile marketing strategies with a more customized platform. It is developing a new website that will feature a more user-friendly and visually appealing listing searches as well as property photo galleries, according to the release. An expanded social media presence is also in the works, it said. A worldwide company with roughly 450 corporate and franchise locations, CBRE has a long and complex ownership history but was essentially formed by the merger of Coldwell Banker and Richard Ellis International in the late 1990s. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CBRE. J.

(Free parking at the college on Friday evenings. Follow signs at entrance.) For more information, visit http://www.olliorchestra.org The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute Orchestra Sierra College Nevada County Campus will perform their free fall semester concert at 7:30 p.m. Friday in the Multi-purpose Room N12 at Sierra College off Sierra College Drive in Grass Valley. Conductor and composer Steve Miller has led the OLLI Orchestra for 15 years and is happy to bring this offering to the community. Miller became involved with Sierra College after completing his master's degree in music from California State University Sacramento. Sierra College was looking for instructors and he took on a part time teaching position as well as conducting the orchestra. He says is he is happy to aid life-long learners in the continuation of their expression of music. Miller said the orchestra includes about 40 members with a variety of backgrounds and various levels of skilled musicians, from ""the advanced to the less advanced."" Musical stories The fall program features pieces that tell a story. Britta Tigan, marketing and administrative volunteer for the orchestra said, ""The best music tells stories or reveals ideas. The pieces performed by OLLI Orchestra on Friday are rich with both stories and ideas."" She said the orchestra will be telling several stories through music. Gioachino Rossini's ""The Italian Girl in Algiers"" is about strong women who get what they want and self-aggrandizing pompous men who stand in their way. The allegorical drama ""Peer Gynt"" by Edvard Grieg tells Ibsen's story of the downfall and subsequent redemption of a Norwegian peasant anti-hero. Audiences will immediately recognize ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" because of its wide use in movies. Jules Massenet's ""Scenes Pittoresques"" consists of four unrelated but perfectly matched character pieces. It represents Massenet's best musical inspiration as well as the finely-crafted and detailed work for which he is famous. The evening will also include the world premiere of conductor Miller's composition, ""Sketches from Nature"" in three movements which he wrote specifically for the OLLI Orchestra. He says he is looking forward to having the orchestra perform his piece for the community. Miller says the atmosphere at the concert is very informal. He likes to tell the story or give a bit of background on each of the pieces before leading the orchestral performance, which he hopes not only educates the audience, but adds to the overall enjoyment of the evening as well. If past concerts are indicative, he said the audience can expect to be highly entertained. Following the concert, the event will conclude with a special reception, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the orchestra. All attendees are encouraged to meet the artists and enjoy some cake and refreshments. Early beginnings Based in San Francisco, The Bernard Osher Foundation, was formed by Mr. and Mrs. Osher in order to help improve people's quality of life by supporting higher education and the arts. The OLLI Orchestra was adopted by Sierra College, as part of an Osher Lifelong Learning Institute grant awarded to the college in 2005. (Sierra College is one of only four community colleges nationwide to receive a grant from the Osher Foundation.) Each semester, the college offers non-credit classes in a variety of disciplines. According to the Sierra College website, ""OLLI at Sierra College is a unique learning community designed for lifelong learners, ages 50 years or better, who are eager to explore new areas of knowledge without the stress of tests or grades. Although classes are designed for adults age 50 and over, there is no age limit for enrollment. "" Many students who enroll in OLLI have played in the past and are brushing up on their skills, while others are learning an instrument for the first time. For those who would like to perform as part of their experience, Miller suggests attending one of the group rehearsals before enrolling in a course. The orchestra meets from 6:30-9 p.m. each Wednesday in the multi-purpose room at Sierra College. ""Everyone is incredibly supportive of each other, it's not a professional group, by any means, but people love getting together to play and are about half advanced and the other half, not so advanced, but everyone is having fun,"" Miller said. ""It's a learning experience for everyone involved."" The concert runs about 90 minutes. The performance is free, tickets are not needed. ""Just show up!"" Miller said. He encourages the public to come and enjoy fellow community members as they share their love of instrument and music.

Phillip,Frost,2015,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/arts-and-theater/the-artistic-type/os-et-s4-cornell-rollins-dangerous-women-art-20181129-story.html,"Throughout the pages of the Bible you can find tales of all sorts of women — seducers, betrayers, the virtuous and the heroic. You don’t have to be a churchgoer to appreciate the various tales of lust, jealousy, faithfulness and honor — and you certainly don’t have to be religious to admire the fine art on display at the Cornell Fine Arts Museum. The Winter Park museum, on the Rollins College campus, is hosting “Dangerous Women,” mostly Renaissance and Baroque works by painters who were inspired by biblical women — Mary Magdalene, Salome, Queen Esther, Potiphar’s wife, Judith and others. If you don’t recognize these names, don’t worry — the exhibition gives the plot and context for each of the stories and related artwork. On view are paintings by artists such as Pietro da Cortona, Fede Galizia, Pordenone, Giovanni Andrea Sirani and Francesco del Cairo, as well as Old Master prints and drawings. “Dangerous Women” was created by the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University in Miami, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota and the Cornell. Virginia Brilliant curated the works, drawn from the Ringling, which is the state art museum. So why use the word “Dangerous”? “Seductive women are potentially dangerous to men because they invoke the fear of women’s power over them,” writes feminist art historian Mary D. Garrard in the hardcover book that accompanies the exhibition. “From earliest antiquity, woman was associated with a paradoxical fusion of sexual appeal and danger,” notes Kimberly L. Dennis, a Rollins professor who coordinates the college program in sexuality, women’s and gender studies. Seen with modern eyes, “Dangerous Women” provides a fascinating look at how these women were depicted in accordance with the norms of society hundreds of years ago. And contemplating how their stories might be told now adds to the enjoyment. These women aren’t just dangerous — they’re fascinating. ► “Dangerous Women runs through Dec. 12. The Cornell, at 1000 Holt Ave., Winter Park, is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesdays, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays, and noon-5 p.m. Saturdays-Sundays. Admission is free. In addition, a free tour of the exhibit will be given at 1 p.m. Dec. 1. No reservations required. More information at rollins.edu/cfam Orlando Sentinel arts writer and critic Matthew J.

Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 11:10 am Pictured from left to right are flight winners Steve Williams-A Flight, Glenn Hudson- D Flight, Ken Harding - B Flight and Dan Morgan - C Flight. Pictured from left to right are flight winners Steve Williams-A Flight, Glenn Hudson- D Flight, Ken Harding - B Flight and Dan Morgan - C Flight. There were 18 members of the Laidback Golf Tour who participated in the event at Danville Golf Club. Originally scheduled for Monday Nov. 12 the tournament had to be postponed to Nov. 19 due to rain and 30 degree temperatures. The delay paid off and the group enjoyed a beautiful sunny warm fall day today for their 19th event of the season where 10 of the 18 competitors won money. The 1916 Donald Ross designed course proved to be up to the challenge as it only gave up two rounds in the seventies and seven birdies to the field. Playing in the A Flight Steve Williams carded two of the birdies on his way to the low round of the day at 78. Williams captured his third win of the season as he narrowly held off the challenge of Fran Hensley who finished second in the flight with a score of 79. Hensley had previously won five times this season. Ken Harding was playing in his first tournament with the Laidback Tour as he just signed up to join for the last two tournaments of this season and all of 2019 prior to the start today. Ken was flighted in the B Flight with his 14 handicap and quickly found his way to his first Tour victory with his round of 86. Bob Foyle finished second in the flight at 88. Dan Morgan; who was responsible for recruiting Harding was playing in only his second event of the season today due to surgery recovery. Morgan joined his recruit in the winners circle today as he topped the C Flight with his round of 85. It was also Morgan’s first Tour victory. Willard Vicks finished second in the flight at 94. The D Flight used Net scores instead of gross scores to determine their winner today as there was a large gap in the handicaps between their beginning of flight to the higher end of the flight. This method is used sometimes in the higher handicap flight in order to allow competitive fairness for all in the flight. Glenn Hudson was able to claim his third win of the season as he turned in a score of 93 with a 26 handicap for net 67. John Horton claimed second place as he shot the flight’s low gross of 90 but had a 22-handicap giving him at net 68.

Michael,Gordon,2012,https://www.reuters.com/article/newzealand-economy-rbnz/update-2-nz-cenbank-to-ease-mortgage-curbs-but-lift-bank-capital-norms-idUSL4N1Y24TB,"4 Min Read * RBNZ to loosen mortgage lending restrictions from Jan 2019 * Financial system risks have eased over past 6 months - governor * RBNZ flags likelihood of higher capital requirements for banks (Re-casts, adds cenbank comments on capital requirements) By Charlotte Greenfield WELLINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s central bank on Wednesday said it would unwind mortgage restrictions as housing-related risks waned but signalled plans to ramp up banks’ capital requirements to address longer-term vulnerabilities. At the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) half-yearly financial stability review, governor Adrian Orr said that mortgage credit growth and price inflation in the previously red-hot housing market had eased to a more sustainable rate, warranting looser loan-to-value (LVR) restrictions. “Both mortgage credit growth and house price inflation have eased to more sustainable rates, reducing the riskiness of banks’ new housing lending,” Orr told reporters. Nevertheless, the bank reiterated that the large mortgage debt burden left households exposed to financial shocks and that local banks’ high reliance on offshore funding left it vulnerable to external factors. “There is no science to this. We have been calibrating it to where we have sufficient capital where the banking system is both sound through many economic conditions as well as efficient,” Orr told reporters. “That sweet spot is north of where bank capital has currently been.” The central bank will release details of its plans in a consultation paper in December. “Higher capital requirements provide banks with a greater buffer against unexpected losses, but they tend to increase the average cost of funding,” said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Bank. “This change would represent a tightening of financial conditions, to go with the easing via the LVR changes.” House prices have risen more than 50 percent nationally over the past decade and almost doubled in Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city. But growth has slowed over the past 18 months from double digits in early 2017 to around 5 percent in October, due in part to the central bank restrictions. The revised LVR rules, which come into effect on Jan. 1, ease deposit requirements for lenders. Under the relaxed rules, up to 20 percent of new mortgages issued by a lender to owner-occupiers can have deposits of less than 20 percent, up from 15 percent of such loans currently. It also lowered the deposit threshold for new mortgage loans to property investors to 30 percent from 35 percent. Orr also signaled that the restrictions would be loosened further in the “next few years” if banks’ lending standards were maintained. The easing had been flagged by the bank and was widely expected, but economists said that the RBNZ still needed to juggle the risk that prices would take off again in the supply-constrained market, or even the risk of a price correction that would send jitters throughout the economy, which could partly explain why the central bank wanted to shore up capital buffers. “Relaxation of the LVR restrictions is not without some risk,” said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank.

Bob,Diamond,2010,https://news.efinancialcareers.com/it-en/3000007/liberum-macquarie-merger,"by Sarah Butcher 7 days ago If you want to know how it feels to feel wanted in finance, you could always ask Liberum. The diminutive pan-European brokerage firm is reportedly being wooed by Macquarie. However, it is not so long ago (last week) that Liberum was also reportedly being sniffed by Bob Diamond's Panmure Gordon. It's clearly got something. Named after the Latin world for independence, Liberum was founded in 2007 by chief executive Shane Le Prevost. It's had its ups and downs - in 2015, then chief executive Simon Stillwell left as the firm struggled with a high cost base and falling profits. Headhunters at the time told us Liberum was known for treating a small coterie of senior people very well indeed and for being less generous to the rest. In 2018 some things have changed. Liberum made a profit of nearly £5m last year according to its accounts for 2017, up from £1.4m in 2016. Accordingly, the highest paid individual at the firm (likely Le Provost) took home £956k, up from £655k the year before. However, the average of Liberum's 178 employees took home £171k, down from £175k in 2016. Irrespective of staff pay, rivals clearly think Liberum has something. Observers suggest it's the whiff of scale. By plugging Liberum's 122 front office staff into their own equities businesses, the likes of Macquarie or Panmure Gordon can grow overnight and hopefully vanquish MiFID II. The UK Liberum franchise is deemed ""strong"" by headhunters, although the smaller U.S. franchise raises a few eyebrows. Not everyone is convinced, though. One equity research headhunter points out that Macquarie and Liberum suffer the same problem - both are smaller players with mostly unranked staff. ""Macquarie would have been better off buying a best in class broker like a Numis,"" says one. In this year's Extel rankings, Liberum ranked third among small and mid cap brokers in the UK, behind Numis and Peel Hunt. For Liberum's employees, Macquarie may yet provide some shelter from the MiFID mayhem. Even big rivals like Numis have been cutting costs, and Berenberg has decided its recent expansion was all a terrible mistake. Macquarie, meanwhile, has been hiring heavily in equities sales and trading this year under Daniel Kaye, the former Credit Suisse trader who's been building the equities business since early 2017, and will undoubtedly welcome the mass injection of new staff. However, some observers suggest the recent departure of Peter Crampton from Macquarie's oil and gas equity research team augurs badly for Liberum researchers. Crampton joined Macquarie in 2014 with a mandate to build the European utilities franchise at the Australian bank. Utilities have traditionally been Macquarie's strongest area and Crampton therefore had one of Macquarie's most prestigious jobs - but left (seemingly for Barclays) nonetheless.

Andrew,Davis,2009,https://news.uga.edu/construction-of-new-i-stem-building-begins/,"It will promote interdisciplinary collaborations between students, faculty and researchers. The University of Georgia broke ground on the new Interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (I-STEM) Research Building on Tuesday, Nov. 27. Expected to open in summer 2021, the building will provide space for faculty and graduate students in chemistry and engineering. The facility represents the future of research and education in the STEM fields at UGA. “Many of the complex problems of the 21st century—from crumbling infrastructure to chronic disease—require solutions that combine the latest advancements in chemistry, engineering and related fields,” said President Jere W. Morehead. “The Interdisciplinary STEM Research Building will be a world-class facility that promotes creative, interdisciplinary approaches to research that will lead to new products and services that improve the quality of life in Georgia and beyond.” The $65 million project, which includes four stories of laboratory and support space and a three-story parking deck underneath, will be funded by a combination of university and state funds. More than $39 million in state funds has been appropriated over the past two years for design and construction of the new facility, and an additional $5.6 million is anticipated for equipment as construction progresses. A rendering of the I-STEM Building. Nearly 30 percent of all college graduates in the state of Georgia pursue degrees in science or engineering, according to the National Science Foundation (NSF). At UGA, the number of students pursuing STEM degrees continues to grow, with about one out of every five graduates receiving a STEM degree last year. Jobs requiring science or engineering degrees are expected to increase dramatically over the next decade. The I-STEM Research Building, along with a recent $3 million NSF grant to research and improve STEM education practices, will play a key role in expanding UGA’s prowess in STEM fields. The 100,000-square-foot building will be home to more than 30 faculty and 100 graduate students from chemistry and engineering, and it will foster the development of joint ideas in areas ranging from cell imaging and microfluidic separation to combustion chemistry and medical robotics. The location of the Interdisciplinary STEM Research Building in the heart of the South Campus science and engineering corridor at the corner of Cedar Street and East Campus Road will promote even greater collaboration among chemistry and engineering researchers and their colleagues in the life sciences, agriculture, computer science and biomedicine.

Andrew,Davis,2009,https://www.prpeak.com/news/powell-river-energy-group-reports-on-lois-lake-dam-safety-1.23511516,"November 27, 2018 04:42 PM Representatives from the group that owns Lois Lake Dam recently met with residents who live below the 72-year-old structure to report on its safety. The dam is owned by Powell River Energy, a subsidiary of Brookfield Renewable. The facility supplies water for a hydroelectric generating station in Stillwater. “There's nothing wrong with the dam; this wasn't to scare people,” said Andrew Davis, Brookfield’s director of stakeholder relations for North America. “It was more to get folks involved in the safety of the dam.” Brookfield undertakes renewals of inundation area analysis and mapping of where flooding could occur in the unlikely case of a complete catastrophe causing the dam to fail, according to Davis. Brookfield dam safety engineer Bashar Sudah said the structural integrity of the dam and how far the dam is from the inundation area are studied. “We simulate a dam failure and we just see where the water goes based on that analysis,” said Sudah. The inundation zone is based on the analysis of the flooded area, he added. Davis said the purpose of the meeting was to present information about the dam safety program, how seriously Brookfield takes it, and what people need to do in the unlikely event that something occurs. If the unthinkable happened, such as an earthquake or severe flood, the area most affected would be around Lang Bay, south of Powell River. qathet Regional District manager of emergency services Ryan Thoms attended the public information meeting and said the district would be integrating understanding of the report into regional emergency plans. “It’s important for all residents to understand the hazards and risks where we live and work and to use that information as the basis of our home and neighbourhood emergency plans,” said Thoms. “As I said at the meeting, the regional emergency service is available to assist residents and neighbourhood groups who want some guidance with how to develop their home and neighbourhood plans.” The latest dam study done according to provincially mandated authority was completed in 2016. “Our dam is safe,” said Davis. “There is not a risk there but it is something we undertake as part of our dam safety program.” The inundation zonefrom the updated study in 2016 has changed from one previously done in 1989, mostly because of more sophisticated technology used and better topography data. “We assume the worst-case scenario as part of this analysis, which would be the dam failing, completely collapsing, which is extremely unlikely,” said Davis. According to Sudah, shortly after the dam’s completion to its current height in 1946, it was undamaged when a major earthquake hit the Powell River area from a category 7.5 epicentre near Courtenay. It was one of the biggest in BC history and the largest onshore in Canada. ‹ › Find out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.

Andrew,Davis,2009,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/WORLD-Chinese-writer-Nigeria-suit-anti-trans-attack-archbishops-statement-/64827.html,"In Nigeria, a federal high court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking the registration of a non-governmental organization for LGBTsthe Lesbian Equality and Empowerment Initiativesby the Corporate Affairs Commission ( CAC ), AllAfrica.com reported. Justice Nnamdi Dimgba upheld the decision of the CAC not to register the group, saying it was in compliance with Section 30 ( 1 )( c ) of the Companies and Allied Matters Act. Organization counsel Mike Enahoro-Eba said he will appeal against the decision of the high court at the Court of Appeal in Abuja. A gang of dozens of men attacked two transgender women in Bekasi, West Java, on Nov. 19, Gay Star News noted. The men chased the two wariaan Indonesian trans female identitystripped their clothes and attacked them with a metal rod, the Jakarta Post reported. Gay sex is not illegal in Indonesia; however, since early 2016, ""government-driven moral panic"" over LGBTI Indonesians has swept the nation, according to rights groups. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said that God is gender-neutral, PinkNews noted. During a lecture at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in London's Trafalgar Square, the archbishop responded to an attendee who asked about God as a father by saying that ""God is not male or female,"" according to The Times. Welbywho said last year that boys wearing dresses to school was ""not a problem""explained that ""all human language about God is inadequate and, to some degree, metaphorical."" In England, a school may face legal action after Christian parents complained to governors about a Pride event it put on for students, BBC.com reported. London's Heavers Farm Primary School ""victimized parents"" who complained about its ""aggressive LGBT agenda,"" the group Christian Concern claimed. The school said it would not ""shy away"" from teaching children about important issues such as LGBT rights. Judgment was reserved in a renewed legal challenge to the ban on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland, The Belfast Telegraph reported. Two couples are attempting to overturn a previous ruling that the prohibition does not breach their human rights. However, Attorney General John Larkin QC argued they lack standing to bring the case because they were not victims of an unlawful act. The Court of Appeal is expected to decide early next year. A gay man is suing the Hong Kong government for denying him public housingbecause he is married to another man, the South China Morning Post reported. In a judicial review application filed to the High Court, Nick Infinger argued the Housing Authority's decision was unconstitutional under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights and the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution. Infinger married his husband in Canada in January, and applied for public housing under the category of ""ordinary family"" in March. Hong Kong does not recognize same-sex marriage. A Scottish hairdresser who police said deliberately tried to infect 10 men with HIV has been jailed for at least 12 years, according to a Washington Blade item that cited The Scotsman. Daryll Rowe, 27, became the first man in the country to be found guilty of intentionally setting out to spread the virus after meeting men on Grindr. At Rowe's sentencing, Brighton Crown Court Judge Christine Henson referred to his crimes as a ""determined hateful campaign of sly violence."" The Canadian federal government announced it will invest nearly half a million dollars in improving the safety of the country's LGBTQ community in the wake of the killings of eight men with ties to Toronto's gay village, CTVNews.ca reported. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government will provide $450,000 to Pride Toronto to lead an initiative that aims to improve the relationship between the LGBTQ community and the criminal justice system. Morneau, who is also the MP for Toronto Centre, did not specifically name Bruce McArthurwho faces eight counts of first-degree murderbut said the funding comes as ""violent murders"" have been uncovered in the city. A new opera featuring the anti-gay comments of senior Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) politicians is premiering in Belfast, Northern Ireland, according to The Independent. The lyrics for Abomination: The DUP in Concert are composed entirely of verbatim views expressed from controversial senior party figures like Iris Robinson and Ian Paisley Jr. For example, there will be comments made by the DUP's Maurice Mills, who blamed Hurricane Katrina on a gay pride festival, and Paisley, who once said he was ""pretty repulsed by gay and lesbianism."" All 27 remaining European Union leaders signed off Britain's Brexit agreement with mixed emotions at a special summit on Nov. 25, CNN.com reported. Less than an hour after members gathered in Brussels, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that they had endorsed the ""Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration on the future EU-UK relations."" The agreement is a small victory for British Prime Minister Theresa May, who must now persuade lawmakers in the UK Parliament to vote for her deal. Princess Diana shook the British monarchy to its core, and a book claims she even partied at a gay bar in London with a group of friends that included Freddie Mercury, AOL.com noted. The Power of Positive Drinking claims Diana and Queen's frontman had a wild night out on the town. The book's author is 80's British TV star/model Cleo Rocos, who was part of the group that ventured out to the gay nightclub. India's first and only openly gay prince, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, has said marriage equality isn't a top priority for himbecause there are other goals to achieve first, a NewNowNext.com item mentioned. ""My first and foremost [objective] is to get acceptance from societythe social rights,"" Gohil said. The prince wants to first fight against things like stigma, discrimination and violence aimed at the LGBTQ community. Gohil has also recently been appointed as a gay representative and resource person under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to educate other governing bodies about section 377 of the penal codea colonial-era law that was recently overturned that criminalized same-sex relations with a punishment of 10 years to life in prison. A gay rugby player threatened with removal to Kenyawhere he fears he would face persecution because of his sexualityhas spoken of his relief after being given a reprieve, The Guardian reported. Kenneth Machariaa member of Bristol Bisons, an LGBTQA rugby clubsaid he would have had to hide his sexuality had he been flown back to Kenya. Macharia arrived in the United Kingdom in 2009 on a student visa; in May 2016 he claimed asylum, arguing that he had a well-founded fear of persecution in Kenya because of his sexual orientation. Several hundred people have participated in Montenegro's sixth annual Gay-Pride parade in the capital, Podgorica, RFERL.org reported. The Nov. 17 incident-free event was held under the slogan ""We are not kissing the chains,"" in reference to a well-known Montenegrin poem. Montenegroa former Yugoslav republic of 620,000 people and NATO's newest memberis working to improve human rights as it seeks membership in the European Union. Recently, openly lesbian tennis player Luksika Kumkhum won the WTA Mumbai Open for her biggest win to date, Outsports noted. She beat Russia's Irina Khromacheva, 1-6, 6-2, 6-3, and is now ranked 80th in the world. Kumkhum, 25, made it to third round of this year's Australian Openher best showing in a Grand Slam event. The group that regulates authority for therapeutic goods in Australia has delayed a decision on whether to permanently ban poppers ( amyl nitrite ), Gay Star News noted. The Therapeutic Goods Adminstration ( TGA ) announced a proposal to temporarily ban the sale, use or possession of poppers in September. It recommended to move nitrite inhalants onto Schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard the same grouping that includes heroin. British singer Sam Smith shared a video on Instagram of himself dressed top to bottom in black spandex, red high heels and ruffle skirt, dancing to Miami Sound Machine's 1985 classic hit ""Conga,"" according to The Miami Herald. The caption: ""Tonight Matthew...I'm gonna be @gloriaestefan."" Then, Estefanin London promoting her musical life story, On Your Feetreposted Smith's video to her own account and wrote him directly: ""What an incredible welcome to London! Love you @samsmith."" A festival that Nicki Minaj was supposed to headline in China recently may have been a scam, Page Six reported. The rapper reportedly traveled to Shanghai to perform a 90-minute set at the Djakarta Warehouse Project China festivalonly to learn the event was fraudulent, according to Shanghaiist. In a new poll from The Hollywood Reporter, people were asked if they support the portrayal of a gay James Bond, Out.com noted. The results showed that 52 percent either strongly or somewhat opposed the idea, while 28 percent either strongly or somewhat supported it. In addition, it showed that 48 percent opposed a female Bond, 29 percent were opposed to a Black Bond and 26 people were opposed to a U.S. Bond.

Paula,Lunder,2006,https://www.pressherald.com/2018/11/26/lunder-foundations-3-million-gift-to-meca-will-increase-financial-aid/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Most of the money will go toward relieving the burden of student debt, while some will be used on the college's strategic plan. Philanthropists Peter and Paula Lunder have given Maine College of Art $3 million to help pay the tuition of Maine students and help the college plan for its future. The gift from the Lunder Foundation, which MECA plans to announce Tuesday, includes $2.5 million for the existing Lunder Scholars program at MECA and $500,000 toward the college’s strategic plan. It’s the largest gift MECA has received for financial aid, said President Laura Freid, and “secures the promise of equal opportunity for all students. The immediate impact is that it will encourage more students of low- and middle-income families to apply.” The Lunder gift is a challenge match. If the college meets its fundraising goals, the gift could add up to $6 million, including $5 million for additional student aid and $1 million for college operations. The promise of the gift holds the potential to be transformative for MECA, Freid said. The college endowment is currently about $8 million, “and a gift that could add $5 million to that is a pretty significant gift,” she said. Though smaller in scale and narrower in scope than the $1.8 billion that businessman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg last week donated to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, the Lunder gift represents a similar goal of making college affordable for low- and moderate-income students “to ensure they do not graduate with a burden of significant student debt,” said Matt Goetting, MECA’s vice president of institutional advancement. “Reducing the student debt burden that so many young people have as they move into their lives nowadays seems to be the issue that everybody is talking about nationwide.” The Portland-based Lunder Foundation previously gave MECA more than $1 million for financial aid to establish the Lunder Scholars program, which has provided need-based aid to more than 100 undergraduates from Maine since its inception in 2002. About 25 percent of MECA’s 500 undergraduate students are from Maine. The Lunder gift will allow the school to pay a larger portion of students’ tuition, increase the number of students it recruits from Maine or both, Goetting said. MECA currently charges $35,000 annually for tuition. On average, it provides $16,000 in scholarship support to each student annually, bringing the effective tuition down to $19,000. Freid said the college provides some kind of financial assistance to all of its undergraduate students, and the school awards more than $7 million annually in scholarships, grants and other forms of financial assistance. In addition to its 500 undergraduate students, MECA has about 40 master’s of fine arts students and 1,500 continuing education students. The most popular undergraduate programs are animation, illustration and design. Freid began as MECA president in July 2017 and met the Lunders soon after at a dinner arranged by a MECA board member intended to introduce Freid to the community. Peter Lunder later gave Freid a tour of the Colby College Museum of Art, which the Lunders have supported with the gift of money and art. “We began talking about the importance of financial aid about a year ago,” Freid said, and “met many times over the year” in ongoing conversations about ways the Lunder Foundation could most effectively help MECA and its students. She said the gift of money for financial aid “is the most important investment any donor can make to a college education. It secures the promise of equal opportunities for all students.” Goetting said the college will begin the legwork of the strategic planning process right away. The strategic plan will address several areas of priority, including a comprehensive fundraising campaign that will include the match for the Lunder gift. In a statement, Peter Lunder said: “We are pleased to support MECA’s efforts to make higher education accessible to students regardless of their financial situation through this new gift to the Lunder Scholars fund. Offering opportunity to a wide spectrum of students who bring both academic and artistic strengths and diverse cultural perspectives is central to our mission.” Bob Keyes can be contacted at 791-6457 or at: [email protected] Twitter: pphbkeyes Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

With teams collapsing and talented riders losing their places ahead of the 2019 season, the professional peloton can be a rough ride for youngsters. But which teams are backing youth over experience next season? We compare the average ages of WorldTour teams to see which outfit is investing in the future. Søren Kragh Andersen wins stage six of the Tour de Suisse (Photo: Yuzuru SUNADA) With its ever-strong development squad, it might be no surprise that Germany’s Team Sunweb is set to be the youngest team in the peloton next season. Sunweb head into the new year with a young roster and an average age of 25.8, according to Pro Cycling Stats. Next year will be the third season running that Sunweb have been the youngest in the WorldTour, but they’re not sacrificing talent. >>> ‘I feel let down. It was a massive disappointment’: Young Brit James Shaw on being dropped by Lotto-Soudal The youngest rider on the team will be the Swiss Marc Hirschi, the 20-year-old newly crowned Under-23 road world champion. Also with youth on their side are Dutchman Sam Oomen, 23, Robert Power, also 23, and Søren Kragh Andersen, at 25. The team’s star rider Tom Dumoulin one of the older riders at 28, while fellow Dutchman Roy Curvers is the teams oldest representative at 38. Steve Cummings at the Volta a Catalunya 2018 (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images) You might be able to guess at some of the older teams at WorldTour level next year. Movistar for example fall at the other end of the scale, with an average age of 29. But the Spanish outfit are just edged out of having the oldest average age by Dimension Data, at 29.1 years of age on average. >>> Five transfer fails of the 2018 season The South African team is made up of 12 riders over the age of 30, including Brits Mark Cavendish at 33 and Steve Cummings at 37. Dimension Data bosses are adding to their roster of experienced riders next season, adding Italians Enrico Gasparotto (36) an Giacamo Nizzolo (29) to the books. The team’s oldest rider is 38-year-old Lars Bak, while the youngster is Gino Mäder at 21. Tao Geoghegan Hart with his Team Sky team-mates at the 2018 Vuelta a España (Sunada) One team worth mentioning is Quick-Step Floors, which becomes Deceuninck-Quick Step next season. Often renowned for their ability to discover and improve young riders, 2019 sees the team racing with an older unit compared to 2018. This season, the Belgian team were the second youngest group in the peloton, at 26.4, but the average age jumps to 27.5 next year, making them the eighth youngest. Team Sky’s average age is also taking a jump between seasons, from third youngest at 26.9 this year to fifth at 27.4. 1. Team Sunweb – 25.8 2. EF Education First–Drapac – 27 3. Jumbo – 27.2 4.

By Charlotte Greenfield WELLINGTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank on Wednesday said it would unwind mortgage restrictions as housing-related risks waned but signalled plans to ramp up banks' capital requirements to address longer-term vulnerabilities. At the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) half-yearly financial stability review, governor Adrian Orr said that mortgage credit growth and price inflation in the previously red-hot housing market had eased to a more sustainable rate, warranting looser loan-to-value (LVR) restrictions. Nevertheless, the bank reiterated that the large mortgage debt burden left households exposed to financial shocks and that local banks' high reliance on offshore funding left it vulnerable to external factors. ""There is no science to this. We have been calibrating it to where we have sufficient capital where the banking system is both sound through many economic conditions as well as efficient,"" Orr told reporters. ""That sweet spot is north of where bank capital has currently been."" The central bank will release details of its plans in a consultation paper in December. ""Higher capital requirements provide banks with a greater buffer against unexpected losses, but they tend to increase the average cost of funding,"" said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Bank. ""This change would represent a tightening of financial conditions, to go with the easing via the LVR changes."" House prices have risen more than 50 percent nationally over the past decade and almost doubled in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. But growth has slowed over the past 18 months from double digits in early 2017 to around 5 percent in October, due in part to the central bank restrictions. The revised LVR rules, which come into effect on Jan. 1, ease deposit requirements for lenders. Under the relaxed rules, up to 20 percent of new mortgages issued by a lender to owner-occupiers can have deposits of less than 20 percent, up from 15 percent of such loans currently. It also lowered the deposit threshold for new mortgage loans to property investors to 30 percent from 35 percent. Orr also signaled that the restrictions would be loosened further in the ""next few years"" if banks' lending standards were maintained. The easing had been flagged by the bank and was widely expected, but economists said that the RBNZ still needed to juggle the risk that prices would take off again in the supply-constrained market, or even the risk of a price correction that would send jitters throughout the economy, which could partly explain why the central bank wanted to shore up capital buffers. ""Relaxation of the LVR restrictions is not without some risk,"" said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank. Enter up to 25 symbols separated by commas or spaces in the text box below.

Gone are the days of abiding by contracts as players and agents take more control in negotiations with release requests, walk-out threats and pay demands. Most recently, Bulldogs enforcer David Klemmer was released two years early from his contract to start a new life in Newcastle, while the Roosters refused to get in the way of Dylan Napa to fill the void at Belmore. That's not even half of the drama that has unfolded this off-season with Sharks flyer Valentine Holmes taking the rugby league world by surprise with a shock defection to the NFL. The recent development has inspired Sporting News to break down the recruitment and retention of players over the past five seasons at every NRL club, comparing gains and losses, plus listing debutants, to get a grasp on which clubs have built towards a premiership.

Andrew,Davis,1998,http://www.bandt.com.au/media/quit-blaming-goldfish-content-failing-long-form-content-stay,"Returning member? Sign in Home > Opinion In this opinion piece, J. Walter Thompson Worldwide content marketing and social media strategist Zeina Khodr (pictured below) discusses why long-form content is here to stay. We’ve all heard over and over again that since our lives have become consumed by the act of swiping and scrolling our attention span has apparently reduced to that of a goldfish. The only issue with this convenient fact is that it’s not exactly true. Andrew Davis (global marketer, author and documentary maker) inspired me to dig a little deeper and really ask if we simply can’t focus more than 8 seconds to consume content, and bust a few audience attention myths in the process. For the first time in my career I started thinking about the business of content you need to ‘market’ through a non-agency lens. Having recently left the content agency I founded and launched in Australia, I was more interested in my immediate lecturing, teaching and consulting gigs. What do today’s students need to know to start their careers, and what do senior marketers need to get a handle on when creating content that stands up to the speed of today’s digital environment? How, in fact, do you conquer content mastery when you’re dealing in content chaos and you’re constantly told to make everything shorter form? I did a little research and, funnily enough, audiences are capable of holding attention for as long as you can grab and hold their attention. Have you seen those crazy gamers on Twitch? Twitch is a live streaming video platform originally designed for gamers who play video games for a live audience. It now has over 15 million daily active users and growing at a rapid rate. Now, it’s game on for ‘content’ marketers, and it’s time to sharpen up the content we create. Too often what we see (and sometimes, what we create in our rush to feed the content machine) is just more of the same-same. And in the words of Jay Baer ‘same is really lame’. In our effort to make content shorter, we have eliminated almost everything that makes it interesting and we have in many instances underestimated our audiences. The audiences you’re trying to reach don’t have trouble paying attention as long as what you create is worthy of that attention – and it’s worth reiterating that worthy means something different to different audiences. You cannot decide that something is interesting and expect everyone to agree and pay attention, or think that a piece of content is failing to engage an audience just because it’s long form. In fact, there are serious, science-backed reasons why longer form content might actually be better for engaging audiences that the shorter, easy-to-consume content many marketers have been focused on in the recent past. Shares and engagement with weightier content is on the rise. The Economist reported their average shares increased from 43 in 2015 to 78 in 2017, while average shares on content from the New York Times increased fourfold between January 2015 and September 2017. And Google has even hinted that it’s algorithm leans towards ranking longer form content highly, because it offers more space for the kind of analysis, originality and in-depth insights that demonstrate authority. Where does this leave marketers with a message they want to impart and conversions to drive? At the end of the day, everything comes back to compelling storytelling. Ever since caveman painted their first stories on the walls, storytelling became a thing. For students entering the profession, and for experienced marketers, the underlying rules remain the same. Longer form content and good storytelling will always work and find an audience because our brains are programmed for good stories. The neuroscience even proves it. Good stories trigger a release of oxytocin resulting in empathy. It also stimulates critical thinking, constructs new knowledge and skills. It’s no surprise psychologists use stories as a form of therapy. Brands in droves are trying to do the same. Creating content that builds connective tissue between a brand and audience these days is trend du jour. But lame content sucks, and we don’t need more of it. Audiences want meaning in the content they consume, because we are overwhelmed by how many options for consumption we’re presented with every day. When we consume content, we want to make it count. Sure, we still want a few cat videos here and there, but it can’t be kitten time, all the time. Content marketing success is more elusive than ever. The competition for audience eyeballs is fierce and audiences are smarter and more cynical than ever. Brands are creating more content than they need to in order to have a presence on channels they shouldn’t even be on. Artificial intelligence and robots are being used to create hyper-relevant, just-in-time content. This game isn’t easy. While on the professional side I have a deep fascination in the future of storytelling, the implications of AI and the rapid shift to a screen-less Voice world, I’m preaching and teaching the basics to students and senior marketers alike: So for students and experienced marketers alike, some of the old rules remain – add a level of curiosity to all the content you create and take audiences from wanting to know, to needing to know. Attention cannot be bought, it’s earned over time. People need time to consume content, and it doesn’t always need to be snackable in 15-sec blocks or 6 second Youtube bumpers. So if you’ve made it this far into this piece of content then I probably don’t need to convince you why a long form read works. Value the content you create, invest in telling interesting and important stories and audiences will reward you with their attention. If you’re not being consumed, ask yourself why no one cares.

Steve,Cummings,1997,https://www.theinertia.com/surf/nazare-big-wave-surfing-from-that-day/,"In the days leading up to November 18, there was a lot of buzz around Nazaré. The Big Wave Tour decided to run the Nazaré despite the giant purple blob on the charts. The swell simply looked too big and too unruly to run an event, so they chose a bit of a cleaner run of swell. The hype increased to frantic level. Garrett McNamara claimed it was going to be the “biggest and best conditions we have ever seen in the history of surfing!!!” It was one of the biggest swells in five years. When it arrived, though, it was a little off. The direction wasn’t exactly right for those building-sized teepees Nazaré is so famous for. The waves were still gigantic, but the hype put a bit of a damper on things. “Luckily, the waves were still firing at around 50-60 feet, which I’ll happily accept,” wrote Steve Cummings, a.k.a. Jacuzzi Surfer, who was behind the camera for the footage you see above. “These surfers are some of the most talented surfers in the world, and tamed these beasts better than I’ve ever seen.” Find more from JacuzziSurfer on Youtube and on Instagram.

James,Crook,1995,https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2018-11-26/2billion-to-cut-delays-for-passengers-on-south-western-railway-trains/,"As new figures reveal around a quarter of South Western Railway's trains are late, Network Rail has vowed to carry out more work than ever before to improve the ongoing chaos. The company says it's come up with radical new ways to give it much more time to carry out work overnight along with a £2billion budget to cut delays for passengers. Yet once again today (26/11) there were delays and cancellations because of a signal failure. Watch this report by our Transport Correspondent Mike Pearse: The latest figures for delayed and late trains could not be worse. Only last week, engineering work overran, causing misery- and that followed a signal failure causing a day of chaos. 2am in the morning on the mainline to Waterloo. Between the last and first trains, there's less than 4 hours to repair a defect that could cause delays. Jim Toovey, Track engineer: Before any work starts, power to the track is turned off. That's followed by a time consuming safety procedure around the worksite to ensure it remains safe. It's vital but it's not long before workers have to get off site. Now, brand new isolation technology means it's being done with the turn of a switch. It is in fact safer; allows 20% more time for work; and reduces the risk of overruns. Jack Roberts, Wessex Maintenance Unit: James Crook, Network Rail: By the end of the day, 300,000 passengers would have passed over these tracks- the busiest in Europe. A reminder of why the work- and completing it on time- is so vital. By using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The striker showed his class for the Young Lions with two brilliant performances in the international break GALATSARAY have entered the race for Liverpool starlet Dominic Solanke, according to reports. The Turkish giants have also been in talks to take Divock Origi on loan but Wolves are said to be leading the chase for the unwanted Belgian. According to Fotospor, Galatasaray chairman Abdurrahim Albayrak has held discussions with two senior figures at Liverpool, Michael Gordon and Philip Nash. But while talks were primarily believed to be about Origi, the Gala chief mentioned Solanke as another player he was interested in taking on loan. SunSport understands Rangers are in pole position to sign Solanke, however. The 21-year-old has not played a single minute for the Reds this season and managed just five starts in the whole of 2017-18. ""HOW ABOUT THAT!""Dominic Solanke chips the keeper with a back-heel...Simply glorious 🙌 pic.twitter.com/s8B23f7jwF The Chelsea academy graduate, who moved to Anfield after a tribunal, has scored just one goal for the club - in the final Premier League game of last season against Brighton. Liverpool fans had called on manager Jurgen Klopp to keep Solanke in the squad after his heroics for England Under-21s during the international break. He scored both goals as the Young Lions beat Italy U21s last Friday and scored another two - including a brilliant back-heel chip - as Aidy Boothroyd's side smashed Denmark 5-1. Klopp said that he is sure Solanke will be a success at Anfiled. The German believes his ""quality"" and ""attitude"" will make sure he does big things in Red. Klopp said: ""He is not coming from the best football situation in his life but he plays these games for England which is good. ""I was really happy when I saw it. ""There is a long career to come. At the end of his career, Dom Solanke will not really know about these two or three years. ""He’s only in the situation he is in because he is so good. ""That is why people already think about why he doesn’t play. He started early with games at Chelsea. ""With himself and with his family, everything will be fine and he can make the career he has in his mind. ""I hope that will be here. Can I be sure we will see that? I really hope.""

PETERSBURG – American Stage will continue its 2018-2019 season with “Miss Bennet: Christmas at Pemberley,” written by Lauren Gunderson and Margot Melcon and directed by Stephanie Gularte, producing artistic director. The production will run Nov. 28 through Dec. 30 in the Raymond James Theatre, 163 Third St. N., St. Petersburg. Performances are Wednesdays and Thursdays, 7 p.m.; and Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m. Matinees are Saturdays and Sundays, 2 p.m. Ticket prices vary. For ticket pricing, call 727- 823-7529, email BoxOffice@americanstage.org or visit americanstage.org. There will be two preview performances on Wednesday and Thursday, Nov. 28 and 29, 7 p.m. Opening night will be Friday, Nov. 30, 8 p.m. Tickets to opening night are $70, which includes the opening night reception, beginning at 7 p.m., and a dessert reception with the cast following the performance. The play is recommended for ages 10 and older. The Tampa Bay area premiere of “Miss Bennet: Christmas at Pemberley” features six cast members making their American Stage mainstage debut. Those new to American Stage are Katie Cunningham, Josh Odsess-Rubin, Lucas Calzada, Brooke Tylar Benson, Courtney McLaren and Sadie Lockhart. Cast members returning to American Stage in this production include Britt Michael Gordon and Jenny Lester. “Miss Bennet: Christmas at Pemberley” gives theatergoers a chance to cozy up with their favorite “Pride and Prejudice” characters at Pemberley this Christmas. Told with a sweet and sassy modern wit and romantic, period style, this comedic sequel takes us to 1815 England in the grand estate of newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Darcy. Bookish middle daughter Mary Bennet meets a curious visitor who proves himself an intellectual match, kindred spirit and possibly more. For the first time, Mary must stand tall and become the heroine of her own story. Inspired by one of the most beloved literary romances of all time, “Miss Bennet” will enchant Jane Austen fans and new-comers alike. ""This new holiday play has so much going for it,” Gularte said. “Not only is it a wonderful, witty imagining of the continuation of Jane Austen's ‘Pride and Prejudice’ world, it is also a smart and celebratory romantic Christmas play with dialogue that feels fresh and immediate. Best of all, ‘Miss Bennet’ features an unlikely but inspiring 19th century female heroine who is discovering how to live a full life on her own terms."" Gunderson, the most produced living playwright in America, co-wrote the romantic comedy in 2017. She is the winner of the Lanford Wilson Award and the Steinberg/ATCA New Play Award, a finalist for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize and John Gassner Award for Playwriting, and a recipient of the Mellon Foundation’s three-year residency with Marin Theatre Co. Gunderson studied Southern literature and drama at Emory University, and dramatic writing at NYU’s Tisch School where she was a Reynolds Fellow in Social Entrepreneurship. Her work has been commissioned, produced and developed at companies across the United States including the Denver Center, South Coast Rep, The Kennedy Center, the O’Neill Theatre Center, Berkeley Rep, Shotgun Players, TheatreWorks, Crowded Fire, San Francisco Playhouse, Marin Theatre, Synchronicity, Olney Theatre, Geva, and more. Her work is published by Dramatists Play Service, Playscripts and Samuel French. Gunderson is a Playwright in Residence at The Playwrights Foundation, and a Dramatists Guild member. She is from Atlanta, Georgia, and lives in San Francisco. Gunderson partnered with Melcon on “Miss Bennet: A Christmas at Pemberley.” Melcon is a theater artist, administrator and writer. She was the Director of New Play Development at Marin Theatre Company for seven years, where she dramaturged over 30 productions – including six world premieres – and administered the company’s two annual new play prizes and commissioning program. She has developed plays with TheatreWorks, Bay Area Playwrights Festival, Crowded Fire Theater, Shotgun Players, Berkeley Rep’s Ground Floor, the Kennedy Center, the New Harmony Project, and the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis. She is currently the Program Executive for Promoting Culture at the Zellerbach Family Foundation. Margot is a graduate of California State University, Chico. Throughout the run of “Miss Bennet: A Christmas at Pemberley,” ticket holders are invited to arrive early for an exclusive prologue presented by select American Stage apprentice Donovan Whitney 30 minutes prior to each performance. American Stage Theatre operates as a 501(c)3, and has been providing live theatrical performances as a professional regional equity theatre in the heart of St. Petersburg since 1977.

Pensioner Dolly Dickson from Mayo Street in Belfast was at the back of her home bringing in her bin when the robber sneaked in and stole her bag with her pension and savings in it. News of the burglary broke when the PSNI posted a message about the theft on its Facebook page. The investigating officer wrote: ""This morning I have attended the scene of a domestic burglary which happened yesterday afternoon in the Mayo Street area. ""Someone has sneaked into the house and stolen around £1,000 cash. What makes this particularly repulsive is that the victim of this is an 83-year-old lady who lives alone. Get that, an 83 years old lady! Who in all good conscience can do this?"" Dolly's son Bill expressed fury at what happened. ""Just a wee warning to people and pensioners, especially in the Upper Shankill and Woodvale area,"" he wrote on his Facebook page. ""Yesterday some scummy wee b*****d walked into my mother's house and stole her bag with her pension and money she had saved for Xmas presents. Luckily for her she was out her back bringing in her bin other wise it could have been much worse."" Almost immediately, offers of help for Dolly flooded in from big-hearted Belfast folk, among them businessman Steve Cummings, who said he would personally donate £1,000 to make good her loss, and Peaky Blinders actor Packy Lee, who also stepped forward with an offer of help. A charity page set up to help her had already received £690 in pledges toward its £1,000 target by last night.

Diners and volunteers look on at a sea of pies at the Montrose Community Thanksgiving Dinner at Friendship Hall on Thursday. Diners and volunteers look on at a sea of pies at the Montrose Community Thanksgiving Dinner at Friendship Hall on Thursday. Amethyst Roth walked forward, throwing her arms wide to welcome those who stood first in a line that wound around three of four walls at Friendship Hall on Thanksgiving. It was time to eat — and, for Montrose Community Dinners Inc. volunteers, to feed a sense of community, not just people. “The whole year, we have been task oriented in an effort to put tomorrow together,” Roth said, of the months-long effort to provide the annual Thanksgiving Friends feast, which was open to any and all comers. “But tomorrow and today, and in these moments where we’re interacting with these volunteers, it’s important for us to remember that we don’t have to be task-oriented anymore. We’re here to be community oriented, which means it’s OK to stand around and have coffee and it’s ok to stand around and joke and talk,” Roth said. “We don’t have to be so tight on a timeline that we lose sight of what we’re trying to do here, which is to build community within Montrose.” The focus, she said, is the opportunity to serve. “It’s been good, approaching it with that mindset,” Roth said. For Angela Armistead, volunteering was the chance to honor her late father, as well as her recently deceased aunt, Betsy Miranda. “I used to bring him (father) here a lot. I was very close to my aunt. I adopted her like a grandma. I’m enjoying being a volunteer. I will probably do it more often,” she said. Earlier, Jane Powers stood, apron-clad and ready to start serving up the more than 135 turkeys that cook John Lindh and many other volunteers had prepared for the big meal. Helping others comes naturally to Powers, who retired in 2016 from the U.S. Public Health Service. “I heard about this last year and came and volunteered. I wanted to come back again, and probably will next year,” she said. “It’s a great way to meet people; it’s great people who put this on and it’s kind of nice to be able to give back to the community.” The Thanksgiving meal annually draws close to 2,000 people — and not just those hankering for turkey and dressing. Roth could be heard speaking with an 86-year-old man, who said he’d already eaten but enjoyed coming to see the turnout. Art Klaus and his wife, Eleanor, were among that teeming crowd. “Our kids are all gone. It’s just the two of us here. Instead of us trying to find something to do, it’s just as easy for us to come here,” Klaus said. Paul Weber, a few tables away, was in agreement. “It’s a good event. It gives people that maybe aren’t able to cook for themselves have a good Thanksgiving dinner. It’s easier and the whole family can come and have a good time,” said Weber, who came with his siblings, grandfather, nephews and other family. “(Volunteers) work really hard to get this all prepped, not even just doing this, but delivering the food to places for the people who can’t come. I think they’re great for putting this on every year,” he said. Eliseo Gomez, junior varsity soccer coach at Montrose High School, brought his players Thursday morning to help ready about 450 take-out meals to those who had requested deliveries. “It went by quick. It was really fun,” Gomez said. Roth said the soccer players had the meals packaged up with impressive speed — it took them about 43 minutes, she said. The boys said they were happy to pitch in. “It probably went by quick because everyone cooperated. We have a good team. I enjoy doing it,” player Alan Vanchaik said. “It’s always good to help people out, to take time out of my morning,” Jorge Baeza added. He and other team members said Adriel Encarnacion had convinced them to volunteer. “This is my first year. Being with the group, the soccer team, has been a good experience, helping out,” Encarnacion said. The soccer team was part of a whole volunteer system, which included those who joined Lindh earlier in the week to roast and debone turkeys; delivery drivers; servers; young children who wove between the tables, bearing trays of drink or desserts; clean-up crews and those staffing the very popular pie table. Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts contributed their time, as did the NJROTC in presenting the colors, as well as running the kids’ activity area. On the stage, Alicia Arbuthnot opened festivities with the national anthem, followed by Jeremiah Quintin’s prayer of thanksgiving, and music from Karen Mercer, Paul Chamberlain, Maria Tirone, and others. “We’ve had a tremendous volume of volunteers,” said, Lindh, who later was called to the stage for honors, as were other Community Dinners board members. “A tremendous amount of people called. I had people yesterday, calling.” In between cutting pies, board member Babs Schmerler also spoke of the giving spirit. “People have always been so generous and I’m very appreciative of that. … It’s a nice way, I think, for families to spend Thanksgiving,” she said.

Phillip,Frost,1985,https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/op-ed/article222059500.html,"By María Carla Chicuén November 22, 2018 03:08 AM Florida International University has always been an epicenter of the Cuban heritage in our community. Since our opening day in 1972, FIU has welcomed one of the greatest concentrations of students and faculty of Cuban origin in the country, and gained international recognition in the field of Cuban studies. Today, the Cuban spirit continues to thrive at the university. FIU is proud to offer more than 70 courses related to Cuba across more than 20 disciplines, spanning the humanities and social sciences, the natural sciences, law, architecture and medicine. Indeed, FIU draws upon the expertise of the largest nucleus of specialists on Cuba of any university in the United States — over 50 faculty members representing most academic disciplines. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Since 1991, moreover, the Cuban Research Institute at FIU has stood at the forefront of interdisciplinary teaching, research and public programming focused on Cuba and its diaspora. Through the generosity of numerous donors, the FIU library and museums have accumulated important Cuban collections ranging from Cuban genealogy materials to memorabilia, art and music. The FIU Library, for example, is home to the renowned Díaz Ayala Cuban and Latin American Popular Music Collection, the most extensive publicly available collection of Cuban music in the United States. The Enrique Hurtado de Mendoza Collection also holds thousands of unpublished family genealogies and manuscripts, now available in digital format worldwide. At the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum at FIU, the Darlene M. and Jorge M. Pérez Collection features works by many of the best-known masters of Cuban art. All of these contributions have helped position FIU as a major resource on Cuban art, music, history and family genealogy. In 2015, under the leadership of President Mark B. Rosenberg, FIU envisioned a dedicated space to harness these outstanding resources and all scholarly and cultural activity related to Cuba. Agustín Arellano, Sr. — now Chairman of the CasaCuba Board of Advisors — was the first to join the president in this vision. Together, they recruited a group of prominent community members to form a board and fuel the creation of a center, right on FIU´s campus, that would preserve the Cuban heritage, celebrate the contributions of Cubans from around the world, and gather top scholars for the study of Cuba. A place where our children, and their children, will learn about the history of our island and our cultural traditions. A hub of resources for the community to advance our education and professions. A meeting place for conferences, exhibitions, and artistic performances. The most consequential, global think tank focused on Cuba and the Cuban people. That vision is CasaCuba. We are so energized by the progress we have made already. FIU has granted CasaCuba a choice piece of land for an iconic center, right at the entrance of our main campus, on 107th Avenue. We have also begun our fundraising campaign to finance the design and construction of the facility. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Ray Rodríguez, Vice-Chairman of the CasaCuba Board of Advisors, provided seed funding, and the Arellano Family recently honored us with a gift of 1 million dollars. Even before our facility is built, CasaCuba will launch programs across the areas of education, research, public discussion, and the arts. We are also planning a festival to help the community preserve and understand the historical value of personal objects related to the Cuban experience. Through future initiatives, we hope to reach and connect Cuban diasporas from around the world and engage not just Cubans, but everyone with a passion or interest in Cuba. The magnitude of our dream to build CasaCuba can only be matched by our conviction in our capacity to achieve it. No other university can claim FIU´s expertise in Cuba scholarship, or FIU´s commitment to preserving the Cuban heritage. Yet, to make our dream a reality, we need your help. The door of CasaCuba is open. Please join us and share your ideas to shape our programming and the scope of our facility. Contribute your talent and time through participation in one of our board committees.Donate through our website, casacuba.fiu.edu, or get in touch with us through casacuba@fiu.edu if you have an interest in making a major, legacy gift towards our fundraising campaign. I hope that today you will consider becoming a founding member of CasaCuba, and helping FIU build an inspiring and inclusive second home for the Cuban community and beyond. María Carla Chicuén is the Executive Director of FIU’s CasaCuba. View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

Steve,Cummings,1984,https://www.theinertia.com/surf/heres-a-nazare-wipeout-reel-were-not-so-sure-anybodys-thankful-for/,"“Have you ever jumped off a four-story tall building and landed face first in a swimming pool?” This is how videographer Steve Cummings describes wiping out at Nazaré. It seems like a pretty fair metaphor. Steve, AKA the JacuzziSurfer, left Southern California recently to trounce around Portugal and document the kickoff of Nazaré’s big wave season. He’s filmed some gems so far and in that time, he’s caught glimpse of the beatings handed out there. And while most wipeout reels are the most violent tumbles from top to bottom, lips crashing down on top of innocent, defenseless, bodies that are about to get rag dolled, this is a slightly different take on a common Nazaré wipeout. Instead, we see a lot of people flying on wave faces so fast that they can’t hang on, skipping along the surface of the water like a tiny rock on a pond. Follow JacuzziSurfer on Instagram here. Only the best. We promise. Join our community of contributors.

Michael,Sylvester,1980,https://www.cnybj.com/leadership-greater-syracuse-graduates-its-28th-class/,"Print Edition Email News Updates Sign In Subscribe By Maria Carbonaro Date: 11/21/2018 9:43 PM SYRACUSE — Leadership Greater Syracuse (LGS) announced that 52 area citizens are ready to take on high-level community roles in Central New York after graduating from the LGS Class of 2018 on Nov. 14 at The Rail Line, a new event venue in downtown Syracuse. New Onondaga County Executive J. Ryan McMahon II was on hand to congratulate the graduates. “The Board of Directors, staff and I are very proud of this class. They have been immersed in the issues and achievements of our community and now have the tools and the connections they need to give back to CNY,” LGS Executive Director Pam Brunet said in a news release. The participants represent a cross-section of local businesses and nonprofit organizations. “The LGS Class of 2018 is also our most racially diverse class with 15 percent identifying themselves as racial minorities,” said Brunet. Founded in 1991, LGS is a nonprofit organization that says its mission is to inspire current and future leaders to make a difference in the community in which they live and work. Each year, the DeWitt–based organization selects a new class of about 50 to 55 people to participate in its yearlong training program to expose them to key community leaders and organizations and the most important issues facing the community. The program teaches participants about community leadership, empowerment, group dynamics, community opportunities, and trends. “The future is bright for the organizations that will benefit from their knowledge and involvement as the LGS Class of 2018 is made up of very enthusiastic and capable leaders,” Brunet said. Approximately 80 percent of all the LGS graduates remain in CNY. A recent survey shows that they have held more than 800 volunteer positions. Leadership Greater Syracuse was founded by CenterState CEO, Onondaga County, the City of Syracuse, and Onondaga Community College. LGS is financially supported by many organizations including United Radio and VIP Structures. Media sponsors include Charter Communications, Advanced Media Group, and the Business Journal News Network.

Michael,Sylvester,1980,https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/rotherham/new-checks-on-councillors-suggested-in-rotherham-1-9455712,"If a councillor attends a meeting at the start, they are shown as present regardless of when they leave and Michael Sylvester – a former councillor who now campaigns on community issues in the town – has expressed concern about that. As a result, James McLaughlin the council’s democratic services manager has agreed that changes could be introduced. Mr Sylvester cited an “extreme” case from some years ago, where a former councillor repeatedly attended meetings only for a few minutes in an apparent move to prevent the ‘six month rule’, where councillors who do not attend for that period can be disqualified. He said: “It is obvious that some councillors are not in attendance for the whole meeting either arriving late or leaving early and often not being present for significant items of business. “I would argue to keep my councillors properly accountable as a citizen I need to know if they are actually present when a decision is made or an item of business is discussed and would ask if it could be recorded in the minutes the time, if a councillor arrives late or leaves early, or if it could be recorded if they are not present for a particular item of business. “From a layman’s viewpoint, if I’m late for work or ‘knock off’ early then I would face repercussions and feel the same should apply to councillors.” He has been told by Mr McLaughlin that he had raised “a valid query” and said “I am currently exploring how we can record this”. Mr Sylvester has previously highlighted the attendance record of Rotherham councillors, which showed some were frequently absent from meetings – arguing that those who claim the council’s cash allowances should be obliged to attend. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

Sara,Burns,1977,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/man-accused-of-fredericton-shooting-spree-to-undergo-psychological-assessment-1.23505457,"November 21, 2018 11:14 AM FREDERICTON — A Fredericton man accused of murdering two police officers and two civilians in an August shooting spree has been ordered to undergo a psychological assessment to see if he is fit to stand trial. Matthew Raymond is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright on Aug. 10 outside an apartment complex on the north side of the city. He is alleged to have fired from his apartment window with a long gun, killing the two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip, and the two police officers as they responded to the scene Provincial court Judge Julian Dickson has imposed a publication ban on any information or arguments dealing with the application for the fitness assessment. Raymond sat quietly in the court during Wednesday's hearing, occasionally nodding to acknowledge he agreed with points being made by his lawyer, Alison Menard. Outside the court, Menard explained that a fitness assessment is usually performed by a psychiatrist and is completed to see if a person is fit and capable to stand trial. ""For example, they have to be able to understand the proceedings. They have to be able to understand who the participants are in the proceedings, among other things that have to be tested,"" she said. The case returns to court on Dec. 4. Menard is the second lawyer Raymond has had since he was charged. During earlier court appearances, Raymond had said he felt he was not being defended by his first lawyer — Nathan Gorham — and tried numerous times to fire him. Raymond suggested Gorham was withholding evidence that would allow him to be ""exonerated"" immediately because of temporary insanity. ""Mr. Raymond's obviously mistaken belief that Mr. Gorham could present evidence to exonerate him at this stage of proceeding suggests that possibly he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings,'' Dickson said at the time. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. › or view results Your City Matters - City of Prince George Click here to view The Last Minute Holiday Gift Guide December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 December 3, 2018 Find out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.

Michael,Gordon,1976,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2018/11/i-love-the-job-exclusive-liverpools-ceo-on-working-behind-the-scenes-to-bring-success-to-club-city/,"It’s over a year since Peter Moore was appointed as chief executive at Liverpool FC. We met with him to discuss the role, the challenges he’s faced, and the importance of the club to its community. Having lived in Garston in south Liverpool as a boy, Moore made his name across the Atlantic while working for some of the world’s biggest tech giants. Returning to his home city after almost 40 years away has been a period of acclimatisation, swapping the Californian sunshine in Silicon Valley for the differing climes that Merseyside offers. As we meet in Moore’s office, overlooking the River Mersey and the iconic Liver Building, the sun is shining and Liverpool Football Club is in a bright place. “I love it [the job],” he enthuses. “It’s great to be back.” Moore took up his role ahead of the 2017/18 season, but admits it was a decision he thought long and hard about having lived in America since the age of 25. He is, effectively, American, so moving back to Merseyside takes some adapting – something that is often overlooked in football when players move from another country, or continent. During the recruitment process, Moore and Michael Gordon – FSG’s key man at Anfield and Moore’s boss – discussed extensively whether it was a plus or minus that Moore was from the city. “We got deep into the psychology,” Moore explains. “Whether it was good to be from Liverpool so you understand the people, city and mentality, having been a Red since 1959, or does it become a lightning rod for negativity should things not go right? “Or is it better to be dispassionate, not emotional and not in any way linked to the way the team is playing, because I’m responsible for the business of football? “I think it’s a plus because I’m a Scouser. I understand Liverpool and I can relate to the people. I try to use that institutional knowledge to my advantage, but it can have its pitfalls. “This is a magnificent city and one of the things I’ve learned in the job is that this role has civic responsibilities. Not only to the football club but to the city and its people, continuing to make it a better place. I relish doing that. “There’s a uniqueness with the bond between the football club and the people of this city.” With Moore’s appointment last year, it signalled the final change in FSG’s structure of the club’s hierarchy. His role differs from former CEO Ian Ayre as he does not get involved in football, transfers or wages, which is now the job of sporting director Michael Edwards. “You have to be aligned – everybody has to understand their role,” Moore says. “You start at the top with the strategies you are going for, how you do it is the underpinning underneath, making sure we can complete at any level, with any club in the world. “It’s about putting our fans first and everything we try to do has that lens and that focus. “It’s about one team, whether you kick a ball for this club, you’re a steward, you work in communications or you’re the CEO – we’re all marching towards one thing: success on the pitch. “Kirkby redevelopment is a great example. “When Jurgen wants to bring up one of the U18s or U23s he can just whistle – right now we’ve got to find a taxi or get somebody to grab them and half an hour later they might be there, depending on traffic.” Moore’s role is somewhat unique in that he is focussed purely on the business side of the football club, but that doesn’t mean his job doesn’t affect things on the pitch – even though he’s keen to stress it “has nothing to do with me.” “We’ve got to drive revenue and catch up with some football clubs,” says the 63-year-old. “So we can continue to invest on the football pitch. “From that perspective it’s my job to make sure we continue to drive the revenue that allows Liverpool to be one of the most attractive football teams in the world. “The success on the pitch, which has nothing to do with me, has been brilliant. “What is to do with me is how you take that success and continue to make sure it’s consistent year in, year out, like we used to be. “We’ve got arguably the most talented, charismatic manager in the world and I can’t think of a club that would like to play against Liverpool.” While living on the west coast of America, Moore explains how he would wake up each morning and watch the new Main Stand being built on a webcam and had even bought two season tickets in the new Boardroom: “Even though I wasn’t able to come back much, my UK-based family could go.” When he was first appointed, the new Main Stand was a year old but there had been strong reports suggesting a naming rights partner, so is this something the club are still pursuing? “I wouldn’t say we’re pursuing it,” he admits. “When the Main Stand was initially being built there were proposals originally but clearly it didn’t go anywhere with a brand or a company that we felt we wanted to be associated with. “If somebody comes along who we think shares our values, then I think there is a conversation to be had. There may be an opportunity with the new training ground, too.” With Anfield’s capacity now at 54,000, supporters are keen to see the development of the Anfield Road End in what is phase two of Anfield’s overall expansion plan, for which the club currently have a planning application that expires in September 2019. “We’re constantly looking and reviewing,” Moore notes, but says: “there is a lot of work to be done before we are in a position to make a decision of that magnitude. “Not a day goes by when we’re not discussing it in some level here.” Moore, though, understands the needs of the local residents in the process, saying: “Our football club takes its community obligations very, very seriously and will continue to do so. “The core focus is right here in our own backyard because that’s where the greatest need is. “We are making sure that we do cause the least level of disruption to the local residents, but also give back to them. “Food poverty and social deprivation are both key things, as well as supporting foodbanks and feeding schoolchildren, in particular. Some of the most impoverished postcodes in the UK are right there and for us as a football club we have an obligation to give back. “Walking football, chair yoga, in particular the work we do at Anfield Sports and Community Centre every single day with our coaches and staff that are taking kids, helping them, educating them, providing them with role models, all through playing football.” Over the past year, there has been a perceived shift in the engagement process at the club, with the first-team providing more opportunities to meet with fans, particularly at the pre-season games in Dublin and Anfield. “We have a number of strategic priorities in this club,” Moore explains. “Football is perceived as a big business and dispassionate – yes it’s a big business but it’s not dispassionate.” Moore speaks of the pre-season tour to America, where 101,000 fans attended the Reds’ friendly against Manchester United – with, seemingly, more than half of those in attendance supporting Liverpool. “Flying back after that game I asked myself, ‘is there a bigger club in the world? Is there another club who could bring 65,000 to Ann Arbor for a friendly?’ “There’s a history of success and the entire soup that is Liverpool Football Club, the ingredients that go into it – Shankly, Paisley, Anfield, You’ll Never Walk Alone, Dalglish, Fowler, and in my day St. John, Hunt, five European cups. “There is a deep pride that you are associated with something and there is a belief in this club that extends to the city itself.” Despite living on the west coast of America, Liverpool remained part of Moore’s life; from getting up at 4am for the early kick off games; to brokering a kit deal with the Reds while at Reebok in the nineties; to watching the new Main Stand being built on a webcam each morning. “The frustration for me was, ‘how do I get closer to Anfield 5,200 miles away?’ and the answer is technology and engagement-based.” Having made his name in business working for tech giants including Microsoft, Sega and EA Sports, Moore is now leading the technological improvements at LFC. “We try to engage people through content. We have a massive investment that FSG has made called Fan Connect which I drive, which is building fan engagement through technology to bring them closer to the club. “The digital transformation will allow us to engage with fans in different, unique and initiative ways, from fans down the street and to where I lived in San Francisco.“ All those years in the USA, where everything is bigger, including in sports, has given Moore an American mentality when it comes to fans. “I learned American business tactics, the slickness of American sports stadium environments, how you engage with your fans, how the players should react to certain situations, and that you have to be open and communicate. “I met Steve Jobs when Apple was in trouble and I was at Microsoft. I watched his style like many people did and there are many that still model their business practices after his…. “I was the face of Microsoft for the Xbox, more as a personality, but somebody who could drive home messaging. “Those are my skills. There’s a lot of things I don’t do well, but I communicate, motivate and I’ll lead from the front and have no issues being outspoken when it’s appropriate.” Speaking of communication, we discuss the merits and pitfalls of being on Twitter. “There was a conversation about deleting my Twitter account – not many, if any, Premier League CEOs are on it. “I wish I was able to do more. At times you can’t provide answers without opening up all kinds of other issues. “I will look at tweets that are catching people’s attention. I’m taking that information and making people aware of it. “It is a platform to engage, when appropriate, and a way of knowing what’s going on 24/7. “Without social media, and in particular Twitter, you’d have to wait for a letter to arrive where somebody explains the situation. It’s much more real-time.” Twitter does, though, have its issues. “I’ve been called everything, but I shrug my shoulders. I rarely, if ever, block anybody, because that’s what they want. “The Scouser in me would be on Twitter all day long fighting with people but that’s just not the CEO that I need to be. “I like to keep up to date with what the fans are thinking, what they are happy and not happy about, and taking that input and figuring out how we can help.” Another area that Moore is hands-on with is the development of the LFC Women’s team. Again, his American influence is helpful here, with women’s soccer being much bigger Stateside than in the UK currently. “I first went to a really big game in 1992, when I started to work for Reebok. Players caught my eye not just as soccer players but role models for young women. “I have three daughters, all of whom have been involved in sports and many point to the [US] women’s national team [as inspirations]. “Girls didn’t play football in the UK when I grew up here – fast forward to the present day and Chelsea vs. Arsenal in the women’s FA Cup final had 45,000 fans there.” The LFC Women’s team reports directly to Moore and he is responsible for the hiring, firing and managing at that area of the club. There have been some “rough periods” recently he admits, with Neil Redfearn quitting his post after just one game in charge, but Moore is clearly enthused to have long-serving Vicky Jepson now installed. “I’m a massive supporter of what a women’s team can do for young women primarily as role models and as people you aspire to. “A lot of girls around here are fans of Liverpool Football Club and they love Mo, Sadio and Bobby, but I want them to love Courtney [Sweetman-Kirk], Leandra [Little], or Anke [Preuss] in goal. I want them to want to be Laura Coombs or Jessica Clarke.” One of the changes Moore has overseen is a move from the Halton Stadium in Widnes to Tranmere’s Prenton Park. “The first time I went to see the team play, I said we need to get closer to Liverpool and build a fanbase. The American model: suburbia, parents who understand the value of what having powerful role models can bring to their daughters and sons. “I’m delighted we finally got a home at Tranmere Rovers. It’s a perfect stadium. “It’s important young women of Merseyside have somewhere to watch women play sports at a high level. “I always get disappointed when I see ill-informed people knock it because ‘women can’t play football or ‘it’s women’. I go to as many games as I can, and I’ll tweet every now and again, and you see the most disappointing reactions to that. “It is engaging, skilful and strategic football and I enjoy and love it. The closer you get to the team, which many of the fans do, understanding the players and the personalities, it’s no different. It’s just women playing, not men. “I absolutely believe in it, I’ve moved them as close as I can to Liverpool itself. We’ve got a good young squad – a nice blend of homegrown talent, brought some players in and some old heads out there are providing some real stability.” MORE RECENT INTERVIEWS:

John,O'Neil,1974,https://www.timesleader.com/news/725564/court-briefs-39,"Man who allegedly slashed officer’s finger waives hearing WILKES-BARRE — A man who barricaded himself inside a Regent Street house and allegedly slashed the finger of a city police officer waived his right to a preliminary hearing Tuesday in Luzerne County Central Court. City police responded to a noise complaint at 62 Regent St. on Oct. 24 and learned an occupant, John O’Neil, 54, had an arrest warrant issued Oct. 5 for disorderly conduct. O’Neil became irate and barricaded himself inside the house. As police forced open a rear door, O’Neil swung a knife and slashed an officer’s finger, the complaint says. O’Neil waived charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, simple assault and terroristic threats to Luzerne County Court. Prosecutors withdrew charges of reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. In an unrelated case, O’Neil pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for loud music at his residence Oct. 5. He was fined $272. Trial in Nanticoke woman’s homicide set for spring 2019 WILKES-BARRE — Accused killer Anthony Spudis learned this week that he’ll be going on trial this spring. Spudis allegedly broke into Gertrude Price’s Nanticoke home Nov. 28, 2013, intending to ransack the place. But prosecutors say he stabbed Price several times in the head when she confronted him. Price was 97 when she died. Prosecutors are pursuing the death penalty for Spudis, 36, who is facing an open count of criminal homicide along with counts of burglary and robbery. Spudis appeared in court Tuesday before Luzerne County Judge Tina Polachek Gartley for a status conference. Spudis’ trial date had previously been postponed after his case had to be outsourced to a private lawyer, after no public defender or conflict counsel was able to take his case. With attorney Robert Saurman, who is death-penalty certified, caught up to speed on Spudis’ case, Gartley was able to schedule Spudis’ trial. Jury selection will begin May 28, 2019. Gartley said it’s likely to last for five days, if not more, as jury selection in death-penalty cases typically takes longer. A further two-week period will be blocked out for the trial itself, meaning three weeks in total will be set aside for Spudis. Gartley set another hearing for Feb. 25 for future motions. Trial scheduled for man accused of killing sister WILKES-BARRE — After he was deemed competent last week, the trial for a Plymouth Township man accused of fatally stabbing his sister has been set for April 29, 2019. Eric Nelson Getz stands accused in the death of his sister, Rebecca Getz, 41, after an argument in their White Oak Drive home on Feb. 4, 2017. Luzerne County Judge Michael T. Vough found Getz, 40, competent to stand trial last week after a competency hearing, saying the defense failed to prove “that he is unable to understand the nature of proceedings or to participate and assist in his defense.” This comes despite claims from mental health professionals who said Getz suffers from brain trauma that caused developmental issues he can never recover from. After his arrest, Getz told police he reached his boiling point with his sister after she hit him in the head with an ice scraper and called him a “retard.” By Times Leader Staff Their view: Giving thanks for values we share Police: Heroin residue at Hazleton home where baby found unresponsive 2018 The Times Leader

John,O'Neil,1974,https://www.mvtimes.com/2018/11/20/permitted-guesthouse-triggers-legal-melee/,"O.B. launches “unprecedented” campaign to redefine graveyard border, guesthouse owners say. Updated November 21 John and Susan Zarba believe they are the target of a coordinated attack by the town and the water district over property rights — their battle with the town leaders so contentious that police were called to Oak Bluffs town hall Monday to restore peace when Susan Zarba sought public records. The dispute dates back years, and is currently focused on the legality of a guesthouse built on the Zarbas’ property. The couple claims the town has changed its assessment and tinkered with its details. Town leaders say the assessing issues did happen, but were quickly corrected. Town administrator Robert Whritenour described the Zarbas’ assessor issues as “quite laughable.” Whritenour characterized Susan Zarba as “a real estate sharpie,” and vowed, “We’re not going to give up. We have to protect and preserve the town’s fiduciary responsibility to the right of access to that land.” The dispute is headed for a Land Court showdown next week, Nov. 29 and 30, at Dukes County Courthouse, but it’s been years in the making, and involves a two-story guesthouse built between 2015 and 2016. The guesthouse, which the couple lives in, was built about 250 feet from town hall. The town says it is road called Davis Avenue, but the Zarbas dispute that it’s a road at all and describe it as a driveway easement or a way. During and after the building process, the Zarbas found themselves in lawsuits with neighbors, and then the town. In addition, the town threatened fines of $300, and then for a time $600, per day, based on alleged zoning violations, and has refused to grant a full occupancy permit. The legal dispute with the town is just one of two currently involving the property. The Zarbas came to terms with a third neighboring property owner last year after an intense Land Court battle over right-of-way issues. That opponent was a trust half belonging to Fall River District Court Magistrate John O’Neil and half to a trustee named John Feitelberg. The Zarbas remain in legal combat with next-door neighbors Keith and Lori Murphy via that couple’s trust, and with the town of Oak Bluffs. At issue before the Land Court is a zoning board decision that found the Zarbas’ guesthouse was in violation of parking and setback requirements. On the strength of a partial survey that town counsel commissioned for Oak Bluffs (after a building permit was issued to the Zarbas), the town claims a past survey used to site the guesthouse was erroneous. The new survey, conducted by Vineyard Land Surveying and Engineering, proves a setback violation, the town claims. The Zarbas contend the survey they relied on is accurate. They located their guesthouse based on a survey by Sourati Engineering. The Sourati survey was done 13 years ago to facilitate a three-lot development for local developer Jack Reagan. It constitutes the survey of record, Susan Zarba said. Adding to the intrigue is Oak Bluffs selectman Brian Packish, a member of the planning board in 2015. Packish poured the foundation for the guesthouse, and requested the site be “pinned,” a type of mini secondary survey that places stakes precisely where the foundation is to be situated. Packish has recused himself from the legal process, and has declined to comment on the case other than to verify he was hired for the foundation. The Land Court case is in essence a battle of surveyors. The area in question is the edge of the Oak Grove Cemetery across from the guesthouse, real estate the Zarbas claim Oak Bluffs doesn’t even have a deed for. The town has not yet responded to a request for a copy of the cemetery deed. The Zarbas told The Times they believe Oak Bluffs has aligned itself with the interests of other homeowners on the contested way, most notably O’Neil, and has leveraged the suits brought on by these homeowners in an attempt to prove “rights and ownership interest” in the contested dirt way, which divides the Zarbas’ property from the Oak Grove Cemetery. John O’Neil could not be reached for comment. A court official said he was out on medical leave, and calls to his home were not returned. “That’s nothing I’m really prepared to comment on,” Feitelberg, his fellow trustee in the property, said. Susan Zarba, who will represent herself, further claims that the town has not only harmed her family, but continues to spend “obscene amounts of taxpayers’ dollars” in the survey and legal process. “How in the world are these people in this position?” former two-term Oak Bluffs selectman Kerry Scott asked, in an interview with The Times. “They have a building permit. They have signoffs for every inspection. How could they be denied water and an occupancy permit?” Jack Collins, attorney for the Oak Bluffs Water District, a completely separate municipal entity from the town of Oak Bluffs, told The Times the Zarbas did not get their water hooked up because an injunction was in place. The injunction, which was placed by Land Court Judge Gordon Piper, was meant to allow John O’Neil and his family free access along the contested dirt way to reach their property while litigation was ongoing with the the Zarbas and other abutters. It wasn’t intended to “limit the ability of defendants, or of any third party (including any water company, underground excavator, or other contractor or company, whether or not engaged by or acting on behalf of the defendants),” Judge Piper wrote at one point in the case. In an electronic letter sent to the Zarbas, Collins appears to tell them they can have water if they sign a release. “I will ask you and your husband to sign a release and indemnification agreement, promising not to sue and to hold harmless the District or anyone involved — including the commissioners, superintendent, and even myself — if such water service is provided,” Collins wrote. “To the extent that you have made any complaints or initiated any action, you would dismiss the same, withdrawing any allegations. If this makes sense to you, I am prepared to proceed right away, with the hope of providing water to you next week.” The town wasn’t looking to get pulled into the Land Court dispute, Ron Rappaport, the town’s longtime counsel, said. “The town was brought into litigation by the Land Court involving an acrimonious [dispute] among various neighbors regarding their rights to use an old road abutting the town cemetery,” he said. “To respond, the town had to undertake research to assess its property rights in the road. And when that work was complete, the building inspector, in our view, was required to take actions to address the various zoning issues resulting from the property-line determinations. Two of the neighbors, including the Zarbas, have exercised their rights to challenge the building inspector’s rulings in two different courts, as is their right.” Mark Barbadoro, who is now the building commissioner of Fitchburg, told the Zarbas in a letter dated Nov. 1, 2016, the new survey places their guesthouse “two and one-tenth feet too close” to the lot line of the cemetery. “If you can’t rely on your recorded deed and your survey plan of record from the Registry of Deeds,” John Zarba asked, “how can any homeowner or builder be sure they won’t end up in the nightmare we have dealt with daily for three years now?” He said he believes the money and effort Oak Bluffs is spending on the land fight is “unprecedented.” Records obtained by The Times show the town has spent $13,755 with Vineyard Land Surveying and Engineering, and tens of thousands of dollars on town counsel invoices. “It is common for subdivision plans as old as the Plan of the Highlands [to have] inaccuracies,” Barbadoro wrote in an email to The Times. He suggested the Zarbas seek a special permit. The Zarbas claim they never needed a special permit or variance to erect their guesthouse, and don’t qualify for one. The said they deem the suggestion of it as a trap to open up another litigation front. An edge of the Highlands Subdivision, an old, poorly defined housing plan from the days of Cottage City, runs near the edge of the cemetery, further exacerbating the difficulty of surveying in the area. “There were multiple plans of the Highlands Subdivision recorded,” Dukes County Registrar of Deeds Paulo DeOliveira said. The “whole area is a mapping disaster,” Oak Bluffs principal assessor David Bailey said. Neither George Sourati nor Reid Silva, who own the two survey firms at play, would comment on the situation. The Zarbas’ claim Michael Goldsmith, the town’s lead attorney on the case, has selected the most advantageous of the many maps of the Highlands Subdivision to help bolster the town’s survey. Citing ongoing litigation, Goldsmith declined to comment on any aspect of the case. Judge Gordon Piper was set to preside over the case next week, but was promoted to chief justice of the Land Court and withdrew. Judge Robert Foster will now hear the case. Updated to include links to documents and surveys and to include a new invoice calculation for town survey work. Interesting for people to know is that O’Neil happens to be the father of Kathy Farresy. She & her husband were using the property to house their heavy equipment for their businesss. It’s all far more shady than the town’s nefarious dealings is known for. Dig deep..grab your popcorn & enjoy the ride. Tax payers look to foot another hefty financial burden due to this corrupt town government That is most definitely not Kathy’s father. If you’re gonna try and create town conspiracy theories maybe you should start with actual facts. Maybe by dig deeper you meant check the police records for how many times the police have been called on the Zarba’s. Lol That is not Kathy’s father. You should do your research before slandering people and starting town conspiracies. Interesting for people to know is John Feitelberg is Feits from Barstool Sports and an internet celebrity. His boss, David Portnoy, El Pres, is notorious for calling the island trash and favors Nantucket since he has a summer house there. I say we let the Zarba’s stay put Also false. Fact check dude. dude it’s a joke dude, bro relax dude. It most definitely is his father unless there’s a crop of feitelberg’s out of fall river Did I just wake up in the old Soviet Union where property rights (as were all rights) were controlled and dictated by the communist party or in this case local government. I am so disappointed in the Town of Oak Bluffs, and as an Oak Bluffs taxpayer I do not appreciate the kind of money the town is putting into this dispute when it is easily resolvable. It feels like a battle of the egos, and it is absolutely cruel. What John and Susan Zarba have been and continue to be put through is unconscionable. I wish the newspaper had mentioned how much the taxpayers have paid in legal fees defending less than 2 feet of land, which they probably don’t own. My guess is over $150,00 in legal fees to date, with another $100,000 pending. Then if the Zarba’s can prove malicious intent, a Federal Court could hit us taxpayers another $500,000 or more in punitive damages…all for 2 feet of land, the town may not own? I could have settled this entire mess in a few days, for a free meal. I am certainly not a stakeholder in this issue, but I really find the total process and people “interesting “. Most disturbing ,assuming that the reporting is accurate, is the behavior of Town Administrator Robert Whritenour toward Susan Zarba. The Zarbas have a lot of investment to protect and if they in fact built based upon best data available and presented….and were awarded a Building approval…then have just cause to vigorously pursue protection of their investment. For Mr. Whritenour to refer to Mrs. Zarba as a “real estate sharpie” concerned about a “laughable” assessment issue speaks volumes with regard to his professionalism. This is a joke, Oak Bluffs why did you ever give them a permit to start building if they truly thought it was an issue for the property line? I don’t know any of these people but I feel bad for the Zarbas. I hope they win and sue the town! Don’t feel too bad for them. The whole reason this became an issue, and why the neighbors are taking them to court is because they wanted to shut down the road. The road has been there a long time and is the only way for the neighbors to get to their houses. This article gives way too much credibility to the Zarbas. I think Facts First is “mistaken”. There is indeed another access to the area. Facts First is correct. Their is no other access for the neighbors to get to their house. Facts First is also correct that the Zarbas don’t deserve sympathy. There is so much more to this story. Before you start feeling too bad for the Zarba’s you should go have a look at the house for yourself. You will see the clear manipulation of the property line. This article tells a very one sided story. Log in to leave a comment

John,O'Neil,1974,http://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/21/news/york/neighbors-ask-state-supreme-court-to-decide-whether-lawn-care-business-has-enough-lawn-for-business/,"YORK, Maine — Daniel and Susan Raposa have filed an appeal to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court regarding ongoing issues with Joshua Gammon and Gammon Lawn Care. But the town and Gammon, both defendants, say the appeal should be denied. The state’s highest court has been asked to rule on a Superior Court decision issued last January, in which it dismissed a lawsuit regarding the grandfathered use of the 650 York St. property. Prior to 2012, the late Peter Marcuri ran an excavation business there. Gammon started using the property in 2012 and bought it in 2014. Marcuri is also named as a defendant in the Raposa’s most recent appeal. [Subscribe to our free morning newsletter and get the latest headlines in your inbox] At the root of the issue is a disagreement over whether Gammon’s lawn care and landscaping business at the site is a continuation of the business Marcuri ran there — and thus is grandfathered as a legal use — or if it represents a significant change in activity. If it’s to be considered a change of use, it would reopen scrutiny into whether Gammon has the space required to work there: The town’s minimum lot size for a nonresidential use in that shoreland zone is 60,000 square feet, and the property was just less than 51,000 square feet when he acquired it. Neighbors, including the Raposas, have said an increase in activity at the property has disrupted their lives. In a January ruling, York County Superior Court Justice John O’Neil sided with the town, which argued a Board of Appeals ruling on grandfathered use is advisory only, does not have legally enforceable status and therefore can’t be appealed to the courts. The matter revolves around an email Code Enforcement Officer Amber Harrison sent to the Raposas in April 2016, after they asked her to investigate whether Gammon’s use of the property was grandfathered or whether a notice of violation should be ordered because his use of the land was different and more intense than Marcuri’s. She wrote that Gammon’s uses “are consistent with the previous uses and no violations are warranted.” [Local landscaper says neighbor is a ‘bully’ who wants to shut him down] The Raposas filed an appeal of her determination to the appeals board, as she told them they were welcomed to do. The board voted that night that the Raposas’ appeal should be approved, leading Gammon to appeal to the Superior Court. However, in the BOA’s subsequent written findings of fact, it stated Gammon’s business was not a change in use — in apparent contradiction of its earlier vote. The Raposas appealed the findings of fact. The two cases were joined, and in January of this year, Justice O’Neil basically said there was no basis for a court appeal of either claim. O’Neil in his order said he was guided by a 2001 case out of Waterboro that closely resembled the situation in York. In that case, a resident asked the town to initiate enforcement action against a gravel pit operator, which the town declined to do. A subsequent Zoning Board of Appeals decision ultimately ended up before the supreme judicial court, which ruled the decision was only advisory. “Only notices of violation and enforcement order are reviewable by the court. Because no notice of violation or enforcement order has been issued and the board only ruled on the failure to find a violation…the court lacks subject matter to review it,” O’Neil’s ruling stated. The Raposas asked the Superior Court to reconsider its decision, but the request was denied in May. As a result, they filed the law court appeal. [Neighbors pledge to continue fighting in protracted battle over lawn care business] In their appeal, the Raposas argue that appeals of town decisions are a cornerstone of appropriate legal challenges. “All property owners must be provided with a venue and the ability…to challenge the CEO when he or she makes a discretionary determination that results in a diminishment of the value and quiet enjoyment of their property. “Denying the right to appeal any CEO determination is inconsistent with the broad legislative mandate that ‘any action or failure to act’ by the CEO may be appealed to a zoning board of appeals and then to the Superior Court,” they state in their SJC brief. They cite several court cases to back up their contention that the courts in fact did have jurisdiction to hear an appeal in this case. They also cite the town’s zoning ordinance, which states the BOA “shall hear and decide appeals from any order, requirement, decision or determination.” The town and Gammon, who joined with the town in the O’Neil case and is doing so with the SJC appeal, both argue the Waterboro case holds precedence and is nearly identical to the facts of the York case. In the matter of use, Gammon’s attorney Matthew Howell stated that when Harrison wrote that initial email to the Raposas in 2016, she relied in pertinent part on a written statement by Peter Marcuri. [Neighbors pressure selectmen to take legal action against local business] The former owner said his business “plowed and removed snow, stored snow from off-site locations and delivered loan, gravel, mulch, hay, brick and other stones.” These are the kinds of activities in which Gammon engages, and so his business was properly grandfathered. The town and Gammon stated in their briefs that O’Neil correctly ruled it was the Board of Selectmen that had authority to rule on whether or not Harrison’s opinion was correct — because she had not taken any formal action, like issuing a notice of violation, that could be appealed to court. It is expected to take months before the Supreme Judicial Court rules on this matter. Have feedback? Want to know more? Send us ideas for follow-up stories.

Phillip,Frost,1969,https://news.fiu.edu/2018/11/a-november-to-remember/128207,"On Wednesday, Nov. 21, President Mark B. Rosenberg sent the following message to the FIU community: Dear FIU family, This has been a November to remember! With Thanksgiving fast approaching, we will finally have a well-deserved moment to pause, reflect and appreciate our many blessings. FIU remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. This semester, you’ve shown tremendous strength and optimism that’s given us an incredible burst of energy and taken our efforts to the next level. These past few weeks are proof of our impact! Here are a few highlights: • Student success: Recently, PBS News Hour brought us national recognition for our innovative, groundbreaking student success efforts in this era of performance funding. FIU will now be helping drive change at other institutions as a part of an Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) initiative called Powered by the Publics: Scaling Student Success. • Celebrating our alumni and faculty: Last weekend, our Torch Awards came home! We celebrated the achievements of our alumni and faculty who are charting new courses in their professions and our community – and reflect the incredible opportunities our FIU provides! It was a spectacular evening full of pride and music, during which Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Sam Moore sang a wonderful rendition of the Beatles’ “Imagine.” • Cybersecurity: FIU is an international research and education hub for cybersecurity. That’s why we were selected as a partner to host the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Conference. Earlier this month we wrapped up a very successful conference that brought together cybersecurity workforce developers, federal and state government leaders, education and training providers to help build the cybersecurity workforce. Our commitment to cybersecurity doesn’t end there. On November 8, we welcomed 200 girls from seven different Miami-Dade schools for “IBMCyberDay4Girls,” a one-day conference that educates young women about cybersecurity. • Leadership: In January, our Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine will celebrate another milestone moment when we welcome Dr. Robert Sackstein as the new dean! Dr. Sackstein comes to us from Harvard Medical School and is going to build on the strong foundation put in place by founding dean Dr. John Rock. That’s not all! Our professional staff is also being recognized for their efforts. FIU Vice President and Chief Information Officer Robert Grillo received the Hispanic IT Executive Council (HITEC) Top 100 award. The HITEC recognizes influential and notable Hispanic professionals who are making a difference in the technology industry. • Research: Our research is changing lives. Years after he lost his hand in a traumatic accident, a hand amputee can “feel” again, thanks to technology FIU engineers have developed. This incredible system was developed by Dr. Ranu Jung and her Adaptive Neural Systems Laboratory team. • Community Engagement: We’re more connected to our community than ever! We earned national designation as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity University by the APLU for our commitment to talent and workforce development; innovation and technology-based economic development; and community engagement. Recently, our Office of Engagement partnered with Forward Cities to host their annual meeting, in which 300 leaders from more than 30 cities across the U.S. gathered to learn more about Miami’s joined efforts to create innovation and economic growth. • Strengthening Partnerships: Our partnership with North Miami is going strong! We recently hosted the North Miami Brewfest – which started as a project led by FIU students. This event not only includes educational seminars that reveal the science behind brewing, but also connects our students to hands-on experience and the chance to network with leading craft brewers. • Arts: We’re bringing world-class art, culture and entertainment to our community. Our School of Music just completed a successful 2018 FIU Music Festival. We held our 32nd annual Festival of the Trees exhibit and auction, benefiting our Interior Architecture Department. Our FIU Theatre students are in the middle of a fantastic season of shows. Our Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum has several exhibitions you’re not going to want to miss! And more than a dozen students are gaining first-hand experience during Art Basel! • Athletics: FIU football has had another record-breaking season. Our Panthers are on the hunt for a conference championship! We’re also bowl eligible for the second year in a row! Please join us for the final game of the regular season on Saturday, November 24 at noon. FIU’s volleyball team has also had a successful season – after qualifying for the C-USA Tournament for the first time since 2015 and earning its most wins in the regular season since 2011! We can certainly be thankful for this meaningful work that is having a positive impact on our community! And there’s so much good yet to come. One of the most joyous times of year is right around the corner. In December, we will celebrate the accomplishments of more than 4,200 students who will graduate in 10 ceremonies. There is no better reminder of who we are and why we are here! I look forward to sharing more with you in my New Year’s letter. Until then, Rosalie and I wish you a Thanksgiving filled with peace and joy. Sincerely, Mark B. Rosenberg President If you're new here, you may want to subscribe to our newsletter.

Robert,Hoopes,1968,http://www.theintell.com/news/20181121/deb-kaplan-appointed-as-lower-southampton-supervisor,"In addition to being on the township planning commission, Kaplan is also a member of the board of directors of the Lower Southampton library. Deb Kaplan was appointed to fill the vacancy on the Lower Southampton Board of Supervisors at Tuesday's meeting. Kaplan, a township planning commission member who also served as a supervisor for five months last year after being appointed to fill a vacancy, will now fill the vacant seat created by the resignation of Joseph McFadden, who had to move out of the state for his job. By virtue of the appointment, Kaplan will serve through the end of 2019 but must run and win in that year's election to retain the seat beyond next year. She said Tuesday night that she does intend to run. Supervisors Keith Wesley, Ray Weldie and Ed Shannon all voted for Kaplan while board member Kim Koutsouradis favored Scott Congdon, a former Neshaminy school board member who denied at the meeting that he held a ""secret meeting"" at his house during the spring with a former Lower Southampton elected official who is under indictment. Three former township officials — District Judge John Waltman, Deputy State Constable Bernard Rafferty and Public Safety Director Robert Hoopes — have all been indicted on money laundering and other charges. Rafferty and Hoopes have pleaded guilty, while Waltman is awaiting trial. In his questioning of Congdon about the alleged secret meeting, Wesley would not identify the former elected official he was talking about. Kaplan, Congdon and quality control inspector Rocco Falato were all publicly interviewed by the board before the vote to appoint Kaplan. A fourth applicant for the vacancy withdrew before Tuesday night's meeting, Wesley said. The subject of Kaplan's bankruptcy was brought up by Koutsouradis after the board had extensively interviewed all three candidates and conferred among themselves for several minutes. Koutsouradis said the records he had indicated Kaplan's bankruptcy was finalized in 2003 and that it called into question her ability to wisely manage township finances. ""It was smart to do that,"" Kaplan said of the bankruptcy. ""My attorney thought it was best for me to do it. It was something that was completely out of my control. It wasn't because I didn't know how to budget my finances. ""I have nothing to hide. I don't mind being on the hot seat. The arrows will come, and I can take it."" Wesley, the board chairman, said he was comfortable voting for Kaplan despite the bankruptcy. ""Her service has been exemplary and she has been very active in the community,"" Wesley said. Kaplan is a former professional dancer, University of Pennsylvania police officer and Bucks County behavioral health advocate but has not worked full-time for pay in more than seven years. In addition to being on the township planning commission, she is also a member of the board of directors of the Lower Southampton library. Kaplan, who joins a board of four Republicans, declined to disclose her party affiliation Tuesday night. When asked about the alleged secret meeting, Congdon responded there were ""no secret meetings held at my home."" When asked outside the meeting room whether the official Wesley was referring to had been at his home, Congdon said ""I don't know who they are talking about. There's been three people indicted."" After finishing the public interviews of the three applicants, the four supervisors were advised by township solicitor Frank Dillon that adjourning to a separate room to confer in executive session was not allowable. So instead, the four supervisors remained in the meeting room but talked among themselves just far enough away from their microphones that they couldn't be heard by the audience. They were chided by resident Scott Russell into picking up the discussion again in a way that everyone could hear them. All four supervisors said it was very hard questioning Kaplan and Congdon about tough issues but they felt obligated to do it because of the ""black cloud"" the township has been under because of the indictments and other issues. ""We're doing our due diligence,"" Wesley said. Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery. © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Michael,Gordon,1966,https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/explained-why-dont-some-mps-like-theresa-mays-brexit-plan,"The forecast for the next 5 days Catch up on TV bulletins Delivered daily to your inbox Theresa May has been defending her Brexit plan, after it was heavily criticised last week. FactCheck examines two of the main concerns. Under the proposals, the UK will enter a “transition period”, after it formally leaves the EU in March 2019. Both sides will then use their “best endeavours” to reach a follow-up Brexit deal. However, some MPs are worried about what might happen if that follow-up deal doesn’t materialise. But do their criticisms stack up? If a future deal is not reached, Theresa May’s proposal provides a safety net, known as the “backstop” plan. It’s designed partly to prevent a physical border being introduced between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (which is part of the EU). Most politicians agree there should not be a “hard border”. But, controversially, the backstop plan means Northern Ireland could be treated differently from the rest of the UK. In particular, Northern Ireland would have deeper ties to the EU on trade and customs than England, Scotland or Wales. The EU explained: “There would be a need for checks on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland. There would be a need for some compliance checks with EU standards, consistent with risk, to protect consumers, economic traders and businesses in the Single Market. “The EU and the UK have agreed to carry out these checks in the least intrusive way possible.” So would this undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom, as some critics have claimed? That’s a matter of opinion. Speaking to FactCheck, Michael Gordon, a professor of constitutional law at Liverpool University, pointed out that Northern Ireland is already a distinct part of the UK. It is already treated differently in certain ways. “It seems to me quite well established that Northern Ireland has a specific, particular, distinctive constitutional status within the UK,” he said. “We have devolution, and Northern Ireland has devolved powers… That doesn’t mean it’s not part of the UK.” However, some argue that the draft Brexit deal goes beyond the existing constitutional differences. Professor of European Law at Cambridge University, Kenneth Armstrong, told FactCheck: “It’s not so much about the fact these are different rules – but who are the author of those rules.” In other words, it’s one thing for domestic policies to create constitutional differences – but it’s another thing for them to be created by international agreements. Perhaps even more controversially is how long this backstop plan could last for. Critics say that Mrs May’s deal does not give Britain the sovereign right to leave the backstop, without getting permission from the EU. This means the EU could keep the UK trapped in the backstop indefinitely, they say. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “It is also harder to leave this backstop than it is to leave the EU.” Even Theresa May has admitted she shares some concerns about the backstop. So what do the documents actually say? Under the proposals, there is no mechanism for the UK to leave the backstop of its own accord. Instead, the UK and EU must “decide jointly” if they want to end it. The draft deal says: “If… the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly… that the Protocol, in whole or in part, is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives, the Protocol shall cease to apply.” Professor Armstrong told us: “It doesn’t tell us what will happen if there’s disagreement.” “On that basis, you might say it then becomes a semi-permanent mechanism… because there doesn’t appear to be a way out.” So, critics are right to say the proposals don’t contain a specific, unilateral “get-out” clause. (This compares to membership of the EU, where Article 50 provides a specific mechanism to leave). But does this mean it would be completely impossible for the UK to leave the backstop? The truth is, nobody can know for certain how difficult it would be to leave. But there are number of issues to bear in mind. “The UK Parliament could, in strict UK constitutional terms, leave the Backstop by passing the appropriate Act of Parliament of its own accord,” explained Dr Joelle Grogan from Middlesex University’s School of Law (who contributed to the3million campaign, which campaigns for EU Citizens living in the UK). However, she added: “This would only end the Backstop at a national level. At international level, the UK would be seen as in breach of its obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement.” “Domestically, Parliament is sovereign,” Professor Gordon agreed. “Parliament can undo our commitment to that international agreement, in extreme circumstances. And it would be extreme circumstances because the costs of it would be so high…” “The costs would be really, really significant – to the point where it probably should never happen. It’s not a safeguard, but it is a reality that I think qualifies any of these ideas that the EU could act in bad faith and lock us into some agreement at the international level. There would always be domestic law options.” “The entire purpose of this mechanism is not to be permanent,” he added. “So when people say ‘the EU could trap us in this thing permanently by refusing to consent to an exit deal if we ask for one,’ that’s the point where I start to think this is actually approaching a misrepresentation a bit.” “There are good faith negotiation obligations written into the terms of the withdrawal agreement.” Perhaps more significantly, Professor Armstrong told FactCheck that the EU could find itself in legal difficulties if it trapped the UK in the backstop indefinitely. The draft deal was negotiated under Article 50, which covers the withdrawal of member states. However, it is not meant to be used to establish a permanent future relationship. Therefore, if the backstop became permanent, that could be in conflict with the EU’s own laws. “The European Union could not rely upon the permanency of that relationship through the backstop, because that itself would be a conflict with Article 50,” he said. However, we could find ourselves in a Catch 22 situation. Professor Armstrong believes that, if the matter was taken to an arbitration panel, it would probably conclude the only legal means of ending the backstop would be by establishing a deal for the future relationship. But if no deal can be reached, we’d end up in deadlock. What troubles Professor Armstrong more is that the proposals may have gone too far, in terms of planning for a future deal. “The backstop is also being used, somewhat, as leverage for what the future relationship would look like,” he said. “We’ve got seven pages of bullet points on the future relationship that is yet to be negotiated, and it’s clear that there are very different views on that.” He explained: “The backstop has ended up not just being a kind of insurance or safety net – but for some it’s a trap… for others it’s a way of kind of bouncing the UK into a particular version of the future relationship.” There are clearly some very legitimate concerns about the constitutional implications of Theresa May’s draft Brexit deal, due to it not containing a specific mechanism for a unilateral end to the backstop. There is little doubt that – in theory – this could make life difficult for the UK, if the EU were to refuse to end the backstop. But, as ever, the truth is a little more complicated than the headlines. If the UK did end up in this situation, there would be certain legal options we could explore – although it’s far from clear how this would pan out. Leaving without the EU’s consent would certainly be extremely difficult and almost certainly economically damaging. But it is not necessarily categorically impossible. However things may pan out in the future, the draft proposals make clear that neither side currently intends to use the backstop indefinitely. Professor Armstrong told us: “I really do think this is not intended to be a trap but really a trampoline, and it will propel both the UK and the EU forwards to a new relationship.”

Andrew,Davis,1963,http://www.bendbulletin.com/opinion/6700372-151/editorial-take-a-look-at-runner-ups,"Bend city councilors already are thinking about how they’ll fill a vacancy on that body come January. They’ve got plans for application forms, letters of interest and interviews of those they believe are the top five candidates. That’s all well and good, but there’s another way to approach the matter that makes more sense. Councilors should seriously consider asking one of the two people who came in second in their races for the council earlier this month to fill the vacancy. Sarah McCormick ran against Barb Campbell, who beat her by a bit over 2,000 votes. Andrew Davis ran for the empty seat that will be filled by Gena Goodman-Campbell in January. The outcome in that contest was not close, but Davis did receive about 12,000 votes for the position. Both Davis and McCormick have things that should give them an edge when it comes to filling the vacancy. They have already demonstrated they want to serve the city and have spent considerable time paying attention to its workings as candidates. They’ve made themselves known to city residents in ways no other appointee can have done: knocking on doors, appearing at public gatherings, and the like. What they may not share with some council members is a lockstep view of what’s best for Bend, and that, too, is a plus. While it’s nice to have three women on the council at one time, it’s far more important to have divergent views among council members. Either Davis or McCormick could be expected to supply that diversity of viewpoint. While current councilors no doubt feel they can be fair no matter what selection process they use, human nature being what it is, they’re likely to pick someone they believe they can work well with. That’s not what the job of a council member is, however. He or she, whether elected or appointed, is there to represent the citizens of Bend in all their diversity. The more voices, then, the merrier. Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.

Their work is having an impact across introductory writing courses and producing direct cost savings for students. Karen Forgette, Andrew Davis and Guy Krueger won the OLC Digital Learning Innovation Award for their project, “Addressing Access, Assessment and College Readiness Gaps in First-Year Composition: Personalized Open Educational Resources Courseware Modules at the University of Mississippi.” The honor includes a $10,000 stipend. The UM team, in collaboration with Lumen Learning, applied principles of OER to develop and implement customized, low-cost, modular courseware in first-year writing curricula. The courseware addresses student preparation gaps in foundational content knowledge and rhetorical skills, areas often under-assessed in writing classes. “We have worked together on adaptive/personalized courseware for six years, and it was very satisfying to see such a payoff after this time,” said Krueger, core lecturer and Writing 101 curriculum chair. “More importantly to us, though, was that it was fulfilling to know that the work we do for our students is recognized as valuable.” To overcome the limitations of generalized, pre-packaged course material restricted by traditional copyright, the trio adapted open content to their own institutional context. This approach produced courseware that’s relevant, engaging and connected to the needs and experience of Ole Miss faculty and students. Survey results following the fall 2017 pilot of roughly 1,000 students revealed that 68.5 percent felt the courseware contributed to their success on major writing projects. Data also revealed that students used the courseware in various ways without being prompted, indicating the platform is versatile enough to accommodate individual student needs. “We feel that we are out in front of our field in a lot of ways since adaptive/personalized learning isn’t used much in writing courses,” Krueger said. “So to be able to help our students and save them money is rewarding on its own. But to receive a national award for this work – we couldn’t be happier.” The open courseware has substantially reduced textbooks costs for students. After the team’s success with the pilot, the courseware has been implemented programwide for the fall 2018 semester and is being used by at least two other schools. “Andrew Davis, Karen Forgette and Guy Krueger are innovative teachers who think first and foremost about their students,” said Stephen Monroe, chair of the Department of Writing and Rhetoric. “With the support of PLATO, a UM program funded by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, this incredible team has developed low-cost digital modules that personalize learning for UM students. “These tools are making an enormous impact across our introductory writing courses. The University of Mississippi is a national leader on this front because of Andrew, Karen and Guy.” The trio was presented the award and recognized at a ceremony Nov. 13 in Orlando, Florida. “The OLC Award for Digital Learning Innovation by a faculty team is a testament to the successful combination of collaborative course revision for multiple sections, low cost/high impact digital learning tools and a department-level commitment to continual improvement,” said Patti O’Sullivan, PLATO program director. “The PLATO Program provided the First Year Writing course directors financial and organizational support, but Guy, Karen and Andrew put in hundreds of hours to create learning and practice modules. I am so pleased to see them recognized nationally for their work.” Lee Cohen, dean of the university’s College of Liberal Arts, agreed. “Our faculty team in the Department of Writing and Rhetoric spent many months developing innovative online modules to complement proven, traditional teaching methods,” Cohen said. “We are very proud of what we are doing on our campus in this regard and are grateful to the OLC for recognizing the outstanding work of our faculty as a national best practice.” OXFORD, Miss. – A group of more than 50 people – including University of Mississippi faculty and students, Oxford high school students and community members – recently visited the Equal Justice Museum and Memorial Park in Montgomery, Alabama.

Andrew,Davis,1963,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/WORLD-Taiwan-marriage-Tanzanias-loss-queer-rap-group-rugby-player/64777.html,"In related news, more than 100,000 peopleincluding musicians, filmmakers and politiciansrallied on Ketagalan Boulevard in Taipei to show support for same-sex marriage ahead of the Nov. 24 referendums on the issue, the Taipei Times noted. Referendum No. 14 aims to legalize same-sex marriage by amending the Civil Code and No. 15 requires that classes on homosexuality be included in compulsory education; on the flip side, referenda 10-12 advocate opposing stances. Tanzania has lost $10 million worth of aid funding from Denmark abecause of the African country's anti-gay crackdown, PinkNews reported. Danish Development Minister Ulla Tornaes announced the decision on Twitter, expressing her concerns about respect for LGBT+ rights and gay people in the country. Denmark is the second-largest donor to the country, gifting a total the equivalent of $53 million in foreign aid last year, Reuters noted. Also on Wednesday, the World Bank decided to scrap plans for a $300-million loan to Tanzania due to the country forbidding pregnant girls from attending school and to return to class after giving birth, CNN reported. Five young rappers from Sao Paulo decided to create Quebrada Queer, Brazil's ( and maybe Latin America's ) first LGBTQI cypher at the beginning of 2018and it's fighting for survival and safety in what's been called the world's LGBT murder capital, according to Remezcla.com . Claiming to be the only openly LGBTQ cypher in the world, Quebrada Queer formed from the urgency to address issues such as LGBTQI-phobia, racism and social inequality. The group consists of appers Guigo ( 26 years old ), Harlley ( 20 ), Lucas Boombeat ( 24 ), Murillo Zyess ( 23 ), Tchelo Gomez ( 26 ) and DJ Apuke ( the crew's musical producer ). Former Wales rugby union captain Gareth Thomas has reported he was the victim of a homophobic assault by a teenager, The News Tribune noted. The 44-year-old Thomaswho announced in 2009 that he is gaythanked the police and the people of Cardiff for their support following the incident in Cardiff. Police in Cardiff confirmed a 16-year-old boy, who was not named, admitted to assault. Far-right militants attacked a rally in support of transgender rights held in Ukraine on Nov. 18, PinkNews noted. Led by the non-governmental organizsation Insight, trans-rights campaigners gathered in Ukraine capital of Kiev to demand an end to transphobia ahead of Transgender Day of Remembrance, observed on Nov. 20. According to U.S. journalist Christopher Miller, who tweeted about the rally, a group of religious and far-right militants confronted the LGBT+ activists early in the afternoon at a park in the city, forcing them to change the location of the legally sanctioned rally. A provincial administration in Indonesia has said it is preparing to issue a regulation to restrict LGBTIs, Gay Star News reported. The administration of Depok, in West Java, said the regulations are in order as LGBTI influence is becoming more common in the area. However, Depok Mayor Mohammad Idris also said that such a legislation would require legal consent from the Indonesian government. In Canada, Alberta Education Minister David Eggen is directing 28 privately run schools to post rules affirming the rights of LGBTQ students or risk having their funding pulled by next school year, CityNews Toronto reported. Private schools receive as much as 70 percent of their funding from the province. All public, separate, francophone and charter schools have policies in place, representing more than 98 percent of kindergarten to Grade 12 students, according to Eggen. A draft new constitution for Cuba that paves the way for same-sex marriage as well as the right to private property was ready to go before lawmakers on yesterday for fine-tuning ahead of a referendum next year, PhilStar.com noted. The government formally ended three months of consultative debates in town halls, workplaces and universities across the Communist-run island of 11 million people. The hottest topic in the town hall debates was the text's definition of marriage as a union ""between two persons""not a man and a woman as specified in the Soviet-era constitution drafted in 1976. The minister in charge of helping Britain leave the European Union, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, abruptly resigned from Prime Minister Theresa May's governmentsaying he could not support the withdrawal agreement approved by her cabinet the previous night, The Washington Post reported. Also quitting their posts were two other ministers and a junior minister in the Brexit ministry, providing a setback for May. Unsurprisingly, U.S. House conservatives are protesting LGBT protection in a Mexico-Canada trade deal, Politico reported. They are displeased that the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement contains requirements that workers be protected from discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation and gender identity. The conservativesincluding House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows and Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa )are hoping to revise the deal before it gets signed. LGBT actor Ezra Miller wore yet another eye-catching look to the UK premiere of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald recently, according to Page Six. The actor, 26, chose a white feathered Givenchy Haute Couture outfit for the evening's blue carpet, adding extra drama by writing ""Avada Kedavra""known to all Harry Potter fans as the killing spellon his palms and ""Dumbledore's Army"" and ""still recruiting"" on his boots. The previous week, he wore a dramatic puffer gown with a hooded cape and gloves as a tribute to his character's dark energy, called the Obscurus. An Australian bridal magazine has announced it will close after contributors revealed it was refusing to feature same-sex couples, PinkNews noted. White magazine, which started 12 years ago and is one of the country's largest wedding publications, said several advertisers had pulled their sponsorship following the controversy. The publishers said, ""White Magazine has always been a secular publication, but as its publishers, we are Christian. We have no agenda but to love."" Queen Elizabeth reached across the pond to give her emotional support as the deadly wildfires in California continue, People.com noted. In a statement, the queen offered her compassion to those affected by the fires in the Golden Statewhich happens to be the birthplace of the newest member of her family, Meghan Markle. Australian police are seeking a potential witness after a man plunged three floors from a Sydney balcony and was impaled on a table leg on the same day he met up with another man on a dating app, PinkNews noted. The Swedish-American national was in critical condition at St. Vincent's Hospital following the incident. Local press reported that the man met up with another man earlier that day on gay dating app Grindr. Victoria's Secret CEO of lingerie Jan Singer is resigning, NewNowNext.com noted. The news came less than a week after exec Ed Razek's fat-phobic and transphobic comments about plus-size and transgender models at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show made the rounds. He later apologized for the offensive remarks and clarified that he ""would"" cast a trans model; the company has had some trans models apply; they just ""didn't make it.""

Andrew,Davis,1963,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Mich-lawsuit-Michelle-Obama-Harvey-Milk-gay-teen-politician/64773.html,"Michelle Obama shared on The Ellen DeGeneres Showand in her new memoir, Becomingthat she ( and daughter Malia ) tried to slip past the Secret Service to celebrate marriage equality with advocates, NewNowNext.com . Obama said, ""It took 15 minutes to get outside. We stood along with all the cheering crowd, off to the side, mind you, so no one would see us, with security surrounding us. And we tried to have our tender, mother-daughter moment. But we just took it in. I held her tight, and my feeling was, we are moving forward. Change is happening."" Stuart Milk, the nephew of the late gay icon Harvey Milk ( who was assassinated 40 years ago this year, on Nov. 27 ), recently spoke at the University at Albany, The State University of New York, according to AlbanyStudentPress.net . Stuart, who is gay himself, explained that Harvey knew about his sexuality before Stuart knew about it himself, and he felt so humbled to know that Harvey was always behind him to watch over. After his death, Stuart said that he was humbled by his uncle's efforts to increase visibility throughout the United States and continued his legacy at home and abroad as well. Harvey was a human-rights leader and the first openly gay elected state official in California, as well as one of the first in the United States. In Texas, Cross Coburna gay 19-year-old Groves city councilman ousted by voters in a recall drivestood defiantly before his former colleagues recently as they affirmed the election results removing him from office, the Beaumont Enterprise reported. Coburn was targeted for recall after nude photos of him from a gay-dating app were anonymously mailed to City Hall earlier this year. The recall measure passed Nov. 6 by a two-thirds majority. Mayor Brad P. Bailey said the council will likely vote on Coburn's replacement at its Nov. 26 meeting. GLSEN spoke out against Education Secretary DeVos' proposed new Title IX rules for schools handling allegations of sexual harassment aimed at scrapping Obama-era guidance that sought to protect students raising accusations of sexual harassment and assault, in favor of bolstering the rights of accused students, a press release noted. ""The U.S. Department of Education's proposed regulations could create cruel and unnecessary obstacles for survivors of sexual harassment, including LGBTQ students who already experience higher rates of sexual harassment in schools than their peers,"" said GLSEN Executive Director Eliza Byard. ""All students deserve to have school administrators take their experiences seriously and support them throughout a process that can often be deeply traumatic."" This proposal begins a 60-day public comment period, and the administration can still make changes before the regulation is finalized. In Baltimore, authorities found 43-year-old gay fitness coordinator and waiter Brendon Michaels beaten to death in his apartment, according to Queerty. Fire department discovered the body, and police have no suspect or motive. Michaels won $50,000 in the Maryland lottery in 2011. Before his death, he worked as the fitness center coordinator at Carroll Community College and as a part-time waiter at Olive Garden. A Southern California man pled not guilty to the murder of a gay University of Pennsylvania student in a hate crime, The Huffington Post noted. Samuel Woodward, a 21-year-old from Newport Beach, California, entered the plea regarding the January stabbing death of 19-year-old college sophomore Blaze Bernstein, who was home visiting his family on winter break. Bernstein, who was gay and Jewish, went missing after he went out with Woodward to a park in Lake Forest, California; his body was found days later buried at the park in a shallow grave. A group of LGBTQ asylum-seekers who split from the larger migrant caravan has arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, NewNowNext.com noted. Around 80 migrants, the majority of whom identify as LGBTQ, made it to Tijuana on Nov. 11and they were met with hostility and fear while facing an uncertain future. They were the first of more than 3,600 Central Americans to arrive at the border, NPR reported, after splintering off in Mexico City after weeks of harsh treatment from others in the group, as well as townsfolk along the way. A new campaign aims to draw attention to the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom ( ADF ), which has been labeled an anti-LGBTQ ""hate group"" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, NBC News noted. Since its founding nearly 25 years ago, ADF has been linked to efforts seeking to criminalize homosexuality, restrict transgender people's access to sex-segregated facilities and permit businesses to deny service to LGBTQ people. A Times Square billboard is expected to remain through February, and directs viewers to the Citizens for Transparency's website ( nogaysallowed.org/ ). Polk County has elected Florida's first openly gay school board member, OrlandoWeekly.com noted. Sarah Fortney, a 34-year veteran of the classroom, became the state's first openly gay member of a school district after she bested Publix store manager Scott Jones for the Polk County School Board's District 3 seat. Police in Seattle have again said they are not investigating the death of a young gay man who died after injecting silicone into his body, Gay Star News noted. The cause of death of Jack Chapman ( who changed his name to Tank Heathcliff Hafertepen in 2016 ) is now listed as ""accidental"" rather than ""natural."" His death was caused through the use of silicone; he used it to boost the size and appearance of his genitals. A viral photo showed about 30 male members of the Baraboo High School Class of 2019 giving the Nazi salute before their junior prom last springbut gay student Jordan Blue did not take part, Instinct Magazine noted. Blue can be seen in the top right of the photo with his arms down, his face showing only a neutral expression while most of his classmates are pictured laughing. Blue, who came out as gay earlier this year, shared with Vice reporter Jules Suzdaltsev that he's been the target of bullying by the boys since middle school. Seven months after her controversial hiring, Mazzoni Center CEO Lydia Gonzalez Sciarrinoa straight woman leading the LGBT healthcare providerwill be stepping down, Philly.com reported. In March, some in the queer community, including the Black and Brown Workers Cooperative activist group, called for Sciarrino's firing, while Mazzoni defended her hire. Mazzoni Chief Operating Officer Ron Powers, a 20-year veteran of the organization, also is resigning, the Gay News reported. The paper said three staffers would lead the center after Sciarrino leaves next month. Chappy, a gay relationship app for men, announced a partnership with GLAAD called ""Chats for Charity"" that will raise money for the organization for each chat session initiated on the app, a press release noted. This feature will become a fixture of the app in 2019, but Chappy will begin donating immediately. A new study in the Journal of Homosexuality finally provides some concrete evidence that sexual-orientation conversion therapy during adolescence is associated with poor mental health outcomes, a Psychology Today item noted. The study recruited 245 LGBT people between 21 and 25, who were asked ""Between ages 13 and 19, how often did any of your parents/caregivers try to change your sexual orientation ( i.e., to make you straight )?"" and ""Between ages 13 and 19, how often did any of your parents/caregivers take you to a therapist or religious leader to cure, treat, or change your sexual orientation?"" They also had participants complete several mental-health measures. Truth Wins Outa non-profit organization founded by author/LGBT advocate Wayne Besen, and best known for monitoring right-wing extremism and outing hypocritical ""ex-gay"" activistshas reopened its doors, per a press release. In a video released to its supporters, Besen said he decided to re-enter the political arena because of the dramatic resurgence of hate and bigotry caused by Donald Trump and his Republican Party sympathizers. Hillary Clinton surprised a crowd including Anna Wintour, Lupita Nyong'o and Ashley Graham at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards, Page Six noted. Clintonwho is rumored to be considering another presidential runencouraged the women in the crowd to run for office. Also speaking at the awards was another potential presidential candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as well as John Legend, who cried while introducing his wife, Chrissy Teigen. Andrew Gillum, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida, conceded to his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, ending a protracted fight that saw the Tallahassee mayor take back his Election Day concession during a statewide recount, CNN.com noted. The concession ended Gillum's first bid for statewide office in Florida, but the rundespite his loss seemingly vaulted the 39-year old politician into the upper reaches of Democratic politics. In a step toward further acknowledgment of the LGBTQ+ student population, Nashville Christian institution Lipscomb University has hired an official liaison to improve relations with that community, according to Lumination Network.Dannie Woods, an alumna of Lipscomb, joined the Student Life office to ""be a bridge-builder between Student Life and our LGBT student community,"" she told Lumination Network. As recently as the 2013-14 school year, ""homosexual behavior"" was specifically outlawed in the student handbook under the Sexual Morality policy. Actor/comedian Bill Cosby, who is serving a three-to-10-year prison sentence for a 2004 sexual assault, now awaits another trial for allegedly molesting a minor in 1974, The Huffington Post noted. LA Superior Court Judge Craig Kaplan announced that the civil trial will begin Oct. 7, 2019, just more than a year after Cosby was sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting former Temple University basketball coach Andrea Constand. Judy Huth claims that Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1974 during a party at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice may interview for head coach of the Cleveland Browns, according to an ESPN report that Deadline cited. If Rice actually moves forward, she would be the first woman to ever interview for an NFL head coaching job. Cleveland GM John Dorsey said he was open to hiring a woman for the position. However, Dorsey has denied the ESPN report, saying, ""Our coaching search will be thorough and deliberate, but we are still in the process of composing the list of candidates and Secretary Rice has not been discussed,"" TheWrap noted. A federal judge ruled in favor of CNN and reporter Jim Acosta in a dispute with President Trump, ordering the White House to temporarily restore the press credentials that the Trump administration had taken away from Acosta, The Washington Post reported. In a victory for the cable network and for press access generally, Judge Timothy J. Kelly granted CNN's motion for a temporary restraining order that will prevent the administration from keeping Acosta off White House grounds. The White House revoked the reporter's press pass after a heated exchange between him and Trump and a brief altercation with a press aide at a news conference. An emotional Monica Lewinsky revealed that she contemplated suicide after her affair with President Bill Clinton was first uncovered, InsideEdition.com noted. ""I remember looking out the window and thinking the only way to fix this was to kill myself, to jump out the window,"" Lewinsky says in an upcoming A&E special. The former White House intern is featured in a new six-part docuseries for the network called The Clinton Affair, which debuted Nov. 18.

Michael,Gordon,1961,https://www.wbtv.com/2018/11/19/butler-high-student-charged-killing-faces-lesser-charge/,"CHARLOTTE, NC (Michael Gordon/The Charlotte Observer) - Jatwan Cuffie, the Butler High School freshman accused of the Oct. 29 hallway shooting of a fellow student, will face a lesser charge of second-degree murder Monday. Cuffie, 16, was initially charged with first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of Butler High sophomore Bobby McKeithen, also 16. A copy of the docket for today’s Mecklenburg County Grand Jury lists Cuffie’s name and the second-degree murder charge. A reduction in the charge would mean the teen may qualify for a bond hearing. That potentially could lead to his release from the Mecklenburg County Jail, where he has been held since his arrest. [ Student accused of killing classmate at Butler HS appears in court ] Cuffie’s next scheduled court appearance is Wednesday. Grand jury deliberations are private. Refusals to indict, particularly on such a serious charge, are exceedingly rare. Unlike the jurors in a trial, who must decide guilt “beyond a reasonable doubt,” a grand jury only must decide if there is “probable cause” that a crime occurred. A list of the indictments, or “true bills,” will be released Monday afternoon. Asked why a lesser charge was being taken to the grand jury, Mecklenburg County District Attorney Spencer Merriweather said Friday he is not allowed by his professional code of ethics to discuss an ongoing case. Defense attorney Michael Greene confirmed that the grand jury would consider a second-degree murder charge against his client but declined further comment. The shooting took place before the Monday morning start of classes at Butler. Video posted online showed a student, believed to be Cuffie, pulling a gun and shooting McKeithen in the side as McKeithen threw punches in the crowded hallway. During an interview with Matthews police after his arrest, Cuffie said the shooting followed a fight in a Harris Teeter parking lot the Friday night before. [ Student accused of killing classmate details weekend fight, text messages that led up to deadly shooting ] Cuffie told police that McKeithen punched him in the hall and then he pulled out a gun and shot him, according to arrest documents. Shortly after the shooting, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Superintendent Clayton Wilcox said it may have been related to bullying. But school officials have since backed off using the term in connection with the incident. During the Friday night fight, one of the people fighting Cuffie pulled out a knife, he told police. Cuffie and his friend ran away when the knife came out, he said. The fight video shows McKeithen at the fight scene but does not show him taking part. Later in the weekend, a friend of the teen who allegedly had a knife texted Cuffie to ask who he thought had won the fight, Cuffie said, according to arrest documents. [ Search warrant issued for cellphone of student accused of killing classmate at Butler HS ] A friend told Cuffie that one of the teenagers who fought him Friday was planning to fight him at school, Cuffie told officers. Early Monday morning, Cuffie “went to the woods to get his gun for protection” and put it in his pocket, according to the documents. Matthews police earlier reported that the gun was stolen in August from a car in Gaston County, the Observer reported. The arrest documents also say Cuffie didn’t think the bullet struck McKeithen, and he was going to shoot again but ran away instead, according to his police interview. Cuffie ran into a classroom and told his ninth-grade math teacher what was going on, the documents state. “She asked him where the gun was and he told her (it was) in his book bag,” according to the documents. “And she moved the bag away from him.” 1 Julian Price Pl.Charlotte, NC 28208(704) 374-3500
