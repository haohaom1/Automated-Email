Top time in the 5K was recorded by Zac Creeden, 17, of Ogdensburg, at 20:28.88. Top female finisher and seventh overall in the 12K was Karen Cummings, 56, of Sussex with a time of 58:57.01.

McNeely began playing jazz alongside Sonny Criss as a teenager, then turned to R&B. He drew attention by sustaining a single note for 50 bars of music, playing one song for an hour straight, and delivering high-energy performances. His 1948 debut “Deacon’s Hop” topped the R&B chart, and was followed by such other singles as ""The Goof,"" ""Strip Tease Swing,"" ""Nervous Man Nervous,"" ""Teen Age Hop,"" and ""3-D."" He scored another major hit with 1959's ""There Is Something On Your Mind.""

Flight Winners pictured from left to right are Curtis Smith-D Flight, Willard Vicks- C Flight, Lyle Heath- B Flight and Mark Dill- A Flight. Pictured are the Laidback Golfers with the Star Tribune Paper at Forest Oaks Country Club in Greensboro. With Hurricane Florence just off the Carolina coast still picking its landfall location; 25 members of the Laidback Golf Tour headed to Greensboro to play their first ever tournament at Forest Oaks Country Club on Wednesday, Sept. 12. Forest Oaks was the former site of the PGA Tour’s GGO and Wyndham events from 1977-2007. The Ellis Maples designed course opened in 1962 and was slightly redesigned by Davis Love III in 2002. Golf World Magazine now rates the course a 4.7 of possible five. The group found the course to be quite deserving of its rating even under cloudy sometimes rainy conditions. The group was able to card 25 birdies and see seven rounds in the seventies. All who participated are looking forward to playing here again. With a larger than normal A Flight today they were able to pay four places in the flight. The top spot had to be determined by a play-off as both Fran Hensley and Mark Dill finished at 75. Hensley had three birdies during regulation while Dill only had two; but it was Dill’s birdie on the first hole of play-off that gave him his first Tour win of the season. Hensley was trying for her third win in a row but claimed second as she made par on the play-off hole. Mike Reynolds finished third with a score of 76 and Steve Manley claimed fourth at 77. B Flight also had another first-time winner as Lyle Heath carded his second lowest round of the season at 83 for the win by a stroke over David Wilson. Wilson; who has two previous wins came into the final hole tied with Heath but bogied for his 84 second place finish. Dave Voss claimed the flight’s third place prize on a card match with Jim White as both finished at 85. The Tours current leading money winner Willard Vicks claimed his fourth win of the season in the C Flight with his round of 84. Vicks also closed the gap on the Tours points leader Randy McCann to only 430 points with five more tournaments to go. Mike Asbury finished second at 86 and Mike Pritchett claimed third on a card match with Red Thompson; both having 87s. With only two players in the D Flight Curtis Smith edged out Tour Director Kenny Powell for his second win of the season. Smith finished with a 97 as Powell’s 52 back nine sent him over 100 at 101 for the day. The Tours next tournament is scheduled for Monday Oct. 1 at Greensboro National Golf Club in Summerfield, NC. Beginning at 10 a.m. Entry fee is $65 for members. Sign-up now or no later than noon Saturday Sept. 29 by emailing golftripman@yahoo.com.

Michael,Gordon,1644,https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/366815/consumer-confidence-at-concerning-6-year-low,"Consumer confidence has hit a 6-year low as growth in house prices slows and fuel prices rise, new figures show. Consumer confidence in Auckland was particularly downbeat because of the slowing housing market. Photo: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly The Westpac McDermott Miller consumer confidence index fell five points in the current quarter to 103.5. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said Auckland was particularly downbeat because of the slowing housing market and the new regional fuel tax. ""Housing is really quite an important component of wealth for New Zealanders, and when house prices are rising rapidly you tend to see people spending a bit more freely out of their perceived wealth,"" he said. ""Property owners are just not getting that accumulation of wealth that they were in the past."" Mr Gordon said the fall in sentiment was a concern because consumer confidence was a broader, more sound measure of feeling about the economy. ""This is not a dissatisfaction with who is in power, it does seem to be a more genuine read of how people are feeling about how the economy is tracking."" Mr Gordon said low consumer confidence would be of most concern to retail businesses because it indicated consumers would spend less. It appeared that the boost from the Government's recently introduced families package was yet to show through. He said gloomy commentary from business leaders may also be a factor in the lower consumer confidence. Copyright © 2018, Radio New Zealand Consumers are more optomistic than businesses in the latest confidence surveys but the two results point to a potential slowdown in the economy by the end of the year. The government is playing down a warning from the Treasury that it's finances could be under threat from a slump in business confidence and a cooling housing market.

Key Quotes “While this was the largest deficit in three years, it is still low relative to history, and remains within the range of what we would consider to be sustainable.” “The balance of trade in goods and services improved in the June quarter, though it was softer than the same time last year.” “Despite the widening in the current account deficit, New Zealand’s international position remains on a sustainable path. Net international liabilities were steady at 54.6% of GDP, which is the lowest reading for this series dating back to June 2000.” “Relatively small current account deficits in recent years, and hence a smaller borrowing requirement, have meant that New Zealand has effectively been able to outgrow its debts.” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

The Spanish judiciary meanwhile turns the law on its head to quench dissent. Catalan National Day celebrations, September 11, 2018.Nr Photo?prss Association. All rights reserved. In the United States, the protection of speech can be traced back to the foundation of the country, hence its prominent and purposeful inclusion as part of the first amendment to the Constitution. Over the course of two hundred plus years that freedom has been tested, and political and civil society leaders from different generations – from George Washington to Frederick Douglass to Cesar Chavez – worked to ensure the tradition of speaking truth to power remains a pillar of the American Republic. An opposite approach has been taken in Spain, where current law treats peaceful protest as a public security concern, assigns heavy fines for acts of civil disobedience and criminalizes speech online, giving security services extraordinary powers, while limiting citizen protections. Broadly condemned by the UN special rapporteur charged with protecting freedom of peaceful assembly, the New York Times’ Editorial Board summed up the most infamous of recent laws restricting basic freedoms by saying it had ‘no place in a democratic nation, where Spaniards, as citizens of the European Union, have more than a virtual right to peaceful, collective protest.’ As political tensions have risen between Madrid and Barcelona over last year’s independence referendum, the restrictions on free speech and assembly have gone into overdrive. Leaders of two of Catalonia’s largest civil society organizations have languished in preventative custody since October 2017 on charges of sedition, even though video evidence disproves the charges, which have been condemned internationally. And nine former members of Catalonia’s government and parliament are also jailed, even while their colleagues who chose exile rather than arrest – including Catalonia’s former president Carles Puigdemont – live freely across Europe. But measures to quash basic freedoms in Catalonia have not been aimed solely at political and civil society leadership, rather they have targeted dissent more broadly. But measures to quash basic freedoms in Catalonia have not been aimed solely at political and civil society leadership, rather they have targeted dissent more broadly, including the right to protest, debate, and even artistic expression, with Spain recently assuming the dubious distinction of incarcerating more artists than any country in the world. In the same vein, Amnesty International released a report this year which details the abuse of counter-terrorism laws to restrict expression online, most graphically symbolized by the unprecedented step of shutting down websites and apps by authorities, violating both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights in the process. Much of the justification of repression by Spanish authorities comes in the form of comparing pro-independence leaders and organizations to the Nazis, a spurious accusation which sadly serves as a familiar bogeyman for prominent former and current officials of both the left and the right in Spain. Astonishingly, the consensus extends to the far-right, where in a recent act of extraordinary irony, the far-right Spanish party Vox, writing to a German court, compared the Catalan president in exile to Hitler. By linking those who speak out or question the political status quo to Nazis and extremists, these otherwise mainstream politicians have stacked the deck against any possibility of negotiating over legitimate political demands. The Spanish judiciary meanwhile turns the law on its head to quench dissent, in a perverse and systematic abuse of legislative intent meant to protect speech, assembly, minorities and the vulnerable. By weaponizing hate speech legislation, a national minority is now cast as the extremist oppressor, and anything goes to silence and jail its political and civil leadership. By weaponizing hate speech legislation, a national minority is now cast as the extremist oppressor, and anything goes to silence and jail its political and civil leadership. In Spain, current legislation allows for the proscription and prosecution of dissent, which Spanish institutions have used to criminalize what is inherently a political question. Here in the United States, the first amendment protects speech, even speech we don’t like, precisely because it takes interpretation out of the hands of the state and forces it back into the public square. It encourages debate rather than litigating it. If applied in Catalonia, incarcerated and exiled political and civil society leaders would be able to participate openly and without fear of retribution in social and political life, free to seek democratic solutions to political questions. Catalonia’s national day, which falls in September, commemorates the loss of the War of Succession of 1714, after which Spain moved to quash Catalonia’s centuries-old institutions and liberties. This year, for the seventh consecutive year, a massive, peaceful march of one million Catalans commemorated that loss, conscious that the struggle to protect and defend those rights marks their present as much as their past.

This prompted Exmouth dad David Preece to express his concerns about the school’s rules on uniform sparking a debate among parents on social media. Mr Preece’s 14-year-old daughter was sent home in the first week of term with a letter saying the skirt she was wearing was not ‘suitable’. Since the incident, she has been going to school in trousers. Headteacher Andrew Davis said the school will work with parents and carers to resolve any uniform issues, including in some cases offering to buy the correct uniform or signposting parents to possible alternative skirts. Mr Preece said while he understands the school’s need for some regulation, he feels children should not be singled out. He added: “It’s the same skirt that 80 percent of other girls have, who haven’t had a letter. “As far as I am concerned, it’s smart, comfortable and fit for purpose. “If you are going to single out children because they are different, you have to make it that you are only allowed this one specific skirt. If that’s all you’re allowed, then that’s okay. “When you have a broad spectrum, you single out children and that can be humiliating.” In a statement, headteacher Andrew Davies said: “Firstly, I would like to clearly state that the vast majority of students at the College wear their uniform to a high standard and are proud to do so. We very much appreciate this and the support of parents and carers who work hard to support the school on this issue. Where issues have arisen with the uniform, whatever they may be, if we are made aware of problems, we will always try and work with individual students, parents and carers to resolve the issue. Examples of the solutions we have put in place include, the College offering to purchase the correct uniform in some circumstances and signposting to other possible alternative skirts which we think will be more appropriate. “We have endeavoured to keep uniform costs down for parents and carers, as is evident with the new grey skirts introduced for Year 7 students, where students have two different styles to choose from, one of which has very small slits in them to allow for more movement. “While this approach to uniform may be seen as a somewhat traditional view, the foundations of our College are based around respect, trying hard, resilience, fairness, hard work, equality and integrity. We see issues such as behaviour, politeness and uniform as being integral to many of these important values. We have high expectations as to what our students can achieve both academically and as a wider person. “As a school we have thought very carefully about our uniform guidance and have tried to balance the need for our uniform to be affordable with the need for a consistent overall appearance for all students. This guidance is clearly stated on our website and reminders were sent to parents and carers before the end of the Summer Term stating we would not accept tight, short or stretchy skirts and that skirts, along with other uniform, should be worn appropriately, including being the correct size. “We believe that the wearing of uniform in an appropriate way is a very important element of a student’s education since we need to teach students to understand boundaries and rules in order to prepare them for working life as well as making sure that the uniform ensures all students, whatever their background, have a consistent appearance across the College.” Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. The contributions of Exmouth’s women to the suffrage movement are detailed in a new booklet.

Andrew,Davis,1642,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SHOWBIZ-Trans-singer-Viola-Davis-Jim-Parsons-Wicked/64081.html,"Oscar-winning Viola Davis has revealed that she has had regrets about the movie The Help, Deadline.com reported. Davis recently admitted in a New York Times interview that The Help was a great experience, but she took issue with the portrayal of the titular ""help."" ""I just felt that at the end of the day that it wasn't the voices of the maids that were heard,"" said Davis. NBC has put in development The Inn Crowd, a multi-camera comedy from a team that includes Big Bang Theory actor Jim Parsons, Deadline.com noted. The Inn Crowd is inspired by Tony Horwitz's 1999 New Yorker article and centers around a gay couple who divide a small town when they open a very successful inn. The 1999 article The Inn Crowdby Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tony Horwitzchronicles the the controversy surrounding the Inn at Little Washington, in Rappahannock County, Virginia, owned by Patrick O'Connell and Reinhardt Lynch. It was announced last month that the movie adaption of popular musical Wicked was moved off its original Dec. 20, 2019, release datebut ""that was always a fake date. There wasn't a prayer in hell,"" says Stephen Schwartz, the man behind the stage musical, according to The Hollywood Reporter. However, Schwartz assured that things are still progressing with the movie: ""That being said, we're making really good progress. The screenplay has gone through a few drafts."" Universal filled the date previously held by Wicked with another Broadway-to-big-screen adaptation: Cats. Reporting that singer Frank Ocean's lawyers sent rapper Travis Scott a cease-and-desist letter over the song ""Carousel,"" TMZ indicated that Ocean was angry Scott had manipulated his vocals and was seeking to get them removed from the albumbut Ocean has clarified things, Stereogum noted. Ocean posted on Tumblr, ""I THINK THE SONG SOUNDS COOL, I DID IT IN LIKE 20 MINUTES AND THE MIX SOUNDS THE WAY TRAVIS WANTED IT TO SOUND FOR HIS RECORD. I ALSO APPROVED IT BEFORE IT CAME OUT SO THE CEASE AND DESIST WASN'T ABOUT [anything]. IT WAS ABOUT [rainbow flag emoji]. ME AND TRAVIS RESOLVED IT AMONGST OURSELVES WEEKS AGO. [heart emoji]"" The Troye Sivan/Azealia Banks feud has apparently reignited, according to NewNowNext.com . On Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, host Andy Cohen asked Sivan what he would say to Banks if they found themselves riding in the same elevatorto which he responded, ""Maybe I would say, 'Hey.' Actually, it's weird because it's not even a thing, but there was a little 'thing,' but I would just say, 'Hey, I love your music.' Because I do, that's true."" Among Banks' multiple online replies were, ""How about you turn around and face the corner of the elevator ? Or... how about you get off the elevator so I can ride in peace thank you"" and ""I do not need that kind of support from other artists. That's how these girls like @DUALIPA steal from me and think it's cool to not acknowledge it. If @troyesivan wants to show support make it genuine."" Netflix movie Sierra Burgess Is a Loser is being slammed on social media for transphobic and ableist storylines, NewNowNext.com noted. The movie, which debuted Sept. 7, stars bisexual actress Shannon Purser ( Stranger Things ) as Sierra Burgess, a teen who embarks on a journey of romantic deception. Minutes into the film, one of Sierra's bullies mocks her with a transphobic joke, saying she should write a school assignment ""about [her] trans experience, super-topical."" Sierra is cisgenderand plenty of folks have pointed out that given the growing epidemic of violence against the trans community, most often trans women, anti-transgender ""jokes"" are especially harmful. The conpany 20th Century Fox conducted an open dance call to find ensemblists to play Sharks and Jets in the upcoming movie musical West Side Story, Playbill.com noted. Directed by Steven Spielberg and adapted by Tony Kushner, the project is a remake of the 1961 film based on the 1957 Broadway musical with a book by Arthur Laurents, music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. Jerome Robbins directed and choreographed both the original stage and screen versions. Former model Jason Boycewho, in December, sued famed photographer Bruce Weber for sexually assaulting him during a 2014 photo shootsays that nine months after coming forward, he's still triggered by the experience, TheWrap.com reported. ""There are some days when I get up and I sit in my car and I cry,"" he said. ""I don't know why, and that's not something that I did before."" In December, Boyce filed a lawsuit against Weber's company, Little Bear, and his former agent, Jason Kanner, accusing the photographer of groping him and kissing him against his will. ( Lawyers for Weber ""unequivocally"" denied the accusations called them ""false,"" while Kanner did not respond. ) Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundationwhich built homes for New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina destroyed their neighborhoods in 2005has been hit with a lawsuit by two people who claim the homes built for them ""were deficiently constructed and built,"" People.com noted. Lloyd Francis and Jennifer Decuir's lawyer, Ron Austin, told NOLA.com that residents ""were forced to file this lawsuit because the Make It Right Foundation built substandard homes that are deteriorating at a rapid pace while the homeowners are stuck with mortgages on properties that have diminished values."" Debra Messing took on Susan Sarandon again over her views on President Donald Trump, People.com noted. ""This is a revolution,"" Sarandon said. ""Maybe things had to get so bad before real change actually could happen. We just have to stay awake."" ""STFU SUSAN,"" Messing tweeted. ""Oh yes, PLEASE let's give Trump CREDIT. I mean how else are you able to walk out on the street."" Sarandon, 71, was quick to respond, tweeting, ""Debs, before you get yourself all self-righteous try clicking on the video and listening to what I actually say, not @Variety's clickbait headline, which btw has no quotation marks. That's a clue."" Expanding her family did not come easy for Carrie Underwood, the singer revealed on CBS Sunday morning, Page Six noted. Underwoodwho welcomed her first child, son Isaiah, with husband and retired NHL star Mike Fisher in 2015said the couple endured three miscarriages before having their first child. Underwood announced in August she and Fisher are expecting their second child. Andy Holtzman said he has no ""ill will"" toward actor Kevin Spaceyšthe man he said sexually assaulted him when he was 27, TheWrap.com reported. Holtzman was a young film program coordinator at the New York Shakespeare Festival's Public Theater in 1981 when he said that Spacey, an up-and-coming actor, walked into his office, pinned him to a desk and groped him. ""I want him to get well,"" Holtzman, now a 64-year-old event marketer, said. ""He's not well. Anyone who has been in the closet is not healthy."" One day after threatening ""immediate legal action"" against Rose McGowan, Asia Argento said she's now seeking ""substantial damages for deception, fraud, coercion and libel"" from her former friend and fellow Harvey Weinstein accuser, TheWrap.com noted. On Sept. 17, Argento demanded in a tweet that McGowan retract the contents of an Aug. 27 statement about sexual-misconduct accusations lodged against Argento. McGowan said that her partner, model Rain Dove, gave the LAPD text messages between Argento and Dove in which Argento acknowledged having had sex with actor Jimmy Bennett despite a public denial of sexual contact with the then-17-year-old actor in 2013. Dancing with the Stars has revealed its celebrity cast and their dancer pairings for season 27, TheWrap.com noted. Some of the competitors will include Dukes of Hazzard actor John Schneider, former NFL player DeMarcus Ware, Bachelor contestant Joe ""Grocery Store Joe"" Amabile, Facts of Life actress Nancy McKeon and Olympic darling Mary Lou Retton. The season 27 premiere will air live Monday, Sept. 24, on ABC. The Seattle Storm defeated the Washington Mystics 98-82 in the third game of the WNBA Finals at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia, to complete a series sweep and capture their third WNBA title, Bleacher Report noted. League MVP Breanna Stewart led the way with 30 points and eight rebounds as she added Finals MVP honors to her honors, while frontcourt running mate Natasha Howard poured in a playoff career-high 29 points. Music icon Paul McCartney scored his first number-one album in 36 years on the Billboard 200 with Egypt Station, as of Sept. 16, Just Jared noted. The album moved 153,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Some of the other acts in that week's top 10 included Ariana Grande, Post Malone, Eminem, Drake and Lauren Daigle. A night after hosting her Savage X Fenty Show in Brooklyn to close New York Fashion Week, Rihanna was back on the scene to throw her fourth-annual Diamond Ball at Cipriani Wall Street, Page Six noted. Issa Rae hosted the event, which benefited the Clara Lionel Foundation, with guests including Joan Smalls, rapper A$AP Rocky, and Paris and Nicki Hilton. Childish Gambino ( aka Donald Glover ) performed as guests drank Jay-Z's Armand de Brignac rose champagne. Angelina Jolie has attached to star in and produce for Imperative Entertainment an adaption of the James Scott frontier novel The Kept, Deadline noted. Published by HarperCollins in 2014, the novel takes place in the winter of 1897, when a trio of killers descends upon an isolated farm in upstate New York. Also, Jolie is starring with David Oyelowo in Come Away, a revisionist fairy tale that marks the live-action directorial debut of Oscar-winning The Brave director Brenda Chapman. Norm MacDonald's appearance on the Sept. 11 episode of The Tonight Show was canceled at the last minute, Deadline.com noted. The Tonight Show's decision to pull Macdonald followed an interview with the Saturday Night Live alum posted by THR in which he indicated he was glad that the #MeToo reckoning in Hollywood seemed to have ""slowed down a little bit,"" and spoke in defense of Louis C.K. and Roseanne Barr following their scandals.

Michael,Gordon,1641,http://www.espn.com.au/nrl/story/_/id/24717083/roosters-look-ferguson-kicks,"You have reached ESPN's Australian edition. Stay on current site or go to US version. The Sydney Roosters could be relying on third-choice goal-kicker Blake Ferguson's boot to get them through to this year's NRL grand final with prop Sio Siua Taukeiaho still battling an ankle injury. Taukeiaho is on track and confident he'll overcome an ankle sprain and face South Sydney in Saturday night's preliminary final, but has been unable to goal kick this week a result of the injury. Regular straight shooter Latrell Mitchell is also out suspended for a crusher tackle, and will only play again this year if the Roosters beat the Rabbitohs to qualify for the September 30 decider. Taukeiaho has usually been the Roosters second-choice kicker this year, and has a career strike rate of 73.33 per cent before injuring his ankle early in the qualifying-final win over Cronulla. Since then his focus has solely been on being fit to play in a Roosters pack already without the suspended Dylan Napa, and he's unsure if his fitness will affect his goal kicking. ""It's the foot I put all my pressure on,"" Taukeiaho told AAP on Tuesday. ""I'm not 100 per cent (sure). At the moment Blake Ferguson is practising goals. I'm just more focused on trying to get myself out there. ""I've got to get myself ready 100 per cent to play on Saturday, and then I'll focus on goal kicking."" Goal kicking could also prove crucial in the Allianz Stadium clash, given three of this year's six finals have been decided by just one point. Left searching for a new kicker after Michael Gordon left the club at the end of last year, Mitchell has stepped up to the point where he was the second-leading point-scorer in the NRL regular season. Ferguson has also kicked this season in games where Mitchell and Taukeiaho have both been off the field, booting over six from seven in 2018, but at a career strike rate of 73.33 per cent. Meanwhile the Roosters are preparing for the impact of Mitchell's absence with more than just the boot. The NSW State of Origin star has scored 16 tries, made 18 linebreaks and busted 101 tackles this year to be their best attacking threat this season. They've named utility Mitchell Aubusson at centre in his place, with Victor Radley brought back into the starting side at lock, in a move that adds plenty of defensive starch. ""He's a a massive loss,"" co-captain Boyd Cordner said. ""He's a game-breaker and proved in the big games, in Origin, what he's capable of, and all year for us. But at the same time, we've had to cover for injuries before.""

But, according to the SEC’s rules, the commission was well within its rights to blindside the 81-year-old entrepreneur. And things could still get worse for Frost, who has denied the allegations, and for OPKO (OPK), the company he founded. Unlock this article by subscribing to STAT Plus. Try it FREE for 30 days!

Phillip,Frost,1640,http://news.wjct.org/post/phillip-frost-denies-fraud-charges-sec-chair-talks-about-protecting-investors,"Miami biotech billionaire and philanthropist Dr. Phillip Frost says he was stunned by the stock trading fraud charges filed against him earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Frost denies the allegations, saying in a statement, they ""are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts."" Frost declined WLRN's invitation for an interview. In an interview with WLRN, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton did not address the charges against Frost, citing ""a longstanding commission policy"" not to comment on enforcement actions. He also refused to discuss Frost's claim that the SEC ""departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” However, Clayton did address the type of stock trading his agency accuses Frost of conducting and the agency's investigative role. Frost made his fortune in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. He is a dermatologist by training and has bought, built and sold companies. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to groups throughout South Florida. He still runs OPKO Health, a publicly traded drug and diagnostic company headquartered in Miami. The SEC accuses Frost of participating in a scheme manipulating the price of low-cost, thinly traded stocks. Nine others are charged along with Frost. They’re accused of buying shares of three companies, touting their business prospects and then selling when the stock prices went up. It’s called a 'pump and dump' scheme. ""Pump and dump is a manipulation scheme that has been around about as long as markets have been around,"" says Clayton. Frost says he remains a long-term investor in both companies included the federal charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission claims Frost made at least $1 million in the trades. Together the scheme allegedly made $27 million dollars for those accused of taking part. Here is an edited excerpt of WLRN's interview with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. WLRN: Explain where the illegal action happens in (a pump and dump trade). If an investor is successful they may want to brag about how successful they are. Is that considered a pump? Clayton: You're raising a very important issue, which is how do you differentiate between legitimate market activity and a scheme. And we try very hard to make sure that when we do bring actions as a commission, that we're not adversely affecting legitimate market activity. What are some of the hallmark signs of a pump and dump that the Securities and Exchange Commission uses as it reviews those kinds of transactions to decipher between what may be illegal activity and what could be legitimate market activity? I'll give you a stark example that the company actually doesn't do anything...or no meaningful business activity or no meaningful change in its business activity despite increasing in value by a substantial amount. What's the threat of these pump and dump schemes? People people use the word confidence a lot. Confidence is critical in our marketplace. To the extent people are doing things that would undermine confidence, it's important to deter them or stop them. I know you won't address the specific charges against Dr. Frost and others that were filed earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company that Frost heads up, OPKO Health, released a statement saying, ""The SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to filing the complaint."" Again, I'm not asking you to address the specifics of the against Dr. Frost, but does the SEC usually tell targets about possible charges before they're filed? It's not appropriate for me to comment. Generally speaking, is there a practice that the commission has in engaging with a person of interest in these types of cases prior to charges being filed? We have a number of policies and procedures in place but I'm not going to comment on a specific one in this context. Would one of those procedures be discussing potential charges? Like I said, I'm not going to comment on specific procedures, but I can tell you that we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we do things in an appropriate manner. Would one of those policies and procedures be the process that OPKO Health describes? Like I said I'm not going to comment. (With) an enforcement action involvving a fairly well-known corporate executive, is that something that you would be made aware of prior to the action being taken? I'm not going to comment on our on our policies and procedures. We handle matters the same regardless of who's involved. That's that's the right way to approach these things.",0.0,11.0,0.4583333333333333,0.0,1053951,0.9188600783106701,1,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

The members of Rotakids, a junior section of Rotary organisation, at Ashleigh School, decided to help Nolan James Crook, 13, who has been diagnosed with H-abc, a degenerative brain condition which progressively damages the white matter in the brain.

Andrew,Davis,1638,http://www.muswellbrookchronicle.com.au/story/5652902/local-artist-painting-a-picture-of-unity/,"A PICTURE can paint 1000 words, but a good painting can leave you speechless. Muswellbrook’s Andrew Davis has donated a large art piece to Muswellbrook South Public School (MSPS), which was made out of four canvasses that he worked on with kids from the school several years ago. He said it’s taken a while to put the final touches on it, but is pleased to give the painting back to the place where it was made – and can be marvelled at by hundreds of impressed students. The donation is part of a larger program Mr Davis is participating in. And, he’s just hoping to spread a good message while he does it. “My main motivation and interest for doing these projects is just giving everyone a fair go and treating all people as equals,” he said. “Also, giving everyone equal opportunities to do something interesting or different or amazing with their life and, hopefully, inspire some people, too.” He admits some were discriminated against from an early age and wants to ensure the children at MSPS know that anyone is capable of having a major impact on the world. “It’s important that we’re not judging people or assuming that people are not capable of doing thing that other people are going to find value in or that will benefit on the community,” Mr Davis said. “My particular interest is people with disabilities, myself having dealt with disabilities and mental health, and my other main interest is transgender people and not judging them. “A lot of them have very hard lives and a lot of them are homeless because they’re discriminated against. “So, by doing works like this, we can educate the community and say we’re an important part of the community.” MSPS stage 3 assistant principal Sarah Winning said the school was delighted to have the painting, dubbed The Journey Home, and thanked Mr Davis for his work. “Andrew had done a fantastic job with putting the final touches on the project,” she said. “And, for him to do this and bring it back to the school is a great way for our students to have the work on display in a mural that will hang proudly for all to see.” She thinks the pupils will be ecstatic to have the piece back; and added those who were involved in its creation in 2015 would be pleased to see it again. “I think the kids that did the project will get a real kick out of it and will be a great thing for other students to see for years to come,” she said. The donation will add to the collection of Mr Davis’ works, as another long-spanned canvas titled together already sits outside the school’s office.

Andrew,Davis,1638,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/toronto-symphony-orchestra-announces-gustavo-gimeno-as-next-music-director-1027541263,"New Chapter Ahead for One of North America's Foremost SymphonyÂ Orchestras TORONTO, Sept. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Toronto Symphony Orchestra Board Chair Catherine Beck and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Loden today announced that Spanish conductor Gustavo Gimeno will become the Orchestra's 11th Music Director beginning in 2020/21, the Orchestra's 99th season. ""This is a thrilling day for the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,"" said Catherine Beck, Chair of the Board of Directors. ""We at the TSO were searching for a leader who would take our highly talented musicians to the next level and, in Maestro Gimeno, we have found exactly that person. We are indebted to our Search Committee who recognized that Gustavo has all the qualities you could ask for in a modern Music Director. He will lead the Orchestra with passion and imagination, bring the TSO to where Torontonians live, and stir this city's appreciation of great music."" Acclaimed for his ability to elicit fresh and vibrant performances, Maestro Gimeno has conducted leading orchestras in Europe, North America, and Japan, and became Music Director of the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg in 2015. He made his Canadian dÃ©but with the TSO this past February with a virtuosic concert program featuring music by Beethoven, Ligeti, and DvoÅÃ¡k. ""I am so proud to become the Music Director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra,"" said Gimeno. ""From our very first encounter, I connected with the Orchestra's sound, their cultivated playing and flexibility, and immediately felt at home, both musically and personally. I greatly admire the TSO's dual commitment to presenting the core repertoire while also introducing new composers and concert formats in a uniquely Canadian way. I look forward to sharing our musical stories with our loyal audiences everywhere."" Gustavo Gimeno began his international conducting career in 2012 as assistant to Mariss Jansons, while Gimeno was a member of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in Amsterdam. As a protÃ©gÃ© of the legendary Bernard Haitink and Claudio Abbado, Gimeno gained experience that solidified his musical foundation and shaped his career on the world stage.Â Maestro Gimeno has signed a five-year contract with the TSO to begin in the 2020/21 season. He succeeds Peter Oundjian, who was named TSO Conductor Emeritus in June 2018 after a fruitful 14-year tenure as Music Director. Sir Andrew Davis is serving as TSO Interim Artistic Director until the end of the 2019/20 season, when he will continue his long relationship with the Orchestra, returning to the TSO podium regularly. ""The TSO's recent contributions to Canada's Sesquicentennial celebrations and its international touring activities have brought new vitality to this organization,"" said Matthew Loden, Chief Executive Officer. ""Gustavo's arrival underscores our commitment to amplifying the energy and cosmopolitan profile of this great city. I can't imagine a more ideal partner for opening our next chapter. As a cultural anchor in the fourth-largest city in North America, the TSO will continue to evolve its artistry, its education and community engagement, and its service to this extraordinarily dynamic and diverse city. Gustavo shares in this vision fully and, as Music Director, will bring vibrancy, inspiration, and artistic intimacy that will broaden and deepen our connections with Torontonians and the world.""Â A deeply versatile musician, Maestro Gimeno is as equally at home with traditional and contemporary symphonic repertoire as he is with opera. He has shared the stage with soloists such as Daniel Barenboim, Krystian Zimerman, Khatia Buniatishvili, and Bryn Terfel, as well as world-renowned Canadian artists including James Ehnes, Johannes Moser, and Jan Lisiecki. His 2018/19 season will bring collaborations with Leonidas Kavakos, Yuja Wang, and Katia and Marielle LabÃ¨que. ""Maestro Gimeno has an ability to connect with people, onstage and off,"" said TSO Concertmaster Jonathan Crow. ""He has a musical charisma and technical ability that is remarkableâhe pulls you into the musical moment. Gustavo is absolutely the right match for the TSO, and we are looking forward to a truly unique partnership that will blend his musicianship with the amazing flexibility of our Orchestra. Together, we will create something very special for music lovers in Toronto."" In the season ahead, Maestro Gimeno will tour throughout Europe's most prestigious concert halls with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg, and he will return as a guest conductor to the Cleveland Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century, the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. Maestro Gimeno recently dÃ©buted with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, and other upcoming engagements include conducting the symphony orchestras of Houston, St. Louis, and Seattle, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. Moreover, Maestro Gimeno will make his Zurich Opera dÃ©but in January 2019, conducting a production of Verdi's Rigoletto, which he will also lead in concert versions at the Philharmonie Luxembourg and the ThÃ©Ã¢tre des Champs-ElysÃ©es in Paris. Gustavo Gimeno has recorded the first symphonies of Dmitri Shostakovich and Anton Bruckner, Maurice Ravel's complete ballet music for Daphnis et ChloÃ©, as well as Gustav Mahler's Fourth Symphony with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg on the Pentatone label.Â Â Born in Valencia, Spain, Maestro Gimeno is fluent in Spanish, English, Italian, and Dutch, and is studying French. He currently resides in Amsterdam with his wife and daughter, and looks forward to exploring his future home in Toronto over the next few seasons. Maestro Gimeno will return to Toronto on June 29 and 30, 2019, to conduct The Firebirdâa program anchored by the famous Stravinsky suite, also featuring works by Sibelius (with TSO Concertmaster Jonathan Crow as soloist) and Prokofiev. About the TSO: One of Canada's most respected arts organizations, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra (TSO) plays a vital role in the city's dynamic cultural life. Committed to serving local and national communities through vibrant performances and expansive educational activities, the TSO offers a wide range of programming that resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds. With a notable recording and broadcast history complementing international touring engagements, the TSO is a unique musical ambassador for Canada around the world. The TSO continues its long-established history of connecting younger generations with orchestral music. Two core programs include School Concerts, performed for over 40,000 students annually, and the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra (TSYO), which, in a tuition-free model, offers high-level orchestral training for talented young musicians aged 22 and under. Additionally, the TSO supports the development of next-generation artists through its annual open call for Canadian orchestral scores, and its essential Resident Conductor and Affiliate Composer positions. Peter Oundjian was named TSO Conductor Emeritus at the end of his 14-year tenure as Music Director in June 2018. In the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons, Sir Andrew Davis will serve as Interim Artistic Director, prior to the arrival of the TSO's new Music Director in 2020. Sir Andrew Davis is well known to Toronto audiences, having a 44-year relationship with the TSO. Maestro Davis opens the 2018/19 season and returns to the TSO stage regularly in each of his two seasons as Interim Artistic Director. Gustavo Gimeno will begin serving as the TSO's Music Director in 2020/21. The TSO was founded in 1922 by a group of Toronto musicians and gave its first performance at the historic Massey Hall. Since 1982, Toronto's iconic Roy Thomson Hall has been the TSO's home, drawing patrons from around the world. Soon to celebrate its centenary, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra's name remains synonymous with musical versatility and growth, and artistic distinction.

He made his debut conducting the orchestra in 2014, standing in for Mr. Jansons, and his international conducting career took off. He will begin in Toronto during the 2020-21 season, succeeding Peter Oundjian, who became its conductor emeritus in June after 14 years as its music director. Sir Andrew Davis will be the orchestra’s interim artistic director through the 2019-20 season. Mr. Gimeno became the music director of the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra in 2015, and has conducted the Cleveland Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He will make his debut with the Zurich Opera in 2019 conducting a production of Verdi’s “Rigoletto.” Matthew Loden, the chief executive officer of the Toronto Symphony, said in a statement that Mr. Gimeno’s arrival “underscores our commitment to amplifying the energy and cosmopolitan profile of this great city.” Mr. Gimeno said in the email that he looked forward to exploring a wide range of repertoire in Toronto, including “the music of today, particularly the voices that need to be heard in Canada right now.” And he said he was eager to work with the city’s diverse communities. “This is a city where every neighborhood feels like a unique slice of the world, which means there are endless moments of inspiration from these cultures that need to be a part of how we present our music,” he said. “I can’t wait to get started.” Advertisement",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1020357,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Previewing what will be key data released this week, Mr Gordon said the message the June quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data would provide was not the one apparent from the broad-brush indicators such as business confidence which had fallen further in recent months. ``As the data on real activity has rolled in, it has revealed growth ranging from modest to strong across a wide range of sectors. ``We're expecting Thursday's GDP release to show a 0.9% rise for the quarter.'' In part, the forecast reflected some big one-off gains in particular sectors that were unlikely to be repeated, he said. Retail spending rose by 1.1% in the quarter, building work was up 0.8% and wholesale trade rose an estimated 1.6%, after adjusting for prices. There was a strong lift in hours worked in the Quarterly Employment Survey, a direct input from some of the service sectors. Milk collections rose by about 8% in seasonally adjusted terms, although the actual figures were at a low ebb at this time of the season, Mr Gordon said. The manufacturing survey was more mixed. Food manufacturing was up overall. There was a rise in dairy production and a rebound in meat processing after a weak March quarter. There was a drop in the production of beverages. There was a second-quarter of strong growth in machinery and equipment manufacturing, suggesting businesses were still prepared to invest. ``Unfortunately, where we don't have a lot of clarity is in petroleum and chemical manufacturing. Output is likely to have dropped sharply over the quarter due to a planned maintenance shutdown at the Marsden Point refinery and an unplanned shutdown in methanol production due to gas shortages.'' ASB senior economist Jane Turner was also forecasting 0.9% growth in the second quarter but suggested momentum might have fizzled out in the three months ending September. The key area of concern was the continued slide in business confidence and the slump in business employment and investment intentions. New Zealand's balance of payments data is due out tomorrow and ANZ senior economist Liz Kendall expects it to show the seasonally-adjusted deficit has narrowed. She expected solid contributions from both goods and services. The goods deficit was expected to narrow as growth in exports outpaced imports. Likewise, services exports were expected to outpace imports, owing to solid tourism growth and a recent weakness in the New Zealand dollar. Providing a partial offset would be a slight widening of the income deficits. Outflows would have increased on higher global interest rates. The annual current account deficit was expected to widen to 2.9% of GDP, Ms Kendall said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Andrew,Davis,1632,http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/16882372.proms-stars-add-extra-sparkle-to-new-concert-season/,"Kendal 12°c WHAT does eminent conductor Sir Andrew Davis and saxophone star Jess Gillam have in common? For starters, they shared the spotlight during the BBC's recent Last Night of the Proms. And what a stunning night that was. The other connection is that the noble knight of classical music and the 20-year-old Ulverston sax sensation both grace the new Lakeland Sinfonia Concert Society 2018/2019 series. Jess plays Kendal Leisure Centre's Westmorland Hall on Sunday, January 20, in a feast of dance and jazz-inspired music and Sir Andrew will be on the podium for the BBC Philharmonic's Kendal visit in the second half of the series on Saturday, April 27, which also features another stellar talent, violinist, Jennifer Pike. Jess blew everyone away during the BBC's Proms night. First, performing Michael Nyman's If (from The Diary of Anne Frank) at Proms in the Park in Hyde Park before dashing across to the Royal Albert Hall and - after a quick costume change - playing Brazileira from Scaramouche by Darius Milhaud as part of the Last Night celebrations. For the record, both pieces have been released on Decca Classics, as a taster of what's to come on Jess's debut album for Decca next year. She also joined acclaimed baritone Gerald Finley for a duet as part of the Royal Albert Hall programme, the whole of which was conducted by Sir Andrew. Jess is really taking the classical music world by storm, initially catching the nation's attention during the BBC Young Musician 2016 when, at the age of 17, she made history as the first saxophonist to reach the final of the competition, wowing audiences with her rendition of Michael Nyman's Where the Bee Dances. This year's been another busy one for Jess. In June, she made her international debut with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and there's plenty of overseas appearances coming up, including concerts with the L’Auditori Barcelona (Spain), Argovia Philharmonic (Switzerland), Tampere Philharmonic (Finland) and a recital at the acclaimed Philip's Collection series in Washington DC. Meanwhile, the popular LSCS series opens on Saturday, September 29 (7.30pm) with the familiar faces of the Royal Northern Sinfonia directed by Bradley Creswick. It promises a concert of tuneful, lively music with an Italian theme. Also featuring oboist Stephen Hudson and Michael O'Donnell on cor anglais, the programme includes Schubert's overture in the Italian Style in D, Albinoni's Oboe Concerto in D Minor, Wolf's Italian Serenade, Donizetti's Concertino for Cor Anglais and Mendelssohn's Italian symphony. Geographically, the programme for the following concert by the Halle orchestra on Saturday, October 20 (7.30pm) has a more British flavour with an arrangement by conductor Andrew Manze of Purcell's Fantasia as well as Vaughan Williams' London symphony. Soloist will be cellist Jian Wang playing Dvorak's glorious Cello Concerto, which was written in America but actually first performed in London. The Royal Northern returns on Saturday, November 10 (7.30pm) conducted by Ben Gernon laced with the terrific tunes of sunny Spain, including Rodrigo's much loved guitar piece Concierto de Aranjuez, starring soloist Sean Shibe. Come Christmas and conductor Wyn Davies brings his famous festive cheer to the series, picking up the baton for the Lakeland Sinfonia and pianist Llyr Williams. Centrepiece of the Saturday, December 15 concert, will be Beethoven's mighty fifth piano concerto, Emperor. Moving into 2019, and the society's series of eight concerts continues on January 20 (4pm) with Jess Gillam playing - among other pieces - Fantasia for Soprano Saxophone by Villa-Lobos with the RNS conducted by Jessica Cottis. For the first time LSCS brings a chamber group to the series: the Scottish Ensemble. Centre stage as soloist will be Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero performing Mozart's 14th Piano Concerto. Gabriela also airs her own composition Babel during the Saturday, February 16 (7.30pm) performance. Danish composer Carl Nielsen's rich and beautifully coloured description of the daily journey of the sun over the Aegean Sea opens the Lakeland Sinfonia's Saturday, March 16 (7.30pm) concert. Conducted by Philip Ellis, also in the programme is Mendelssohn's ever-popular, high spirited and lyrical Violin Concerto, played by another of the series' galaxy of star performers, Lucy Gould. Saturday, April 27 (7.30pm), and the concert series ends with a definitely-not-be-missed night of what's described as 'big' music courtesy of the BBC Philharmonic, which begins with Symphony no 6 from Sibelius and concludes with his Finlandia epic. Under the distinguished baton of Sir Andrew Davis the revered BBC ensemble also rattles off Stravinsky's Symphony in C and Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with soloist Jennifer Pike displaying her tremendous virtuosic skills.

Michael,Gordon,1631,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7268967/charles-bronsons-estranged-wife-labels-notorious-lag-a-chubby-cry-baby-who-sobbed-when-he-was-turned-down-for-parole/,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. The notorious prison hard man wants to divorce wife Paula Williamson who he married in Wakefield Prison THE estranged wife of notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has branded him a cry baby whose hard man image is a sham. Bronson is currently in HMP Frankland, in County Durham, the same prison as Soham killer Ian Huntley, Levi Bellfield and Peter Sutcliffe – with no parole date imminent. Paula, 38, and the 65-year-old Bronson began exchanging letters before apparently falling in love with one another. He proposed to Paula with a rendition of Frank Sinatra's My Way as he serenaded her down the phone on Valentine's Day 2017 and they married in November. But Bronson - who changed his name to Charles Salvador in honour of artist Salvador Dali - wants a divorce her after pictures emerged of a man with his head in her breasts. Now Paula has hit out at Bronson, calling him a “liar and a phoney” whose hard man image is far from reality. “He has thousands of fans who look up to him and think he’s this tough gangster type,” she told the Daily Star. “Well he’s not this hard geezer – if anything he’s a frail little old man. “At his parole hearing he started crying when he found out he’d been turned down. He also blubbed at our wedding – he’s soft. “Charles isn’t buff any more. He’s lost loads of muscle mass and has saggy skin – I’m glad I never had to have sex with him.” “I used to visit and spend £20 on lunch in the canteen for him. “He’d scoff eight pasties in a row then go back to his cell for dinner.” Paula also said she has been left out of pocket campaigning for his release while he continues to be sent cash by fans, who he mocks. “He gets sent money every day. If it’s £5 or even a tenner he takes the mickey out of them. “Even people on disability benefits were sending him cash, which he’d just take and bin the letter without reading. “He once told me he’d given a woman £5,000 because she’d written to him asking for a boob job.” Armed robber Bronson, born Michael Gordon Peterson, was first caged in 1974. He has spent more than 40 years in prison for repeated attacks on jailers. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Steve,Cummings,1629,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cummings-sometimes-a-bad-experience-can-be-a-good-one/,"British rider 'starting afresh' after string of disappointments in 2018 It has been a season to forget for Steve Cummings. Or maybe not. The British rider has had a frustrating and winless campaign, but is determined now to use it as a force for change.Related ArticlesCummings: Best way to respond after Worlds snub was to carry onCummings waiting for his chance in Volta a CatalunyaCummings keeping calm in the eye of the stormCummings: I have to fight for my Tour de France spot10 riders who need to save their seasons “It’s good you know, sometimes you need a season like that,” he told Cyclingnews at the Vuelta a España, where he had his Grand Tour fill after missing out on selection for the Tour de France. “You rip everything you’ve been doing apart and it’s an opportunity to change some things and go forward. I think it’s just given me a chance to explore everything really, lots of new ideas. That’s how I see it, anyway.” Cummings had enjoyed a highly successful spell since joining Dimension Data in 2015, and seemed liberated and rejuvenated, even in his late 30’s. He won a stage of the Tour de France in his first year and then added another in a 2016 season that also included wins at Tirreno-Adriatico, Vuelta al Pais Vasco, Criterium du Dauphine, and the overall title at the Tour of Britain. In 2017 he claimed the road race and time trial double at the British national championships and then a stage of the Giro della Toscana later in the year. This year, however, he has no wins and has failed to finish half the races he has started. His programme was altered by the team, and the situation was only compounded by the long injury list at the team. For someone who describes himself as ‘goal-driven’, having to fill gaps at late notice was far from ideal. On top of the Tour de France snub, Cummings was informed last week that he hadn’t been selected for the British team for the upcoming World Championships. He has clashed with British Cycling over selection in the past but this time, though disappointed, he could see it coming. “You think about the Worlds when we won with Cav and that was what I was hoping for – that we could go and someone could win the Worlds and I could be part of that again. It wasn’t like I thought I could win the Worlds or anything like that. Of course, it’s disappointing but it’s the way it is, isn’t it, I just haven’t performed as well as I could have this year, for one reason or another,” Cummings said. “I think the course suits the Yates brothers, I’d say they were favourites and I think the team has to be what’s best to help them. It looks like a really good team. Personally of course it’s disappointing but to see how British cycling has grown and how many riders we have for different roles, that’s really cool. We have super talented riders coming through and everyone there deserves their place. I’m excited to watch and wish everyone well.” Cummings has made it to the end of the Vuelta. He was present in a couple of breakaways but has had a quiet three weeks and was mostly seen in his favoured position at the very rear of the peloton. Rather than trying to salvage something from his trying season in Spain – and at his upcoming outings in the autumn Italian Classics – he is already laying the foundations for the next one. “Doing this Vuelta is almost like starting afresh into next year. I’m looking at everything in my daily routine to try and get back to the level I had before. That’s the goal,” he said. “I think you have to remain open. As soon as you close off to new ideas and new thinking it’s not a good way, so you have to just have to try and remain open and look to improve all the time. Perhaps over time you find certain things that work well for you or did work well for you. Sometimes a bad experience can be a good one because it just forces you to go over everything you’re doing and make some positive changes.” There is no specific area of his regime that Cummings has identified needs changing. His is a global approach, drilling right down as deep as the meaning of why he gets on his bike every day. “I think I’m just in this mode now of just kind of exploring all the possibilities, the hows and whys. It’s difficult to explain… it’s nothing I haven’t done before, it’s just going over everything, like pulling everything apart, and asking, ‘Why? Why?’. “A lot of it is not really on the bike, it’s off the bike. If you plan like that off the bike, which is how work anyway – I’m very much goal driven – then going on the bike is just part of the process and it’s a lot easier for me to understand what I’m doing. “I’m looking for new ideas, new things, and new thinking. Maybe I don’t change anything or maybe I change small things that make a big difference. I think it’s going back to having a really good solid plan that we’ll deliver, and sort of the desire and commitment to believe in that plan, and then execute it.” 'It's almost like I get more respect from Italian people,' says British rider Dimension Data rider finding form at Spanish stage race Dimension Data rider looking to maximise his remaining time at the top © Immediate Media Company Ltd. 2017 The website is owned and published by Immediate Media Company Limited.",0.0,8.0,0.3076923076923077,0.0,1016437,0.6738316677485455,1,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Vendors under tents line the property Saturday at the Konriko Rice Mill. Jane Powers jots down a note at her booth Saturday along the vendor aisle at the Konriko Rice Mill Craft and Food Fair. The inaugural Konriko Craft and Food Fair took place Saturday morning in New Iberia at the historic rice mill. Shoppers look at merchandise at the Konriko Store on Saturday during the Konriko Rice Mill Craft and Food Fair. People mingle at the fair Saturday. As the oldest rice mill in the country, Konriko Rice Mill always has played a big part in Iberia Parish since it first opened more than 100 years ago. A new event organized by staff at the mill Saturday gave Teche Area residents a chance to see and celebrate the history behind the mill. The Konriko Craft and Food Fair began Saturday morning and lasted well into the afternoon as a variety of craft and food vendors set up shop on the property and local residents and visitors took the opportunity to see the business for themselves. Konriko owner Mike Davis said the idea for the fair was conceived as a way to spread some local awareness about the mill. “Here’s the deal. We are the No. 2 attraction in (Iberia) Parish,” Davis said at the event. “We’ve had close to 50,000 tourists (a year) from all over the United States. But as I go around and talk to younger people, they’ve never visited here. “So we tried to come up with something that would attract local people here. They all know the rice we make but they’ve never been here to visit.” Founded in 1912, the Konriko Rice Mill is the oldest in the United States, and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. Although Davis said he was aiming for about five vendors to come out and sell their wares at the fair, the final tally ended at 17. “We’re happy with that,” he said. Vendors included Delcambre Direct Seafood, Will’s Woodcraft, artist Gage Pacetti, barbecue, jams, homemade goods, hot sauce and wood designs. “It’s going good,” vendor Jane Powers said at the event. “A little warm but thankfully it’s not raining.” Those attending also had the chance to tour the facility and shop at the Konriko Store, where a variety of Cajun-themed merchandise was available. “It’s an interesting little company. We’re small and we like being in New Iberia,” Davis said. We're always interested in hearing about news in our community.

Andrew,Davis,1626,https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/opinion/last-night-audience-in-belfast-too-polite-to-complain-about-lack-of-rule-britannia-and-bbc-takes-this-as-acquiescence-1-8636361,"On Monday I wrote of being at Proms In the Park at Titanic slipways in Belfast on Saturday, where the Northern Ireland audience was deprived the Last Night ritual from the Royal Albert Hall: Rule Britannia. My article attracted republican abuse and ridicule, with particular amusement at my use of the word deprived. But that is what it was: we were nothing less than deprived of one of the highlights of the ‘last night,’ which is a magnificent rendition of Rule Britannia — always led by one of the great contemporary singers. In a follow-on story the BBC said that the NI crowds know they will be getting a different night to London and implied that they have come to expect it. They said: “The BBC Proms in the Park concert in Northern Ireland has always offered our local audience a diverse mix of live performances from home grown and internationally renowned artists, as well as some televised Last Night of the Proms moments across the evening. “People attending the concert here in Northern Ireland are largely aware of this and it has been this way since it began locally in 2002.” I believe that that is a misleading comment. My contention is that localising is fine up to a point, but the only typically ‘last night’ classic that Belfast was given, in a three hour local concert, was Land of Hope and Glory. The growing number of people in Belfast who are turning up with Union flags would, I bet, love Rule Britannia. Some years ago barely anyone in the Belfast concert turned up with a Union flag — perhaps half a dozen — perhaps fearful of being seen as sectarian if they did. I suspect people are fed up with treading carefully in this way and now far more people wave the flag, in the spirit of the ‘last night’. But they are too polite to complain at the fact that Belfast has been almost entirely stripped of any vestiges of ‘last night’, and so the BBC takes this as acquiescence in their butchering of the Albert Hall footage. • Ben Lowry (@BenLowry2) is News Letter deputy editor Ben Lowry Sep 10: Belfast crowd loved Last Night of the Proms but once again was deprived of Rule Britannia Ben Lowry: The risk of a sudden Irish Sea border is rising as Brexit no deal nears Ben Lowry: Commuters now stand for 30 mins on Glider every day ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1020357,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Phillip,Frost,1624,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article218420880.html,"By Rob Wile rwile@miamiherald.com September 14, 2018 05:56 PM Billionaire Miami philanthropist Phillip Frost is denying allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he committed securities fraud as part of a years-long “pump-and-dump” scheme. In a statement emailed to reporters Friday afternoon, Frost said he was “stunned” by the SEC’s civil complaint, filed a week ago. He said he believed the SEC had “departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” The SEC declined to comment. The agency alleges that Frost — along with nine other defendants and related companies including Frost’s OPKO Health Inc.—manipulated the share price of multiple small-cap drug and health companies by touting their potential on trading websites without disclosing their ownership positions. The SEC alleges Frost made more than $1 million from the purported scheme. As of Friday morning, Forbes listed Frost’s net worth at $2.4 billion. “The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,” Frost said in his statement. “I invested in two of the entities identified in the complaint. These investments were made because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term shareholder in both companies.” No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. Though the SEC complaint did not name the companies involved, multiple media outlets have reported them as Cocrystal Pharma (formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.), and MabVax Theraputics Holdings. Each trades at less than $5 a share. Frost has been an active investor in small-cap companies for at least a decade, SEC filings show. In January, MabVax disclosed that it was under investigation by the SEC. Trading in Miami-based OPKO, which Frost runs, was halted Sept. 7 and reopened about 1 p.m. Friday. Shares closed down approximately 15 percent Friday, to $3.90. The company has also denied any wrongdoing. Frost remains on the board of directors at the University of Miami, the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science and Coconut Grove Bancshares. “Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives,” Frost said in his statement Friday. “I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.",0.0,13.0,0.5416666666666666,0.0,1053951,0.9695529482245292,1,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail
Phillip,Frost,1624,https://www.local10.com/news/phillip-frost-releases-statement-after-being-charged-with-securities-fraud,"MIAMI - South Florida businessman Phillip Frost released a statement Friday after being one of a large group of people the Securities and Exchange Commission charged last week with fraudulent stock sales. ""I was stunned by the SEC's lawsuit and deny the allegations it contains against me,"" Frost said. ""It was particularly disturbing that the SEC departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action."" According to the SEC, Frost and nine associates manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies during a five-year period from 2013 to 2018, generating over $27 million. Frost is accused of taking part in two of the three schemes led by Barry Honig. According to the SEC, the group acquired large amounts of stock at deep discounts, then illegally promoted and manipulated trading to boost the price. Once the market price was inflated, the SEC charges the group dumped its shares into the inflated market. The SEC claims Frost, the founder of pharmaceutical company OPKO, and the group reaped millions off unsuspecting investors. ""The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,"" Frost said. ""I invested in two of the entities identified in the complaint. These investments were made because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term shareholder in both companies. ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives. I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name."" The names of Frost and his wife Patricia are on the new Museum of Science in Downtown Miami, as well as the art museum on the campus of Florida International University. The Frost family donated $35 million to the construction of the science museum, with an additional $10 million for the construction of a planetarium. A museum spokesperson released a statement last week, saying the museum is grateful for the Frosts' generosity. Frost also serves on the board of trustees at the University of Miami.

Phillip,Frost,1624,https://therealdeal.com/miami/2018/09/15/frost-denies-stock-fraud-charges-in-sec-suit/,"Phillip Frost and Opko Health Building 4400 Biscayne Boulevard Miami billionaire Phillip Frost, the largest shareholder of brokerage firm Douglas Elliman’s parent company, denied charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he committed securities fraud. Frost, who owns 15.3 percent of publicly held Vector Group, faces charges of participation in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate stock prices. Vector, which owns most of Douglas Ellimam through a subsidiary, is based in an office building at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard in Miami. It also is the headquarters of Opko Health, which Frost runs as chairman and CEO. “I was stunned by the SEC’s lawsuit and deny the allegations it contains against me,” Frost said Friday in a prepared statement. “It was particularly disturbing that the SEC departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” The SEC filed a lawsuit Sept. 7 alleging that Frost participated in a scheme to inflate the prices of unidentified stocks and then sell them, generating $27 million of illegal stock sales and causing substantial harm to other investors. The SEC charges in its lawsuit that Frost participated in stock fraud with Barry Honig, a Boca Raton businessman who allegedly orchestrated large purchases of stock issued by three small companies, then engaged in “illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer’s stock price.” But in the statement he released Friday, Frost said he invested in two of the three unidentified companies “because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term investor in both companies.” Citing reports by other media outlets, the Miami Herald reported Friday that Cocrystal Pharma and MabVAx Therapuetics Holdings are the two of the three unidentified companies in the SEC lawsuit. “The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,” Frost said in his statement. “Nothing is more important to me than my integrity … I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” – Mike Seemuth All rights reserved © 2018 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc.",0.0,9.0,0.375,0.0,1053951,0.8010821551749286,1,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 9980.

Michael,Sylvester,1623,https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/rotherham/positive-boundary-change-undone-by-latest-review-of-village-s-position-it-is-feared-1-9349260,"From 2020 changes to Rotherham Council mean the community of Thrybergh will be united into one council ward, rather than being split between the Valley and Silverwood councillors. Instead, it will fall into the new Dalton and Thrybergh ward, with all villagers represented by the same councillors. But independent political campaigner Michael Sylvester is now concerned that changes to Parliamentary constituencies will see the community split, with some residents in the Rotherham area and others in the newly named Wentworth and Hoyland area, which he believes will make it more difficult to represent the needs of the village. “The crazy thing is we have a boundary change coming into place for the council elections that will unify the village in one ward, while the map for electing MPs follows the existing boundary along Poplar Avenue and Vale Road” said Mr Sylvester. “Thrybergh gets very much over looked and struggles to get anything done in the village because it is on the periphery and a small part of two separate wards and constuencies and having it anything other than unified with one MP responsible for the area is unacceptable” he said. Two different bodies, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England and the Boundary Commission for England were each responsible for one set of changes, with the parliamentary boundaries redrawn nationally in an attempt to balance population sizes represented by each MP. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011381,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-14 16:07:42,True,Priority Mail

Karen,Cummings,1621,https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/greenwood-restaurant-fire-under-investigation/1445486212,"Posted: Sep 14, 2018 07:32 PM EDT Updated: Sep 14, 2018 07:32 PM EDT GREENWOOD, Ind. (WISH) -- The Qdoba across the street from the Greenwood Park Mall was closed Friday after a Thursday morning fire caused more $400,000 in damages. At Qdoba on Friday, the patio furniture normally reserved for diners was holding up yellow tape, blocking off the entrance to the restaurant. That didn't stop customers from stopping by, including Karen Cummings, who delivers customers' pick-up orders through DoorDash. ""Thought I was going to pick something up here at Qdoba, but unless they want it well done, they're not going to get it,"" Cummings jokingly said. Laughing this off is the silver lining because, according to Greenwood Fire Marshal Tracy Rumble, flames broke out after the restaurant was closed. No one was injured. ""When you eat at a restaurant, you know how to come in the front door, but you don't know where all the fire exits are. So for it to happen when they're closed is absolutely a blessing,"" Rumble said. Rumble believes the fire started in the back kitchen before spreading next door to Mattress Firm, which still smelled of smoke on Friday. The door was left open, not for customers, but to let the building air out. The Qdoba was damaged extensively but was not a total loss, Rumble said. ""It's substantial damage. They're going to be closed for quite awhile for a rehab. The health department has been up here and obviously they're not going to be open for quite awhile,"" he said. Meanwhile, investigators were on scene Friday, exploring all possibilities for what could have started it. ""The photos that we've taken and everything, the employees ... did anything weird happen on Wednesday when they were open for business? Did they make any customers mad? There's so many different questions we have to ask to try and find answers to,"" explained Rumble. While investigators look for answers, Cummings has found another Qdoba location to pick up her deliveries. ""If anybody wants Qdoba tonight, better head onto 135,"" she said. Rumble said the investigation into the cause of the fire could take a few weeks to wrap up. Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
