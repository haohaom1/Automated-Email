As it seemed to be getting better, her joints became extremely sore, which prevented her from walking. She then developed a high fever. Hannah was diagnosed in September 2002 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She underwent chemotherapy from 2002-2004. Her port-o-catheter was removed the day after her sixth birthday. One of the things that she most vividly remembers was the playroom in the Jimmy Fund Clinic. She spent hours doing arts & crafts, playing on the “ship” (big boat structure the Clinic used to have), playing with Polly Pockets, and hanging out with her Clinic friends. Hannah's hobbies include singing (she is in an acapella group), soccer (she doesn't play in college), and cooking. Her family includes her parents, Jeff Packman and Karen Linde Packman, and sister, Julia, who is 22 years old and lives in New York. In September, she will be a sophomore at Colby College in Waterville, ME. For the summer, she is interning in the Dana-Farber Communications Department. Her grandfather, Ed Linde, was also treated at Dana-Farber and battled multiple myeloma for many years. He passed away in 2010. Hannah’s relationship with Deborah: Deborah was always there. That is the number one thing about our relationship. No matter what was going on, she was there, whether that was when I was having shots in my leg (which I did each week for a while), getting Lumbar Punctures (which I hated more than anything in the world), or just waiting to get chemotherapy. We would play with the toys in her office, like the doll house she had, for hours on end. She provided me with these moments of relaxation and happiness even when I was feeling horrible. More importantly, looking back on it, she was such a huge support system for my entire family, especially my parents and sister. © Entercom 2018Radio.com Sports"

Constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello were killed in the line of duty along with two civilians just over a week ago. ""It was important for us to go,"" Cpl. Jason Blacquiere told Mainstreet P.E.I.'s Angela Walker. ""When any agency in the policing world has a loss, we all feel it. ""It's important of us as an agency to show support to the other agencies as well as the community, because they suffer a big loss,"" he added. The Summerside officers joined representatives from police forces all over North America, he said. ""Hopefully the families feel that support,"" he said. Blacquiere has attended five or six funerals for slain officers over his career, he said. ""They're happening too frequently,"" he said. During the funeral Blacquiere said he thought about the dangers of police work and the loss the families suffered. Watching Cst. Burns's young sons lay flowers on their mother's casket was a ""moving moment,"" he said. Dwelling on the sadness of the funerals isn't helpful though, Blacquiere said. ""You try and get back to business as usual,"" he said. ""If you dwell on things like this, it can lead you to make mistakes you wouldn't normally make and maybe put yourself in compromising situations. You put it behind you.""

He was a classmate of mine at the Atlantic Police Academy. We trained together in 1997 and 98,” said Ross. “Robb had a great outlook. He was a great person and very dedicated. You knew Robb was going to be a great policeman.” Ross said the funeral was very touching. “It touches your heart, and there’s solidarity no matter where you’re from,” said Ross. “Whether you’re Canadian or American, everybody comes together to show their support.” Sgt. Kelly Oberg of the Calgary Police Department attended the funeral with many of his colleagues. “It’s difficult to see the families and the spouses and how it impacts the children,” said Oberg. “We’re from Calgary and, as fellow police officers, we understand the risks of the job and we all understand that, by the grace of God, it could be any one of us at any time.” Ross agrees. “Everybody is conscious to the fact it could happen, and we train for every type of scenario but, unfortunately, things like this do occur. It’s a tragic set of circumstances,” said Ross. The senseless randomness of the tragedy can be difficult to absorb and understand. ""Being police officers it’s hard to deal with. It can happen anywhere,"" said Pike, while adding that there is one major takeaway from the funeral. “You have to move forward, you have to use what you get from the community, your members, your family, and the people around you,” said Pike. “That’s the lesson here. No matter what happens you can’t quit, you have to move forward.”"

Manly sustained no injuries after their loss against the Gold Coast last weekend. Hooker Api Koroisau is nearing a return from his footy injury, and if proven fit, will take his position in the starting hooker role. Warriors v Panthers The Warriors are set to have their first choice playmakers this weekend as Shaun Johnson (ankle) and Blake Green (corked thigh) are hopeful of playing. Gerard Beale however is in doubt with a hamstring injury and could face one week on the sidelines. Tohu Harris will make his return from a knee injury while Sam Lisone is due back after serving a one week suspension. Coping fines for punching over last weekend, Waqa Blake, Tyrone May and Viliame Kikau are free to play, but the Panthers will be sweating on sorting out visa issues for Kikau to make the trip to Auckland. James Fisher-Harris is expected to be named after being a late withdrawal due to a shoulder complaint. James Maloney is still at least a week away from returning, meaning May will keep his position in the halves. Cowboys v Eels Wrecking ball Jason Taumalolo will be back for the Cowboys this week after serving his suspension. Matt Scott was withdrawn last round due to an ongoing neck issue, but if fit, could line up in his 250th NRL game. Shaun Fensom will return from concussion as the Cowboys look to send out legend Johnathan Thurston on a high. Nathan Brown is in some doubt with a knee injury, but the forward stocks should get a huge boost with Daniel Alvaro (knee), Tim Mannah (broken hand) and Kane Evans (calf) all striving for a comeback. Raiders v Rabbitohs Aidan Sezer is close to a return from a hamstring injury which could push Blake Austin into the centers or a bench position. If not, the Raiders are expected to remain unchanged. The long awaited return of superstar Greg Inglis is officially over as the Rabbitohs will welcome him back at left centre. The backline will also be boosted by the return of Alex Johnston (hamstring) and Campbell Graham. All eyes will be on the fitness of Adam Reynolds and whether he’s recovered from his elbow injury to take up his halfback position. Titans v Storm Michael Gordon will not be back for the Titans meaning Alexander Brimson remains at fullback with no changes expected for the Gold Coast side. On the other hand, the Melbourne Storm seem to be facing a bit of an injury crisis. Cameron Smith is rated “touch and go” with a back injury, as reserve hookers Billy Walters and Harry Grant are also injured. Back-up hooker Brandon Smith is set to miss weeks with a knee injury, therefore meaning Kenny Bromwich will most likely be thrown the role. Suliasi Vunivalu and Nelson Asofa-Solomona also got injured last weekend and must be replaced, while Will Chambers also accepted a three match suspension. Late withdrawal Jahrome Hughes will be used in some capacity this weekend with Tui Kamikamica set to replace NAS. Roosters v Broncos Luke Keary will resume full contact at training this weekend making him a chance to return, along with Jared Waerea-Hargreaves. Ryan Matterson could find himself back in the forwards if Keary returns, and captain Boyd Cordner can escape suspension with an early guilty plea. After a mysterious disappearance reported to be due to illness from the Broncos’ training session on Monday, Josh McGuire is expected to be named for the massive clash with the Roosters. Sharks v Knights Wade Graham and Jayden Brailey are expected to return from their respective injuries, meanwhile backline players Ricky Leutele (knee) and Jesse Ramien (ankle) will miss out. Edrick Lee should make a return from a shoulder injury and Sione Kata is inline for a possible recall. Question for the Knights this week is where to play Kalyn Ponga? His switch to five-eighth last week helped Newcastle tremendously with coach Nathan Brown suggesting he’ll continue with the experiment. Chris Heighington returns after being rested and Shaun Kenny-Dowall is free to play after receiving a fine for punching. Dragons v Bulldogs Paul Vaughan is at least another week off but is coming along in leaps and bounds in his recovery. Kurt Mann will remain at five-eighth as Gareth Widdop remains on the sidelines. Matt Frawley will remain in the starting halfback position over Jeremy Marshall-King as no other changes are expected for the Dogs. I was at Redfern today. Alex Johnston did NOT train at all Mawene Hiroti was at Fullback. Sam Burgess didn’t train either. How did Zero Tackle miss that? Log in to leave a comment"
