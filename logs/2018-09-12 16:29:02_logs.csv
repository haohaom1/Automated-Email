Rick,McVey,b'1601',https://www.nickiswift.com/132902/olympian-ryan-lochte-marries-wife-kayla-rae-reid-in-second-ceremony/,"Congratulations again to Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte and his lady love, Playboy model Kayla Rae Reid! On Sunday, Sept. 9, 2018, Lochte and Reid married in an outdoor ceremony at Monroe Estate in Palm Springs, Calif. in front of 100 guests, as reported by People. The pair's 15-month-old son, Caiden Zane, served as ring bearer at the wedding. Lochte and Reid had wanted to have him involved in their big day, which is one of the reasons why the two decided to wait to exchange their vows. ""We wanted Caiden to be old enough to walk down the aisle,"" Lochte told the magazine. ""One of our visions was to have him be able to be the ring bearer, so it's perfect timing!"" The Pure Lavish Events-planned wedding boasted a ""romantic"" vibe and was decorated with flowers, crystals, and candles. Reid wore a Galia Lahav wedding gown with diamond earrings by Tacori and a tennis bracelet that was her grandmother's. Lochte, on the other hand, wore a custom tux designed by Giorgio Verdi. According to People, wedding guests were treated to a shots of tequila, which were poured into custom-made shot glasses that served as place cards, and they enjoyed pizza and Mexican cuisine at the reception — along with three different wedding cakes. As Nicki Swift previously reported, Lochte and Reid had actually gotten married back in January 2018, getting hitched at a courthouse in Gainesville, Fla. Before their big, extravagant bash this time around, Lochte and Reid celebrated with Bachelor and Bachelorette parties. E! News reported that Lochte partied at the Hakkasan Las Vegas Restaurant and Nightclub with friends, while Reid exercised at a workout class with her pals before hitting the beach. Lochte and Reid aren't the only celebrities to have gotten married in recent weeks. Pretty Little Liars actress Janel Parrish and her chemical engineer fiancé, Chris Long, tied the knot on Sept. 7. A week earlier, Good Morning America co-host Lara Spencer wed Rick McVey, the CEO of financial tech company MarketAxess. Clearly, love is in the air!

Bob,Diamond,b'1599',https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sometimes-finance-fails-the-socially-useful-test-37q3fxx36,"comment Philip Aldrick Ask any bank lobby group why the financial services industry should be a treasured national asset and they’ll give you a compelling reply. It employs one million people, two thirds outside London. It generates a trade surplus of 3 per cent of GDP, a counter-weight to the deficit in goods to help us to pay our way in the world, and it contributes a tenth of tax revenues despite accounting for 6.5 per cent of output. What’s not to like? It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but the argument is conceived the wrong way round. It’s a bit like arguing that bread is best because that’s all the baker made, when perhaps cake might be nicer.

Bob,Diamond,b'1599',https://nairametrics.com/union-bank-raises-n20-billion-through-bond-issue/,"Union Bank of Nigeria has announced the registration of a N100 billion Debt Issuance Program and the subsequent inaugural issuance of Series I and II Bonds under the newly registered Bond Program.

The new funding is expected to support Union Bank’s loan book diversification efforts and provide further working capital. Chief Executive Officer of Union Bank, Emeka Emuwa, noted that the inaugural issuance under the N100 billion bond program marks a milestone achievement in the bank’s bid to accelerate business growth and continue its commitment to re-establish the bank as one of Nigeria’s leading financial institutions. Tier two banks in the country continue to face a tougher time dealing with liquidity challenges, and several of them initiated plans to embark on a capital raise.

Bill,Alfond,b'1598',https://tuftsdaily.com/sports/2018/09/10/field-hockey-displays-strong-defense-shutout-colby/,"Junior midfielder Marguerite Salamone confronts a Middlebury player in Tufts' 3–2 loss on Oct. 7, 2017. Evan Sayles for Tufts University Ryan Eggers is a Sports Editor and an Assistant Arts Editor at the Tufts Daily. He is a sophomore studying economics and political science. Ryan can be reached at ryan.eggers@tufts.edu. Tufts began its season in earnest on Saturday, playing its first regular season match of the year in Waterville, Maine against Colby. The NESCAC rivals have played each other on opening day in each of the past three seasons, with the Jumbos coming out on top over the Mules every time. This year proved to be no different, as Tufts shut Colby (1–1) out for the second straight year, leaving Bill Alfond Field with a 2–0 victory. Defense was the name of the game for the Jumbos, who allowed a mere two shots on goal, both of which senior goalkeeper Emily Polinski put away. One of the more interesting factors in the team’s season opener actually had nothing to do with the players or coaches on the field, but rather the field itself. Colby’s new field for field hockey and lacrosse is comprised of thick artificial turf, which plays much slower than the AstroTurf that is found at Ounjian Field. While Tufts’ Bello Field typically hosts its lacrosse teams, as well as the men’s soccer team, practicing on Bello was a crucial part of the field hockey team’s preparation for Colby. It showed, as the Alfond Field turf had seemingly no impact on the Jumbos’ performance. The beginning of the match featured little scoring danger on either side, with a lot of battling for possession. It did not take too long for the Jumbos to strike first, however, as a corner in the 15th minute of the game led to a goal from sophomore midfielder Beth Krikorian. The assist came via junior midfielder Marguerite Salamone. The rest of the half proceeded without another goal, but it wasn’t for a lack of aggression from the Jumbos. Tufts led the first half in shots 8–1, forcing Colby senior goalkeeper Riley Whitmeyer into five saves in the frame. This dominance continued into the second half, with senior forward Hanaa Malik scoring an unassisted goal less than two minutes in. While that was the Jumbos’ final score of the day, the visitors still found themselves in control of the field throughout the rest of the latter period. Tufts again topped Colby in the attacking third of the field, putting up 10 shots in the final half to Colby’s three. Colby junior forward Georgia Cassidy had two looks at goal 20 minutes into the half — the hosts’ only two shots on goal for the contest — but Polinski took care of both. The Jumbos put up a few more shots in the half, but the final sequences of the game mostly proceeded without incident. After a hard-fought 70 minutes, Tufts went home with a 2–0 victory. The Jumbos managed to get 20 players into the game, a positive sign in their first match. The team’s depth was lauded by its players and coaches before the season began, and the first game reinforced their optimism. “One thing I think we learned in that first game is just how deep this team really is,” senior forward and co-captain Gigi Tutoni said. “It really feels like anyone on this team, even those that don’t start, could easily start [for] us right now.” This point was further proven by the Jumbos’ shot distribution. Tufts’ 18 total shots in the game came from 11 different players, with Tutoni leading the team with three. Thanks to a strong defense and an offense with multiple threats on the field, the Jumbos have reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year. Tufts will have a quick turnaround as it heads to Babson (4–0) on Tuesday for the second game of the season. The Jumbos’ first loss of the 2017 campaign came at the hands of the Beavers in a heartbreaking 3–2 overtime defeat. The Jumbos will look to change their fortunes this year. “Babson actually features a similar turf to Colby’s,” coach Tina Mattera said. “Outside of that, they also share a lot of similar tendencies, so we’re hoping that we can take a lot of what we did on Saturday into our game on Tuesday.” Composure will be essential to the team going into Tuesday. While there is adequate talent and depth on the roster, the Jumbos will need to play their game consistently — if they do so, they’ll have a great chance at going out of the gate 2–0 this year. “I think sometimes we can get a bit frantic if we don’t get a goal in the first half,” Tutoni said. “Just reminding ourselves that we worked hard to get here and that we have a team that can win every game is key.” The second chapter of the Jumbos’ season starts at 6 p.m. Tuesday at MacDowell Field in Wellesley, Mass.
