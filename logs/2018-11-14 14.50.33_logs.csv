Reed Ling Nolff Reed Ling Nolff PETOSKEY — Two current members and one newcomer won seats on the Public Schools of Petoskey’s board of education in Tuesday’s election. Unofficial election results in Emmet County show Kathleen Reed received the most votes with 4,785. She received an additional 328 votes from three precincts in Charlevoix County, making for a total of 5,113. Mary Ling received 4,229 votes in Emmet County and 249 votes in Charlevoix County, for a total of 4,478. Jessica Nolff secured the third open seat on the board with 4,175 votes in Emmet County and 254 votes in Charlevoix County, for a total of 4,429. Departing board member Mark Ashley received 4,152 votes in Emmet County and 255 votes in Charlevoix County, for a total of 4,407. There were also 127 write-in votes. Reed, 56, currently serves as president on the board of education. She is a registered nurse and an attorney who has practiced law with the Dykema Gossett firm since 1989, focusing on health care law. “I’m really thankful and appreciative of everyone who voted in favor of me,” Reed said. “I’m really happy to continue to have the opportunity to work on the things we’re working on.” Reed said an important focus for school board members is ensuring the regional enhancement millage funds are spent in the best way possible. Reed added that the new third-grade reading law is another important issue to address. “We’re working heavily on our third-grade reading initiatives with reading coaches,” she said. “That’s a big thing for us now.” Ling, 56, currently serves as first vice president on the board of education. She is a facilitator at the Camp Daggett Adventure Center. “It was great to see the high volume of voters coming out,” Ling said. “I’m glad that our school millages passed. I want to thank Mark Ashley for his years of service on the board. He’s been great to work with and he’s been a good advocate for Petoskey schools. I’d like to see him continue to be involved and I’d like to welcome Jessica Nolff to the board.” Ling thanked the voters for supporting her and added that she is looking forward to working with Reed, Nolff and the rest of the school board. “I will do my best to continue to do what’s best for the kids and Petoskey Public Schools,” she said. Nolff, 47, is a graphic designer and bookkeeper who has served on the board of the Char-Em United Way. This election marked Nolff’s first time running for public office. “It was a pretty close, tight race so I’m really happy to be one of the three,” Nolff said. “I’m really excited.” Nolff said she plans to spend the next few weeks doing research and completing a training program with the Michigan Association of School Boards. Nolff also has several projects and ideas she would like to bring to the board. “One of my passion projects has been last year working with Groundwork (Center for Resilient Communities) and (food service director) Beth Kavanaugh and Lindsey Walker at Emmet County Recycling on getting rid of the (plastic foam) in the school district,” Nolff said. “That’s something I’d like to continue to see.” Nolff added she would like to see more community engagement with the school board and a focus on the state’s new third-grade reading law. “I’m currently tutoring some students through the library program, so I think we’re going to have to keep an eye on that and try to de-stress as much as we can as it rolls out over the next year,” she said.

Michael,Sylvester,1898,http://harrisondaily.com/neighbors/unofficial-results-new-mayor-at-harrison/article_c87c7850-e23e-11e8-aa77-43e029306cf9.html,"James L. White/Staff Harrison Mayor Dan Sherrell (left) and challenger Jerry Jackson await election results Tuesday night. James L. White/Staff Harrison Mayor Dan Sherrell (left) and challenger Jerry Jackson await election results Tuesday night. Unofficial Boone County election results show Harrison voters elected a new mayor, but kept two incumbent aldermen. Alpena voters also selected a new mayor and some incumbents across the county won and lost. Harrison Mayor Dan Sherrell took 45 percent of votes cast, but challenger Jerry Jackson took 55 percent for a decisive win. In 2014, Jackson and Sherrell ran in a three-way race against then-Mayor Jeff Crockett. Jackson and Sherrell qualified for a runoff with Jackson taking 73 more votes than Sherrell. But in the runoff a few weeks later, Sherrell won by 37 votes. After results started to come in, Jackson said he had in the last few days of the campaign worked hard on being non-partisan. “It’s such an amazing feeling,” he told the Daily Times. Sherrell, after conceding to Jackson, said he still had his job as a farmer and that wouldn’t stop. “You will see me in my farm clothes,” Sherrell said. In recent memory, only former Mayor Bob Reynolds had been elected to two consecutive terms. Others have served two terms, but not back to back. In the Harrison alderman races, incumbents Heath Kirkpatrick and Joel Williams defeated challengers, respectively, Daniella Scott and Lawton Coonts by 68-32 percent margins. At Alpena, challenger Theron McCammond defeated Mayor Bobbie Bailey in both Boone and Carroll County results with a total of 49 to 35 votes. There will likely be a runoff at Diamond City for Alderman Ward 2 Position 2 between Cheryl Guthrie and Kenneth Bollinger. The runoff is set for Dec. 4.
