Bob,Diamond,b'1709',https://bklyner.com/the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-that-never-goes-out/,"COBBLE HILL – Sometimes the most exciting places in New York are not found on its streets but right underneath them. Consider the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel in Brooklyn. Along with places like the 91st Street ghost station and the abandoned East 18th Street station, the tunnel is one of several abandoned underground transit spaces in New York. Built in 1844, the world’s first subway ran under Atlantic Avenue between Boerum Place and Columbia Street, according to The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA). Constructed almost 40 years before the Brooklyn Bridge opened, it was the last step in connecting Boston with New York by rail link. Running the trains underground satisfied investors who wanted to develop the area and residents who wanted to keep it beautiful. But benefits were offset by pollution when ventilation shafts unleashed sparks and shot plumes of smoke onto the avenue above. Residents complained, and in 1859 a New York Court prohibited coal or wood burning locomotives from entering Brooklyn, according to Robert Daley’s book The World Beneath the City. The world’s first subway had been active for only 16 years. The tunnel lived on in the minds of New Yorkers. Rumors claimed the missing pages of John Wilkes Booth’s diary, pirates, prohibition era bootleggers, mustard gas wielding WWll spies, mobsters, and giant water rats had all found sanctuary within its walls. The tunnel became the stuff of fantasy. This all changed in August of 1980 when a young engineering student from Flatbush, Bob Diamond, went down a manhole, crawled through a shallow chamber, broke through a brick wall and pulled the tunnel back into reality. “This blast of cold air came out from the other side, just like Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Diamond said of the moment he opened up the cavernous tunnel. The discovery was followed by eight months of obsessive researching and digging through city records. The work had paid off. More than the tunnel, Diamond’s fascination was fixated on what he believed was inside—an abandoned 1830s engine sealed behind the far wall of the tunnel. Captivated with trains since his childhood, Diamond filled his home with model train sets in his youth and now stacks it high with piles of books on the subject. “I wanted that locomotive,” Diamond said. “As far as I’m concerned, that was mine.” For a time it seemed he might succeed. The city reacted positively to his proposed plans for a museum in the tunnel. Private organizations offered to donate trolley cars. In 1982 Diamond started offering public tours. He formed the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association the same year. The association successfully appealed to the National Register of Historic Places which landmarked the tunnel in 1989. Diamond expanded his efforts to restoring trolley service in Dumbo and nearby Red Hook, with the goal of one day connecting the two lines. By 2010, now flanked by a Trader Joe’s and Urban Outfitters, the neighborhood above the tunnel was different from the day Diamond first clambered down a manhole. Recent rezoning in downtown Brooklyn raised the maximum height for new developments. The dusty antique stores that once lined Atlantic Avenue were beginning to disappear and plans to open a Barney’s had recently been announced. Diamond had changed too. No longer the youthful student crawling his way into adventure, he suffered from arthritis and conducted his tours from a seat in the tunnel. His persistent nature had made him a thorn in the side of local government agencies, several of which declined to comment for this article. Despite the neighborhood’s transformation, Diamond was shocked when his operation was shut down in 2010. Over the 30 years the tunnel was open the tours had increased in popularity. Hundreds of curious visitors were ushered weekly through the manhole in the middle of Atlantic Avenue (at Court Street). Rooftop Films held screenings in the tunnel, running series with themes like “Trapped in the Tunnel” and “Tunnel of Love.” National Geographic planned to film a documentary about the tunnel and the abandoned locomotive rumored to be sealed in its depths. The growing attention might have done more harm than good. In December of 2010, on the recommendation of the Fire Department, the DOT suspended the tours and the City of New York barred Diamond and the BHRA’s access to the tunnel. Diamond sued the City in 2011, seeking to recover damages for fraud and breach of contract. He lost the case, the court finding that the City had the “right to revoke and terminate the consent agreement at any time.” He appealed and lost again in 2015. Today the Atlantic Avenue entrance remains welded shut. In 2014 the owners of Chez Moi at 135 Atlantic, Tarek Debira and Patricia Ageheim, were renovating their restaurant. After a beer and some persuasion with a sledgehammer, Debira uncovered an exterior section of the tunnel behind a basement wall. Like Diamond’s comparison to Indiana Jones, Ageheim said finding the tunnel “was like opening the doors of Narnia”. The space was incorporated into a speakeasy style bar, Le Boudoir, which attracts customers with this slice of Brooklyn history. It’s a fitting fate for a tunnel once rumored to have been a hideout for bootleggers and illegal whiskey stills. Petitions have circulated urging the City to resume the tours. Ageheim said there were reports of a residence in the area also having basement access to the tunnel. A test conducted in the tunnel shortly before it closed showed evidence there could be a large metal object behind the far wall, right where the locomotive is alleged to sit. Diamond has not given up hope he will see the inside of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel again. Inspired by the new evidence from the test, he continues to look for new ways to regain access. Referring to a book by Chairman Mao sitting on his table, he said the process was like “long term, low intensity warfare.” While the second life of the Atlantic Tunnel might have been a brief 30 years, this chapter closes with a new generation of Brooklynites curious about its future. Hopefully the giant rats won’t be a part of it. This story is free to read thanks to the generous support from readers like you.

Andrew,Davis,b'1708',http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6566480-151/bend-council-candidates-debate-housing-growth-sewer,"Four Bend City Council candidates sparred over growth, transportation and housing at a debate Monday. The Central Oregon Association of Realtors hosted a joint debate with Position 5 candidates Gena Goodman-Campbell and Andrew Davis and Position 6 candidates Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick. Victor Johnson, who’s running for Position 5, and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, who’s running for Position 6, did not attend the debate. Boozell is in jail through December for failing to pay child support; Johnson did not respond to an invitation, said Tyler Neese, the association’s government affairs director. The association’s political action committee has given $30,000 to Davis and $10,000 to McCormick, according to campaign finance records filed with the Oregon Secretary of State. Growth Davis and McCormick both said the city should focus on quickly annexing land in its urban growth boundary, the line around Bend that limits where it can grow. A land shortage means Bend can’t build homes or attract high-paying jobs quickly enough, said Davis, Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life. The city also needs to start planning for its next UGB expansion immediately, he said. “If we can build homes quickly enough, we can help costs from scaling out of control,” he said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, said she agreed Bend should be building more homes quickly to address the city’s housing crisis, but she said Bend should be careful about sprawling. The city’s last urban growth boundary expansions took two tries and several years to be approved because it tried to expand too far, she said. “I really don’t think we can afford more sprawl, especially when we have trouble maintaining the roads and infrastructure we have now,” she said. Smart growth includes focusing development in the center of the city, where roads and other infrastructure already exist, Goodman-Campbell said. Affordable housing Davis and Goodman-Campbell said they wanted to see developers in Bend building more varieties of housing, including duplexes and townhomes. The focus should be on homes for people making the median income of $64,000 or below, Goodman-Campbell said, because Bend has a shortage of thousands of homes for people making that amount but a surplus of homes for people with higher incomes. McCormick, a stay-at-home mother whose family owns the Pine Tavern, said the city should focus on annexing land in the UGB rather than trying city policies like rent control or inclusionary zoning, which requires affordable housing in developments. Developers work with fine margins and requiring them to construct affordable housing will mean they move to other cities, she said “There is a price to be paid for putting in low-income housing,” McCormick said. Bend and other cities have learned from past failures and now build subsidized housing so it fits in with neighborhoods, said Campbell, a current city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop in downtown Bend. She said she wished she could get all Bend residents who are concerned about affordable housing projects on a bus tour to look at the projects the city’s already completed. “I think most of our citizens would be surprised to find out they are already living near affordable housing,” she said. “We’ve done a remarkable job of making those types of housing fit into neighborhoods.” Transportation State law requires Bend to reduce how many miles vehicles travel, and there are several ways to do that, Goodman-Campbell said. One way is by making sure Bend residents have access to amenities like grocery stores in their neighborhoods, so they’re able to safely walk, bike or drive a short distance instead of driving across town, she said. “If their car breaks down, a lot of people don’t have ways to get around town,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell both talked about how advances in street-light technology can help traffic. Smart traffic signals and route-finding apps that advise drivers to take less congested routes help create capacity without widening streets, Campbell said. McCormick and Davis, meanwhile, said they supported a pilot program near Oregon State University-Cascades that will test subsidizing ride-hailing services in place of a bus route that was canceled this summer because of low ridership. Subsidizing ride-hailing rides is better for the city’s budget and the environment than operating buses, McCormick said, but she said Campbell would disagree because “she’s part of the protest with the bus union people.” Campbell, along with Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel, joined city bus drivers when they rallied for higher wages last month. “I’m really excited about having Uber subsidized in place of our bus system,” McCormick said. Campbell, who voted against the pilot program, said she doesn’t want the city to work with companies like Uber and Lyft because their rating system allows for discrimination. “Subsidizing Uber with tax money? No, thank you,” she said. Sewer Campbell and Goodman-Campbell agreed that the city as a whole and the hundreds of homeowners who will have to connect to Bend’s sewer lines should split the costs of connection. A current suggestion from a city committee made up mostly of people who live in a southeast Bend neighborhood near a new city sewer line would cap the connection costs for homeowners at $25,000, instead of the $100,000 or more some homeowners would have to pay without city intervention. The committee’s suggestion also would create financing options that would spread the cost over years and create a safety net for people who can’t afford to connect. A fee of $25,000 is still too much, Davis said. “To someone who is retired and drawing on Social Security, that number might as well be $1 million,” he said. He said the city should keep looking at financing options and make sure everyone contributes to the cost. McCormick, meanwhile, said its the city’s responsibility to take care of its residents and homeowners shouldn’t have to pay $25,000. “The city needs to get back to the drawing board,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,5.0,0.35714285714285715,0.0,1020357.0,0.5496088938337768,1,2018-10-03 13:10:00,False

Andrew,Davis,b'1708',https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/cops/ellsworth-police-log-week-of-oct-4/,"ELLSWORTH — Car crashes and hit-and-runs kept officers busy this week. Old Town resident Justine Alexander was taken to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital with possible injuries on Sept. 27 after a three-car crash on Forrest Avenue. Around 6:30 a.m., a car driven by Brewer resident Michael Friel slowed and stopped at a red light at the intersection of Forrest Avenue and State Street, according to the report. Alexander’s car slowed and stopped behind Friel’s, but the car behind her, driven by Andrew Davis of Ellsworth, failed to stop in time and hit Alexander’s vehicle. Alexander’s car was towed due to “disabling damage.” On Sept. 26, police received a report from Krystal Flak of Ellsworth that her car, which was parked on Union Street, had a broken passenger-side taillight and a large scrape near the right rear fender. The car was unoccupied at the time it was hit, according to a report. Officers are looking for the car that allegedly hit Flak’s. Also on Sept. 26, Cheryl Keep reported to police that the truck she was driving struck a parked, unoccupied pickup truck owned by Gene Lyons in the parking lot of Pat’s Pizza around 8 p.m., causing damage to both vehicles. On Sept. 28, Jennifer Cook of Ellsworth came out of Governor’s Restaurant and Bakery to find that her car had a “small dent” in the left rear bumper, according to a report. Officers are investigating. Orland resident Nicholas Noddin was not injured after the truck he was driving struck and killed a deer on the Surry Road on Sept. 28. On Oct. 1, police responded to a report of a hit-and-run in the Walmart parking lot. Paula Ranco of Franklin told officers that her parked car had been hit by a Nissan truck with a lawn mower in the back, causing around $800 worth of damage to the rear passenger-side door, according to a report. The truck “took off” after the incident. Police are investigating. On Sept. 30, officers responded to the parking lot of Home Depot after a report came in that a car driven by Olivia Perkins of Penobscot had struck a car driven by Steven Gunning of Tremont, tearing the bumper off the car driven by Gunning. Perkins told officers she was attempting to pull out of a parking spot and “turned too sharply,” striking the bumper of the car to her right. On Sept. 26, police responded to the Goodwill parking lot after a car driven by Arnold Weisenberg of Tremont reportedly struck a car driven by Cindy Goodwin of Bucksport, causing around $200 in damage to each vehicle. Weisenberg was reportedly backing his car out of a parking space when he hit the car driven by Goodwin, scratching the rear passenger side of her vehicle. On Sept. 27, John Murray of Blue Hill was backing his car out of a spot in the Hannaford parking lot when he struck a jeep driven by Deer Isle resident Caroline Turner on the jeep’s rear passenger side. Officers assist ambulance Capital Ambulance called police to assist in getting into a local residence to help a woman who was “having a medical emergency” on Oct. 1, according to a report. The woman was taken to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital without incident. Death “nothing suspicious” Officers responded to a death at a Christian Ridge Road residence on Sept. 26. The death was not suspicious, according to a report. “No crime” in domestic incident Police responded to a “domestic situation” on Sept. 30 at a local residence, according to a report. Officers left after determining that “no crime had been committed.” Man “staggering” not found Police failed to locate a man “staggering on the roadway” on Sept. 29 who “looked to be intoxicated” and had “fallen down a few times,” according to a report. Guns fired in “safe manner” Two individuals firing guns near the Mill Dam Road on Sept. 29 were determined to be doing so “in a safe manner,” according to a police report. Dispute over “allegedly bad food” Police “refereed a dispute over some allegedly bad food” at a local restaurant with an irate customer on Sept. 25. “They all eventually came to an amicable solution,” officers wrote in a report. Thefts and other losses Police warned a man who had allegedly taken bottles from a business and attempted to redeem them not to return to the business or the redemption center, according to a report made on Sept. 26. Officers are investigating a check for $5,650 that “had not been honored,” according to report made on Oct. 1. Arrests Dana Myrick, 29, of Bar Harbor was arrested and summoned on charges of violation of bail and unlawful possession of a Schedule W drug.

The organization will honor Olympian Adam Rippon, poet Leslea Newman, Chance Mitchell and Justin Nelson of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce ( NGLCC ), and youth advocates Drew Adams & Ose Arheghan. Judy and Dennis Shepardthe parents of Matthew Shepard, whose brutal and homophobic murder was the impetus for the Matthew Shepard Foundation as well as the Hate Crimes Prevention Actwill be speaking at the event. Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 918, the Homeless Youth Act of 2018, authored by Senator Scott Wiener ( D-San Francisco ) and Assemblymember Blanca Rubio ( D-Baldwin Park ) and co-sponsored by Equality California ( EQCA ), an EQCA press release noted. Following an historic $25 million investment in combating youth homelessness included in California's 2018 budget, SB 918 provides resources for housing, services and supports for youth experiencing homelessness, and tasks the state's Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council with overseeing the program. The Black LGBTQ+ Migrant Project ( BLMP ), a project of Transgender Law Center, celebrated the release of Udoka Nweke, a 29-year-old gay Nigerian migrant, from California's Adelanto Detention Facility, according to a BLMP press release. ( Nweke fled from Nigeria, where he was the target of violence for being gay. ) A June 2018 report by Human Rights Watch, the National Immigrant Justice Center, the Detention Watch Network and the American Civil Liberties Union analyzed the death records of people who died while in immigration prisons and found that between 2010 and 2017, seven people died at Adelantomore than any other facility in the United States. After taking flak for remaining the only MLB team not to host an LGBT Pride Night, the New York Yankees organization changed the narrative by announcing details on a series of 2019 events that will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, USA Today reported. The Yankees' commemoration, tabbed the Yankees-Stonewall Scholars Initiative, will be held during the team's homestand June 17-26, 2019, that will honor graduating senior students from the New York City Public School who have made impactful support toward LGBT equality. Lesbian Texas gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez rejected anti-transgender bathroom legislationonce a priority for anti-LGBT Gov. Greg Abbottas ""fear-mongering"" in a debate Friday night with her opponent, The Washington Blade reported. During a debate at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, KSAT-TV anchor Steve Spriester asked Abbott whether he'd sign a bill barring transgender people from using the restroom consistent with their gender identityand Abbott eventually said, ""Not on my agenda."" Valdez said, ""There is a continual fear-mongering, and I don't believe in laws that start out with fear. We need to stop the fear-mongering in our laws and get down to what really matters to all Texans: To have an equality life, to have an equal and fair opportunity in this state instead of just dealing with people that you don't agree with."" A lawsuit challenging the replacement for North Carolina's House Bill 2 is moving forward, with a judge finding evidence that transgender plaintiffs are being harmed by a prohibition on new local anti-discrimination laws, WRAL.com reported. However, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder rejected another key argument: that uncertainty created by the current law effectively discriminates against transgender people. Schroeder sided with plaintiffs' arguments that House Bill 142 ( which halted new local anti-discrimination ordinances until the end of 2020 ) largely thwarts their efforts to seek new LGBT protections. In Pennsylvania, what started as a call to support a principal who had been placed on leave turned into a personal admission from Beaver Area School District's top administratoras Beaver Area Superintendent Carrie Rowe said she's lesbian, TimesOnline.com reported. Rowe's statement came after Luke Berardelli, a Beaver graduate and former Beaver councilman, organized a rally prior to a meeting to show support for Steve Wellendorf, the Beaver Area High School principal placed on paid leave in August. Berardelli had complained of a ""toxic culture"" in the school district, and alleged Rowe has targeted people who are involved in a Christian group called Young Life; Wellendorf supported the speech of a student at a 2017 graduation that included elements of prayer and Christian themes. There is a new project to compile a resource list of service providers to the transgender community throughout Texas called the Texas Transgender Alliance, The Dallas Voice reported. Black Transman founder Carter Brown and Equality Texas Transgender Programs Coordinator Lou Weaver are running the project. The Texas Department of State Health Services is identifying groups across the state falling through the cracks when it comes to HIV care. In a strange development in Colorado, a Jefferson County court has found that a man was married to his ex-boyfriend as a result of a commitment ceremony in 200311 years before gay marriage was legalized in the state, Westword.com noted. As a result of the ruling on a complaint filed by his onetime partner, who sued for spousal support earlier this year, Denver-area resident Dean LaFleur had to divorce a man to whom he never believed he was married tolosing a sizable amount of his assets in the settlement that resulted. Bryan Deneumostiera Miami man arrested in July for posing as a housewife and promising men sex before luring them to his home, filming them without their knowledge and putting those films on a pay website called Straightboyzhas pled guilty to charges of recording two victims in May and July 2015, a Towleroad item noted. Deneumostier reportedly told the men he filmed that the ""housewife"" was an army wife and would never film them. The men wore blackout goggles or a blindfold while engaged in the sex act. The Trevor Projectthe world's largest suicide-prevention and crisis-intervention organization for LGBTQ young peoplereleased ""How to Save a Life,"" a new national campaign that encourages supporters to apply to become volunteer crisis counselors for TrevorText and TrevorChat, a press release noted. The campaign's 30-second PSA features artist-activist Jussie Smollett.

On the Sept. 21 episode of ESPN's Outside the Lines, sportscaster Bob Ley commended Capital University's Wyatt Pertuset for ""the first touchdown scored by an openly gay college football player in any division"" during the show's ""Underreported Story of the Week"" segment, Queerty noted. Pertuset actually made the touchdown nearly three weeks prior, and Ley speculated the triumphant moment had been underreported because sports media is finally treating LGBT athletes as equals. There are still no openly gay football players currently playing in the NFL, but there are seven openly gay or bi players competing at the college level. An effort to accommodate LGBTQ students at the evangelical Christian Azusa Pacific University changed when its board reversed an administration decision to lift the ban on LGBTQ relationships, San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. When the APU student newspaper published an article on Sept. 18 about the initial pro-LGBT move, the 119-year-old university received some kudos but significantly more criticism, especially from Christian news outlets and pundits. In response, the university announced Sept. 28 that because the policy change was never approved by its board of trustees, it was reinstating the ban. A new episode of Smithsonian Channel's The Lost Tapes relives the Bill Clinton impeachment scandal, using only contemporary film and audio to allow viewers to experience history without comment, a Smithsonian Channel press release noted. The hour-long episode seeks to ask: At a time when everyone took a side, would you take the same one now? The Lost Tapes: Clinton Impeachment will air Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. CT on the Smithsonian Channel. Fox News fired contributor Kevin Jackson over his tweet referring to the women accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault as ""lying skanks,"" TheWrap reported. Jackson, a radio personality and author, took to Twitter to make some widely criticized comments during Kavanaugh and his accuser's testimonies before Congress on Sept. 27. Speaking of Kavanaugh, his gay college roommate spoke out about what it was like living with the Supreme Court nominee around the same time he was accused of assaulting multiple women, Queerty noted. Kit Winter lived with Kavanaugh and a third roommate in a three-man suite at Yale in fall 1983. In a new piece by The Cut, Winter, who is gay, described what it was like living with Kavanaugh and the ""grim"" conditions. Winter described Kavanaugh as a ""loud, obnoxious frat boy-like drunk"" type who was ""frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk."" The Center for Fiction announced that Oprah Winfrey will present author Toni Morrison with a lifetime achievement honor for ""Excellence in Fiction,"" Page Six noted. Winfrey, who has chosen such Morrison novels as Song of Solomon and Paradise for her book club, will introduce the author during a Dec. 11 dinner ceremony. Morrison's longtime publisher, editor-in-chief Sonny Mehta of Alfred A. Knopf, also will be honored that night. A message of ""silence"" shared on fourth-ranked Ohio State football's Twitter account drew criticism on social media and from national advocates for victims of sexual abuse and relationship violence, ESPN.com reported.

Sara,Burns,b'1707',https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/fredericton-police-bolster-front-line-emergency-response-after-deadly-shooting-1.4116668,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement The Canadian flags are lifted off the caskets of slain Fredericton Police officers Const. Sara Burns and Const. Robb Costello during a regimental funeral in Fredericton on Saturday, August 18, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese FREDERICTON -- The Fredericton Police Force is bolstering its front line emergency response capabilities in the wake of a deadly summer shooting that claimed the lives of four people, including two police officers. Chief Leanne Fitch said in a statement Monday that although the pain of the loss is still very fresh, the force has to adjust the way it delivers services to adapt to a ""post-August 10"" reality. ""Seven short weeks ago, our police force and our community suffered a grave tragedy, something we never imagined could have happened,"" she said. ""The senseless loss of Donnie Robichaud, Bobbie Lee Wright, and our cherished officers, Cst. Sara Burns and Cst. Robb Costello, is still resonating throughout our great city, and in the hearts and minds of loved ones and colleagues."" Although the force is continuing to mourn the deaths, Fitch said the force must also ""adapt to the realities we have faced."" A number of officers have been transferred to the force's primary response team patrols, a move that Fitch said will impact staffing levels in other areas such as police station tours and public presentations. The change will also curb the force's ability to roll out specialized traffic tools, such as portable electronic speed signs. In response, the city of Fredericton has committed to hiring 16 new officers in the coming months -- 10 more than previously approved -- to strengthen the front lines, restore community services and provide some flexibility for officers who require time off for vacation or personal reasons, the chief said. Offering a glimpse at how deeply the tragedy impacted the force, Fitch said the shooting has placed a strain on officers -- with some not yet able to return to full duties. ""As you can well imagine, the Fredericton Police Force is feeling this loss acutely,"" she said. ""The pain of the loss is still very fresh for us, and it will continue to be as we face reminders in the coming weeks and months."" Matthew Vincent Raymond is facing four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. During Raymond's first court appearance, his lawyer said they were unable to proceed with the case because the defence was still awaiting disclosure -- or release of the findings of the police investigation. Lawyer Nathan Gorham has said he eventually expects a plea of not guilty and a request for a preliminary hearing. Advertisement Did you capture some amazing images or video?

Sara,Burns,b'1707',https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-city-council-budget-2019-1.4846454,"Calamities like the Fredericton shootings that left four people dead, including two police officers, could cost the city up to $2.2 million in its 2019 budget. ""The reality is, there is no buffer to absorb these significant unexpected costs right now, without additional revenue, without impacting service levels,"" Tina Tapley, the city treasurer and director of finance, said at a pre-budget council-in-committee meeting on Monday. Councillors were told the city was responsible for paying for the regimental funerals for Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns, who died, along with Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud, in the shootings outside a north-side apartment building in August. The city is also paying for the investigation and for police officers who had to fill in for officers who needed time off after the shootings. Matthew Vincent Raymond, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the August shooting, is expected to appear in provincial court on Oct. 22. The city still doesn't know exactly how much those expenses will be, which worries some councillors. ""It's been an expensive and catastrophic year across a variety of files,"" said Coun. Greg Ericson, chair of the city's finance committee. ""Council has some challenging decisions ahead of it in terms of how we're going to cover those costs and still provide services and the quality and value that the citizens get from our services."" At the meeting, Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien said Ottawa will help with some of the costs, but he didn't say how much it would contribute. The city's bottom line was also impacted by tariffs from the United States, unprecedented spring flooding, halting the city's plans for Officers' Square, and the continued effects of the provincial property tax assessment freeze. Council agreed there needs to be a better contingency fund to cover unforeseen expenses. Right now, Ericson said, the city doesn't have a strong plan for dealing with unexpected costs. ""Huge one-time fluctuations, whether they're costs or whatever, can impact all kinds of operations that the city performs,"" he said. ""We have very limited revenue streams and limited capacities to borrow under provincial legislation. ""We don't have a credit card with an unlimited amount on it, and we can't just turn to other levels of government with our hands out every time we need it."" In 2018, the city was able to handle some budget challenges such as the property assessment freeze because of a substantial surplus carried over from a previous budget. ""This year we don't have a surplus that helps in the same way, so we've got some difficult conversations around the council table,"" said Ericson.

Phillip,Frost,b'1706',https://www.financial-planning.com/news/ladenburg-thalmann-not-dependent-on-ex-chairmans-capital,"The SEC charges against Ladenburg Thalmann’s primary shareholder will not affect access to capital for its 4,300-advisor independent broker-dealer network, CEO Dick Lampen says. Phillip Frost retired from the Miami-based firm’s board on Sept. 20, two weeks after the SEC accused him of involvement with a $27 million pump-and-dump scheme. In addition to the network of five IBDs, Ladenburg’s subsidiaries also include its 139-year old investment bank, an asset management unit, an insurance brokerage and a trust division. The company’s various entities hold $250 million in cash with a book value above $390 million, Lampen noted in a statement. Ladenburg is “very pleased about how well-positioned our company is today for continued industry leadership,” he said, noting it also has $600 million “in permanent capital and long-term investment-grade notes” raised in the past five years. “With access to significant capital resources,” Lampen added, “Ladenburg will continue to explore opportunities for growth, including growth through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunities present themselves.” Frost controls about 35% of the company, according to Barrington Research Associates, the sole analysts currently listed as covering the stock. He owns about 3.1 million shares directly and 67.7 million shares indirectly through two entities where he’s the trustee, an SEC Form 4 filing shows. Frost exercised options to purchase nearly $1 million worth of Ladenburg’s stock on Sept. 24, according to the filing. In a separate transaction, he had forfeited 45,000 shares in connection with his retirement from his role as chairman. In the second transaction four days later, Frost exercised his options and held the stock rather than selling the 600,000 shares valued at $948,000, or $1.58 per share. The options, which the company granted him in 2008, would have expired on Oct. 30. The SEC charged one of the stock-owning entities in which Frost is a trustee, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, in the pump-and-dump case. The other, Frost Nevada Investments Trust, is an affiliate of Frost Gamma, according to the firm’s $40 million credit agreement with Frost Gamma. In a civil case filed earlier this month in the Southern District of New York, the regulator charged Frost, nine other people and 10 entities with selling penny stocks at artificially inflated prices. Retail investors wound up holding “virtually worthless” stock, the SEC says. The billionaire dermatologist’s fortune, which stems from his legendary career as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, helped Ladenburg acquire its five IBDs between 2007 and 2015. Frost has largely taken “a passive role” with the IBDs, though, says recruiter Jon Henschen. Henschen sees the SEC case against Frost as much different from the accounting scandal which plunged former Cetera Financial Group parent RCS Capital into bankruptcy protection in 2016. “It has nothing to do with Ladenburg,” Henschen says. “They’re basically putting up a Chinese wall to shield them, whatever does transpire there. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s not going to involve Ladenburg.” Barrington analyst Alexander Paris reiterated the research firm’s “outperform” rating for Ladenburg’s stock in a Sept. 21 note following the announcement of Frost’s retirement. Paris set a 12-month price target of $4.75 per share, or roughly an 95% increase over its current value of $2.44. Paris noted that Frost had expressed confidence in Ladenburg’s outlook even as he stepped down, which “suggests to us that he has no current plans to sell or reduce” his stake in the firm. The analysts “can attest to his long-term and successful approach to investing,” Paris wrote. The sell-off following word of the SEC charges against Frost left the value of Ladenburg's shares at 60% of its projected 2018 revenue, according to Paris, who describes the price of the firm’s stock as a discount on the ratio of 1.3-times-revenue for shares in its “closest proxy,” LPL Financial. “We expect continued growth going forward, as Ladenburg leverages its significant scale and capitalizes on further consolidation opportunities,” Paris wrote.",0.0,21.0,0.875,0.0,1053951.0,0.9994979930908506,1,2018-10-03 13:10:00,False

The case, Pepe v. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. f/k/a BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, No. 2:18-cv-14091 was filed on September 20, 2018. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the company and certain of its officers were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate Cocrystal's stock price; (2) this illicit scheme would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (3) the Company failed to abide by SEC disclosure regulations; and (4) as a result, the Company's statements about Cocrystal's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, on September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Phillip Frost, one of the Company's directors and shareholders, and others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, Phillip Frost allegedly participated in at least two unlawful pump-and-dump schemes involving various microcap companies. After the lawsuit was announced, Cocrystal's share price fell from $3.74 per share on September 6, 2018, to a closing price of $3.16 on September 11, 2018—a $0.58 or a 15.51% drop. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Cocrystal's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.
