In November 2017, Brooklyn BreYanna Stevenson, 31, was found dead in a hotel room in Oklahoma City with multiple gunshot wounds.

Lambda Legal filed a federal lawsuit challenging Tennessee's policy prohibiting transgender people born in the state from correcting the gender marker on their birth certificates, a press release noted.

By refusing to correct the birth certificates of transgender Tennesseans, Tennessee puts transgender people in harm's way and violates our most fundamental constitutional rights,"" said Lambda Legal Senior Attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan. Amazon, IKEA, Lyft, Hilton, Warby Parker and several other businesses operating in Tennessee are speaking out against legislation affecting LGBT individuals, arguing the proposed bills will make employee recruitment more difficult and harm the state's business climate, The Tennessean reported. Marriott International, MassMutual, Nike, InterContinental Hotels Group, Salesforce, Unilever and Replacements also signed a letter dated April 23, initiated by the Human Rights Campaign and sent to Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and House Speaker Glen Casada. Warner Music Group, Curb Records and AllianceBernstein have previously issued statements voicing their concerns about the bills.

It turned out that a post published on the website Medium accusing Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg of sexual assault was fabricated as part of a smear campaign led by two right-wing agitators, PinkNews noted. Republican lobbyist Jack Burkman and provocateur Jacob Wohl had been looking for young men willing to accuse Pete Buttigieg of sexual misconduct as part of their plan to stop the candidate's momentum, The Daily Beast reported. The Medium account that posted the false accusation bore the name of Hunter Kelly, a 21-year-old gay Republican college student who told The Advocate he was flown to Washington, D.C., by Burkman and Wohl; Kelly later denied the claims against Buttigieg. Evangelical pastor Franklin Graham  the son of the late pastor the Rev. Billy Graham  is calling on Pete Buttigieg to repent for being gay, The Washington Blade noted.
