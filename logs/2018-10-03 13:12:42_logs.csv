Bob,Diamond,b'1709',https://bklyner.com/the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-that-never-goes-out/,"COBBLE HILL – Sometimes the most exciting places in New York are not found on its streets but right underneath them. Consider the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel in Brooklyn. Along with places like the 91st Street ghost station and the abandoned East 18th Street station, the tunnel is one of several abandoned underground transit spaces in New York. Built in 1844, the world’s first subway ran under Atlantic Avenue between Boerum Place and Columbia Street, according to The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA). Constructed almost 40 years before the Brooklyn Bridge opened, it was the last step in connecting Boston with New York by rail link. Running the trains underground satisfied investors who wanted to develop the area and residents who wanted to keep it beautiful. But benefits were offset by pollution when ventilation shafts unleashed sparks and shot plumes of smoke onto the avenue above. Residents complained, and in 1859 a New York Court prohibited coal or wood burning locomotives from entering Brooklyn, according to Robert Daley’s book The World Beneath the City. The world’s first subway had been active for only 16 years. The tunnel lived on in the minds of New Yorkers. Rumors claimed the missing pages of John Wilkes Booth’s diary, pirates, prohibition era bootleggers, mustard gas wielding WWll spies, mobsters, and giant water rats had all found sanctuary within its walls. The tunnel became the stuff of fantasy. This all changed in August of 1980 when a young engineering student from Flatbush, Bob Diamond, went down a manhole, crawled through a shallow chamber, broke through a brick wall and pulled the tunnel back into reality. “This blast of cold air came out from the other side, just like Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Diamond said of the moment he opened up the cavernous tunnel. The discovery was followed by eight months of obsessive researching and digging through city records. The work had paid off. More than the tunnel, Diamond’s fascination was fixated on what he believed was inside—an abandoned 1830s engine sealed behind the far wall of the tunnel. Captivated with trains since his childhood, Diamond filled his home with model train sets in his youth and now stacks it high with piles of books on the subject. “I wanted that locomotive,” Diamond said. “As far as I’m concerned, that was mine.” For a time it seemed he might succeed. The city reacted positively to his proposed plans for a museum in the tunnel. Private organizations offered to donate trolley cars. In 1982 Diamond started offering public tours. He formed the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association the same year. The association successfully appealed to the National Register of Historic Places which landmarked the tunnel in 1989. Diamond expanded his efforts to restoring trolley service in Dumbo and nearby Red Hook, with the goal of one day connecting the two lines. By 2010, now flanked by a Trader Joe’s and Urban Outfitters, the neighborhood above the tunnel was different from the day Diamond first clambered down a manhole. Recent rezoning in downtown Brooklyn raised the maximum height for new developments. The dusty antique stores that once lined Atlantic Avenue were beginning to disappear and plans to open a Barney’s had recently been announced. Diamond had changed too. No longer the youthful student crawling his way into adventure, he suffered from arthritis and conducted his tours from a seat in the tunnel. His persistent nature had made him a thorn in the side of local government agencies, several of which declined to comment for this article. Despite the neighborhood’s transformation, Diamond was shocked when his operation was shut down in 2010. Over the 30 years the tunnel was open the tours had increased in popularity. Hundreds of curious visitors were ushered weekly through the manhole in the middle of Atlantic Avenue (at Court Street). Rooftop Films held screenings in the tunnel, running series with themes like “Trapped in the Tunnel” and “Tunnel of Love.” National Geographic planned to film a documentary about the tunnel and the abandoned locomotive rumored to be sealed in its depths. The growing attention might have done more harm than good. In December of 2010, on the recommendation of the Fire Department, the DOT suspended the tours and the City of New York barred Diamond and the BHRA’s access to the tunnel. Diamond sued the City in 2011, seeking to recover damages for fraud and breach of contract. He lost the case, the court finding that the City had the “right to revoke and terminate the consent agreement at any time.” He appealed and lost again in 2015. Today the Atlantic Avenue entrance remains welded shut. In 2014 the owners of Chez Moi at 135 Atlantic, Tarek Debira and Patricia Ageheim, were renovating their restaurant. After a beer and some persuasion with a sledgehammer, Debira uncovered an exterior section of the tunnel behind a basement wall. Like Diamond’s comparison to Indiana Jones, Ageheim said finding the tunnel “was like opening the doors of Narnia”. The space was incorporated into a speakeasy style bar, Le Boudoir, which attracts customers with this slice of Brooklyn history. It’s a fitting fate for a tunnel once rumored to have been a hideout for bootleggers and illegal whiskey stills. Petitions have circulated urging the City to resume the tours. Ageheim said there were reports of a residence in the area also having basement access to the tunnel. A test conducted in the tunnel shortly before it closed showed evidence there could be a large metal object behind the far wall, right where the locomotive is alleged to sit. Diamond has not given up hope he will see the inside of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel again. Inspired by the new evidence from the test, he continues to look for new ways to regain access. Referring to a book by Chairman Mao sitting on his table, he said the process was like “long term, low intensity warfare.” While the second life of the Atlantic Tunnel might have been a brief 30 years, this chapter closes with a new generation of Brooklynites curious about its future.

Andrew,Davis,b'1708',http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6566480-151/bend-council-candidates-debate-housing-growth-sewer,"Four Bend City Council candidates sparred over growth, transportation and housing at a debate Monday. The Central Oregon Association of Realtors hosted a joint debate with Position 5 candidates Gena Goodman-Campbell and Andrew Davis and Position 6 candidates Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick. Victor Johnson, who’s running for Position 5, and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, who’s running for Position 6, did not attend the debate. Boozell is in jail through December for failing to pay child support; Johnson did not respond to an invitation, said Tyler Neese, the association’s government affairs director. The association’s political action committee has given $30,000 to Davis and $10,000 to McCormick, according to campaign finance records filed with the Oregon Secretary of State. Growth Davis and McCormick both said the city should focus on quickly annexing land in its urban growth boundary, the line around Bend that limits where it can grow. A land shortage means Bend can’t build homes or attract high-paying jobs quickly enough, said Davis, Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life. The city also needs to start planning for its next UGB expansion immediately, he said. “If we can build homes quickly enough, we can help costs from scaling out of control,” he said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, said she agreed Bend should be building more homes quickly to address the city’s housing crisis, but she said Bend should be careful about sprawling. The city’s last urban growth boundary expansions took two tries and several years to be approved because it tried to expand too far, she said. “I really don’t think we can afford more sprawl, especially when we have trouble maintaining the roads and infrastructure we have now,” she said. Smart growth includes focusing development in the center of the city, where roads and other infrastructure already exist, Goodman-Campbell said. Affordable housing Davis and Goodman-Campbell said they wanted to see developers in Bend building more varieties of housing, including duplexes and townhomes. The focus should be on homes for people making the median income of $64,000 or below, Goodman-Campbell said, because Bend has a shortage of thousands of homes for people making that amount but a surplus of homes for people with higher incomes. McCormick, a stay-at-home mother whose family owns the Pine Tavern, said the city should focus on annexing land in the UGB rather than trying city policies like rent control or inclusionary zoning, which requires affordable housing in developments. Developers work with fine margins and requiring them to construct affordable housing will mean they move to other cities, she said “There is a price to be paid for putting in low-income housing,” McCormick said. Bend and other cities have learned from past failures and now build subsidized housing so it fits in with neighborhoods, said Campbell, a current city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop in downtown Bend. She said she wished she could get all Bend residents who are concerned about affordable housing projects on a bus tour to look at the projects the city’s already completed. “I think most of our citizens would be surprised to find out they are already living near affordable housing,” she said. “We’ve done a remarkable job of making those types of housing fit into neighborhoods.” Transportation State law requires Bend to reduce how many miles vehicles travel, and there are several ways to do that, Goodman-Campbell said. One way is by making sure Bend residents have access to amenities like grocery stores in their neighborhoods, so they’re able to safely walk, bike or drive a short distance instead of driving across town, she said. “If their car breaks down, a lot of people don’t have ways to get around town,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell both talked about how advances in street-light technology can help traffic. Smart traffic signals and route-finding apps that advise drivers to take less congested routes help create capacity without widening streets, Campbell said. McCormick and Davis, meanwhile, said they supported a pilot program near Oregon State University-Cascades that will test subsidizing ride-hailing services in place of a bus route that was canceled this summer because of low ridership. Subsidizing ride-hailing rides is better for the city’s budget and the environment than operating buses, McCormick said, but she said Campbell would disagree because “she’s part of the protest with the bus union people.” Campbell, along with Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel, joined city bus drivers when they rallied for higher wages last month. “I’m really excited about having Uber subsidized in place of our bus system,” McCormick said. Campbell, who voted against the pilot program, said she doesn’t want the city to work with companies like Uber and Lyft because their rating system allows for discrimination. “Subsidizing Uber with tax money? No, thank you,” she said. Sewer Campbell and Goodman-Campbell agreed that the city as a whole and the hundreds of homeowners who will have to connect to Bend’s sewer lines should split the costs of connection. A current suggestion from a city committee made up mostly of people who live in a southeast Bend neighborhood near a new city sewer line would cap the connection costs for homeowners at $25,000, instead of the $100,000 or more some homeowners would have to pay without city intervention. The committee’s suggestion also would create financing options that would spread the cost over years and create a safety net for people who can’t afford to connect. A fee of $25,000 is still too much, Davis said. “To someone who is retired and drawing on Social Security, that number might as well be $1 million,” he said. He said the city should keep looking at financing options and make sure everyone contributes to the cost. McCormick, meanwhile, said its the city’s responsibility to take care of its residents and homeowners shouldn’t have to pay $25,000. “The city needs to get back to the drawing board,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,5.0,0.35714285714285715,0.0,1020357.0,0.5496088938337768,1,2018-10-03 13:11:47,False

Andrew,Davis,b'1708',https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/cops/ellsworth-police-log-week-of-oct-4/,"ELLSWORTH — Car crashes and hit-and-runs kept officers busy this week. Old Town resident Justine Alexander was taken to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital with possible injuries on Sept. 27 after a three-car crash on Forrest Avenue. Around 6:30 a.m., a car driven by Brewer resident Michael Friel slowed and stopped at a red light at the intersection of Forrest Avenue and State Street, according to the report. Alexander’s car slowed and stopped behind Friel’s, but the car behind her, driven by Andrew Davis of Ellsworth, failed to stop in time and hit Alexander’s vehicle. Alexander’s car was towed due to “disabling damage.” On Sept. 26, police received a report from Krystal Flak of Ellsworth that her car, which was parked on Union Street, had a broken passenger-side taillight and a large scrape near the right rear fender. The car was unoccupied at the time it was hit, according to a report. Officers are looking for the car that allegedly hit Flak’s. Also on Sept. 26, Cheryl Keep reported to police that the truck she was driving struck a parked, unoccupied pickup truck owned by Gene Lyons in the parking lot of Pat’s Pizza around 8 p.m., causing damage to both vehicles. On Sept. 28, Jennifer Cook of Ellsworth came out of Governor’s Restaurant and Bakery to find that her car had a “small dent” in the left rear bumper, according to a report. Officers are investigating. Orland resident Nicholas Noddin was not injured after the truck he was driving struck and killed a deer on the Surry Road on Sept. 28. On Oct. 1, police responded to a report of a hit-and-run in the Walmart parking lot. Paula Ranco of Franklin told officers that her parked car had been hit by a Nissan truck with a lawn mower in the back, causing around $800 worth of damage to the rear passenger-side door, according to a report. The truck “took off” after the incident. Police are investigating. On Sept. 30, officers responded to the parking lot of Home Depot after a report came in that a car driven by Olivia Perkins of Penobscot had struck a car driven by Steven Gunning of Tremont, tearing the bumper off the car driven by Gunning. Perkins told officers she was attempting to pull out of a parking spot and “turned too sharply,” striking the bumper of the car to her right. On Sept. 26, police responded to the Goodwill parking lot after a car driven by Arnold Weisenberg of Tremont reportedly struck a car driven by Cindy Goodwin of Bucksport, causing around $200 in damage to each vehicle. Weisenberg was reportedly backing his car out of a parking space when he hit the car driven by Goodwin, scratching the rear passenger side of her vehicle. On Sept. 27, John Murray of Blue Hill was backing his car out of a spot in the Hannaford parking lot when he struck a jeep driven by Deer Isle resident Caroline Turner on the jeep’s rear passenger side. Officers assist ambulance Capital Ambulance called police to assist in getting into a local residence to help a woman who was “having a medical emergency” on Oct. 1, according to a report. The woman was taken to Northern Light Maine Coast Hospital without incident. Death “nothing suspicious” Officers responded to a death at a Christian Ridge Road residence on Sept. 26. The death was not suspicious, according to a report. “No crime” in domestic incident Police responded to a “domestic situation” on Sept. 30 at a local residence, according to a report. Officers left after determining that “no crime had been committed.” Man “staggering” not found Police failed to locate a man “staggering on the roadway” on Sept. 29 who “looked to be intoxicated” and had “fallen down a few times,” according to a report. Guns fired in “safe manner” Two individuals firing guns near the Mill Dam Road on Sept. 29 were determined to be doing so “in a safe manner,” according to a police report. Dispute over “allegedly bad food” Police “refereed a dispute over some allegedly bad food” at a local restaurant with an irate customer on Sept. 25. “They all eventually came to an amicable solution,” officers wrote in a report. Thefts and other losses Police warned a man who had allegedly taken bottles from a business and attempted to redeem them not to return to the business or the redemption center, according to a report made on Sept. 26. Officers are investigating a check for $5,650 that “had not been honored,” according to report made on Oct. 1. Arrests Dana Myrick, 29, of Bar Harbor was arrested and summoned on charges of violation of bail and unlawful possession of a Schedule W drug.

The organization will honor Olympian Adam Rippon, poet Leslea Newman, Chance Mitchell and Justin Nelson of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce ( NGLCC ), and youth advocates Drew Adams & Ose Arheghan. Judy and Dennis Shepardthe parents of Matthew Shepard, whose brutal and homophobic murder was the impetus for the Matthew Shepard Foundation as well as the Hate Crimes Prevention Actwill be speaking at the event. Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 918, the Homeless Youth Act of 2018, authored by Senator Scott Wiener ( D-San Francisco ) and Assemblymember Blanca Rubio ( D-Baldwin Park ) and co-sponsored by Equality California ( EQCA ), an EQCA press release noted. Following an historic $25 million investment in combating youth homelessness included in California's 2018 budget, SB 918 provides resources for housing, services and supports for youth experiencing homelessness, and tasks the state's Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council with overseeing the program. The Black LGBTQ+ Migrant Project ( BLMP ), a project of Transgender Law Center, celebrated the release of Udoka Nweke, a 29-year-old gay Nigerian migrant, from California's Adelanto Detention Facility, according to a BLMP press release. ( Nweke fled from Nigeria, where he was the target of violence for being gay. ) A June 2018 report by Human Rights Watch, the National Immigrant Justice Center, the Detention Watch Network and the American Civil Liberties Union analyzed the death records of people who died while in immigration prisons and found that between 2010 and 2017, seven people died at Adelantomore than any other facility in the United States. After taking flak for remaining the only MLB team not to host an LGBT Pride Night, the New York Yankees organization changed the narrative by announcing details on a series of 2019 events that will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, USA Today reported. The Yankees' commemoration, tabbed the Yankees-Stonewall Scholars Initiative, will be held during the team's homestand June 17-26, 2019, that will honor graduating senior students from the New York City Public School who have made impactful support toward LGBT equality. Lesbian Texas gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez rejected anti-transgender bathroom legislationonce a priority for anti-LGBT Gov. Greg Abbottas ""fear-mongering"" in a debate Friday night with her opponent, The Washington Blade reported. During a debate at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, KSAT-TV anchor Steve Spriester asked Abbott whether he'd sign a bill barring transgender people from using the restroom consistent with their gender identityand Abbott eventually said, ""Not on my agenda."" Valdez said, ""There is a continual fear-mongering, and I don't believe in laws that start out with fear. We need to stop the fear-mongering in our laws and get down to what really matters to all Texans: To have an equality life, to have an equal and fair opportunity in this state instead of just dealing with people that you don't agree with."" A lawsuit challenging the replacement for North Carolina's House Bill 2 is moving forward, with a judge finding evidence that transgender plaintiffs are being harmed by a prohibition on new local anti-discrimination laws, WRAL.com reported. However, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder rejected another key argument: that uncertainty created by the current law effectively discriminates against transgender people. Schroeder sided with plaintiffs' arguments that House Bill 142 ( which halted new local anti-discrimination ordinances until the end of 2020 ) largely thwarts their efforts to seek new LGBT protections. In Pennsylvania, what started as a call to support a principal who had been placed on leave turned into a personal admission from Beaver Area School District's top administratoras Beaver Area Superintendent Carrie Rowe said she's lesbian, TimesOnline.com reported. Rowe's statement came after Luke Berardelli, a Beaver graduate and former Beaver councilman, organized a rally prior to a meeting to show support for Steve Wellendorf, the Beaver Area High School principal placed on paid leave in August. Berardelli had complained of a ""toxic culture"" in the school district, and alleged Rowe has targeted people who are involved in a Christian group called Young Life; Wellendorf supported the speech of a student at a 2017 graduation that included elements of prayer and Christian themes. There is a new project to compile a resource list of service providers to the transgender community throughout Texas called the Texas Transgender Alliance, The Dallas Voice reported. Black Transman founder Carter Brown and Equality Texas Transgender Programs Coordinator Lou Weaver are running the project. The Texas Department of State Health Services is identifying groups across the state falling through the cracks when it comes to HIV care. In a strange development in Colorado, a Jefferson County court has found that a man was married to his ex-boyfriend as a result of a commitment ceremony in 200311 years before gay marriage was legalized in the state, Westword.com noted. As a result of the ruling on a complaint filed by his onetime partner, who sued for spousal support earlier this year, Denver-area resident Dean LaFleur had to divorce a man to whom he never believed he was married tolosing a sizable amount of his assets in the settlement that resulted. Bryan Deneumostiera Miami man arrested in July for posing as a housewife and promising men sex before luring them to his home, filming them without their knowledge and putting those films on a pay website called Straightboyzhas pled guilty to charges of recording two victims in May and July 2015, a Towleroad item noted. Deneumostier reportedly told the men he filmed that the ""housewife"" was an army wife and would never film them. The men wore blackout goggles or a blindfold while engaged in the sex act. The Trevor Projectthe world's largest suicide-prevention and crisis-intervention organization for LGBTQ young peoplereleased ""How to Save a Life,"" a new national campaign that encourages supporters to apply to become volunteer crisis counselors for TrevorText and TrevorChat, a press release noted. The campaign's 30-second PSA features artist-activist Jussie Smollett.

On the Sept. 21 episode of ESPN's Outside the Lines, sportscaster Bob Ley commended Capital University's Wyatt Pertuset for ""the first touchdown scored by an openly gay college football player in any division"" during the show's ""Underreported Story of the Week"" segment, Queerty noted. Pertuset actually made the touchdown nearly three weeks prior, and Ley speculated the triumphant moment had been underreported because sports media is finally treating LGBT athletes as equals. There are still no openly gay football players currently playing in the NFL, but there are seven openly gay or bi players competing at the college level. An effort to accommodate LGBTQ students at the evangelical Christian Azusa Pacific University changed when its board reversed an administration decision to lift the ban on LGBTQ relationships, San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. When the APU student newspaper published an article on Sept. 18 about the initial pro-LGBT move, the 119-year-old university received some kudos but significantly more criticism, especially from Christian news outlets and pundits. In response, the university announced Sept. 28 that because the policy change was never approved by its board of trustees, it was reinstating the ban. A new episode of Smithsonian Channel's The Lost Tapes relives the Bill Clinton impeachment scandal, using only contemporary film and audio to allow viewers to experience history without comment, a Smithsonian Channel press release noted. The hour-long episode seeks to ask: At a time when everyone took a side, would you take the same one now? The Lost Tapes: Clinton Impeachment will air Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. CT on the Smithsonian Channel. Fox News fired contributor Kevin Jackson over his tweet referring to the women accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault as ""lying skanks,"" TheWrap reported. Jackson, a radio personality and author, took to Twitter to make some widely criticized comments during Kavanaugh and his accuser's testimonies before Congress on Sept. 27. Speaking of Kavanaugh, his gay college roommate spoke out about what it was like living with the Supreme Court nominee around the same time he was accused of assaulting multiple women, Queerty noted. Kit Winter lived with Kavanaugh and a third roommate in a three-man suite at Yale in fall 1983. In a new piece by The Cut, Winter, who is gay, described what it was like living with Kavanaugh and the ""grim"" conditions. Winter described Kavanaugh as a ""loud, obnoxious frat boy-like drunk"" type who was ""frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk."" The Center for Fiction announced that Oprah Winfrey will present author Toni Morrison with a lifetime achievement honor for ""Excellence in Fiction,"" Page Six noted. Winfrey, who has chosen such Morrison novels as Song of Solomon and Paradise for her book club, will introduce the author during a Dec. 11 dinner ceremony. Morrison's longtime publisher, editor-in-chief Sonny Mehta of Alfred A. Knopf, also will be honored that night. A message of ""silence"" shared on fourth-ranked Ohio State football's Twitter account drew criticism on social media and from national advocates for victims of sexual abuse and relationship violence, ESPN.com reported.

Sara,Burns,b'1707',https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/fredericton-police-bolster-front-line-emergency-response-after-deadly-shooting-1.4116668,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement The Canadian flags are lifted off the caskets of slain Fredericton Police officers Const. Sara Burns and Const. Robb Costello during a regimental funeral in Fredericton on Saturday, August 18, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese FREDERICTON -- The Fredericton Police Force is bolstering its front line emergency response capabilities in the wake of a deadly summer shooting that claimed the lives of four people, including two police officers. Chief Leanne Fitch said in a statement Monday that although the pain of the loss is still very fresh, the force has to adjust the way it delivers services to adapt to a ""post-August 10"" reality. ""Seven short weeks ago, our police force and our community suffered a grave tragedy, something we never imagined could have happened,"" she said. ""The senseless loss of Donnie Robichaud, Bobbie Lee Wright, and our cherished officers, Cst. Sara Burns and Cst. Robb Costello, is still resonating throughout our great city, and in the hearts and minds of loved ones and colleagues."" Although the force is continuing to mourn the deaths, Fitch said the force must also ""adapt to the realities we have faced."" A number of officers have been transferred to the force's primary response team patrols, a move that Fitch said will impact staffing levels in other areas such as police station tours and public presentations. The change will also curb the force's ability to roll out specialized traffic tools, such as portable electronic speed signs. In response, the city of Fredericton has committed to hiring 16 new officers in the coming months -- 10 more than previously approved -- to strengthen the front lines, restore community services and provide some flexibility for officers who require time off for vacation or personal reasons, the chief said. Offering a glimpse at how deeply the tragedy impacted the force, Fitch said the shooting has placed a strain on officers -- with some not yet able to return to full duties. ""As you can well imagine, the Fredericton Police Force is feeling this loss acutely,"" she said. ""The pain of the loss is still very fresh for us, and it will continue to be as we face reminders in the coming weeks and months."" Matthew Vincent Raymond is facing four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. During Raymond's first court appearance, his lawyer said they were unable to proceed with the case because the defence was still awaiting disclosure -- or release of the findings of the police investigation. Lawyer Nathan Gorham has said he eventually expects a plea of not guilty and a request for a preliminary hearing. Advertisement Did you capture some amazing images or video?

Sara,Burns,b'1707',https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-city-council-budget-2019-1.4846454,"Calamities like the Fredericton shootings that left four people dead, including two police officers, could cost the city up to $2.2 million in its 2019 budget. ""The reality is, there is no buffer to absorb these significant unexpected costs right now, without additional revenue, without impacting service levels,"" Tina Tapley, the city treasurer and director of finance, said at a pre-budget council-in-committee meeting on Monday. Councillors were told the city was responsible for paying for the regimental funerals for Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns, who died, along with Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud, in the shootings outside a north-side apartment building in August. The city is also paying for the investigation and for police officers who had to fill in for officers who needed time off after the shootings. Matthew Vincent Raymond, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the August shooting, is expected to appear in provincial court on Oct. 22. The city still doesn't know exactly how much those expenses will be, which worries some councillors. ""It's been an expensive and catastrophic year across a variety of files,"" said Coun. Greg Ericson, chair of the city's finance committee. ""Council has some challenging decisions ahead of it in terms of how we're going to cover those costs and still provide services and the quality and value that the citizens get from our services."" At the meeting, Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien said Ottawa will help with some of the costs, but he didn't say how much it would contribute. The city's bottom line was also impacted by tariffs from the United States, unprecedented spring flooding, halting the city's plans for Officers' Square, and the continued effects of the provincial property tax assessment freeze. Council agreed there needs to be a better contingency fund to cover unforeseen expenses. Right now, Ericson said, the city doesn't have a strong plan for dealing with unexpected costs. ""Huge one-time fluctuations, whether they're costs or whatever, can impact all kinds of operations that the city performs,"" he said. ""We have very limited revenue streams and limited capacities to borrow under provincial legislation. ""We don't have a credit card with an unlimited amount on it, and we can't just turn to other levels of government with our hands out every time we need it."" In 2018, the city was able to handle some budget challenges such as the property assessment freeze because of a substantial surplus carried over from a previous budget. ""This year we don't have a surplus that helps in the same way, so we've got some difficult conversations around the council table,"" said Ericson.

Phillip,Frost,b'1706',https://www.financial-planning.com/news/ladenburg-thalmann-not-dependent-on-ex-chairmans-capital,"The SEC charges against Ladenburg Thalmann’s primary shareholder will not affect access to capital for its 4,300-advisor independent broker-dealer network, CEO Dick Lampen says. Phillip Frost retired from the Miami-based firm’s board on Sept. 20, two weeks after the SEC accused him of involvement with a $27 million pump-and-dump scheme. In addition to the network of five IBDs, Ladenburg’s subsidiaries also include its 139-year old investment bank, an asset management unit, an insurance brokerage and a trust division. The company’s various entities hold $250 million in cash with a book value above $390 million, Lampen noted in a statement. Ladenburg is “very pleased about how well-positioned our company is today for continued industry leadership,” he said, noting it also has $600 million “in permanent capital and long-term investment-grade notes” raised in the past five years. “With access to significant capital resources,” Lampen added, “Ladenburg will continue to explore opportunities for growth, including growth through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunities present themselves.” Frost controls about 35% of the company, according to Barrington Research Associates, the sole analysts currently listed as covering the stock. He owns about 3.1 million shares directly and 67.7 million shares indirectly through two entities where he’s the trustee, an SEC Form 4 filing shows. Frost exercised options to purchase nearly $1 million worth of Ladenburg’s stock on Sept. 24, according to the filing. In a separate transaction, he had forfeited 45,000 shares in connection with his retirement from his role as chairman. In the second transaction four days later, Frost exercised his options and held the stock rather than selling the 600,000 shares valued at $948,000, or $1.58 per share. The options, which the company granted him in 2008, would have expired on Oct. 30. The SEC charged one of the stock-owning entities in which Frost is a trustee, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, in the pump-and-dump case. The other, Frost Nevada Investments Trust, is an affiliate of Frost Gamma, according to the firm’s $40 million credit agreement with Frost Gamma. In a civil case filed earlier this month in the Southern District of New York, the regulator charged Frost, nine other people and 10 entities with selling penny stocks at artificially inflated prices. Retail investors wound up holding “virtually worthless” stock, the SEC says. The billionaire dermatologist’s fortune, which stems from his legendary career as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, helped Ladenburg acquire its five IBDs between 2007 and 2015. Frost has largely taken “a passive role” with the IBDs, though, says recruiter Jon Henschen. Henschen sees the SEC case against Frost as much different from the accounting scandal which plunged former Cetera Financial Group parent RCS Capital into bankruptcy protection in 2016. “It has nothing to do with Ladenburg,” Henschen says. “They’re basically putting up a Chinese wall to shield them, whatever does transpire there. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s not going to involve Ladenburg.” Barrington analyst Alexander Paris reiterated the research firm’s “outperform” rating for Ladenburg’s stock in a Sept. 21 note following the announcement of Frost’s retirement. Paris set a 12-month price target of $4.75 per share, or roughly an 95% increase over its current value of $2.44. Paris noted that Frost had expressed confidence in Ladenburg’s outlook even as he stepped down, which “suggests to us that he has no current plans to sell or reduce” his stake in the firm. The analysts “can attest to his long-term and successful approach to investing,” Paris wrote. The sell-off following word of the SEC charges against Frost left the value of Ladenburg's shares at 60% of its projected 2018 revenue, according to Paris, who describes the price of the firm’s stock as a discount on the ratio of 1.3-times-revenue for shares in its “closest proxy,” LPL Financial. “We expect continued growth going forward, as Ladenburg leverages its significant scale and capitalizes on further consolidation opportunities,” Paris wrote.",0.0,21.0,0.875,0.0,1053951.0,0.9994979930908506,1,2018-10-03 13:11:47,False

The case, Pepe v. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. f/k/a BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, No. 2:18-cv-14091 was filed on September 20, 2018. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the company and certain of its officers were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate Cocrystal's stock price; (2) this illicit scheme would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (3) the Company failed to abide by SEC disclosure regulations; and (4) as a result, the Company's statements about Cocrystal's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, on September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Phillip Frost, one of the Company's directors and shareholders, and others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, Phillip Frost allegedly participated in at least two unlawful pump-and-dump schemes involving various microcap companies. After the lawsuit was announced, Cocrystal's share price fell from $3.74 per share on September 6, 2018, to a closing price of $3.16 on September 11, 2018—a $0.58 or a 15.51% drop. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Cocrystal's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

The confirmed additions join the previously announced entries from Team Panoz Racing and Automatic Racing for the Intercontinental GT Challenge season finale. It will result in at least seven GT4 manufacturers being represented on the grid, which will also feature GT3, Cup class and TCR machinery. While an entry list has not yet been released, it’s understood a total of 31 cars are currently entered.

Contact John Patrick October 1, 2018 at 5:31 pm Looking forward to seeing the entry list. Definitely a testimate to which GT4 cars are all around the best – an 8-hour enduro! The Camaro GT4, I don’t think, has been mentioned, yet. Coupled with the fact that none of those cars have run the 4-hour IMSA enduro’s, I would like to see how that car’s reliability stacks up to the rest… NotJohnDagys October 1, 2018 at 6:18 pm Just figuring these entries will pull teams away from Sebring’s November race…. KMW October 2, 2018 at 3:57 am Last year’s race was actually very entertaining. Lead changed with about 20 minutes to go. With a race of this length, there is plenty of time to walk the whole course and enjoy every corner. And you won’t have to fight any crowds. Apparently this race is too esoteric for the casual fan. The hardcore will be there. daedalus October 2, 2018 at 4:20 am This year seems to be a race worth watching. The GT3 will get strung out after the first hour so I’m glad there are so many GT4 entries this year to keep things interesting. David Bruce Vodden October 3, 2018 at 12:27 pm These teams should run the 25 Hours of Thunderhill December 1-2. It has become the race that everyone wants to run just because it is.

Sara,Burns,b'1703',https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/officers-killed-in-fredericton-shooting-honoured-at-ottawa-ceremony-1.4115776,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement Two Fredericton police officers who were killed in a shooting nearly two months ago were among the six officers to be honoured in Ottawa for making the ultimate sacrifice. Six Canadian police officers who died in the line of duty were honoured on Sunday in front of hundreds of colleagues at the 41st annual Police and Peace Officers' Memorial Service outside Parliament Hill. Among them were Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello. Burns and Costello were killed on the morning of Aug. 10 in a shooting at an apartment complex in Fredericton. Two civilians -- Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright – were also killed. The suspect in the shooting, Matthew Vincent Raymond, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. His next court date is scheduled for Oct. 22. Both Costello’s and Burns’ families were at the ceremony in Ottawa, but were too emotional to speak with reporters. “They're doing as well as can be expected,” said Fredericton Police Chief Leanne Fitch. “They are incredible families and I think this has been a very healing event for all of us.” In 1998, the federal government officially proclaimed the last Sunday of September as Police and Peace Officers’ National Memorial Day. In a statement, Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale acknowledged the police officers’ “self-sacrifice and dedication to their noble professions.” “Police and Peace Officers' National Memorial Day is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the vital role police and peace officers play in our society and to honour those who have sacrificed their lives in carrying out their duties,” he said. “It is also an opportunity to think of their families and loved ones, and to extend to them our thoughts and prayers."" The other four officers who were honoured on Sunday included: All six names will be added to Honour Roll tablets on Parliament Hill, which already include the names of more than 860 fallen officers in Canada. With a report from CTV Ottawa’s Megan Shaw A cool + cloudy day in Ottawa, but the National Police+Peace Officer Memorial Service was both moving + impressive. Thousands gathered to pay tribute to fallen officers. #HeroesInLife #WeRemember pic.twitter.com/RfJhV0EyP6 A police officer adjusts her hat before the Canadian Police and Peace Officers Memorial Service on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018.

GEORGE — A passenger was killed and seven occupants, six of them young children, were injured in a rollover on Interstate 15 just south of Cedar City Saturday afternoon. Shortly after 4 p.m. officers and emergency personnel responded to the single-vehicle rollover on southbound I-15 near mile marker 54 involving a silver 2003 Honda Odyssey carrying eight occupants, Utah Highway Patrol trooper Michael Gordon told Cedar City News. Upon arrival, troopers found that one female passenger, later identified as 27-year-old Nancy Morales, of Cedar City, was ejected during the crash and pronounced dead at the scene. The driver and six young children passengers remained in the vehicle during the rollover and were transported to area hospitals, Gordon said. Intermountain Life Flight was also launched due to the severity of injuries. According to a witness at the scene, the helicopter landed on the interstate to load the patients. At the time of the crash, the minivan was heading south on I-15, Gordon said, and according to witness statements at the scene, either a semitractor-trailer or a large RV began to merge into the lane the minivan was traveling in. “The minivan was trying to get away from that vehicle when it lost control and went off of the roadway,” the trooper said. Once the minivan skidded onto the soft shoulder, it rolled multiple times, crashed through a barbed-wire fence and then came to rest in an upright position. The woman who died was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, according to a statement released by UHP. All southbound traffic was stopped, and both travel lanes were closed for more than an hour for the helicopter landing and to allow responders to tend to the scene. Both southbound lanes were reopened for travel at around 5:45 p.m. This report is based on statements from police and may not contain the full scope of findings.

Updated: October 3, 2018 @ 12:55 pm Serving Lawrence County since 1880 Walkers head up the hill from the Cascade Park picnic grove during the Fit Walk. Editor Walkers head up the hill from the Cascade Park picnic grove during the Fit Walk. In their childhood, they rode rides like the Comet, the Tumble Bug, the Ferris wheel and the merry-go-round. Those amusements that once populated Cascade Park put people in motion, but riders always ended back where they started. The concept was basically the same at the sixth annual Challenges Fit Walk yesterday, except the kids are now senior citizens, all the motion was done on foot and home base was the park’s venerable dance pavilion. According to Michael Gordon, health and wellness coordinator for Challenges: Options in Aging, a record 328 people registered to participate in yesterday’s event that included a choice of two walking courses — one easy, the other harder — as well as lunch, a basket auction, 50/50 raffle and prizes. “We’re going to take a stroll through the park today and reminisce at Casade. People are real excited to be here,” Gordon said of the participants. “They grew up in this park and they get to see and reminisce all about the roller coasters and the park as it once was.” The event started out six years ago at Pearson Park in Neshannock Township, but quickly outgrew that facility. Few, though, seem to have outgrown the walk itself. “We have people walking into their 90s,” Gordon said. “It’s impressive what they can do. “But we’re also going to have an indoor sit-down exercise session for those who can’t go out and do the trail today.” Prior to heading out, the participants loosened up with some dance and exercise moves in the pavilion after watching Dottie Trott receive proclamations from both state Sen. Elder Vogel and the Lawrence County commissioners. Trott is retiring after 41 years as fiscal administrator for Challenges. Somewhat newer to the cause is Claire O’Connor, health and wellness assistant at Challenges. Yesterday was her first Fit Walk. Story continues below video “I was impressed by them from the first day I started, and they just continue to impress me with everything they do and how they support each other,” she said. “It’s amazing to see how many of them are here, and how excited they get and how much fun they have.” John Duda, 73, paused outside the pavilion to say, “It’s a great day for exercise, it’s a good fun time. I love it, I come every year.” Richard Macaluso, 77, has done all six Fit Walks, but they are just one part of the Challenges experience he enjoys so much. “Just being with Challenges is good — best operation in town for the elderly,” he said. “I started out in the back with the Fitness Club and stayed with it. They have a golf league, a bowling league, learning how to play mahjong, my wife plays bridge. It’s just a great thing.” Dan Houk, took a different tack. Asked what he liked best about the day, the 63-year-old Ellwood City resident deadpanned, “The prizes.” His wife, Sandy, 67, played along, noting “We did our walk — from the car to here.” The pair conceded that they did plan to participate in the exercise session while others walked, but Sandy said the day is about more than exercise alone. “This is very festive” she said, “exercises and talking to other people.” In other words, just a walk in the park.

It was a loss that set the tone for rest of the district slate last season. John Hardin hosts the Warriors at 7:30 tonight at Bulldog Stadium. The Bulldogs hope to atone for last season and start off on the right foot this year. “This is the first week of our season,” John Hardin coach Chris Eng­strand said. “Everything before this week was merely preparation for district play and playoffs. We weathered the storm of four 6-A schools and that has prepared us for what really matters: District champions and deep playoff run. This week and every week from this point on is our most important week of the season.” John Hardin is riding a three-game winning streak, including scoring late to pull out wins over Central Hardin and Meade County. Engstrand said it hasn’t been difficult to keep the Bulldogs’ attention. “It’s not been too difficult. We just remind them of last year and how easily things can change for the worse,” Eng­strand said. “This group is different. They are hard to put my finger on. Not that it’s a bad thing, I just can’t remember coaching a group this unique. They are fun and maddening at the same time.” The Warriors have struggled offensively this season. They have managed only 21 points in six games, including being shut out four times. It’s a far different offense than last season that scored 49 points against the Bulldogs. But Engstrand said the Warriors still are a dangerous team. “Western is fast, they will try to pound the ball behind a really big offensive line – I mean huge,” Engstrand said. “If they get past our second level, it could be a long night. We have to continue to stop the run and force teams to be one dimensional. If we can continue to do that, we can make a really good run.” John Hardin’s offense is churning out 18.5 points and 343.8 yards per game. Senior Justin Russell has passed for 876 yards and 11 touchdowns. He has completed 52.1 percent of his passes. Russell has thrown 10 interceptions in 169 attempts. Russell has added 116 yards on the ground. Senior DeShawn Johnson has 22 catches for 299 yards and three touchdowns, while senior Darion Davis has made 29 receptions for 243 yards and five scores. Junior Andrew Davis has 14 grabs for 106 yards. Senior Will Cason leads the team in rushing with 226 yards and one touchdown on 40 carries. Sophomore Dominik Hodges has added 216 yards on 42 attempts, while senior Jaylin Springs has 171 yards on 46 carries. The Warriors are allowing 42.5 points per game, but Engstrand said they still are capable of disrupting offenses. “Defensively they are athletic and fast,” Engstrand said. “They play a base 4-3 and really like to bring pressure. They can cause us some issues. Offensively we are going to pick up our tempo. For the first time this season, we have the advantage of numbers and our conditioning. We are shooting for 80 to 90 offensive snaps.” Western (0-6) dropped its district opener at Breckinridge County, 39-6. The Bulldogs (4-2) are in a much better situation than a year ago. They were 3-3 at this time last season. They have won three straight for the first time since 2016. It’s the longest streak in Engstrand’s two-year tenure. Engstrand said the foundation of this season was laid when the Bulldogs rallied from a 19-0 deficit to beat Mercer County, 20-19 in the season opener. “The team believes, it’s that simple,” Engstrand said. “It didn’t start on the winning streak, it started when we came back to win at Mercer. Aside from the hiccup versus North, we have been in every game and we’re a kicker away from beating Daviess County.” Chuck Jones can be reached at 270-505-1759 or cjones@thenewsenterprise.com.

Andrew,Davis,b'1694',http://www.thevalleydispatch.com/ci_32171206/ayer-man-stabbed-death-woman-charged,"AYER - A 24-year-old Ayer man died Friday afternoon after being stabbed by a 26-year-old Ayer woman to whom he is related, and the woman is in police custody pending arraignment on Monday, according to the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Emergency crews in Ayer were called to an apartment complex on Groton School Road in Ayer Friday about 1:18 p.m. by a 911 call reporting a stabbing, according to a press release. Crews arrived to find the man suffering from a stab wound to the torso, according to a press release. ""That man was taken to the Nashoba Valley Medical Center, where he later died from that injury,"" District Attorney Marian Ryan said during a Friday evening press conference outside the Ayer Police Department. Ryan was accompanied by Ayer Police Chief William Murray and Massachusetts State Police Lt. Paul Bulman. According to Ryan, preliminary investigation suggests that the victim was apparently in an altercation inside the apartment with the woman with whom he is related. ""During that altercation, the allegation is that the female stabbed that male with a large kitchen knife,"" Ryan said. Officials said the woman lives in the apartment where the stabbing occurred. The woman was arrested at the scene and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury. More serious charges could be filed once an autopsy is complete. The identities of the victim and the suspect cannot immediately be released since the incident is domestic in nature, according to a press release. Over at the Zodiac Village Apartments at 75 Groton School Road, investigators cordoned off a section of the complex with yellow crime scene tape. They brought out shoe covers to wear in the area of a second-floor apartment. ""I'm shocked,"" Jan Kendall, who was dropping something off for someone at the complex, said. ""It's a whole quiet area."" Andrew Davis, who has lived at the complex for about three years, had no idea what allegedly occurred around the corner from his home. ""It's always been a pretty safe place,"" the 70-year-old said from the entrance of his first-floor apartment. ""I've never seen anything like that."" A short time later, a man wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap showed up to the scene with a concerned look on his face. He didn't want to share his name but said he knew the people who lived in the apartment investigators were looking at. As he learned more details, the man became increasingly distraught. He peered up at the apartment flooded with officers. ""I know who lives there,"" he said. ""I just don't understand."" The 26-year-old suspect was held on $100,000 cash bail and will be arraigned Monday in Ayer District Court.

Sep 28, 2018 @ 2:10 pm By Bruce Kelly With the Securities and Exchange Commission cracking down on penny stocks, Merrill Lynch recently told its clients and financial advisers that it is putting restrictions on the purchase and sale of a large swath of low-priced securities. ""To ensure we are complying with SEC regulations and protecting the interests of our clients, we recently made changes to our policy regarding low-priced securities,"" a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, wrote in an email. As a result, certain transactions may be subject to restrictions, trading prohibitions or other limitations."" According to a source familiar with the moves, as of July, clients were no longer able to buy penny stocks through Merrill Lynch, and by the end of September, will no longer be able to sell them through the brokerage. The stocks will still be able to be transferred to a different account at another broker-dealer. After Merrill informed its clients it was not allowing the sale of the securities and gave advisers and clients to the end of the month to complete the trades, advisers raised concerns about closing down clients' positions, according to the source, who asked not to be named. The changes in Merrill Lynch's stance come as the SEC continues to warn investors about penny stock trading and the risks of market manipulation and higher volatility. The SEC on Friday said it had settled charges against clearing firm COR Clearing for failing to report suspicious sales of penny stock shares totaling millions of dollars. As part of the settlement, COR has agreed to exit a key penny stock clearing business by significantly limiting the sale of penny stocks deposited at COR, which was fined $800,000 and neither admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Earlier this month, Dr. Phillip Frost, the largest shareholder of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., was charged with fraud by the SEC for his involvement in a pump-and-dump, penny stock scheme. At the time, Dr. Frost was the non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann. He resigned from that position days after the SEC's filed its complaint. The new restrictions at Merrill do not affect securities listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, the source said, but apply only to those on the over-the-counter market, which is also known as the Pink Sheets. ""Other firms are saying we don't want these securities,"" the source said. Two years ago, UBS Financial Services created a similar policy regarding so-called high-risk stocks, including penny stocks. According to Merrill Lynch, a low-priced security is generally defined as having one or all of the following traits: securities that trade over-the-counter, or OTC, at or below $5 per share and have a market capitalization of less than or equal to $300 million; securities labeled as ""Caveat Emptor"" by the OTC Markets Group; and OTC securities that have limited or no financial disclosure information available. ""Caveat Emptor,"" Latin for ""let the buyer beware,"" is a designation generally used to inform investors that there may be reason to exercise additional care and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security, according to Merrill Lynch. After September 30, Merrill Lynch clients who want to sell existing positions will face additional compliance reviews that could slow down the transactions. Regulators have increasingly made their views of penny stocks known. The SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis published a white paper in 2016 highlighting the risks of investing in over-the-counter markets. The majority of investors lose money in the trades, and losses worsened for stocks that were the subject of promotional campaigns and those that had weaker disclosures, the SEC said. CNBC first reported the changes in penny stock policy at Merrill Friday morning.

Andrew,Davis,b'1692',http://www.oregonwinepress.com/bubbling-brew,"By L.M. Archer Sparkling wine demands time, toil and treasure. It’s also seductive as hell. Just ask Oregon winemakers. Already renowned for premium Pinot Noir, the state now threatens to outshine other wine regions in bubbles. Many ascribe this burgeoning fizz fame to a far-flung band of passionate winemakers as diverse as their respective terroirs and as complex as the sparkling they craft. Willamette Valley winemakers represent a history of leading, not following. If you’ve tasted a bottle of this gnarly region’s bubbles, chances are one of two men had a hand in it: Rollin Soles or Andrew Davis. Many credit Soles of ROCO Winery for getting the ball rolling and Andrew Davis of The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company for advancing it down the field. Together, their respective legacies account for a major touchdown in Oregon méthode Champenoise or méthode traditionelle, the Old World method developed in Champagne. Soles founded Argyle Winery in 1987 in Dundee with a specific intent: to produce world-class sparkling wine in the Willamette Valley. A pragmatic, handle-bar-mustachioed Texas Aggie, Soles blames luck for his eventual foray into bubbles. “Setting oneself up to receive luck is important,” says Soles. “My luck was that my biochemistry professor [at Texas A&M] set me up to work in Switzerland one college summer vacation for his cousin, Hans Uli Kesslering, who grew Pinot Noir and was a pioneer in sustainable agriculture in the mid-’70s.” Soles credits this experience as the impetus to his future in wine. A side note: “Can’t get any tougher than ripening Pinot Noir in northern Switzerland,” he confirms. Soles’ guiding hand propelled Argyle, and Oregon, to the forefront of sparkling wine internationally, garnering an unprecedented trifecta on Wine Spectator’s list of “Top 100 Wines of the World” in red, white and sparkling categories. “It’s humbling how very small changes in sparkling winemaking actually show up in the wine,” notes Soles. “From picking decisions to pressing the fruit, to fermentation vessels and yeast choices, to blending, to best timing on yeast in the bottle and dosage, sparkling winemaking has made me a better white and red wine winemaker.” In 2001, Soles and his wife, Corby, planted vines on land they purchased in 1987 within the Chehalem Mountains AVA. From that vineyard, Wits’ End, Soles produced his own “Private Stash” Pinot Noir, a cult wine later served at the White House. Such success paved the way in 2009 for Soles to establish ROCO Winery — the name derives from the first two letters in Rollin and Corby — and build a tasting room in 2012. In 2013, Soles turned over the Argyle reins to winemaker Nate Klosterman to concentrate on ROCO. Klosterman has since added Ksenija Kostic House as Argyle’s assistant winemaker — Soles still maintains a healthy mentoring relationship with Argyle. “The timing [to leave Argyle and start ROCO] was perfect,” says Soles. “I’m inspired every month by the manner that ROCO was set in motion by my wife, Corby. She did the ‘hard yards’ of making ROCO happen, has an amazing palate and is the most creative person I know. How could that not inspire this old winemaker?’’ Six Degrees of Andrew Davis While Soles laid the foundation, many people point to Andrew Davis, founder of The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company, for Oregon’s dominance in sparkling today. At 6 feet 5 inches tall, the Argyle alum literally towers above his fellow winemakers. Davis learned sparkling winemaking from Soles at Argyle directly after completing a master’s program in New Zealand. “It was my first stop,” he says. “I knew I wanted to be making bubbles.” Davis recounts his time working under Soles, “He was a wonderful mentor to me. Spectacular. And [he] had the confidence in my abilities to slowly give me more and more of the reins, until I took on the winemaker role.” As Argyle grew, Davis realized he wanted to take on a personal project of a much smaller scale. That day arrived in 2013. Sensing a latent desire from area winemakers for assistance starting their own sparkling projects, Davis founded Radiant — partially funded by Rollin and Corby Soles. Investing in a state-of-the-art mobile bottling unit, coupled with a no-frills warehouse operation replete with a gyropalette for riddling and an assembly unit for disgorging, topping, corking, caging and labeling, Radiant provides Oregon winemakers the sparkling infrastructure without the costly capital outlay. “This is coming up on year six of the Radiant Sparkling Wine Project,” says Davis. “I started with a number of people thrown together very quickly in 2013. That doubled the next year, and then doubled again.” He reveals he’s somewhat surpassed his goal regarding clientele, with future success measured in other ways. “I see smaller, more natural, organic growth, as my clients feel comfortable about their own production and their own sales,” Davis explains. “Eventually, someone’s going to grow to a point where commercially it makes sense for them to buy their own equipment, and I’ll mark that day as a sign of my success.” Not wanting to give up his winemaker’s hat, Davis, in 2013, also participated in a collaboration called Lytle-Barnett with Andy Lytle, Antony Beck and consulting winemaker Pieter “Bubbles” Ferreira of Graham Beck. Davis found the fruit, made the base wine, and bottled the blanc de noirs, brut and brut rosé, all pending release. Making bubbles is not for the weary. “You have to be passionate about it [sparkling wine] because it is more work and a longer pay-off,” Davis says. “It’s more nerve-racking than still wine, so you have to be dedicated from the get-go to do this. You also have to be on top of your game. You can’t short-cut it. You can’t cut corners. You can’t be lackadaisical about it, or else, it won’t turn out.” Radiant impacts a number of Oregon sparkling wine projects, including Chemeketa Community College Wine Studies Program. The Willamette Valley college first integrated sparkling wine production into their curriculum two years ago. “This ranges all the way from discussions of partial pressures in wine chemistry to all parts of the production process in our wine production series,” explains Scott Dwyer, program chair and winemaking instructor. “Sparkling wine interest and sales are increasing daily, and our job is to create educated and skilled members of the wine industry.” Dwyer acknowledges the local wine industry, former winemaking instructor Barney Watson and Davis for contributing valuable resources, time and expertise to the program. “When I came on board here, there were bottles on tirage still from 2009, 2010 and 2011,” says Dwyer. “This gave us the ability to start teaching all the components of the process immediately and helped show students that sparkling production isn’t necessarily limited to larger wineries with massive equipment budgets.” The college recently gained international recognition when it hosted the 2018 Sparkling Symposium at their Northwest Wine Studies Center, featuring keynote speaker Peter Liem, author of “Champagne.” The biannual event allowed students to showcase a clonal variation experiment in base wine to participants. “Oregon sparkling is both challenging and exciting to me,” concedes Dwyer, “because of the unseen potential. It’s exciting to be a part of it all and to see when it will all tip.” For some, méthode Champenoise constitutes a means of self — and site — expression. Anne Amie Vineyards winemaker Thomas Houseman always wanted to make sparkling wine but held back due to associated costs and logistical hurdles. However, he believed that Anne Amie’s 12 Oaks Estate on Chehalem Mountain, a cool vineyard with great acidity, presented the perfect site for bubbles. “I prepared a file with all the details in case the subject ever came up, but kept my mouth shut,” says Houseman. “In 2011, Dr. Pamplin [Anne Amie’s proprietor] came to me and asked me if I’d like to make sparkling wine. I said, “Of course,” and showed him my folder with all the details hammered out. The rest is history.” Since 2015, Anne Amie has hosted Bubbles Fest, a two-day consumer event held every February centered on Oregon sparkling wine. In 2018, the winery added a technical symposium for sparkling producers. “The idea is to do for sparkling wine what the Steamboat Pinot Noir Conference did for Pinot Noir, giving us a forum to share our trials, our successes and our failures,” explains Houseman. Houseman believes community drives the success of Oregon sparkling wine, as it did Pinot Noir. “Our strength lies in our ability to help one another,” he says. “Eight years into making sparkling wine, I can attest to that. We were helped by those who came before us, and I am there to help those who want to follow in our footsteps.” For Shane Moore of Gran Moraine in Yamhill-Carlton AVA, “sparkling production is a bit of an ideological twist for me. In still wine production, I generally try to throw numbers out the window and follow wherever the vineyard is leading me.” Moore also employs Radiant for bottling. Of the four vintages completed so far in Oregon, Moore considers 2017 his favorite. “I think it’s because we got to hang the fruit out there a bit later,” Moore says, “and the wines have a lot more electricity, as well as depth.” Ribbon Ridge proprietor and winemaker James Frey of Trisaetum developed a natural appreciation for site-specific grower Champagne from his own production of single-vineyard Pinot Noir and Riesling. “When Andrew Davis started Radiant Sparkling Wine Company, and provided the logistical support for many of us to really explore what sites, soils and clones can produce amazing sparkling wines here in Oregon, I jumped in with both feet in 2014.” Frey produces four different sparkling wines under the Pashey label, an homage to his maternal grandmother, a striking, dark-haired British ‘traveler,’ or gypsy, whose image graces the muselet atop every bottle. “Oregon has always attracted entrepreneurial winemakers who want to push themselves, and others, to find what wines are truly best suited to this climate and these soils,” says Frey. “The collegial spirit among winemakers here in the Willamette Valley is clearly speeding up the learning process with sparkling winemaking. It’s an exciting time to be making wine here.” Sokol Blosser co-president and winemaker Alex Sokol Blosser of Dayton admits family feeds his foray into sparkling wine. “Growing up, we had bubbles for special occasions, and felt there was always something mysterious and fanciful about Champagne,” shares Sokol Blosser. “When my sister, Alison, and I took the reins from our parents, we knew we wanted to put a stake in the ground as an outstanding house of sparkling wine in Willamette Valley.” “Our favorite site for our bubbles program is Blossom Ridge Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills,” says Robin Hawley, Sokol Blosser’s laid-back, lead sparkling winemaker. “It sits in a nice little bowl that the Van Duzer Corridor effect helps keep cool and the fruit clean.” Sokol Blosser contends sparkling production has improved all aspects of their winemaking. “Carbonation exposes everything about the wine, and makes the fruit pop more, as well as any sweetness — but on the bad side, it showcases any wine imperfections,” he confesses. “You see everything — for better or worse. This has forced us to bring more precision to our winemaking to ensure we get the flavors we want in the bottle.” The sparkling wine industry favors those flirting beyond the traditional fizz framework, too. While growing in popularity, Oregon Pét Nat producers like Dan Rinke of Johan Vineyards in Rickreall and Kate Norris of Division Wine Company in Portland, still remain a select tribe. “I made a traditional method sparkling wine in 2010, and I was looking for a way to make a sparkling wine the same way that I farm, which is using Biodynamic methods,” says Rinke. “That means minimal additions to the wine. No cultured yeast, no fining, no filtration, no yeast nutrients, no sugar and no sulfur. A true ‘natural wine.’” Since Rinke’s first vintage working with Pét-Nat in 2014, he’s expanded this program to include Pinot Noir, Melon de Bourgogne and even plans to do a Grüner Veltliner Pét-Nat in 2018. “Pét Nats are tricky because what we are looking for at Johan are some ripe flavors but lower alcohol and high acid, whereas with conventional sparkling wine, you’re looking for acidity and low alcohol with some flavor.” Champagne importers Terry Theise and Vintage ’59 introduced Bobby Rowett of Mellen Meyer to the world’s finest bottles of boutique Champagne while he worked for them. Obsessed by Champagne’s nuances and variety, Rowett wondered, “Why weren’t wineries making sparkling wine in that style in the United States?” This question led him to conclude, “Willamette Valley is the place to make our contribution to the world of premium sparkling wine.” Rowett sources Biodynamic fruit for his sparkling, in part, from grower and producer Johan Vineyards. “While we are inspired by Champagne and other great sparkling wine regions in the world,” Rowett says, “I think it’s essential we focus on making these wines in our own way. This is our unique corner of the wine world.” Sometimes confused with its famous concert-going cousin, The Gorge in eastern Washington, Oregon’s Columbia Gorge AVA scrims both sides of the Columbia River with wind-swept, hard-scrabble, moody drama. Scoured, uplifted and layered by epoch-old geologic events, it turns out this vertiginous fulcrum between the Willamette and Columbia valleys proves an ideal crucible for making some of Oregon’s most compelling bubbles. Part of this region’s success rests on the unassuming shoulders of vineyard manager and winery owner Lonnie Wright, and his dynamic daughter Sierra Wright of The Pines 1852 in The Dalles. Lonnie Wright moved to the Columbia Gorge in 1981 after marrying a local girl. Fresh from a three-year stint planting vines for Columbia Crest in Patterson, Washington, Wright immediately found work helping restore what proved to be one of Oregon’s oldest vineyards, The Pines, a site planted in the 1890s to old-vine Zinfandel. Over time, he developed a successful vineyard management company while leasing, expanding and, eventually, purchasing The Pines. “In the late 1990s, we started seeing wineries come here,” says Wright. “For years and years, I had sold fruit to wineries out of this area, so that was probably the biggest thing when we started to see wineries show up in this area because the winery is what’s going to give the area its reputation.” Convinced of the region’s potential, as well as the quality of their fruit, the Wrights established The Pines 1852 winery in 2001. In 2005, the Columbia Gorge AVA was approved. That same year, Sierra returned from college to assist, and The Pines 1852 built the first tasting room in downtown Hood River. Finally, in 2009, after much prodding, Sierra convinced her father to venture into sparkling wine. A pragmatic man, the decision wasn’t easy. “Everything in sparkling is more expensive. Everything,” Lonnie Wright says with a shake of the head. “The bottle. The cork. The cage. The label. Also, if you have someone that’s doing some contract winemaking.” Wright initially contracted with Chris Berg of Roots Wine Company for their 2009 and 2010 vintages but logistical issues with the bottler led them to Radiant Sparkling Wine Company in 2012; the mobile bottler also completed their 2016 vintage. The 2016 is still on tirage. Infrastructure and aging account for only part of the total cost. “The taxes that you have to pay on [sparkling wine] are a lot more expensive than you have to pay for other wine,” he explains. “It’s considered a federal luxury tax that you have to pay.” For Sierra Wright, despite the expense, Columbia Gorge AVA sparkling wine offers a chance for area winemakers to highlight their unique styles while offering consumers greater diversity. “We grow so many different kinds of grapes, and we have so many different styles of winemaking. With sparkling, that’s no exception. So you can’t just say ‘Oh, yeah, the Gorge sparkling is like this,’ because we’re all very different.” Ultimately, sparkling wine chooses the winemaker. Analemma Wines winemaker Steven Thompson and partner Kris Fade moved to Mosier from Walla Walla, Washington, in 2010. Veterans of tending Bordeaux varietals and Syrah from The Rocks District of Milton Freewater within the context of “normal” growing cycles, their first vintage in the Columbia Gorge proved anything but usual. “When the vines hadn’t even flowered by the second week of July, I was like ‘Oh, wow!’ says Thompson. “There’s no way we’re going to make it to harvest, to maturity.” Instead of panicking, the two listened patiently, and learned. They discovered Atavus Vineyard, the 50-year-old site they leased and managed above White Salmon, Washington, contained the Mariafeld clone from Switzerland, a Pinot Noir suited to cold climates. They also realized making sparkling wine was the original vision of the vineyard’s founder, Charles Henderson. “We thought, ‘OK, we’re hands-off here. This is what we’re doing.’” recounts Thompson. “I believe this element of listening, and respecting the variables we walked into, helped create the Atavus Blanc de Noirs into what it is today.” The slight, soft-spoken Thompson imbues a meditative approach to each aspect of sparkling wine production, save riddling and disgorgement, which he entrusts to The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company. “Because that’s what it’s about, right?” Thompson affirms. “It’s about giving your attention. We are contemplative and very intentional in our practices. And, ultimately, our goal is to provide a Zen-like experience for the consumer. When they share the wine with friends or family, it stops people in their revelry just for a minute to go, ‘Wow, this is something special.’” Translucent golden hue with persistent perling and rich, cashmere-like mousse that unlocks subtle, intoxicating aromas of marzipan, brioche and almond blossom.

Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell's Brycen Seymore and defensive coordinator Keith Styles talk on the sideline during last week's loss to Hickory. The Titans host St. Stephens in the annual homecoming game tonight (Friday, 7:30). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. The McDowell Titans experienced some smooth sailing at the start of the football season, winning their first two games in statistically dominant fashion. Then came the hurricane season, and the waters have been choppy ever since. But the Titans will try and right the ship tonight when they host the St. Stephens Indians in the annual homecoming game (7:30). McDowell (0-1 Northwestern 3A/4A Conference, 2-3 overall) is coming off a 31-0 loss to Hickory in the conference opener last Friday and has dropped three in a row. The Titans’ last win came at Avery more than a month ago (Aug. 24). On paper at least, McDowell should match up fairly well with tonight’s opponent. The Indians (0-1, 1-4) have had their share of struggles as well, and like McDowell, were shut out in the NWC opener last Friday. Freedom blanked St. Stephens 49-0, handing the Indians their third straight defeat. Last season’s game was tight throughout. McDowell held a 10-7 lead late in the first half, but a punt snap rolled out of the end zone for a safety and St. Stephens added a touchdown on the ensuing possession to hold a 16-10 lead at the break. The Indians ended up on the long end of a 19-17 score in the first meeting ever between the two schools. Although the Indians have had their share of difficulties, they’re certainly not without weapons. Sophomore quarterback Connor Williams (6-4, 190) is 42-of-94 passing for 553 yards and five touchdowns with 11 interceptions. Receiver Zach Lee (6-4, 190) has been Williams’ primary target, catching 23 passes for 437 yards and three scores.

Andrew,Davis,b'1692',http://www.oregonwinepress.com/wine-on-the-go,"By Hilary Berg Our society loves its conveniences. Groceries delivered to your door, meal kit subscriptions, renting movies via your TV, eyeglass frames to try on at home, coffee drive-thrus. The list goes on and on, and on. In the wine industry, convenience translates to other amenities, such as wine clubs’ home delivery (see page 26) or canned wine — which we recently covered. Behind the scenes, one of the greatest game-changers is the mobile unit. Owning and operating a winery can be cost-prohibitive. It takes a fair number of expensive equipment to make your favorite Pinot Blanc or Albariño (see page 14). Processing the fruit requires sorting lines and de-stemmers, presses and pumps. But, like I said, mobile companies are now here to make wine production more affordable and so much easier. For example, Jon Casteel, the youngest of the Bethel Heights Casteel clan, saw a need and filled it, literally. With an eye on a tractor-trailer, he made an incredibly savvy business decision in 2006: He started his own mobile bottling unit. Twelve years later, he’s serviced wineries all across the Valley, and now owns an on-site bottling facility, offering even more options to his ever-growing client list. Filtering wine. Who knew this was such a tricky task? Winemakers, raise your hands. Companies like Willamette Cross Flow offer reliable, affordable mobile filtration, alleviating headaches of cellar workers throughout the state. A service that’s a clear winner. And now, one of the most expensive and time-consuming endeavors any winery can undertake, traditional sparkling, has been innovated into a mobile service using the latest equipment and making the highest quality bubbles on the market — if you’ve never tasted founder Andrew Davis’ sparkling, Lytle-Barnett, you are truly missing out (see page 30). Although not on the road, other innovations are happening, too, in the vineyard, in the lab, in the distribution market (see page 40), etc. In the end, all these modernizations lead to the same goal: Quality wine from a healthy market in which new ideas and tradition balance for a perfect delicious blend. Now that’s something worth waiting for in the winding-around-the-parking-lot line that’s now spilling out into the street. Coffee, not so much.

The series comes on the heels of a study that examined one major sector initiative and found that eight out of 10 nonprofits that implemented efforts to collect feedback went on to make changes to better serve clients. The SSIR series The Power of Feedback, which is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, will feature philanthropy leaders such as Fred Blackwell of The San Francisco Foundation, Pamela Norley of Fidelity Charitable and Kathy Reich of the Ford Foundation; nonprofit leaders such as Frank Daidone from the Nurse Family Partnership; sector experts such as the Center for Effective Philanthropy's Phil Buchanan and Listen for Good's Valerie Threlfall; corporate leaders such as SurveyMonkey CEO Zander Lurie; and clients of services related to housing, employment, and more.

SSIR plans to invite a conversation with readers via social media with the hashtag #FeedbackEmpowers. Listening to beneficiaries—the end users and clients of direct services provided by nonprofit organizations and supported by charitable donors—has been rated as one of the most promising practices for improving the impact of social change organizations, and more donors and nonprofits are adopting the approach. Through Listen for Good, the signature initiative of the donor collaborative Fund for Shared Insight, funders and nonprofits work together to build high-quality feedback loops with nonprofit clients. More than 200 nonprofits have received Listen for Good grants, totaling more than $9.4 million since 2016 and elevating the voices of more than 90,000 nonprofit clients nationwide. As of last week, when the latest round of Listen for Good grants were announced, the total number of funders involved with the collaborative effort is nearly 100. An evaluation of the initiative's effectiveness finds that nearly eight out of 10 organizations that participated are translating insights from the feedback collected into changes to better serve clients. Among those: In addition, the analysis suggests that the implementation of high-quality feedback loops can also advance organizations' equity, diversity, and inclusion work by providing clients a seat at the table at various stages of the decision-making process and allowing them to shape the services that benefit their communities.

Michael,Gordon,b'1691',http://www.ragtrader.com.au/news/best-and-less-owners-rebrand-amid-controversy,"The move comes as its global parent company, Steinhoff International, weathers legal and financial woes over a highly-publicised accounting scandal. Greenlit Brands will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steinhoff International. No decision has been made concerning the separation from ownership by Steinhoff International and the Group said it will ""continue to carefully and methodically consider the various options in due course."" Greenlit Brands operates a number of homewares and apparel retailers, including Harris Scarfe, Postie and Best & Less. It is also the local operator for Debenhams. The company employs more than 10,000 people with 640 stores across Australia and New Zealand. The Greenlit Brands new name and logo were developed from within the Group and selected following a group-wide voting process. Greenlit Brands Group CEO, Michael Ford welcomed the change. “We have great brands which all originate in Australasia, that are loved by Australian and New Zealand consumers. Our retail brands cover the good, better and best spectrum in the household and general merchandise sectors. ""We also have our own manufacturing, logistics and supply chain operations which provide support to our retail brands. We look forward to building on this portfolio for our customers under the Greenlit Brands corporate identity.” Refinancing Package Greenlit Brands has secured a new financing package with a syndicate of three Australian-based banks comprising ANZ, NAB and Deutsche Bank. The package includes a Senior Facility of A$256m with a tenor through to October 2020. Greenlit Brands’ existing intergroup debt with entities of Steinhoff International Holdings NV (‘Steinhoff International’) has been subordinated to the Senior Facilities with longer tenor than bank debt, and existing parent company guarantees under the former local banking facilities have now been released. The refinancing package underlines that Greenlit Brands operates independently from its parent group, Steinhoff International, in terms of its working capital requirements and debt funding needs. Greenlit Brands CFO Michael Gordon said the package is essential to operations. “Putting in place longer term funding arrangements for Greenlit Brands is a major step forward for our Group. “We are pleased to have secured the longer term for our bank facilities with our local banking partners, which has been struck on normal commercial terms and interest rates. “This important initiative provides our 10,000 employees, our suppliers and our business partners across all of our respective brands with certainty about the Group and is indicative of the strength and independence of our Group in Australasia,” he said.

Phillip,Frost,b'1690',https://news.fiu.edu/2018/09/your-brain-is-a-work-of-art/126502,"What do you see when you look at this image? Tomás R. Guilarte asks his 8-year-old daughter Sofia this very question, curious about her young mind’s interpretation of this and several other pictures. They are all images of brain cells in culture he has brought home from work. Guilarte is dean of Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work and an expert in the fields of neuroscience and neurotoxicology. He is also a professor of environmental health sciences and cognitive neuroscience and imaging. Sofia tells him she sees a green octopus with bright blue eyes (upper left corner). He shows her a couple more, which Sofia says remind her of: 1) a galaxy, spreading itself infinitely 2) an orchid, due to its long curving stem, and 3) the roots of a tree, veining deep into the ground. 1) “A galaxy” 2) “An orchid” 3) “The roots of a tree.” Guilarte prepared the same activity for an attentive audience at “Beauty and the Brain: Connecting Art to Science,” as part of the Mixtape Mondays lecture series at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum. Mixtape Mondays features FIU faculty across disciplines, welcoming them to present their innovative research and studies in relation to art and the museum’s collection. Guilarte shared his research on the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants – such as heavy metals – on neurological and mental health. Presented with the colorful images of the cells, the room-filled audience gave similarly imaginative answers. Some said the “orchid” looked like a “chicken with a very long neck,” and the “roots” were reminiscent of the aerial view of a cityscape with its twinkling “lights,” which are actually synapses. Guilarte was excited to integrate art into the lecture, easing the understanding of these concepts by connecting notions that are seemingly unrelated. “I’m very visual. I see pictures, and just like the ones I showed, I begin to see shapes, animals and objects,” he said. “Providing an idea of the shapes and colors living within the organization and structure of the brain is a great way to communicate these ideas and connect art to science.” Tomás R. Guilarte This exercise, like any puzzle, is an excellent workout for the brain, one that Guilarte says promotes neuroplasticity (the creation of new neural connections) and neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells). And other studies also agree, proving that regularly practicing art enhances brain connectivity. But keeping our brains healthy is a difficult task when considering the cluster of harmful compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis. “We live in a soup of chemicals, we have to minimize our exposure and properly feed our brains,” said Guilarte. Because our brain’s susceptibility to injury from exposure to environmental pollutants is remarkably high, it is vital to prevent the loss of neurons and promote the growth of new ones. “As we age, neurons die, and many neurodegenerative diseases – like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s – are principally diseases of aging,” said Guilarte. “But we are beginning to understand how these pollutants can initiate and/or accelerate the disease.” Though the traditional route of adopting a balanced diet and exercise regimen along with not smoking is still highly recommended, Guilarte emphasized the somewhat unconventional yet impactful role of art – both its consumption and creation – in the birth of new neurons and their integration into brain circuits that can enhance learning and memory. “And though genetics matter, it appears art is exceptional for our minds and our longevity,” he said. So, the next time you stop by a museum, keep a few things in mind about art: it improves brain function, brain wave patterns, fine-motor skills, creativity, and our social and emotional development.

(NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) and Opko Health, were largely responsible for the declines in the Tel Aviv 35 Index in the past three sessions. Teva fell 4.5% today, making it a 10% drop in three days, and bringing the company's market cap down to NIS 85 billion. Opko Health fell 6.5% today, for a 17% drop over the three days. Its market cap is now at NIS 7.9 billion. Perrigo, the third largest pharma stock on the Tel Aviv 35 list, remained fairly flat over the same period. RELATED ARTICLES IBI sees annual sales of $1.6-2.4 billion for Teva migraine drug FDA approves Teva migraine drug Analysts see growth on Teva's horizon Still too soon to talk about Teva's recovery document.write(ad_handler.google_div(article_banner_object)) The falls in Teva are attributed to two possible causes. The leading factor is apparently the recommendation by a panel of the European Medicines Agency to approve Eli Lilly's migraine treatment. Eli Lilly's drug works in a similar way to Teva's migraine drug, which was recently approved for sale and which is considered one of the two great hopes for the future of the company's innovative business, alongside its drug for Tourette syndrome. The migraine prevention market has started to become very crowded, and the race to the top is close. The first drug in the category, from Novartis and Amgen, was approved in May, and was given a low market penetration price. Teva's product was approved for sale in the US two weeks ago, and not enough time has passed to assess the difference in the pace of market adoption of the two products. Eli Lilly's product should be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the next month or two, and the positive recommendation by the European panel raises the probability of it being approved in the US. A fourth product by a smaller company called Alder has passed a Phase III clinical trial but there is still no target date for a response by the FDA. Against the background of the approval of its migraine product two weeks ago, Teva's share price rose 12% within a few days, but it has now subsided to the level it was at before the approval. This is a frequent occurrence for pharma companies that receive a drug approval that was expected: the initial enthusiasm passes, anyone who was only waiting for the event exits the stock, while those looking to the longer term start to take into account not just the glad tidings of the approval but also the challenges of the marketplace, which in this particular case are considerable. A competitor to Copaxone? The second factor possibly contributing to the weakness in Teva is the report by a new contender in the multiple sclerosis treatment market, TG Therapeutics, of good results in a Phase II trial for its product. The results look very promising, although the trial was carried out on just 22 patients, and it will be some time before the product reaches the market, if at all. It may be that by that time Teva's dependence on multiple sclerosis (with its flagship original drug Copaxone) will substantially reduce, but still, TG Therapeutics looks like an interesting potential competitor. As for Opko, the company is still under the cloud of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe of Opko CEO Phillip Frost and of the company itself on suspicion of share price manipulation. The affair broke on September 7, and since then the company's market cap has dipped 35%. It recovered slightly on September 14 when Frost publicly rejected the accusations against him and spoke out against the SEC for not having requested his response before revealing the investigation. The correction was short-lived, however, and investors now await legal developments.
