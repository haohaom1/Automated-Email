Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 12:01 pm EDITOR: In the news, opioids. OMG! We have a crisis! Let the politicians talk, get thier picture in the paper with doctors. Opioids kill more than vehicular accidents ... wait -- hold the presses. Alcohol, you know that pesky advertising and lobbying giant, their products kill more than 87,000 people per year. Where are the congressional reps getting pictures in the paper? Where are the cities and states suing the spirits industry? I believe the opioid crisis is real and I believe if we talk about it enough we won't talk about a $20 trillion debt, trillion-dollar deficits, $200 trillion unfunded liabilities, broken VA health, and generally a broken society. Keep talking, keep the pictures rolling, everyone follow the pied piper's music. In the meantime, we in health care will continue to try to find real solutions to pain management, disease control, addiction issues, be it alcohol, tobacco, legal or illegal drugs. I am not in favor of the return of Prohibition of alcohol; nor should tobacco users be treated worse than a heroin user. Ironically, many cities have safe rooms that are medically staffed. These rooms allow a safe drug use experience. Vital signs are monitored before, during and after the injections. These cities, including some in Kentucky, give out new needles. The medical staff are standing by with Narcan to reverse an accidental overdose. Yet a smoker is treated as a pariah in modern society and can't smoke in a park. Just beam me up.

Steve,Cummings,770,http://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/4674/brits-at-the-giro-ditalia-whos-on-the-start-list,"Sign up for our newsletter Secondary menu Sections The 101st Giro d'Italia will kick off this time next week with a short individual time trial around the streets of Jerusalem, Isreal, making history as the first Grand Tour stage to take place outside of the shores of Europe. The 176 man field will roll off the start ramp one by one, pitting themselves against the technical course in search of the first pink jersey in the race. Among those riding the Grande Partenza will just four British riders, all of whom will be racing for completely varying goals. Chief among those will be Chris Froome (Team Sky), who despite the mountain of controversy surrounding his presence, will be looking to make history with three consecutive Grand Tour victories. While four riders may seem like a poor turn out considering the success of British cycling over recent years - away from Italy at least - it's an improvement on 2017 when the UK provided just three riders and 2016 when not a single British rider took to the start line of the Giro. Below we take a closer look at the British riders heading to the Giro and what we can expect from them The spotlight will be on Chris Froome from the moment he arrives in Jerusalem to the moment he finishes - if he reaches the finish - in Rome three weeks later. Controversy has surrounded the four-time Tour de France champion since his adverse analytical finiding for salbutamol at last year's Vuelta a Espana. Many have argued he shouldn't race for pink, many have said he should and regardless of your standing, it appears that Froome will be on the start line next Friday. This brewing investigation into whether Froome did take too many puffs of his inhaler will have no doubt affected his build up, both mentally and physically. His below-par performances at the Tirreno-Adriatico and Ruta del Sol acted as testament to that. Yet, at last week's Tour of the Alps, Froome began to show form, attacking on multiple stages before taking fourth on General Classification. Chances are the 32-year-old will enter the race slightly undercooked with the hope of riding into form for the tougher stages later in the race and then holding the form through to his Tour defence in July. Cyclist suspects Froome will be there or thereabouts before turning the screw on Stage 16's 34.2km individual time trial from Trento to Rovereto. If Froome is to win pink, he will most likely do it in the final week making use of his strong team that looks to include the likes of David De La Cruz, Wout Poels and Sergio Henao. Cyclist predicts that Froome will go well until Stage 14 to the fearsome Monte Zoncolan. The steep gradients may unravel the Team Sky man and tee up an underdog towards pink a week later. The Yates twins are the two hottest prospects for British General Classification riding. Both Simon and Adam have been on a steady rise to the top and both have impressed at Grand Tours already, both winning the best young rider jersey at the Tour de France. While Adam will be returning to the Tour in July, Simon will be forming part of a double headed attack for Mitchelton-Scott with Esteban Chaves at the Giro. How Yates will perform at the Giro, however, is a mystery. The 25-year-old has performed well this season with stage victories at Paris-Nice and Volta a Catalunya, finishing second on GC at the former, losing the lead of the race on the final day in Nice. Form should not be an issue. Having never ridden the Giro is perhaps where the doubts lie for Yates. The race is embroiled with unpredictability and chaos, something that it takes a few attempts to usually get used to. With that in mind, logic would suggest teammate Chaves has a better chance of victory having finished second in 2016. Regardless, Yates should have what it takes to place comfortably among the top 10. Quietly, Mitchelton-Scott have formed a deceptively strong team around their two GC hopefuls. The acquisition of former Team Sky super domestique Mikel Nieve was somewhat of a coup and Roman Kreuziger had a mightily impressive Ardennes Classics campaign. Young Aussie Jack Haig is improving race by race and is a true exciting prospect while Svein Tuft, Sam Bewley and Chris Juul-Jensen are tried and tested Grand Tour riders. Cyclist considers Mitchelton-Scott to have one of the strongest teams in the race. Simon Yates should profit from that and clinch another top 10 Grand Tour result. From the top of the General Classification list to most likely nearer the bottom, Alex Dowsett will be making his first start at a Grand Tour since the 2015 Tour de France after making the Winter switch from Movistar to Katusha-Alpecin. Obviously, the rider is not looking towards the fight for General Classification for himself. What Dowsett will be interested in is that opening day's time trial around Jerusalem. Rolling but with nothing too testing, the short 9.7km ride against the clock presents the Essex local with a career-defining chance to grab the pink jersey. If all goes right, there is a very realistic chance of Dowsett winning the stage. His biggest obstacle will be the world class competition. Rohan Dennis (BMC Racing) seems unstoppable in a prologue, Victor Campenaerts (Lotto-Soudal) is strong over this distance and there is even Dowsett's teammate Tony Martin. Beyond the opening day, the Giro will be a matter of finishing and looking for breakaway stage success for the 29-year-old and a dig at Stage 16's individual time trial to Rovereto. Cyclist remembers that the last time Dowsett rode the Giro he won the Stage 8 time trial, beating compatriot Bradley Wiggins. But a repeat of this seems unlikely. Hooped earring, lives in Pamplona away from the pro scene and spent two years with Spanish ProContinental team Caja-Rural, Carthy is the embodiment of hipster, except on him it seems kind of cool. The Preston-born rider is a natural mountain goat and will form part of an exciting EF-Drapac team built around Canadian Michael Woods, whose own possibilities are an unknown. Carthy's form coming into the Giro has been decent with 13th at Volta a Catalunya including an impressive showing on the summit finish of La Molina. General Classification is not the goal but left to his own devices, Carthy is clearly one of the most talented climbers in the peloton and the insidiously steep nature of Italian climbs could be a perfect playground for the 23-year-old. Carthy raced the Giro last year without any notable results but undoubtedly came away from the three week race a wiser racer. Hopefully we will see the lightweight climber towards the pointy end of some of the Giro's toughest stages with even the possibility of a stage win. Cyclist will be keeping a keen eye on Carthy's progress throughout the Giro. 2018 - Chris Froome, Simon Yates, Alex Dowsett, Hugh Carthy 2017 - Geraint Thomas, Hugh Carthy, Adam Yates 2016 - No riders 2015 - No riders 2014 - Ben Swift 2013 - David Millar, Adam Blythe, Steve Cummings, Alex Dowsett, Mark Cavendish, Bradley Wiggins 2012 - Jeremy Hunt, Ian Stannard, Mark Cavendish, Peter Kennaugh, Geraint Thomas 2011 - Mark Cavendish, Adam Blythe, Russell Downing, Peter Kennaugh, David Millar 2010 - Daniel Lloyd, Adam Blythe, Charlie Wegelius, Bradley Wiggins, Steve Cummings, Chris Froome 2009 - Chris Froome, Jeremy Hunt, Daniel Lloyd, David Millar, Bradley Wiggins, Ian Stannard, Charlie Wegelius, Mark Cavendish, Ben Swift Vitus Pro Cycling launches for 2019 season, and here’s their new bike.

Breakaway Music Festival 2018 Announces Full Lineup For Nashville Harry Styles: Live on Tour (Review) Andrew Davis (vocals and guitar), Daniel Busheikin (keyboards), Mike Searle (Bass) and Evan Lewis (guitar) – released their first full-length self-titled album in 2015, a collection of dense and intricate pop music under the gauzy veil of krautrock and psychedelia. It was mixed by the elusive Dave Newfeld (Broken Social Scene, Weaves) and mastered by Gavin Gardiner (The Wooden Sky). Departing from the dreamy psyche pop of their first album, Grounders’ newest project Coffee & Jam see the band veer into dark and unsettling sonic territories, crafting quirky vignettes that reflect their exhaustive touring of North America. Through scraping synths and jangly guitars, Coffee & Jam oozes with self-sabotage, anti-authoritarian rebellion and that twenty-something’s sense of the world passing by. Grounders has shared the stage with Alvvays, Born Ruffians, Nap Eyes, Diet Cig, Widowspeak and more. They’ve played festivals including SXSW, CMJ, NXNE, CMW , Sled Island, Rifflandia, Tomorrow Never Knows, and others. Also their music has appeared on the soundtrack of the homoerotic indie game Rinse And Repeat and has been played for the studio audience of The Price Is Right (Drew Carey is a fan). Merry Christmas Ya Filthy Animal: Your Prime Christmas Playlist Backstage with Big Gigantic: what’s next for the electronic jazz duo Odesza Returns With Deluxe Edition of ‘A Moment Apart’ Grounders graced us with an inside look at their inner workings. Check out the witty interview below: Latifah Obaid: Tell me about how you guys got started, what’s the origin story of Grounders? Grounders: Dan and Searle were living in Chinatown behind Grossman’s Tavern when I met them. I asked them to play on some songs I was working on. 3 months later we played our first show at a nautical themed venue/restaurant called the Boat in Toronto. LO: Has Toronto living had any influence on your music, creative energy, or just helped you guys in your musical careers in any way? If so, how? G: Toronto is a very skronky town. The kijiji buy and sell game here is very strong. I would not have half the Boss pedals I have today if it weren’t for all the Yonge and Eglinton daddy’s liquidating their collections. LO: Tell me about your most recent album “Coffee & Jam” What are some of the central messages of the album? What inspired it? G: Coffee & Jam came mostly out of some jams we had while we were on tour. We set up in a house we rented somewhere North of Sacramento that had a very post-apocalyptic vibe to it. Tons of dead grass and trucks with bullet holes in them. It was like the Compton of wine country. That’s where some of the futuristic loner cowboy themes came out of. LO: What’s you’re favorite track off “Coffee & Jam” and why? G: Scum For You. I was writing from the perspective of a guy who only eats at gas stations and only smokes clove ciggies. A sensitive man and a real piece of garbage. LO: What kind of experience do you guys work to create for listeners when you’re making music? G: Wetness, spiciness, thoughtfulness. LO: What has been one of your biggest challenges that you’ve faced in your time as artists thus far? G: McDonald’s or Wendy’s. LO: Who are your musical influences (modern or classic)? G: Devo The Cure Silver Jews Talking Heads Waylon Jennings Sleepy La Beef LO: If you could collaborate with any artist, dead or alive, who would you choose and why? G: Shaq. He’s got an album, movies, video games and lord knows how many championship rings. A real pro at marketing and diversifying and that’s what success is all about….please manage us Shaq, I love you. LO: What has been your most rewarding or satisfying moment thus far as musicians?

Michael,Gordon,765,http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article209626854.html,"By Michael Gordon April 26, 2018 10:09 AM Citing a technicality, the U.S. Department of Education has quickly closed an investigation into whether an N.C. college discriminated against a former student in part because she is white. Last month, the department's Office of Civil Rights announced that it was opening a probe of the student's assertions that she had been mistreated by Lees-McRae College on the basis of her sex and race. Her complaint to the OCR was filed in November. Less than three weeks later, the same office wrote to Lees-McRae President Barry Buxton that the investigation had been dismissed. The reason: The allegation of sex discrimination already is included in a lawsuit the former student filed against the Banner Elk school in March. The OCR told Buxton that it dropped the racial-discrimination part of the probe because while the allegation is not included in the lawsuit, it could have been.

Nonetheless, the former student's attorney said federal officials are bypassing a chance to fix a significant problem at Lees-McRae. ""The civil suit will address the wrongs done to our client,"" Durham lawyer Kerry Sutton told the Observer. ""By failing to proceed with their investigation, OCR has lost an opportunity to address the systemic problems in the Lees McRae Title IX process. That's unfortunate for the rest of the Lees-McRae community."" Raleigh attorney Katie Hartzog, who represents Lees-McRae, said the college should not have been investigated in the first place. ""This is a dispute between two students,"" she said. ""The college is confident it ... continues to afford both students a fair opportunity to be heard."" The legal fight arose from a 2017 sexual harassment complaint the former student filed against three of her peers. The accused students were either African-American or Latino and included a member of a prominent varsity sports team. After a hearing last year, a campus misconduct committee ruled that the male students did not violate the school's sexual harassment policies. Sutton says the decision drove her client off campus and led to a suicide attempt. In the federal lawsuit she filed last year, the former student claims the college's acted out of ""an improper fear"" that her allegations would spur a racial controversy across the 1,000-student campus, which is 120 miles northwest of Charlotte. She accused the school of violating its own Title IX hearing rules to accommodate the family and supporters of the varsity athlete, who is African American. After the female student appealed, the committee's ruling was overturned and a new hearing ordered. It has not been rescheduled. The Associated Press December 04, 2018 01:09 PM The National Republican Congressional Committee says it was hit with a ""cyber intrusion"" during the 2018 midterm campaign, and the breach has been reported to the FBI. #ReadLocal For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today.

Robert,Burke,763,https://www.mycitizensnews.com/news/2018/04/borough-backs-121-4m-budget-proposal/,"Naugatuck officials review the proposed 2018-19 budget during a meeting Monday night at Town Hall. –LUKE MARSHALL NAUGATUCK — Borough officials backed a budget proposal for 2018-19 that increases spending by more than $1 million but is expected to reduce the mill rate slightly. The Joint Boards of Mayor and Burgesses and Finance Monday night approved a $121.4 million budget proposal to send to a public hearing. The budget proposal increases spending by about $1.03 million, or 0.85 percent, over the current budget. The bulk of the spending increase comes in insurance, which is going up $757,723, or 7.1 percent, to $11.4 million due primarily to increases in rates and workers’ compensation. “I think it is a fair budget that takes into account the needs of the taxpayers while making sure we have a strong infrastructure to support the needs of the town,” Board of Finance Chairman Dan Sheridan said. Despite spending going up, officials anticipate the mill rate will decrease by 0.15 mills, or 0.3 percent, to 48.4 mills, based on current revenue projections. A mill is $1 for every $1,000 of assessed property value. Under a 48.4 mill rate, a taxpayer with property assessed at $150,000 would pay $7,260 in taxes, a decrease of $22. Mayor N. Warren “Pete” Hess said the likely decrease in the mill rate comes despite the fact that the borough is expected to receive $3.7 million less from the state than in the current budget. “The fact that we are not only able to hold the mill rate but reduce it slightly and still provide all the services, including paving roads at a much greater clip than in the past, shows that the entire finance board and burgesses did a great job with the budget,” Hess said. The borough offset the loss in state aid and the overall spending increase with increases in other revenues. The biggest chunk comes under general property taxes where officials project the borough will raise more than $3 million in 2018-19 than this fiscal year. There is a projected $1.85 million increase in motor vehicle taxes alone because the state is raising the cap on car taxes from 37 mills to 45 mills. Under the budget proposal, the school budget would stay flat at roughly $61.68 million. Earlier this month, the Board of Education presented a budget that sought an increase of $482,567. The finance board subsequently shaved off more than $166,000 from the request, and on Monday decided not to fund any increase for the school budget. Members of the joint boards raised concerns over the size and frequency of surpluses in the school budget. The school board finished the 2016-17 fiscal year with a budget surplus of $525,681. Even with a flat budget this fiscal year, the school board could have a surplus, officials said. “They said last year that, if they took a big hit from the state to the tune of $1 million, they could absorb it,” Burgess Robert Neth said. Sheridan, who felt there hadn’t been enough transparency with the school budget throughout the years, said any increase would raise the minimum budget requirement. Under state law, the Naugatuck school budget can’t be cut because the borough is an alliance district. “It will be a fixed number forever because it constitutes a new minimum budget requirement. You’ll never be able to drop it below that,” Sheridan said. The decision to keep education funding flat wasn’t unanimous as Hess, Deputy Mayor Laurie Taf Jackson, Burgess Bob Burns, and finance board members Diane Scinto, Sara Euvino and Robert Burke voted against it. This would be the third year in a row the Board of Education hasn’t received an increase in its budget. Another topic of debate among the joint boards was whether to fund the first payment for a new firetruck — $183,333 — under capital projects. The payment in the 2018-19 budget would be the first of three for a new firetruck, which would replace Engine 5 at the Naugatuck Fire Department. The department is also looking to replace a ladder truck in the near future. The trucks are near the end of their lives, according to officials. Most members of the joint boards favored of the purchase. Board of Finance member Andrew Bottinick argued that putting off financing items led to the borough underfunding its pensions for many years and then bonding to correct the error. “That was something we kicked down the road and through the years. I don’t even want to think about how much interest we have had to pay on that bond to make up for the sins of our fathers,” Bottinick said. Euvino agreed, saying the borough would have to face purchasing multiple fire engines at one time if it didn’t begin the process now. “Do you want to buy two engines in 2021? Hell no,” Euvino said. “It is irresponsible, knowing the situation we are in right now, to say in 20 years the finance board is going to have to do this same thing.” The budget will now go to a public hearing on May 14 at 6:30 p.m. at the Board of Education office, 497 Rubber Ave. The joint boards will then meet May 17 to review and adopt the budget.
