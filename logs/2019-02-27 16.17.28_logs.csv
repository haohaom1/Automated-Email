David Willson led the Emory & Henry program for six years. EMORY, Va. – Following a six-year run as the head men’s basketball coach at Emory & Henry College, David Willson is returning to his alma mater to direct the boys basketball program at Memphis University School. In a phone interview Tuesday afternoon, Willson said his decision was based on family considerations and an allegiance to former MUS coach, Jerry Peters. “Coach Peters was a legendary man and extremely successful coach, and he’s probably the biggest reason that I got into the profession,” said Willson, a 1999 MUS graduate. “Most members of my extended family live in Memphis, so that had a lot do with my decision as well. It’s heart-wrenching decision to leave this area, though.” Willson, 38, stressed the family approach with his players at E&H. The Wasps gathered for a final team meeting Monday night. “It went really well,” Willson said. “I told the guys how much I appreciated them making a commitment to something bigger than themselves. When it comes to our achievements here, I have so many memories.” Over the past four years, the Wasps won more games (75) than any other period in the last 25 years when famed coach Bob Johnson guided the Wasps. In the 2017-18 season, the Wasps won their first-ever Old Dominion Athletic Conference tournament title and earned their first NCAA Division III berth in 25 years. “Winning that ODAC championship was an incredible highlight, not only for what our players achieved but for the support we received,” Willson said. “The numbers of fans we had that weekend in the Salem Civic Center spoke volumes about the way this community supports the college and way the alumni support the students.” After winning a total of nine games in Willson’s first two years at E&H, the Wasps recorded at least 16 victories each of the past four seasons. “I’ll never forget how good it felt when we beat Shenandoah four years ago to clinch our first trip to the tournament in around a decade,” said Willson, who was 84-80 over six seasons, including a 75-37 mark over the last four campaigns. “It was also a special feeling last season when we defeated Randolph-Macon in front of a packed King Center. I will always cherish those memories.” The son of a minister, Willson reflected on the fellowship and counsel he shared in the spartan office once occupied by the dynamic Johnson. “Having conversations with my team during tough times and helping guys work through personal struggles, those times were important to me,” Willson said. According to Willson, his biggest smiles came on graduation day. “I was there every year to watch my guys walk across the stage,” Willson said. “Those were proud moments.” The 2018-19 season for E&H ended Feb. 21 when the seventh-seeded Wasps (17-10) dropped a 77-67 decision to No. 2 Guilford in the quarterfinals of the ODAC tournament at the Salem Civic Center. There were just three seniors on the roster for E&H in 6-7 post Andrew Davis (Wake Forest, N.C.), 6-4 guard Jarris Hendricks (Mechanicsville, Va.) and 6-6 Alic Wynn (Asheville, North Carolina). The Wasps lost standout junior guard Colin Molden for nearly half the season because of a knee injury. Wynn, who collected over 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds as a Wasp, described the tone of Monday’s team meeting. “I was in shock along with all the other guys,” Wynn said. “Coach Will really put his heart, blood, sweat and tears into this program, and it showed with the success he had. He had a huge influence on the community, and he helped prepare us for the real world.” Davis said he appreciated the extra time Willson devoted to his players. “Coach Willson poured his life into the basketball program, and he has afforded me and all my teammates opportunities of a lifetime,” Davis said. “Hearing the news Monday made me reflect on his impact on my life because while I became a better player in my four years, he made me a better man.” Hendricks said a lasting image from his time at E&H was hanging the ODAC championship banner with Wilson. “Seeing the joy on his face as we were finally able to achieve something we worked so hard for - that was my favorite moments with Coach Willson,” Hendricks said. “I will always remember after our last game how he hugged me and told me how proud he was of me. I thanked him for an unforgettable four years.” Willson and his wife have three children approaching middle school age. “And that was a factor in my decision. Being away from home for recruiting in college can be tough,” Willson said. “Leaving the Emory area will be extremely difficult for my entire family. We feel at home in this community, and I love my players more than you can imagine.” The academic and societal mission at E&H was another reason Willson said he savored his time in far Southwest Virginia. “It was special to be a small part of an institution that has such a powerful legacy impacting lives,” said Willson, who spent part of his youth living in Elizabethton. “I’m a strong believer in what this college is all about, and I’m very excited to see what awaits this campus and its basketball program.” Willson has a long history in basketball. As a player at Memphis University School, Willson was selected as runner-up for the Mr. Basketball award in Tennessee. Following one season at Southern Methodist University, Willson helped guide Hampden-Sydney College to three NCAA tournaments and the 2003 NCAA Division III Final Four. Willson came to E&H after serving nearly a decade as an assistant coach at Furman University, Elon University and the College of William & Mary. A national search will begin for a new head coach, with assistant coach Bobby Perez taking over the day-to-day operations of the program. “I’m confident that school officials will find a bright coach to move the program forward, and I’m willing to provide any help I can,” Willson said. Anne Crutchfield, the E&H interim director of athletics, offered the following statement. “We are grateful to David for everything he has done to elevate the men’s basketball program,” said Crutchfield said. “Besides the success on the court, David has been a great role model for these young men off the court, and he will be missed.” Junior guard Daniel Spencer and sophomore guard Tharon Suggs were first and second-team picks on the All-ODAC squads this season and figure to be team leaders in the 2019-2020 season. “Coach Willson did a lot for this program, and we’re excited to keep building on the foundation that he laid,” Suggs said. agregory@bristolnews.com | Twitter: @Greg_BHCSports | (276) 645-2544

The former Tory MP was appointed to the role in April, only weeks before news of the supermarket tie-up broke. He took up his post in June. Lord Tyrie, 62, spent two decades representing Chichester in parliament, making a name for himself when he became chairman of the Treasury select committee in 2010. During his seven years leading the committee, he questioned everyone from Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, and George Osborne, the former chancellor, to Bob Diamond, the former Barclays boss, garnering a reputation as a sharp-witted interrogator.

Steve,Cummings,2540,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/aggressive-andersen-ignites-volta-ao-algarve-finale/,"Dane signals form ahead of Classics campaign Søren Kragh Andersen (Sunweb) unclipped from his bike and sat in the ditch, exhausted, on crossing the finish line atop the Alto do Malhão. He had just been pipped to the stage win by Zdenek Stybar (Deceuninck-QuickStep) and now the sight of a television crew mobbing yellow jersey Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) confirmed that he had just missed out on overall victory at the Volta ao Algarve to boot.Related ArticlesKragh Andersen: I like to win, that's why I race my bikeSoren Kragh Andersen wins Paris-ToursPogacar wins 2019 Volta ao Algarve A brace of second places felt a scant reward for his efforts in a breathless final 20 kilometres through the rippling hills of the Serra do Caldeirão. The Dane had begun the stage 29 seconds off Pogačar’s overall lead but, rather than try to out-strip the Slovenian on the short but sharp final climb, he opted to go on the attack from distance, responding to an initial acceleration from David de la Cruz (Team Sky) on the ascent of Vermelhos. ""The final climb was hard enough to make a difference, but we had two cards to play,"" Andersen told Cyclingnews, pointing out that teammate Sam Oomen had started the day in 6th overall. ""When De la Cruz attacked, I felt good and I thought, 'I’m here to race', so I went with him."" Andersen was followed by Stybar and later Steve Cummings, though he performed the lion’s share of the pace-making as the trio passed the day’s early break and began to establish a sizeable advantage over a yellow jersey group where Pogačar found allies to be in short supply. ""I wanted to put pressure on UAE, that’s why I went. I wanted to win the stage, too, of course, but the main goal was to put pressure on UAE,"" explained Andersen, who was in the virtual overall lead by the time he entered the final 10 kilometres. With teammate Tim Declercq among the survivors in the day’s early break and Enric Mas still in podium contention in the group behind, Stybar had two compelling reasons not to collaborate with Andersen on the run-in. No matter, the 2018 Paris-Tours winner continued to extend his hypothetical buffer over Pogačar all the way to the base of the Malhão. ""It was sad I got Stybar with me because he could sit on my wheel,"" said Andersen, who saw little point in trying to cajole the Czech into taking turns on the front. ""I’d rather spend my energy on something I can control. His tactic is not in my charge. He was on the wheel. Sometimes you are lucky, sometimes you are unlucky."" The three leaders had more than a minute in hand on the Pogačar group when they began the 3km haul up the Malhão, where Andersen immediately upped the pace to shed Cummings. Stybar, however, proved a more resilient foe, and remained grimly on his wheel as the gradient ratcheted upwards. ""I tried to drop Cummings pretty fast because I know he’s not so explosive. That’s why I made an acceleration in the bottom and after that I tried to pace myself to the 1k sign, where there was a bit of a plateau,"" Andersen said. Inside the final kilometre, Stybar just about managed to punch his way clear of Andersen, though the Sunweb man fought gamely all the way to the line, coming in 3 seconds down. ""It’s just a little bit annoying that I lost by 25 metres, but I’m happy about how I raced,"" Andersen said. The succession of accelerations in the yellow jersey group, meanwhile, saw Pogačar’s deficit to Andersen decrease rapidly on the final ramps before the finish. The 20-year-old weathered the storm to place 6th on the stage, 18 seconds down on Stybar, and secure overall victory. Andersen, for his part, had to settle for second place on general classification, 14 seconds behind Pogačar, but he could draw solace from his display in what was his first race of the 2019 season. Grander appointments await, starting at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad next weekend. ""I wanted to start a nice culture in Sunweb, where we are racing in the front,"" Andersen said. ""Often it pays off – and if not, it’s good training.""

On Pop Idol winner Will Young's Homo Sapiens podcast with friend Chris Sweeney, Sivan said, in part, ""Part of me wonders sometimes if I would be more commercially successful if I wasn't gay or not as 'in-your-face gay.' I think we're in a really interesting time in music right now where we are seeing more and more queer artists pop up, but we don't have a queer Taylor Swift, we don't have a queer Rihanna or a queer Beyonce."" Sivan is currently dating model Jacob Bixenman. Freeform announced the premiere date of the spinoff series Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists, according to a press release. Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists will premiere Wed., March 20, at 8 p.m. EST/PST. I. Marlene Kingwho was behind the original show, Pretty Little Liarsis one of the executive producers of the new series. Janelle Monae said that her Grammy nominations for her album Dirty Computer are for her ""trans brothers and sisters,"" Variety reported. The recording artist scored two Grammy nominationsone for album of the year with Dirty Computer, and another for best music video for her track ""Pynk."" Monae's album was praised for its exploration of sexuality, and the singer has been outspoken about living her truth as a queer Black woman. Monae also revealed that before she publicly came out in 2018, many people warned her against it. Oprah Winfrey celebrated her 65th birthday on Jan. 29but has no plans to retire, Ebony.com noted. Winfrey acknowledged the birthday as a ""milestone,"" but she doesn't feel limited by age. ""I am feeling some kind of way because it's the number of which the United States government has said you're officially old,"" she told Entertainment Tonight. Winfrey joked that all her friends are asking whether she received her Medicare card. Speaking of Winfrey, she debuted the first trailer for the new Oprah Winfrey Network ( OWN ) Black gay teen drama David Makes Man, which debuts this summer, Aazios.com noted. The trailer first debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, where star Phylicia Rashad and executive producer Michael B. Jordan took part in a Q&A, and later surfaced on OWN YouTube. David Makes Man is the first TV series for show creator Tarell Alvin McCraney, who won an Academy Award for co-writing 2017 Best Picture winner Moonlight, based on his play In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue. Historians have staged their own fight against the iconic production Hamilton, the Chicago Sun-Times noted. Ishmael Reedwho has been nominated twice for a National Book Awardhas chosen to fight fire with fire: collecting his critique of Lin-Manuel Miranda's acclaimed show into a play. Reed's The Haunting of Lin-Manuel Miranda is an uncompromising takedown of the musical Hamilton, reminding viewers of the founding father's complicity in slavery and his war on Native Americans. Chris Pratt is defending his church after out actress Ellen Page called it ""infamously anti-LGBTQ,"" USA Today noted. ""It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which 'hates a certain group of people' and is 'infamously anti —LGBTQ.' Nothing could be further from the truth,"" Pratt posted on Instagram Story. ""I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.""

Andrew,Davis,2510,https://news.uga.edu/uga-student-joins-class-young-science-leaders/,"University of Georgia ecology doctoral student David Vasquez was one of 40 young science leaders chosen to be a fellow of the Yale Ciencia Academy for Career Development. He attended the American Association for the Advancement of Science Annual Meeting held Feb. 14-17 in Washington, D.C. Vasquez, a third-year student in the Interdisciplinary Disease Ecology Across Scales doctoral program, is studying how ecological and environmental conditions can affect the fitness and geographic range of parasites. He is supported by fellowships from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program and by the IDEAS traineeship program. The Yale Ciencia Academy for Career Development provides graduate students with opportunities for mentoring, networking and skills development, and for making contributions to their communities through science outreach. The program is led by the nonprofit organization Ciencia Puerto Rico, in collaboration with Yale University. Fellows must apply to be selected to participate in the year-long, mostly virtual program, which leverages the CienciaPR community—one of the largest networks of Hispanic/Latinx scientists in the world—to connect doctoral students in biological, biomedical, health and behavioral sciences with advisors, mentors and professional development opportunities. Through workshops and virtual conversations with successful scientists, participants can explore different careers, define their academic and career goals, expand their networks, and acquire communication and leadership skills. The program also allows students to have an impact on society through science outreach. In addition, participants attend an in-person meeting at the AAAS conference, where they participate in program-organized workshops and meeting sessions. “The Yale Ciencia Academy complements traditional graduate training with access to a diverse network of peers, role models and advisors”, said Giovanna Guerrero-Medina, principal investigator and director of the YCA. “The goal is to help students gain clarity in their academic and professional goals and become the scientists they want to be. We are excited about the talent and promise among this new class of YCA fellows.” Started in 2016 and funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, YCA has trained 114 young scientists from more than 50 institutions across the United States and Puerto Rico to date. Over the past two years, YCA Fellows have completed 85 outreach projects, including podcasts, lesson plans for educators, school visits, and articles and talks for the general public, impacting nearly 16,000 people. The 2019 class is composed of 40 students from 31 institutions nationwide.

Jason,Hogg,2512,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/aon-s-top-cyber-threats-2019-revealed,"Companies’ cyber risk profiles should be updated in tandem with each new digital technology that it embraces, according to Aon in its 2019 Cyber Security Risk Report. The scale of attacks and their impact on organizations is intensifying, and as we recently reported, are becoming less predictable. Ransomware attacks may have peaked in 2018, as industry experts have noted, which sent malicious actors reverting to good old fashioned digital extortion, albeit with a slight twist. Adopting a proactive outlook is the best way for companies to respond to the complex and changing set of cyberrisks, said Jason J. Hogg, CEO of Aon Cyber Solutions. “To better prepare against attack, organizations should continually assess their overall cyber risk profile, remediate where recommended and proactively manage their defense,” Hogg said. The report discusses eight prominent areas where organizations are expected to face cybersecurity threats this year.

Rocco,Landesman,2498,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/19/michael-bloomberg-network-2020-1173605,"Michael Bloomberg says he plans to decide whether he'll run for president by month's end, capping a monthslong, data-intensive exercise of poll testing and organizing Democratic focus groups. | Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images 2020 elections The billionaire looks to his philanthropic network for support as he considers 2020 bid. By MARC CAPUTO 02/19/2019 05:04 AM EST From shuttering coal-fired power plants to fighting the gun lobby, obesity and Big Tobacco, Michael Bloomberg’s philanthropy has given away $6.4 billion and earned the love and respect of progressive-minded activists across the country. The question is whether that goodwill is enough to fuel a Democratic presidential primary campaign. Story Continued Below The network of Bloomberg Philanthropies recipients is vast includes mayors throughout the country as well as grassroots climate change, gun control and education advocates and others who could form a ready-made army of campaign supporters, volunteers and paid staffers. Bloomberg’s political team is beginning to press the issue. As the former New York mayor nears a decision on whether to run, his advisers — led by Kevin Sheekey — are asking beneficiaries of his largesse if they’d be on board for his presidential bid. “Kevin Sheekey asked me, ‘Are you with us?’ And I unequivocally said, 'Yes,'” Rocco Landesman, a former chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts said. Our must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. “If you’re passionate about climate change, gun control or education or public health or the arts, he’s leading the charge. He’s the guy out there,” Landesman, a Broadway producer best known for “The Producers,” said. “How would that not translate into political support?” Landesman acknowledged that Bloomberg, a moderate, could face trouble in a leftward-shifting Democratic primary, even though he has been a leader on climate change and gun control, two issues dear to progressive activists that would form a centerpiece of Bloomberg’s campaign. Like others who have been involved in causes that received support from Bloomberg, Landesman said that he never felt Sheekey “put the screws to me” to support Bloomberg and that Bloomberg’s longtime charitable work was authentic and parallel to his political motives. Bloomberg’s effort to stop childhood drowning in Bangladesh, for instance, “doesn’t get him any votes in New Hampshire,” Landesman said. The former New York mayor has said he would decide whether to run for president by month's end, capping a monthslong, data-intensive exercise of poll testing and organizing Democratic focus groups as part of a campaign to deny President Donald Trump a second term that could exceed $500 million. A Bloomberg consultant said the billionaire’s organizations have fielded calls from thousands of supporters eager to repay the favor of the philanthropist’s support over the decades. 2020 ELECTIONS By STEVEN SHEPARD But the conversations between Bloomberg’s team and others have created some awkward situations for those accustomed to operating in issue-based arenas. When asked by POLITICO if he had spoken with Bloomberg or his team concerning a presidential bid, John Feinblatt, president of the Bloomberg-funded Everytown for Gun Safety, avoided the question, saying Bloomberg hadn’t announced and so he would “not get ahead of the facts. Let’s see where we are.” Asked again about conversations he had concerning the topic, Feinblatt spoke about Bloomberg’s “gold standard” record on gun safety. So is that a no? he was asked. “I’m trying to answer the question as frankly as I possibly can."" One reason for the discomfort in discussing the blurred lines between Bloomberg’s philanthropic contributions and his political ambitions is that Everytown and other groups Bloomberg has supported don’t want to appear to undercut their mission by taking sides. They have a strong affinity for the billionaire but fear appearing to be a campaign tool. Bloomberg’s advisers say he recognizes the challenges presented by a presidential campaign — he’s reluctant to step back from his charitable work. That’s not the only issue that has surfaced: he’d have to step away from the Bloomberg media empire while its reporters cover their boss’ race. Sheekey said Bloomberg’s efforts to avoid conflicts of interest would be akin to erecting a virtual Great Wall of China. “There’s never been a Bloomberg campaign that didn’t start with a very good lawyer and a very good accountant,” Sheekey said. Sheekey said there are people in at least half the states who are ready to take a leave of absence to help Bloomberg if he runs. 2020 By BILL SCHER “Is there a network of people like that? Yes. Have we spoken to many members of that network? Yes. And may they take a leave of absence to work on the campaign? Yes,” he said. “Mike Bloomberg has hundreds of people around him who, when Mike Bloomberg says, ‘This is what we’re doing next,’ I don’t have to call them. They call me.” Even if a Bloomberg campaign could tap that network of supporters, his team is aware there are other hurdles that the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat would face in a primary and from progressive activists who reject his centrist politics or think he hasn’t done enough. For instance, Bloomberg has contributed $218 million for clean-energy efforts that, among other results, has led to the closure of 282 coal-fired power plants. But he does not oppose, at least in the short term, other fossil fuel use — and that’s not good enough for activists like Mitch Jones, who directs climate and energy programs for Food & Water Action, an environmental group that fights corporate influences in the movement. “Bloomberg’s reputation as a climate warrior is a bit overblown,” Jones told The Associated Press, calling him “a pro-fracking, pro-pipeline, pro-nuclear billionaire who favors half measures and false solutions because he’s more interested in protecting his friends in the C Suite than he is in stopping climate change.” Bloomberg’s giving covers five major areas — the environment, public health, government innovation, the arts and education — and last year totaled $787 million, making him the nation’s second-most generous philanthropist behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Through one of his biggest programs, the American Cities Initiative, Bloomberg has helped municipalities and activists grapple with everything from climate change to guns to obesity. The initiative is an outgrowth of Bloomberg’s time as New York mayor and has helped sow goodwill with mayors and former mayors throughout the country, giving him possible entrée into a layer of local political support that conventional candidates lack. Michael Nutter, who served as Philadelphia’s mayor when Bloomberg was New York mayor, said Bloomberg is a master of “G.S.D."" ""In private, that means getting shit done,"" he said. ""In public, that means getting stuff done.” 2020 Elections By ELENA SCHNEIDER Nutter, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, said he’s behind Bloomberg, whom he calls “mayor of the world.” In the signature city of yet another swing state — Miami — former Mayor Manny Diaz sits on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies and last week introduced Bloomberg at a fundraiser for immigrants' rights where he said the country needs Bloomberg for president. Diaz, a top surrogate for President Barack Obama’s campaigns in Florida, said he’s been encouraging Bloomberg to run as well. “For him, I would pull out all the stops,” Diaz said. Bloomberg’s advisers said sentiments like that are the norm, not the exception, among those who have worked with his philanthropy and causes. “There are literally hundreds of people. The truth is, we’ve already heard from thousands,” Sheekey said. “They’re already phoning in.” Missing out on the latest scoops?

Andrew,Davis,2456,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Trans-military-ban-Black-icons-Edie-Windsor-trans-art-exhibit/65433.html,"Congressman Joe Kennedy III ( D-Massachusetts ) led efforts for a resolution opposing President Trump's ban on openly transgender servicemembers from serving in the nation's militaryand said resolution has 103 co-sponsors, according to a joint statement from The American Military Partner Association, OutServe-SLDN and SPARTA. American Military Partner Association President Ashley Broadway-Mack said, ""While the Trump-Pence administration unconscionably singles out these brave transgender Americans for discrimination, it's crucial that Members of Congress make clear they stand behind them and are grateful for their service and sacrifice. We are thankful for Representative Joe Kennedy's leadership on this important resolution."" The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) is honoring Black History Month by highlighting not only the straight Black icons and legends but also the LGBTQ ones as well, Instinct Magazine noted. The HRC released a blog post in which it named several Black figures in entertainment like Jussie Smollett, Janelle Monae, and the cast of Pose, politicians like Kamala Harris and Lauren Underwood, and historical figures like Marsha P. Johnson and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy. The life of late LGBTQ advocate Edith ""Edie"" Windsor will be immortalized in A Wild and Precious Lifea forthcoming memoir started by Windsor prior to her death two years ago, NewNowNext.com reported. Windsor made a name for herself nationwide in 2013, when she was the lead plaintiff on the federal lawsuit that successfully struck down the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ). Her case paved the way for the Supreme Court's groundbreaking 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality in the United States. In Miami, Florida International University's Frost Art Museum will run the exhibit ""Jess T. Dugan and Vanessa Fabbre: To Survive on This Shore"" through April 28, according to a press release. In the exhibit, Dugan and Fabbre reveal how U.S. culture lacks representation of older adults who are transgender and gender non-conforming. ( Photos are also in the hardcover book To Survive on This Shore. ) The show is part of the museum's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which will include the presentation in the fall of Art After Stonewall ( 1969-1989 ), the first major museum exhibition about how the LGBT-rights movement impacted the art world. The Rev. Thomas James Brown was elected Feb. 9 to become the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Maineand is the married gay priest elected to lead a diocese, Episcopal News Service reported. He is married to the Rev. Thomas Mousin, who is currently the rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Charlestown, a neighborhood of Boston. The Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson became the first openly gay and partnered bishop in the Anglican Communion in 2003 and served as the Diocese of New Hampshire's bishop until his retirement in January 2013; he and husband Mark Andrew divorced in 2014. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello's administration issued guidelines that are designed to make the U.S. commonwealth's public employees more sensitive to the needs of transgender people and same-sex couples and their children, The Washington Blade noted. The guidelines specifically refer to trans Puerto Ricans who want to change the gender on their birth certificates as well as children whose parents are legally married same-sex couples. The federal appeals court in the Fifth Circuit said its 40-year-old precedent that federal civil-rights law doesn't apply to gay workers also means that transgender workers aren't covered, Bloomberg Law reported. The ruling stemmed from a discrimination lawsuit filed by Nicole Wittmer, a transgender woman who applied for an engineering job with Phillips 66; she claims she was denied the position because of her gender identity. Federal Judge Stephanie M. Rose ruled that a Christian student group at the University of Iowa can't be stripped of its affiliation with the institutioneven if its members follow a ""statement of faith"" that bans those in LGBTQ relationships from leadership roles, InsideHigherEd.com reported. Pro-LGBTQ advocates are worried the decision would open the door for a challenge of a U.S. Supreme Court case from 2010 that allows colleges and universities to enforce anti-discrimination policies, even when student religious organizations claim those policies infringe on their beliefs. Also at the University of Iowa, the UI LGBTQ Resource Center has renamed itself the Pride Alliance Center in order to be more inclusive of diverse sexual and gender identities, as well as to clarify the purpose of the center, The Daily Iowan noted. Alex Barethe outreach director of Spectrum UI, a LGBTQ student organization on campussaid the LGBTQ abbreviation is not fully inclusive of all sexualities and gender identities. The Southern Black Policy & Advocacy Networka non-profit focused on improving health outcomes and reducing social and economic disparities impacting Black communities living in the U.S. Southlaunched the Southern Black HIV/AIDS Network's Advisory, a press release noted. The council will aim to provide strategic direction and organize Black leaders in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. South. Also, the network is launching Organizing to End Black HIV NOW ( bit.ly/EndBlackHIV ), a campaign focused on organizing and mobilizing Black HIV leaders and advocates on the front lines of ending the epidemic in the U.S. South. The Virginia Board of Counseling, on Feb. 8, voted in favor of issuing guidance and documents that recommend a ban on licensed counselors from practicing conversion therapy on minors, The Washington Blade reported, citing TV station WWBT. Counselors in the state who continue to engage in conversion therapy will receive ""a finding of misconduct and disciplinary action"" from the board. Terry Tinsey was the only board member who opposed the measure, expressing concern over the impact the documents and regulations may have on the ""faith community."" The Human Rights Campaign Foundation ( HRC ) announced that it will honor actress/advocate Josie Totah with an Upstander Award at the organization's sixth annual Time to THRIVE Conference on Feb. 15-17 at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, California. Last year, Totah, who starred in the NBC sitcom Champions, came out as transgender in an op-ed for Time magazine. HRC also announced that the band OneUp will perform on the opening night of the conference. In North Carolina, an openly lesbian Durham City Council member's appearance at a local Catholic institution Immaculata Catholic School was canceled because of planned demonstratinos, ABC11.com reported. The school said it had planned to kick off Black History Month celebrations at their morning prayer on Friday with a variety of speeches, including one from Vernetta Alston, an Immaculata alum. ""As pastor, I cannot place our Immaculata students into this contentious environment,"" said Pastor Christopher VanHaight. The U.S. Supreme Court blocked Louisiana from enforcing a law that women's groups said would leave only a single doctor legally allowed to perform abortions in the state, NBC News reported. By a five-to-four vote, the court said the restrictions must remain on hold while challengers appeal a lower-court decision in favor of the law. Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the court's liberal members. A first-of-its-kind conference in Ohio addressed issues once swept under the rug, as inaugural two-day LGBT Horizons of Aging Summit took place in Dayton, WDTN.com reported. Public Health of Dayton and Montgomery County, along with United Church Homes and Rainbow Elder Care, organized the summit in response to a growing need to support an aging LGBT generation that lived much of its lives openly. A security guard was stabbed in the back outside of Micky's Bar while escorting a man out of the West Hollywood spot, WeHo Times reported. Authorities say that deputies responded within seconds of the incident and detained the suspect. The victim suffered two non-life-threatening stab wounds in the upper back; he was transported to a nearby hospital and was expected to survive. In West Virginia, Del. Eric Porterfield, R-Mercer, caused controversy after comparing gay people to the Ku Klux Klan, WVGazetteMail.com noted. ""The LGBTQ is a modern-day version of the Ku Klux Klan, without wearing hoods with their antics of hate,"" Porterfield said in an interview. He also called the gay community a ""terrorist group"" and said he is being ""persecuted"" by the gay community in retaliation for his remarks, including receiving threats on Facebook and voicemails. House Republicans sought to distance themselves from Porterfield's remarks. Multiple bills filed in the Tennessee General Assembly would allow adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples based on religious objections, USA Today reported. One billfiled by Republican legislators Joey Hensley and John Raganspecifies that an adoption agency would not be required to provide services to a couple if it would conflict with the agency's ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" Legislation filed by Republican Tim Rudd puts in place similar protections for discrimination based on religious beliefs and would prevent a couple from suing the adoption agency for refusing to provide services. In Texas, the Carrollton City Council passed an employment nondiscrimination ordinance that bans discrimination based on, among other things, sexual orientation and gender identity. The ordinance, approved on a five-to-two vote that basically revised the city's existing nondiscrimination ordinance, protects city employees, contractors and political appointees. It also bans discrimination based on pregnancy and political beliefs. Julian is a Mermaid, by Jessica Love and published by Candlewick Press, and Hurricane Child, by Kheryn Callender and published by Scholastic Press, are the 2019 recipients of the Stonewall Book Awards-Mike Morgan & Larry Romans Children's & Young Adult Literature Award, an American Library Association ( ALA ) press release noted. The Stonewall Book Awards are given annually to English-language works of exceptional merit for children or teens relating to the LGBT experience. The award will be presented to the winning authors or editors at the ALA's Annual Conference & Exhibition in Washington, D.C., in June. Two government contractors35-year-old Peter Melendez and 27-year-old Robert Koehlerwere arrested after they were caught trying to get on the gay-focused Atlantis Events cruise to sell drugs, Instinct Magazine noted. The government contractors planned ""to smuggle the narcotics into the ship and distribute it once on board the ship,"" according to police records of the arrest. Before they could, a Homeland Security special agent intercepted the emails and alerted Miami-Dade police.

Michael,Gordon,2481,https://www.thecabin.net/news/20190215/objection-filed-in-baker-case,"A federal judge gave former Sen. Gilbert Baker the OK to leave an in-patient substance-abuse facility to attend his son's wedding. However, prosecutors are now asking the court to reconsider the time frame Baker will be allowed to leave treatment. The former senator is currently taking part in a 30-day treatment program at the Freedom House in Russellville as previously ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia S. Harris as part of the conditions of his release from federal custody. Gilbert is awaiting trial after being indicted in January on federal conspiracy, bribery and wire fraud charges. A motion was filed Wednesday by attorney J. Blake Hendrix on Baker's behalf requesting the 62-year-old briefly be allowed to leave the Russellville treatment center so that he can attend his son's wedding, as well as the reception, which will be in Conway the evening before. The wedding is also in Conway. Harris granted the request that same day, and modified Baker's pretrial conditions to allow him to leave the in-patient treatment center at 3 p.m. Feb. 22 and return by 5 p.m. Feb. 24. Harris ordered on Jan. 24 that Baker abstain from alcohol and that he must undergo in-patient substance abuse counseling as part of the conditions of his federal release. In her ruling, Harris also ordered Baker, who was convicted in September 2016 of a DWI in Conway District Court and tested positive for methamphetamine on a toxicology screening taken the night of his DWI arrest, would be subject to random drug and alcohol screenings. While prosecutors initially did not object to allowing Baker to attend his son's wedding, ""there has been an inadvertent misunderstanding with defense counsel,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gordon said in a motion filed Thursday asking Harris to reconsider her previous decision. ""The United States does not oppose the defendant attending his son's wedding if Pretrial Services approves. However, the United States was not aware that the defendant would be requesting a 50 hour pass, which amounts to the defendant missing more than two full days of his treatment program,"" the newly-filed motion for reconsideration reads in part. Prosecutors are proposing an order be imposed that instead would allow Baker a one-day pass. According to Gordon's motion, after speaking with Baker's Pretrial Services supervisor, a pass from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. would best suit Baker because an extended leave ""may interfere with the defendant's success in the treatment program."" The indictment against Baker was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas on Jan. 10. The investigation against the former senator reveals he, Maggio, who was a circuit judge for the 20th Judicial District, and at least one other person schemed together from May 2013 to June 2014. ″[The three] did knowingly and unlawfully conspire, confederate, and agree together and with each other: to corruptly give, offer, and agree to give, anything of value to any person, intending to influence and reward Maggio [...] in connection with a business, transaction, or series of transactions of $5,000 or more of the State of Arkansas,” the documents state. Baker and the other two devised a schedule to fraud, trick and “deprive” Arkansas residents of their “right to honest services of Maggio,” according to the indictment. “It was a purpose of the conspiracy for [Baker] and Maggio to enrich themselves, LRM Consulting and Company A [a nursing home and rehabilitation center in Faulkner County] by providing campaign contributions to Maggio from Individual A [owner of Company A],” the documents further state. In addition, their purpose was to conspire to hide, conceal and cover up the nature and scope of Baker’s dealings with Maggio and the center’s owner including the campaign contributions and its source and nature, the indictment states. Maggio is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for previously pleading guilty to a bribery charge. Baker currently faces up to five years in prison regarding the conspiracy charge, up to 10 years in prison for the bribery charge and up to 20 years in prison on each of the seven wire-fraud counts filed against him. The federal trial in Baker’s case will be held at 9:30 a.m. Oct. 28 before U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. Choose the plan that's right for you.

Incumbent Mayor Steve Cummings faces challenges from Deputy Mayor Lori Palmeri and local tavern owner Nathan Stiefvater. The top two vote-getters in Tuesday's primary will advance to the general election in April. The candidates recently came together for a candidate forum, held by the League of Women Voters of Winnebago County. Did you miss the event or not have time to watch the full video? Don't worry; we've got you covered. Cummings is a lifelong Oshkosh resident and has served on the Oshkosh Common Council for nine years, including the past four as mayor. He wants to continue what he calls the progress and fiscal responsibility that resulted in such projects as the Oshkosh Riverwalk; the Menominee Nation Arena; a new Oshkosh Corp. headquarters; plus the revitalization of the Washington Building, The Howard and the Oshkosh Community YMCA on Washington Avenue. He sees the job of mayor as being the visionary and cheerleader for the city, a job he says he spends about 30 hours a week doing. In response to a question about the city's use of special assessments to help fund road projects, Cummings says it's a fairness issue. Charging property owners on a corner lot a $10,000 special assessment, for example, might seem a bit much, though it's still only 25 percent of the city's total cost, he said. Cummings supports the city's newly revamped rental inspections program, saying landlords should be held accountable for maintaining ""clean, sanitary and safe"" homes for tenants without threat of evictions. He also says newly proposed rules for short-term rentals are confusing but that it's an fairness issue. Palmeri is in her second term on the council (her first as deputy mayor) and is a wife, mother and grandmother with more than 25 years of experience in organizing neighborhoods and holds a master's degree in urban planning. She advocates accessible, approachable local government. She wants to continue making sure the city uses tax dollars efficiently and effectively. ""Our city government isn't always as inviting as it should be,"" Palmeri said. In addition to running council meetings, the mayor should also ensure a warm, welcoming and approachable environment while also advocating city-related issues at the state level, she said. Palmeri thinks a transportation utility fee would be more equitable than a wheel tax. She wants more information about creating a transportation utility that would allow the city to subsidize the costs of not just streets but also other amenities, such as sidewalks. She also supports the newly revamped rental inspections program but thinks the city could do more, working with both landlords and tenants to protect the health and welfare of tenants while still respecting the rights of property owners. Stiefvater owns Barley & Hops Pub and Beer Garden and has been a small business owner since 1997. He is married with two children. He thinks the city has been moving in the right direction but that it will be a challenge to maintain the enthusiasm recent development projects have created. Stiefvater thinks the mayor should serve as a liaison to the citizens. He opposes making landlords pay for inspections as part of the city's newly revamped rental inspections program (fees are issued only if inspectors find violations that aren't addressed within 30 days). ""If it's a mandatory thing done by the government for the betterment of its citizens, then the landlord shouldn't be picking up the tab,"" he said. Stiefvater says regulating short-term rentals, such as folks renting out their homes during the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual AirVenture fly-in convention, is ""nothing but a money grab"" by the city. A vehicle registration fee or so-called wheel tax wouldn't be fair to property owners who have already paid special assessments, he said.

John,O'Neil,2480,https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190215/judge-to-expedite-ogunquit-recall-lawsuit,"OGUNQUIT � The judge considering the lawsuit filed by four Ogunquit residents seeking to halt the recall vote of three Select Board members said he will move the suit along quickly, and issue a scheduling order for court proceedings the week of Feb. 25. York County Superior Court Judge John O�Neil said during a status conference Wednesday that he wanted to expedite the proceedings while ensuring that he has adequate time to properly decide the case. On Feb. 4, O�Neil issued a temporary stay ordering the town of Ogunquit to stop all action in the recall election until legal challenges are heard in court. Ogunquit resident Jerry Dehart filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, and O�Neil granted that request during Wednesday�s court conference. DeHart also submitted a motion asking the judge to lift the temporary stay so the recall election could proceed. O�Neil declined to lift the stay and said he would rule on that the week of Feb. 25. �We are pleased both that he has not lifted the stay and that he is considering an expedited schedule to get the legal issues resolved potentially in time for the June Town meeting, if an election ends up going forward,� said Stephen Langsdorf, attorney for the recall petition challengers, said in a statement Thursday. The lawsuit filed late last month in York County Superior Court seeks to halt the process for recalling three Select Board members, citing multiple problems with the petition process, but supporters of the recall effort say the lawsuit is just a stalling tactic. The lawsuit follows months long turmoil in the future of three members of the Board of Selectmen, Chairman Charles �Bunky� Waite, Selectwoman Madeline Mooney and Selectman Bob Winn. Residents who initiated the recall process did so following a public appeal hearing on Oct. 9 where the three board members voted to support the termination of former fire chief Mark O�Brien by Town Manager Pat Finnigan. Selectmen Rick Dolliver and John Daley voted against upholding O�Brien�s termination. O�Brien has since filed a complaint against the town in York County Superior Court appealing his firing. Residents Mary Buck, Barbara Ferraro, Patricia Hussey and Peter Kahn filed the lawsuit Jan. 28 asking the court to order the town to stop moving forward with the recall. Before the lawsuit was filed, the recall effort was slated to move forward after Town Clerk Chris Murphy issued findings in the challenges made at a public hearing on Jan. 11 to signatures gathered on the recall petitions. Murphy denied all but three of the 11 challenges, meaning there were enough valid signatures to move petitions to the Select Board. Mark McLeod, speaking on behalf of residents leading the recall initiative said, �We are disappointed that we do not yet have a decision in this court case, but are waiting, albeit impatiently, for the judge's decision. We believe that the legal challenges have no merit and are ready to set that belief to the vote of Ogunquit residents.� Choose the plan that's right for you.

Michael,Gordon,2506,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/feb/20/ex-senator-keeps-pass-for-wedding-activ/,"A federal judge declined Tuesday to reconsider her decision last week to allow former state Sen. Gilbert Baker to leave an inpatient treatment center for more than two days this month to attend a son's wedding activities. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tricia Harris said in a two-sentence order that she had carefully considered a federal prosecutor's request Friday that she rethink modifying Gilbert's conditions of release, but the request was denied. Last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Gordon cited ""an inadvertent misunderstanding with defense counsel,"" who told the judge that the government didn't oppose a pass allowing Gilbert to attend the wedding as long as the pretrial services office approved. Gordon said that while true, the government didn't know that attorney Blake Hendrix was planning to seek a 50-hour pass that would allow Baker to miss more than two full days of his 30-day treatment program at Freedom House in Russellville. An absence that long from the program could interfere with Gilbert's substance-abuse treatment, Gordon said. He added that after Hendrix's motion was filed, Gordon spoke with the pretrial services officer supervising Baker, who consulted with his counselor at Freedom House, and both recommended a 12-hour day pass instead, just for the wedding. Harris granted Baker's request last Wednesday, the same day it was filed, allowing him to leave the treatment center this week from 3 p.m. Friday until 5 p.m. Sunday, to attend a wedding rehearsal dinner on Friday as well as the wedding on Saturday, both in Conway. Baker, 62, of Conway, who is also a former chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, pleaded innocent last month to single counts of bribery and bribery conspiracy and seven counts of wire fraud. The charges stemmed from an investigation into a purported scheme involving a nursing home owner and a now-imprisoned former judge, Michael Maggio. Nursing home owner Michael Morton of Fort Smith hasn't been charged with a crime and has denied wrongdoing. Harris allowed Baker to undergo an inpatient treatment program as part of the conditions of his release pending trial, which is scheduled for October before U.S. District Judge D. Price Marshall Jr. Other conditions of his release are that he not use alcohol and that he submit to random drug and alcohol testing. Baker is also a former lobbyist and political fundraiser who has been teaching music at the University of Central Arkansas in Conway since he resigned as an executive assistant to the college's president in April 2014. His resignation followed public reports about his involvement in the purported scheme. That same month, the UCA Foundation returned a $100,000 donation that Morton had sent through Baker in July 2013. A spokesman for the university said last week that Baker is on sick leave and that the four courses he was teaching had been assigned to another faculty member. If convicted, Baker faces up to five years on the conspiracy count, 10 years on the bribery count and 20 years on each of the wire-fraud counts. Metro on 02/20/2019 Print Headline: Former Arkansas senator keeps pass to leave treatment center for wedding activities Why is he still associated with UCA? It is evident he is not taking this seriously. The man was found with meth which is why he's in treatment. They should watch his booking video, he was tweaking his brains out. He needs at least 90 days of in patient rehab, 30 days is a joke. No champagne for him. Copyright © 2019, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Inc. All rights reserved.

Michael,Gordon,2520,https://www.abc12.com/content/news/Attention-Voters-No-reason-needed-to-mail-in-ballot-506173441.html,"FLINT TOWNSHIP (WJRT) - (02/21/19) - People can now vote by mail without having to provide a reason. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson chose to mark the moment Thursday in Flint Township. ""It's important to know that voters here in Genesee County have access to the same opportunities to vote that everyone else in our state does, so I wanted to raise awareness because one of the biggest challenges in making sure these conveniences are taken advantage of by voters is making sure they know about it,"" Benson said. She also talked about how advances like this might increase voter turnout. ""We did a study already of looking where the lowest turnout areas are in our state, and while there are some parts of Flint and Genesee County that vote in significant numbers, there are many that do not. And the same holds true in parts of Wayne County and a lot of rural counties in our state,"" Benson said. In November voters approved Proposal 3, allowing for comprehensive changes to Michigan's election law. Thursday no-reason absentee voting became official. Previously, voters had to provide at least one of six reasons when requesting an absentee ballot. RELATED: Committee convened to provide input on election reforms Michael Gordon, owner of Great Lakes Sandwich Co. & Cafe, welcomes the change. ""When I have to close to go vote I'm potentially missing money,"" Gordon said. ""I just put a note in the door saying gone to vote. I'll be back as soon as possible."" Local groomer Shanna Tucker called it a great move. ""Very rewarding being able to do it and work with animals but there are just some days when I just get out of work and I do not want to sit in line for an hour, two hours to vote,"" Tucker said. By visiting michigan.gov/vote you can print an absentee ballot and send it in. ""Everyone can apply and be issued an absentee ballot. They simply take it home, do any research if necessary. Mark it, seal it, sign it and send it back to the local clerk's office. No more waiting in line, no more 'I totally forgot it was election day,'"" said Flint Township Clerk Kathy Funk. She encouraged voters to go online. Some voters will be using the new feature for the May 7 election. Benson said she's also working on an online portal where people can register to vote and update records online. She says she is also implementing audits to ensure machines are accurately counting ballots. The first step she says is to convene the national committee.

ALBANY — Mike Rigerman is halfway to a wrestling state championship. The undefeated Pioneer senior recorded two pins Friday, giving him 29 on the year, to advance to today’s semifinal round of the state tournament. Wrestling is scheduled to resume at 10 a.m., with finals slated for 6:30 p.m. The top-seeded 220-pounder in Division 2, Rigerman (41-0) began the day by pinning Jasper-Troupsburg’s Connor Sykora in 5:24. In the quarterfinals, he won by fall in 4:27 over eighth-seeded Josh Greenwood of Section 3’s Beaver River. Rigerman took fourth in the weight class last year and is seeking to become Pioneer’s sixth state champion and first since Tony Lock in 2012. In the semifinals, he will meet fifth-seeded Jeff Crooks (36-2) of Section 2’s Cobleskill. The other semi pits the Nos. 2 and 3 seeds, Keagan Carmenatty (41-1) of South Seneca and James Oosterom (22-1) of Section 9’s Port Jervis, respectively. The Big 30 sent six wrestlers to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association championships — the area’s most state qualifiers since 2012. After the first day of action at the Times Union Center, half still have a shot at reaching the podium. Wellsville’s Hunter Kurtz (99 pounds, Division 2) and Olean’s Patrick Walsh (182 pounds, Division 1) lost in the first round and quarterfinals, respectively. But each remains alive in wrestlebacks. Walsh, a third-seeded senior, won his opening match with a pin of Penfield’s Joe Cocozza in 4:56. A 10-9 defeat by sixth-seeded Angelo Petrakis of Section 8’s Massapequa ended Walsh’s title hopes, but he responded with a pin in 2:51 against Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Eduard Dzhioev in a wrestleback match. Kurtz dropped his opener by major decision, 14-5, to No. 6 Jackson Polo of Section 8’s Cold Spring Harbor. However, the unseeded senior then won a pair of wrestlebacks, decisioning Trevor Tufano of Port Jervis 6-2 and claiming a 12-1 major decision over Jair Gomez of Section 2’s Ichabod Crane. Walsh (36-7) and Kurtz (44-3) are both one win from guaranteeing a place-finish. Walsh took sixth at 182 pounds in Division 2 last year, while Kurtz is Wellsville’s first state rep since 1990 state champion Brian Gray Jr. In today’s consolation quarterfinals, Walsh faces Michael Gordon of Section 8’s Hewlett, while Kurtz takes on second-seeded Sixx Cook of Section 3’s Central Valley Academy. Three Olean wrestlers saw their seasons end after two matches. At 160 pounds, Icar Simon (30-8) was pinned in 1:49 by No. 8 seed Devin Earl of Section 3’s West Genesee before losing 7-1 to Stephen Grabher of Section 8’s North Shore. Seventh-seeded 170-pounder Devan Moore (30-7) fell 6-1 to Joe Gannone of Section 11’s Eastport-South Manor and was eliminated with a 17-6 major decision by Victor’s Joseph Theede. Tanner Hulse (33-11), the Section 6 285-pound champion, lost 6-0 to sixth-seeded Collin Burns of Hilton, then was pinned in 4:39 by Jeremiah Cheatham of Section 4’s Elmira.

Andrew,Davis,2500,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/WORLD-Trans-Thai-PM-candidate-anti-LGBT-attacks-intersex-ruling/65487.html,"A transgender woman who the United States deported back to her native El Salvador died earlier this month after she was attacked outside the country's capital, The Washington Blade reported. Salvadoran trans advocacy group Asociacion Aspidh Arcoiris Trans said that Aurora, also known as Camila, had been reported missing at the end of Januarybut it turned out she had been admitted to a hospital with multiple injuries. It remains unclear what happened to Camila. In Algeria, medical student Assil Belalta, 21, was murdered in his dorm room with a homophobic message written on the wall with his blood, LGBTQ Nation reported. Citing unnamed sources, ObservAlgerie reported that he returned to his dorm room when two unknown individuals followed him in, slit his throat and took his car keys. Before the attackers left, they wrote ""He is gay"" in English on the wall with Belalta's blood. The European Parliament has adopted a landmark resolution on the rights of intersex people, Organisation Intersex International ( OII ) Europe posted. ""We applaud the European Parliament for issuing this outstanding resolution,"" said Kitty Anderson, co-chair of OII Europe. ""It is clearly based on an in-depth knowledge about the human rights violations that intersex people face in within the European Union."" Brazil's supreme court was expected to rule on a pair of cases that could determine whether homophobia and transphobia should be considered criminal offense, Reuters noted. The casesbrought by Brazilian rights group ABGLT and the Popular Socialist Partyasked the Supreme Federal Tribunal ( STF ) to acknowledge the ""unconstitutional delay"" of Brazil's Congress in criminalizing violence against LGBT+ people. A draft law criminalizing homophobic actions was first presented to Brazil's Congress in 2001; however, despite having wide popular support, the bill was never approved by the country's Senate. An Instagram account featuring comic strips about a gay Muslim man's struggles went darkjust days after the Indonesian government demanded that the social-media site remove it over public concerns in the largest Islamic-majority country, BenarNews.org reported. BenarNews could not determine if the person responsible for the @alpantuni account took the account offline or if Instagram responded to the government's demand. Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology said Instagram had not responded to a Feb. 2 letter demanding that the account be blocked for causing public discomfort. Poland had its first gay-inclusive prom, LGBTQ Nation noted, citing Towleroad. The Bednarska High School in Warsaw recently had its first Equality Prom Dance. The event was made to honor same-sex couples and LGBTQ students who are in their senior year. Seventy percent of Polish youth who identify as LGBTQ express having depression and suicidal thoughts. Gay pastoral ministers in the Netherlands have published an open letter to Pope Francis protesting the Vatican's ban on gay priests and claiming the Gospel's credibility is imperiled by the Church's attitude on homosexuality, according to a New Ways Ministry blog post. The Working Group of Catholic Gay Pastors ( WKHP )which represents more than 40 gay priests, deacons and lay ministers in the Netherlandswrote the letter, dated last year and signed by chairperson Frans Bossink, public on its website just recently. This release came just ahead of the Vatican's summit on clergy sexual abuse. Activists and service providers say that people with HIV/AIDS in Venezuela are dying because of an acute lack of available antiretroviral drugs within the country, The Washington Blade reported. Cesar Sequerafounder of Alianza Lambda de Venezuela, a Venezuelan LGBTI-advocacy groupsaid that he has been able to obtain antiretroviral drugs from non-governmental organizations or from donations he received from outside the country. He described the situation as ""critical and alarming."" Trans sportswomen hit back at Martina Navratilova after the tennis champion said ""it's insane and it's cheating"" for transgender women to be allowed to compete in women's sport, OpenlyNews.com reported. Navratilova's comments are ""disturbing, upsetting, and deeply transphobic,"" said Rachel McKinnon, who, in 2018, became the first transgender woman to win a world track cycling title. Under rules brought in by International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 2016, athletes transitioning from female to male can now participate without restrictions; trans male competitors must have kept their levels of testosterone below a certain level for at least 12 months. Navratilova expressed support for Caster Semenyathe two-time 800-meter Olympic women's championin her case against the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ), which is being heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Online streaming service GagaOOLalaoften called Asia's LGBTI Netflixis expanding into India, Gay Star News noted. Taiwanese LGBTI activist and GagaOOLala founder Jay Lin said the time was right for the move. He said India's landmark decriminalization of gay sex last year as well as improved mobile telephone networks dictated the move. British cricket player Joe Root has been praised by anti-discrimination campaigners for his response to potentially homophobic comments by West Indies player Shannon Gabriel, Yahoo! News noted. Gabriel has been charged by the International Cricket Council for his altercation with Root. A mic recorded Root saying, ""Don't use it as an insult."" Gabriel replied, ""What was that?"" Root then said, ""Don't use it as an insult. There is nothing wrong with being gay.""

Andrew,Davis,2542,https://www.disabilitysupportguide.com.au/talking-disability/mortality-rates-in-autistic-community-double-general-population,"Posted 2 days ago by Nicole Pope An Australian first study led by the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and PhD scholar Jane Hwang has found the mortality rates in people on the autism spectrum are double those of the general population. Funded by the Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC) the study collected data on 36,000 people with autism living in New South Wales and revealed the co-occurring health conditions, factors that influence mortality risk and causes of death. UNSW Medicine and Chair, Intellectual Disability Mental Health, Professor Julian Trollor says the findings are “of great concern”. “While we only looked at NSW data, we’d expect to find the same patterns nationally. ""It’s important to note the results do not point to elevated mortality for autistic people as a result of their being on the spectrum. “Rather, the results indicate there needs to be a greater understanding of autism and co-occurring conditions within the health services sector, and that more equitable access to health services needs to be a priority for government and health service providers,” Professor Troller says. The study also revealed cancer and circulatory disease as the top causes of death for the general population, whilst for people with autism, injury and poisoning, including accidents, suicide and deaths resulting from self-harm were found to be the top cause of death. “Combined with the information about mental health being a risk factor for death, the higher proportion of deaths from injury and poisoning may point to unmet mental health needs that this group is experiencing,” Professor Trollor says. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Autism CRC Andrew Davis says the study is the first known use of large linked datasets to investigate mortality and cause of death for people on the autism spectrum. “This is an issue, as understanding the drivers of excess mortality is important for those on the spectrum – and for those who support them, such as family members, health professionals and policymakers. “This is particularly important where the deaths may be preventable,” he says. Autistic health advocate Kathy Isaacs says the findings should serve as a call to action for government and health service providers. “Every single Australian deserves healthcare that is both readily accessible and accommodating of their individual needs, but this study confirms the sense within the autistic community that this is not what is happening - for this group in NSW, and for autistic Australians.” She says a comprehensive health and disability service response is required to ensure people with autism are adequately supported and their health needs are met. “From a broader perspective, we need to ensure that all of our system-level health promotion and preventative health programs are accessible, that the bare minimum goal of autism awareness is met for all staff, and finally, that people on the spectrum are consulted and involved at all stages of health policy development.” CEO of Autism Awareness Nicole Rogerson says it’s critical to address the co-occurring conditions that are causing these deaths and work to prevent this through good understanding and management. “So many of these tragedies would be avoidable if we better understood individuals with autism and managed their needs and supports accordingly. ""Autism is complex...there is no easy fix here but a better understanding and planning for a range of complex physical and mental health issues will literally save lives. “We owe it to our loved ones with autism to ensure they live healthy, long lives and that we don't fail them by merely mis-managing their care. “So much of this is preventable, not all of course, but what we can change, we should with great urgency. ""In a modern-day Australia, our community deserves so much better. These are our children, we must not fail them once they have grown into adults,"" she says. The report was published today in the leading academic journal, Autism Research. © Copyright 2019 Disability Support Guide

In her victory speech, accompanied onstage by her wife and daughter, Lightfoot asked: ""So what do you think of us now?"" Lightfoot announced her candidacy in May 2018, long before Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he'd be leaving office in 2019, setting into motion a contest that saw well over a dozen mayoral candidates enter the field. A former prosecutor who headed up the Chicago Police Board, Lightfoot is running for office for the first time. ""As an LGBTQ-plus person, I thought about running for mayor when no other LGBTQ-plus person had ever made the ballot,"" said Lightfoot in her Feb. 26 remarks. ""This election is about whether we are resigned to the status quo or resolved to fight for what's right,"" she added. ""This election is about leaving the crumbling machine in the past, once and for all, and demanding an independent, accountable City Hall that serves the people. It's time to bring it home."" She also spoke about her roots, and how her family's experiences when her brother was incarcerated influenced her world-view: ""It's not every day that a little Black girl from a segregated steel town makes the runoff to become the mayor in America's third largest city."" Lightfoot acknowledged her support from Equality Illinois PAC and Victory Fund. Those organizations wasted no time in announcing their congratulations in statements. ""While we wait for every vote to be counted, we are incredibly thrilled with the votes that have come in,"" said Equality Illinois CEO Brian Johnson. ""We congratulate Lori Lightfoot for advancing to the April 2 run-off election and her historic candidacy as the first-ever openly queer person to run for mayor of Chicago. That is a significant milestone in Chicago and Illinois history. Representation matters. Now, let's bring it home on April 2 and elect Lori Lightfoot mayor of Chicago."" ""Despite not having a legacy last name or a rolodex of rich friends, Lori's fighting spirit and ability to transcend the murky machinations of Chicago politics has made the unlikely a reality  and Chicagoans will be better for it,"" said Annise Parker, Victory Fund's president and CEO. ""While Lori is determined to improve the lives of all the city's residentswhether downtown or on the South Sidethe historic nature of her candidacy provides Chicagoans the rare opportunity to bring fresh perspectives and experiences to city hall."" In her speech Feb. 26, Preckwinkle came out swinging in remarks, denouncing Lightfoot for having accepted appointments in Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Mayor Richard M. Daley's administrations. She added, ""I'm not afraid of big challenges and hard work. … My entire career has prepared me for this moment. … This race is is not about me; it's about all of us. It's about our shared vision for this city."" City clerk Anna Valencia was against two candidates who had removals pendingso she received all the votes. City treasurer In a competitive race, Melissa Conyers-Ervin and Ameya Pawar are headed for an April 2 runoff. Aldermanic races: With all 50 Chicago City Council seats up for grabs, it was a mixed bag for incumbents and challengersand one for LGBT candidates as well. ( Results with asterisks denote races with LGBT individuals involved. ) To win a Chicago race outright, a candidate must win more than 50 percent of the vote. If that does not happen, each race will go to an April 2 runoff between the top two finishers. NOTE: These results are as of 10 p.m. on Feb. 26. Results will be updated online as they are finalized. 1st Ward: Incumbent Proco ""Joe"" Moreno was upset by challenger Daniel La Spata 61 percent to 39 percent, losing the seat he has held since 2010.

Sara,Burns,2476,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/spouse-slain-officers-not-angry-1.5019580,"Steve Burns's life dramatically changed last Aug. 10. His wife, Fredericton police officer Sara Burns, was shot and killed that morning, along with a fellow officer and two other residents. Since the shootings, Burns has felt a roller-coaster of emotions, but one emotion he doesn't feel is anger. ""I can't really explain it,"" he said. ""She was doing what she loved and working for the community that she loved. … We spent 24 awesome years together. I spent the day before with her … I just have all these things I hold onto, and that's why I don't get angry about it."" Matthew Vincent Raymond, the man accused of killing Sara, her colleague Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright, has made several court appearances and is now undergoing an examination to determine whether he is not criminally responsible. After losing his wife, Burns found himself in a situation he wasn't prepared for, a single parent to three boys. His children have been strong through the whole ordeal, he said, pointing to a school essay his son wrote called ""The Gift,"" which talks about living life to the fullest. ""You just never know what's going to happen,"" Burns said. Burns, who has an internet technology company, said he's been able to take as much time as he's needed to deal with his wife's death. He has also been grateful for the kindness of friends and strangers, saying he never had to make a phone call for help, because help was always offered. Burns's life in the past six months has given him insight into the hardships many single parents face. ""I can't imagine being the father or mother of three children and having to work 40 hours a week,"" he said. ""It just blows my mind."" There have been numerous events and fundraisers in Sara's honour. Aitken's Pewter minted a special coin and Grimross Brewery released a special edition beer named after Sara's horse, Grimsby. On Saturday night, singer Kayley Hill, who competed on The Voice, will perform at a fundraiser called Be My Valentine at the Fredericton Convention Centre. The event includes an auction. Proceeds from the fundraisers go to the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund. The fund will help support work in mental health and wellness, women and violence, adult education and community safety. ""Those are the things that are near and dear to her heart and that's where this money will go,"" Burns said. He said he hopes to get the memorial fund up to $1 million, after which it should be self-sufficient. Steve said if Sara were alive and able to see how much the city has come together to raise money, she would be proud. With files from Information Morning Fredericton Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Sara,Burns,2483,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-newsletter-the-506er-1.5021959,"Good evening, Here's what we're talking about this week: Tidying guru Marie Kondo has become an international phenomenon thanks to her Netflix show Tidying up with Marie Kondo. Folks everywhere are reorganizing their living spaces (you should see my sock drawer) with emphasis on living with less and keeping what sparks joy. But that means libraries and thrift stores have been inundated with donations. We checked in on how they're handling the onslaught. Check out our video: Negligence. Abuse. Inadequate care. Those were some of the choice words in Charles Murray's stunning report on the crisis in care at the Restigouche Hospital Centre. Last week, the New Brunswick's ombud was unequivocal about the ""significant mistreatment"" and ""chronic understaffing"" that exists within the walls of the provincial psychiatric hospital in Campbellton. The report also cast the future of the adjacent youth centre, which is nearly complete, in doubt. The hair-raising revelations detailed in the report validate concerns of parents who fear for their children. Fathers Reid Smith and Darrell Tidd don't believe their sons are safe in the hospital. ""It's on my mind every day, from the time I wake up to the time I go to sleep,"" Tidd said. The sister of a patient at the Restigouche psychiatric hospital said she was flabbergasted to learn how her loved one had been treated there. The patient was one of the five cases described in the report. Forty-eight hours after Murray's report, it was announced a patient died at the hospital. Vitalité Health Network and the RCMP are investigating but police say ""no criminality"" was involved. Despite the recent news, Vitalité CEO Gilles Lanteigne maintains that the hospital is safe, saying many of the issues noted in Murray's report were previously addressed by the health authority. Lanteigne also said the facility isn't suffering from understaffing, but even Vitalité's numbers contradict the CEO's statement. Staffing ratios at the Restigouche Hospital Centre reached a level that Vitalité describes as a ""danger"" one-third of the time in October, Karissa Donkin reports her in story. The CBC's Vanessa Blanch explored in a two-part series this week on the new safe space for sex workers in the Moncton area that's opening soon. The Connection Centre, the first of its kind in the province, will offer sex workers a hot meal, a place to take a shower or a nap, peer support, trauma counselling and access to services and supports such as affordable housing, mental health and addictions counselling. First, Vanessa spoke with organizers about the need for such a space and how it came to be. ""It's been on the radar since I've started the past three years and to see it actually happening is just really huge,"" said Jenn Fredericks of the Moncton YMCA. ""My hope is that individuals will be empowered to be who they are. To be empowered to move forward if that's what they choose."" Second, we hear from two former sex workers who plan to volunteer at the centre and mentor women and girls. ""Every second of every minute,"" one of the women said. ""We're judged by the men that pick us up, and then we're judged by the surrounding businesses that watch us there, and then we're judged by the residents in that neighbourhood as well."" Six months after his wife was killed in the Aug. 10 shooting in Fredericton, Steve Burns told CBC News of the many emotions he's felt in the months since, anger isn't one of them. ""I can't really explain it,"" said Burns, husband of Const. Sara Burns. ""She was doing what she loved and working for the community that she loved. … We spent 24 awesome years together. I spent the day before with her … I just have all these things I hold onto, and that's why I don't get angry about it."" Meanwhile, the community continues to rally around the victims' families. Funds continue to pour in for the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund, including 100 per cent of the proceeds from a new Grimross beer named after her beloved horse, Grimbsy. Shane Fowler spoke with brewer Stephen Dixon who wanted to help out but didn't know how. So, he decided to do what he knows best: brewing. The Liberal Party selected its interim leader this week, while the path to the June 22 convention became murkier for one leadership hopeful. Longtime northern New Brunswick MLA Denis Landry steps into the interim leader role after former premier Brian Gallant officially resigned this week. Landry said his priority will be to boost the morale of party members still smarting over the failure to win a majority in last September's election. René Ephestion's bid to become the next Liberal leader may be in trouble after the leadership race rules were released. They say a candidate must be eligible to sit as an MLA, meaning he must be a Canadian citizen. The French national says he has permanent residency and expects to become a citizen before June. Also this week, Premier Blaine Higgs hinted he's open to changing the province's forestry policy in hopes of restoring the province's traditional exemption from softwood lumber duties. ""If we don't have a fair marketplace, we will fix it,"" Higgs told reporters ahead of a trip to Washington later this month. The Progressive Conservatives are also thinking ahead to the next election. Internal party documents obtained by CBC News show the party aims to collect $1.6 million in donations in 2019, as the PCs improve their once desperate financial situation. The minority-government situation means an election could come much sooner than 2022. ""We want to be an election-ready machine,"" said PC party president Rick Lafrance. ""We will be ready for any election that may come our way, whether it's within six months to four years."" A 70-year-old Saint John man was just looking to relieve pain and have an easier time getting some sleep when he sat down with a cannabis-infused lollipop. But the man bit off more than he could handle. The man, who was already being treated for coronary artery disease, ended up being treated in hospital for a heart attack. ""He was very paranoid, very upset, thought he was going to die at home and then this crushing chest pain started,"" said Dr. Robert Stevenson. The incident has doctors warning the public about over-consumption when it comes to cannabis products, especially edibles, which are expected to hit shelves for legal purchase this fall. Grand Manan's Hole-in-the-Wall campground, known for its cliff-side campsites boasting spectacular and unobstructed views of the Bay of Fundy, is up for sale. The family that owned the property for 213 years is asking $1.3 million. Meanwhile, a group is requesting the federal government take on the land and turn it into a satellite portion of Fundy National Park. ""It's one of the only places in Canada, other than Cap-Bon-Ami up in Quebec that's a national park, where you can sit on the cliffs and watch some of the most endangered animals in the world,"" said Andrea Kelter, who has been spearheading the proposal. There are some assurances in life. Death, taxes and a New Brunswicker saying, ""Geez, there have been an awful lot of snow days this year."" Cancelling school because of weather is always a tricky business, but, lucky for you, the CBC's Elizabeth Fraser wrote this helpful explainer on how the school districts decide on calling it a snow day.

(Photo: Courtesy of Oshkosh Media) OSHKOSH - Voters stuck to what they knew Tuesday as they narrowed the field for mayor for the April election. Incumbent Mayor Steve Cummings and Deputy Mayor Lori Palmeri triumphed in Tuesday's primary election, with 39.6 percent and 39.3 percent of the vote, respectively. Challenger Nathan Stiefvater, who owns Barley & Hops Pub and Beer Garden, took home 21.1 percent of the vote and will not advance to April's general election. The vote tallies remain unofficial until the Board of Canvassers verifies them Friday. A lifelong Oshkosh resident, Cummings has served on the Oshkosh Common Council for nine years, including the past four as mayor. He has said he wants to continue what he calls the progress and fiscal responsibility that resulted in such projects as the Oshkosh Riverwalk; the Menominee Nation Arena; a new Oshkosh Corp. headquarters; plus the revitalization of several properties on Washington Avenue. Palmeri is in her second term on the council (her first as deputy mayor). She has more than 25 years of experience in organizing neighborhoods and holds a master's degree in urban planning. She advocates accessible, approachable local government. She wants to continue making sure the city uses tax dollars efficiently and effectively, and that people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives feel welcomed and well-represented. *indicates candidates who will advance to the April general election BECOME A SUBSCRIBER: Full access to articles, videos and deals LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Get Oshkosh news in your feed FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: Check out photos and videos NEWSLETTERS: Get news in your inbox

Michael,Sylvester,2554,https://www.thestar.co.uk/our-towns-and-cities/rotherham/petition-aims-to-keep-deprived-community-s-name-in-the-public-eye-after-boundary-changes-1-9617842,"Under changes instigated by the Local Government Boundary Commission, ward boundaries and names will change in the borough, with the current Dalton, East Herringthorpe and Thrybergh ward among those being remodelled. In future it will be know as the Dalton and Thrybergh ward, although East Herringthorpe will still feature within its boundary. Now community campaigner Michael Sylvester has started action which he hopes will eventually see the East Herringthorpe name re-instated. That is important, he believes, to help ensure a community with many needs does not fall from the sight of the council’s decision-makers in future. Rotherham Council say the new name was set by the boundary commission, but Mr Sylvester said the council can opt to change ward names itself, under legislation dating from 2007. However, to do so the council would need to consult on the suggestion and would need two thirds of councillors to agree to the change. Mr Sylvester said: “It may seem like a little thing but East Herringthorpe is the most neglected and forgotten part of the local area and if we are to support those who work hard and have pride in the area, it will be important from the start to remind any new councillors that the estate should be seen as an equal part of the ward.” He will be gathering names on a petition to try to persuade the council it should move to keep the East Herringthorpe name in the ward’s identity. A Rotherham Council spokesman said: ""The decision to name the ward Dalton and Thrybergh was taken by Parliament on the recommendation of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE) following an open consultation, which included the opportunity to comment on ward names. Local councils have no decision making powers with regard to naming their wards."" ©2019 JPIMedia Ltd. All rights reserved.

Andrew,Davis,2521,http://tv5.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/26050128/gsp-vs-khabib-win,"You have come to the Philippines Edition, for other ESPN editions, click here. Georges St-Pierre addresses the mutual interest for a fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov, but the UFC has other plans for the lightweight champion. (0:50) Georges St-Pierre announced his retirement from mixed martial arts on Thursday. St-Pierre, who defended the UFC's welterweight belt nine straight times from 2008 to 2013, will go down as one of the greatest fighters in history. But the one thing that would have kept him from making this decision? A fight with current UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov. ""I knew [Nurmagomedov] wanted to fight me, and his message excited me,"" St-Pierre said at a news conference in Montreal. ""Unfortunately, it takes two fighters and also an organization to make that fight happen. The UFC has other plans for Khabib, and I wish him the best of luck."" But if that matchup were to come together, who would come out on top? We posed that question to our ESPN MMA contributors -- Brett Okamoto, Jeff Wagenheim, Phil Murphy, Chamatkar Sandhu, Eric Tamiso and Andrew Davis -- to find out. Georges St-Pierre announced his retirement from MMA on Thursday afternoon. For ESPN's Jeff Wagenheim, GSP will go down as the all-time best. Georges St-Pierre is the reason Ariel Helwani started covering mixed martial arts. As GSP retires, Helwani explains the fighter's importance to his life. Okamoto: I'm basically forced to go with youth here. St-Pierre is seven years older than Nurmagomedov, and he has logged nearly six hours of actual competition in the Octagon. That takes a toll. Nurmagomedov has never lost. I can't predict a man who is past the prime of his career would be the first to beat him -- even if that man is the greatest welterweight of all time. Now, GSP in his prime vs. Nurmagomedov? I'll lean St-Pierre on that one, how about that? And one more thing, for the record, I will not be disappointed if St-Pierre does, in fact, stay retired and this matchup never happens. He is the owner of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, résumés in MMA history. He has done enough. And Nurmagomedov has about 82 legitimate title contenders waiting in line at lightweight. I know the fight would be fun, but I don't need it. St-Pierre riding off into the sunset, on top, isn't the worst thing. Wagenheim: On Wednesday, minutes after news broke of St-Pierre's imminent retirement, I was put on the spot during our taping of ""The MMA Reporters"" podcast. Asked who'd win this hypothetical matchup, I danced around the question a bit before finally going with St-Pierre. I mean, how do you pick against the GOAT? I'm going to reverse course here, though. This is not simply my wishy-washy way of covering all of my bases. I just got to thinking about what we've seen over the past few weeks: older, inactive legends getting outgunned by younger stars. It happened to Cain Velasquez. It happened to Anderson Silva. If we were matching GSP in the prime of his career against today's Khabib, I would shout my prediction from the rooftop. That version of Georges had wrestling sharp enough to keep the fight standing, where he'd pick the Dagestani apart. But now? St-Pierre has fought once in the past 5½ years. In two months, he will turn 38. Nurmagomedov has never been beaten. You know who else is undefeated? Father Time. Sandhu: I never pick against an undefeated fighter and wouldn't do so in this potential scenario, either. Khabib Nurmagomedov is younger and very much in his prime. If we were talking about a St-Pierre from seven or eight years ago, then I might be inclined to pick the Canadian. Another thing to take into consideration would be the weight class. In his Instagram post, Khabib indicated a fight taking place at 155 or 160 pounds. Georges has never fought at that weight, and although he has been looking very svelte of late, I'd have to think cutting that much weight would have a detrimental impact on his performance. Khabib all day long. Murphy: First, we need to establish whether this is GSP today or GSP at his peak in the late aughts. The latter is among the all-time MMA greats (No. 2, for me, for what it's worth). That St-Pierre comfortably beats the smaller Nurmagomedov. Assuming we're predicting a potential GSP-Khabib for this fall, career arcs make things much more competitive, though I doubt the result differs too greatly. There's a worn-out adage: Styles make fights. I'm left questioning how Khabib beats GSP. GSP has a 6-inch reach advantage, probably would carry more weight on fight night and has proved far sharper on the feet -- though Khabib's striking did look fantastic while beating Conor McGregor. Khabib's ""lead blanket of death"" offense requires he take down an opponent. GSP allowed 10 takedowns in 28 career fights, many against very decorated grapplers. I think St-Pierre's calculated movement, precise striking and a Firas Zahabi game plan would lead to a win, much like when he beat Jake Shields at UFC 129: not terribly sexy but efficient enough to get his hand raised. Tamiso: With all due respect to GSP, Khabib would dominate this fight and it wouldn't be close. There would be too many questions about St-Pierre going into a fight later in 2019. How would he look at age 38? How would he look after two years away, and one fight in the past six? What would cutting down to 155/160 pounds do to him? Given the issues he had getting to his last fight vs. Michael Bisping, I'd take the unbeaten fighter we've seen very few issues with. If there were some alternate universe where you could see this version of Nurmagomedov vs. GSP circa 2010, I might have a different answer. A prime GSP and his coaching could have the key to unlock the Khabib code, but we'll never know. Davis: If the UFC had made this matchup for the lightweight title, I think we'd be looking at the first three-division champion in company history in St-Pierre. This fight is intriguing in the sense that these guys put almost every UFC fighter they've faced on their back. According to UFC Stats, St-Pierre scored a takedown in all but two UFC fights, and the same goes for Khabib. When it comes to takedown defense, St-Pierre has an 84 percent takedown defense (eight takedowns allowed), and Khabib is at 83 percent (two takedowns allowed). Eliminating the ground game, the fight moves to the stand-up and championship-round experience in determining the winner for me. St-Pierre landed 65 percent of his total offense from distance or the clinch. From his highlight reel, we've come to see those strikes come in the simplest form with jabs (UFC 124 vs. Josh Koscheck), as well as more complex strikes like spin kicks (UFC 129 vs. Jake Shields) and superman punches (UFC 167 vs. Johny Hendricks). I don't see Khabib having enough awareness to stop those strikes and be able to counter with his own. Despite that, I'd see this fight going to the championship rounds, a place GSP has been nine times in his UFC career. Khabib has been there as well in his past two fights, but I believe that championship-round experience coupled with the competition St-Pierre faced in his career would be the difference in this dream bout.

Andrew,Davis,2536,https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/vivendi-steps-pressure-telecom-italia-120142217.html,"Sign up to our daily brief. (Bloomberg) -- Vivendi SA has stepped up its campaign to shake up the board of Telecom Italia SpA at the phone carrier’s annual meeting next month and signaled more openness to deals such as a merger of its landline network with a rival. In a 48-page document that outlines concerns with five directors backed by Elliott Management Corp., Telecom Italia’s largest shareholder reiterated calls to replace them with candidates proposed by the French media company. “Vivendi believes that only such a board will have the credibility and trust of all shareholders to objectively analyze any industrial strategic options, including those for Telecom Italia’s fixed network,” it said. Vivendi and the U.S. activist investor Elliott have been battling over the future of the former phone monopoly for almost a year. The two top shareholders disagree about what strategy to pursue to turn around the indebted carrier, which is contending with declining sales and profits in its home market amid rising competition. Vivendi’s influence was weakened when Elliott’s slate won the majority of board seats last May. Elliott has proposed asset disposals -- including the spinoff of the carrier’s landline network -- and in November put in place Telecom Italia Chief Executive Officer Luigi Gubitosi, after ousting Vivendi-backed Amos Genish. On Sunday, Vivendi said it was open to a merger of Telecom Italia’s landline network with alternative provider Open Fiber SpA that Elliott has proposed. “Vivendi believes that Telecom Italia’s fixed network is core to its value creation,” it said in the presentation. “Vivendi is ready to support a merger of Open Fiber with TIM if the conditions are right and fair from an operational, financial and regulatory standpoint” and overseen by a board controlled by independent directors. Telecom Italia’s shares, which have lost around a quarter of their value in the past year, rose 1.1 percent as of 10:23 a.m. in Milan. Vivendi shares rose 0.1 percent in Paris. Vivendi said it may also support any possible sale of nonstrategic assets, restoring dividend payments on Telecom Italia’s common shares and a “simplification of capital structure.” One such measure proposed by Gubitosi is the conversion of saving shares into common stock. Vivendi proposes to replace Elliott representatives Fulvio Conti, Alfredo Altavilla, Massimo Ferrari, Paola Giannotti de Ponti and Dante Roscini with its candidates Franco Bernabe, Gabriele Galateri di Genola, Flavia Mazzarella, Rob van der Valk and Francesco Vatalaro at Telecom Italia’s next annual general meeting on March 29. The candidates will make the board more neutral, “leaving no single party in control,” Vivendi said. It said only two of the Vivendi-backed nominees will not be independent, and neither of them will be a candidate for chairman. A representative for Elliott in Italy declined to comment.

Michael,Gordon,2506,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190218/jury-recommends-death-sentence-for-michael-gordon-in-brutal-stabbing-deaths-of-polk-mom-patricia-moran-daughter-deborah-royal,"Last week, the same 12 jurors deliberated about six hours before convicting Michael Gordon of first-degree murder for the stabbing deaths of Haines City mother Patricia Moran and her daughter, Deborah Royal, on Jan. 15, 2015. BARTOW — By unanimous vote, jurors agreed Monday to recommend that convicted murderer Michael Anthony Gordon be executed for the brutal home-invasion killings of two Haines City women in 2015. Gordon, 39, wearing a light-blue Oxford shirt, a gray cable-knit sweater vest, black slacks and shackles on his ankles, showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Jalal Harb read the jury’s decision. But as Harb was thanking the 12 jurors for their service, Gordon smiled and waved to a reporter videotaping the proceedings. The jury deliberated about five hours Monday to reach its verdict, which is solely a recommendation. The final decision on sentencing rests with Harb, who must, however, give the recommendation great weight in making his decision. No sentencing date was set Monday, but Harb scheduled a status hearing for April 26. Last week, the same 12 jurors deliberated about six hours before convicting Gordon of first-degree murder for the stabbing deaths of Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal, on Jan. 15, 2015. Jurors also found him guilty of robbing the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale with three other assailants earlier that day, and firing on law enforcement during a pursuit that ended in the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City. The first to be caught was Devonere McCune, 26, who was taken into custody moments after the assailants’ car crashed near the entrance to the subdivision and the four ran from the car. Gordon would be captured next after murdering the women and crashing Moran’s car through the garage door of her home in an attempt to escape, according to court testimony. He drove across an open field, amid gunfire from officers, before slamming into an embankment along Lake Confusion. He was shot four times, but recovered. On Monday, in his closing argument to jurors, Assistant State Attorney Paul Wallace argued four reasons for recommending the death penalty, including Gordon’s violent past and the cruelty of the murders. Prosecutors are limited to 16 statutory reasons for seeking the death penalty, while defense lawyers are unlimited in presenting arguments for mandatory life imprisonment. Wallace stepped through previous convictions against Gordon involving violent crimes, including a Lakeland shooting that left a man injured and a 2005 prison stabbing, in which Gordon was charged with using a blade carved from a toothbrush. Wallace also recounted the vicious nature of the killings, and Gordon’s efforts to avoid capture after the pawn shop robbery. “The only reason he took a life was because he was bound and determined that he was going to avoid being arrested for the crimes that he had already committed on that particular day,” Wallace told jurors. “Patricia did not pose a threat to him other than being able to scream out and alert the officers who were coming by then, by the dozens, to flood the whole neighborhood. That is why he cut her throat, to prevent her from being able to cry out, and that is why he continued to stab her even though she valiantly fought for her life.” In his closing statement Monday, Clearwater defense lawyer Bjorn Brunvand reminded jurors that Gordon has been diagnosed with brain damage, likely dating to infancy and exacerbated by his father’s physical abuse, according to defense testimony. He said the damage to Gordon’s brain is concentrated in an area that causes him to react violently when angry. “His brain doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to function,” he told jurors. The problems, Brunvand said, began surfacing as early as grade school. “He was constantly getting in trouble, constantly doing things he wasn’t supposed to be doing,” he said. “That corroborates that something was going on with him at the time that basically caused him not to be able to act in the manner and the way that we’re supposed to.” Upon his release from prison in April 2014 after serving nine years for an aggravated battery conviction, Gordon failed to take his prescription medication regularly and began self-medicating with street drugs, including synthetic marijuana, Brunvand told jurors Monday. “Not only do we have brain damage, but we have someone whose brain is clouded by this behavior and by the use of these drugs and the actions of the psychotropic drugs,” he said. “So you say, well, he can make decisions. He should have made better decisions. The problem with that is he can’t make better decisions.” After Harb announced the jury’s decision Monday, Mary Feiock expressed relief that the jury recommended death for the killer of her mother and her sister, but said the memories of the trial will continue to haunt her. “I’m glad it’s over, but to have sat there and have heard what he did to them, and to know that my sister came out and saw my mother like that, and how much pain they were in — it’s going to take a long time to get past that,” she said after court. Gordon is the second of four co-defendants to face a jury in the 2015 rampage. In October, Terrell Williams was sentenced to life in prison after a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, armed robbery and attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, among other charges. He and co-defendant Jovan Lamb were arrested within hours of Gordon’s capture. Williams, 33, was convicted under the state’s felony murder law, which holds all co-defendants legally responsible when someone is killed during the commission of a violent crime, including armed robbery. Jovan Lamb, 33, is scheduled for trial in September, but no trial date has been set for McCune. They are both being held without bail in the Polk County Jail pending trial.

Michael,Sylvester,2497,https://bangordailynews.com/2019/02/19/news/state/mainers-rally-to-protest-trumps-border-emergency-declaration/,"Dozens of protesters gathered at Portland’s Lobstermen’s Park Monday afternoon to oppose President Donald Trump’s declaration of a national emergency last week to help fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The declaration came after federal lawmakers reached a deal to avoid a government shutdown and increase border spending by more than $1 billion. Trump signed the deal, but then declared the emergency, which would allow the president to side step Congress and redirect an additional $6.5 billion to the border. Grayson Lookner, one of the organizers of Monday’s event, said the president’s declaration is yet another abuse of presidential power. [Maine among states suing over Trump’s border ‘emergency’] “Declaring this emergency is just making it visible,” Lookner said. “Like, there is no respect for rule of law, for all of these things we take for granted in this democracy we live in. This nominal democracy.” State Rep. Michael Sylvester, a Portland Democrat, said the protests are intended to show that many Americans are opposed to divisive policies. “We’re out here to say, the only thing that makes this country great is if we unite, if our policies help everybody, and if we don’t work out of fear, but rather out of a sense of commonality,” Sylvester said. Similar protests were planned nationwide on Monday, including events in Augusta and Bangor. All four members of Maine’s congressional delegation, including Republican Sen. Susan Collins, have voiced opposition to the emergency declaration. And several federal lawmakers, including Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree, said they would support a resolution disapproving of Trump’s declaration. This article appears through a media partnership with Maine Public. Have feedback? Want to know more?

BARTOW — Brain damage from childhood injuries, repeated beatings by his father and drug usage left convicted murderer Michael Anthony Gordon unstable and unable to control his aggressive impulses, doctors in the penalty phase of his trial testified Thursday. Michele Quiroga, a clinical neuropsychologist in Coral Gables, said Gordon requires ongoing medication to maintain control in his life, and in the weeks leading up to the murders of Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, in January 2015, Gordon wasn’t medicated. Another medical expert, Dr. Joseph Wu, told jurors that scans of Gordon’s brain revealed abnormalities in the front of his brain, likely caused by injuries and resulting in aggressive impulses. The medical testimony came Thursday as Gordon’s lawyers mounted a case against imposing the death penalty, which prosecutors are seeking. The defense team is expected to present more medical testimony Friday. Prosecutors have relied largely on testimony and evidence presented in the last three weeks during the guilt phase of Gordon’s trial. On Tuesday, jurors deliberated nearly six hours before finding him guilty of first-degree murder for each of the killings, along with 12 related charges in the January 2015 crime rampage. It began with an armed robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale, which led to a pursuit with law enforcement and ended with the murders of the two women in their Chanler Ridge home in Haines City. Gordon, who will be 39 Friday, was convicted of forcing his way into the women’s home as he ran from police. The women were stabbed more than 50 times each. Gordon had slashed Royal’s throat down to her spine. Prosecutors have presented evidence that Gordon served 10 years in prison for aggravated battery stemming from a shooting, and was released in April 2014 — nine months before the murders. They also argued that he killed the women to evade capture, and that the killings were particularly vicious. But Clearwater lawyer Bjorn Brunvand, representing Gordon, told jurors that his medical issues outweigh the brutality of the crime and his record of violent crimes. On Thursday, Wu said Gordon’s IQ was measured at 80 when he was in the second grade, but had fallen to 70 in recent testing, suggesting additional brain damage in the past 30 years.

Michael,Gordon,2469,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190213/death-penalty-phase-begins-for-michael-gordon,"After weeks remaining stoic during his first-degree murder trial, Michael Anthony Gordon lost control Wednesday, breaking down in tears as his lawyer addressed the jury and shouting at a witness who was testifying about a jailhouse stabbing. BARTOW — After weeks remaining stoic during his first-degree murder trial, Michael Anthony Gordon lost control Wednesday, breaking down in tears as his lawyer addressed the jury and shouting at a witness who was testifying about a jailhouse stabbing. His outbursts came during the first day in the penalty phase of his trial. The 12-member jury convicted him Tuesday of brutally stabbing two Haines City women to death in a January 2015 home invasion. And because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, the same jurors began hearing additional testimony Wednesday. Based on the trial and penalty evidence, the jury will recommend whether Gordon should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment for the murders. Among the reasons prosecutors are arguing he should be sentenced to death is Gordon’s history of violence, including his conviction for an attack on another inmate while in custody. From the witness stand, Rasmes Simeon was telling the jury Wednesday that Gordon had stabbed him with a shank made from a prison-issued toothbrush. Gordon, who will be 39 Friday, began shouting at Simeon. “You had a knife on you,” he said. “Tell them the truth. You had a knife, that’s why. You was a bully. You was bullying everybody. Big bad Haitian Jack. Haitian Jack, the drug dealer that run Winter Haven.” As Gordon continued to shout, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb had court bailiffs escort the jury from the courtroom. “Everybody scared of you,” Gordon said, “coming in here with all your diamonds and your jewels on.” At one point, outside the jury’s presence, a court bailiff told Gordon he needed to shut up. “I shut up when I want to,” Gordon responded. Earlier in the day, when Clearwater lawyer Bjorn Brunvand addressed the jury, he discussed Gordon’s difficult upbringing, with an alcoholic father who abused him and his sister. He told them his sister had left home when she was 12, and will testify that she still regrets having left her brother in that situation. “To this day, she regrets that she left Michael Gordon behind — that she left him with a father who she knew was abusive,” he said, “and a mother who was unable and not capable of taking care of him and protecting him.” At that moment, Gordon fell into tears, his shoulders heaving as he wiped his eyes. “We’re not expecting that you will necessarily see God in Michael Gordon,” Brunvand said. “But we hope ... that you will see that Michael Gordon, despite the conviction, despite the horrific acts that he has participated in, is a fellow human being, a fellow man, a scared little boy inside that big man’s body of his.” He said Gordon appears to have experienced an injury as a child that affected the frontal lobe of his brain. “It’s the part of the brain that helps you respond appropriately when you are faced with fear,” Brunvand said. “It’s not working for Michael Gordon.” Medication enables Gordon to maintain control, he said, and for the decade he was in prison from 2005 until April 2014, the medication enabled him to live with others. But he wasn’t taking the medication after his release, and he started self-medicating with street drugs. “You will hear from a doctor, a pharmacologist, who will explain how that impacted him and how that may have affected what happened in this case,” he said. But Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme told jurors the viciousness of the killings can’t be ignored. “They are fighting for their lives,” she said, “all the while feeling what is going on.” Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, each was stabbed more than 50 times, and their throats were slashed so deeply, Royal was almost decapitated. Testimony is scheduled to continue today in the penalty phase, and jurors are expected to deliberate a recommendation by the end of the week. The final decision on sentencing will rest with Harb.

Michael,Gordon,2538,https://www.murrayvalleystandard.com.au/story/5922824/titans-shopping-for-sustained-nrl-success/%3Fcs%3D13102,"This time last year, Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan was just another bloke waiting in line at the deli. Now he can tell the punters in the fruit and vegie aisle of the local Burleigh Heads supermarket that his Titans are in for a big year. Brennan jokes about the nuisance his emerging profile has caused but the proud mentor knows it means the NRL club's rebuild is on track. ""Last year they didn't know who I was and I could do my shopping in peace,"" he said. ""But it's great, the passion is there and there's a connection with the community ... I think the community lost connection with the team."" Conceding the Titans had been on the nose, Brennan thinks things are turning as they aim for just their second finals appearance since 2011. ""They've probably brought it on themselves; they've had their fair share of scandals,"" Brennan said of the club's rocky road. ""But you win and they'll come and the junior base here is as good as anywhere. ""There's a buzz around the place; you go down the shops now and people are saying it's going to be our year."" The addition of Mal Meninga and Trevor Gillmeister as full-time staff have given the club renewed clout. New owners, a new chief executive and another year alongside Dennis Watt and Phil Moss in the football department has allowed Brennan to narrow his focus in 2019. ""It was hectic; I was doing a lot of different jobs but now I'm just coaching the footy team which is what I get paid to do and what I'll be judged on,"" he said. ""Everyone wanted to know who Garth Brennan was; I was juggling rosters, recruiting and winning the community back and getting them to understand my vision for the club."" Brennan hopes a ramped-up grassroots program will result in more local talent in Titans uniforms down the track. He is buoyed by the talent presently available though, with Shannon Boyd, Brian Kelly, Tyrone Roberts and Tyrone Peachey adding depth that wasn't there last year. ""Last year some guys didn't put the hard work into preseason because they knew they'd get picked,"" Brennan admitted. ""This year you look at someone like Brenko Lee - he's as fit as he's ever been because he's turned up and seen (fellow backs) Kelly and Peach. ""That's off nothing magical I've said, just him looking around."" Veteran fullback Michael Gordon was one of the side's best last season but could be pushed out by AJ Brimson, while a fit Bryce Cartwright provides an unknown quantity, and halfback Ashley Taylor will have added creative flair around him in Roberts and Peachey. All that bodes well for Brennan's quest for sustained finals appearances that, ""with a bit of luck"", will begin this year. ""I think the bookies still have us down the bottom somewhere and that's fine,"" he said. ""But every year new sides tend to sneak in.""

A job opening for Jussie Smollett BARTOW, Fla. (AP) - A Florida man faces the death penalty for fatally stabbing two women. The Ledger reports that a Polk County jury unanimously recommended execution Monday for 39-year-old Michael Gordon. A judge will make the final decision. Gordon was convicted of first-degree murder last week. Authorities say Gordon, Terrell Williams, Devonere McCune and Jovan Lamb robbed an Auburndale pawn shop in January 2015. McCune was arrested after a shootout with police. Responding deputies went to a nearby home and found the bodies of 72-year-old Patricia Moran and her 51-year-old daughter Deborah Royal. Authorities say Williams, Gordon and Lamb were arrested after trying to flee in the victims’ car. Williams was convicted of felony murder and sentenced to life in prison. Lamb and McCune are awaiting trial. ___ Information from: The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.), http://www.theledger.com Copyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

She was 17-years-old at the time of the offence and cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Justice R. Shawn Smith erred by: misapprehending evidence; failing to consider the evidence as a whole; making findings of fact unsupported by evidence; and failing to give reasons for his decision, argues the appeal, submitted by Andrew Davis. Dong, 37, and three others were in a vehicle headed out of Saskatoon in October 2016. They were drinking and doing drugs when the accused and another man got out of the vehicle and started beating Dong because he wouldn’t admit to stealing from them. According to an agreed statement of facts, the woman stabbed Dong six times. The Crown says it will seek an adult sentence while the defence is asking for a youth sentence. Sentencing is set for May 16. Corman Park police have laid a charge under the Animal Protection Act against a horse owner who claimed his horses had been shot. weather Change city Advertisement Use of this Website assumes acceptance of Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy © 2019 All rights reserved.

Michael,Gordon,2462,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190212/gordon-guilty-of-murdering-2-haines-city-women,"BARTOW — Mary Feiock quietly wept in a Polk County courtroom Tuesday as Circuit Judge Jalal Harb read the verdict in Michael Anthony Gordon’s murder trial. Guilty for the murder of her mother, Patricia Moran. Guilty for the murder of her only sister, Deborah Royal. The women were stabbed in a brutal home-invasion double-murder in January 2015. After three weeks of testimony, jurors deliberated nearly six hours Tuesday before convicting Gordon of the murders and the attempted murders of law enforcement officers who were fired upon while pursuing Gordon’s car. They also found him guilty of robbing an Auburndale pawn shop, which initiated the crime rampage that led to the killings. Gordon, 38, sat motionless and without expression, his eyes fixed on Harb, as the guilty verdict in each of the 14 counts against him was announced. Behind the defense table, his ankles were shackled. Wednesday, the same jurors will return to hear testimony regarding Gordon’s punishment. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against him, and the jury of eight men and four women will recommend either mandatory life in prison or death by lethal injection. The final decision will rest with Harb. Prosecutors intend to argue four statutory reasons for imposing the death penalty, including that Gordon murdered the women to avoid capture and that the murders were particularly vicious. During the trial, jurors heard that Moran, 72, was stabbed 57 times, and her daughter, 51-year-old Royal, 54 times. Their throats were slit, and the wound on Royal’s neck cut down to her spine, according to court testimony. Gordon is the second of four co-defendants to be convicted of robbery and the women’s murders. Terrell Williams, 33, was sentenced to life imprisonment in October after a jury found him guilty. The other two defendants — Devonere McCune, 26, and Jovan Lamb, 33 — remain in the Polk County Jail without bail awaiting trial. The rampage began in the late afternoon of Jan. 15, 2015, when three armed men wearing masks robbed the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale while Lamb, alleged to be the getaway driver, waited outside. When scooping jewelry from a shattered display case, they unknowingly grabbed a GPS tracker that enabled law enforcement to pursue them as they sped toward Haines City. The chase ended when the four assailants crashed their car near the entrance to the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City. McCune was the first to be captured when a K-9 trapped him near the car. The other three ran, but would be apprehended within hours. Gordon was taken into custody after crashing through Moran’s garage door in her car and driving across an open field before slamming into an embankment along the shoreline of Lake Confusion. As he was being taken into custody, officers discovered the bodies of the two women inside Moran’s house, along with a single tennis shoe and a pair of gloves with a logo stamped on the back. During the trial, prosecutors presented surveillance video from the Auburndale robbery showing Gordon wearing gloves bearing the same logo and shoes like the one found at the murder scene. Officers also found bloody clothes in the women’s washing machine that prosecutors said Gordon had been wearing in the pawn shop’s surveillance video. One of the bloody shirts had Gordon’s DNA on the collar, according to court testimony. Clearwater defense lawyer Jervis Wise, representing Gordon, told jurors Williams and Lamb were still on the run when the women were murdered, and suggested their involvement in the killings. He said Gordon was escaping a bad situation when he used Moran’s car to flee. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070.

Andrew,Davis,2470,https://theappalachianonline.com/2019/02/14/app-states-relationship-with-google-raises-concerns-over-data-privacy/,"Mack Foley, A&C Reporter|February 14, 2019 In late January, Google briefly saw its license to internally distribute apps on iOS revoked after Apple discovered it was sharing them with non-employee personnel. The app, called Screenwise Meter, was an opt-in program that monitored how people were using their iPhones and compiled that data in exchange for a nominal gift card each month. The company’s ban lasted less than a day, but it was another brief glimpse into Google’s actual business: the collection and monetization of user data. When using Google’s collection of apps and programs, it’s easy to think that users are customers, but in reality, it’s more like a consolation prize. The average user isn’t Google’s actual consumer, said Andrew Davis, visiting communication professor. “We are Google’s product, not their customer,” Davis said. “We are their endpoint user, in some sense, but we are their product and their workforce.” One thing that allowed Google to break away from its contemporaries in the late 2000s was giving people access to reliable services that looked nice and ran smoothly for no price. For the average user, everything was free. The catch is that Google scrapes data from users’ emails, documents, calendars, locations and more and sells that information to advertisers, who then feed users ads tailored to them personally. This model was almost unprecedentedly successful for Google, which squashed out its competition and now controls almost 93 percent of web searches across the world. As such, it’s difficult to avoid Google, even if you disagree with its practices regarding data use. For students and faculty at App State, it’s even harder to avoid, considering the UNC System licenses Google Suite for Education for campuses across North Carolina. Google’s services fall into a legal gray area. Almost no one is comfortable with the company harvesting their personal information, but it’s almost impossible to do anything about it. Google’s terms of service are convoluted to keep users and politicians from decoding and taking action against the company. Legislators don’t know enough to keep Google, or anyone in Silicon Valley, in check. “Look at Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony in front of congress this past summer,” Davis said. “You have these senators who, through their questions, demonstrate that they have no idea what they’re talking about when it comes to this technology. Lawmakers, while possibly being good at what they do, are very bad at understanding technological developments.” What does this mean for students and faculty at App State? It means they’re most likely being taken advantage of with no real recourse. “Google does not share personal information with third parties, except in the limited circumstances outlined in our privacy policy,” according to the G Suite for Education privacy policy. Digging into that privacy policy a bit reveals that Google still allows its partners to parse through App State’s data from its browsers and devices for advertising purposes. Just attending or working at App State eliminates any agency people would have regarding their online privacy. Targeted advertisements and monetized propaganda are a side effect of being at App State. Google can put users and institutions in uncomfortable situations because of how necessary services like G Suite are, said Larry Bridges, a computer science lecturer at App State. “These solutions have become pretty important,” Bridges said. “Not only in corporate America or in business, but in education too. We have to do what we have to do to educate, so you really need those services.” Packages like G Suite allow institutions to unify their online programs, connecting departments, students and staff alike in ways that are incredibly difficult and costly without them. “It’s kind of like a necessary evil,” Bridges said. “We have to give some of our data and then we rely on being smart people. We have to understand, follow up and see what they’re doing, as well as work through legislature and user communities to try to influence them.” There’s no easy solution to cutting Google out, but what users can do is look at the company with scrutiny. What little online privacy remains in 2019 is in the hands of users, who can criticize and pressure for change. They can take some time to read through terms of services that they’ve blown by for years. If the terms don’t make sense, some organizations online simplify parts and boil them down for folks to understand. If people don’t understand these companies, they will, without fail, continue to exploit them.

Bernard,Osher,2523,https://www.seattletimes.com/explore/special-sections/never-stop-learning-seattle-area-noncredit-classes-that-will-grow-your-mind/,"University of Washington’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and One Day University feature lectures and courses on a broad range of topics, from art history to current events. No papers. No grades. Just the joy of learning. That’s why Linda Farrell regularly walks a short path from her home at an active adult community called Trilogy at Redmond Ridge to classes sponsored by the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Washington, part of its Continuum College. “I’ve been taking classes right and left, in whatever sparks my interest,” Farrell says. Of course, there’s a little work for some classes, she admits. “For one class on Marxism, we had to read ‘The Communist Manifesto,’ ” she says. “There’s some homework, but never a test, and you don’t have to do the homework. Most classes are lecture format, with a ton of Q-and-A [time].” Here are a few options available locally for those who want to soak up knowledge without pursuing a degree or certificate. Osher Lifeling Learning OLLI-UW classes are designed for adults 50 and older and are offered all over Puget Sound, from Everett to Issaquah to Seattle. The courses draw from a wide range of fields and are taught by current and retired UW faculty or experts from the community. Winter 2019’s slate includes “Geomorphology: The Study of Landforms,” “Andrew Jackson: The First Populist President,” “Introduction to Modern Short Fiction;” and “Contemporary Ethics I.” The classes encourage new friendships and provide learning opportunities via a membership to the program, which is $35 per year. OLLI-UW membership gives access to courses, free member programs, access to UW libraries and more. OLLI-UW is one of 122 Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes on U.S. campuses, launched by philanthropist Bernard Osher in 2001, which have a similar mission — noncredit courses, no assignments, no grades — for “seasoned” adults, in the institute’s words. Some professors, admittedly, appreciate teaching adult students who already know who Ronald Reagan was — no explanation necessary, says Natalie Lecher, director of OLLI-UW. “Professors enjoy the experience too, and engaging with the audience,” says Lecher. “The professors are really passionate about their topics.” Summer brings field trips, such as guided art-museum tours with art historians. Year-round offerings include free, weekly meetings that are designed and led by members and focused on a chosen topic or book, ranging from a Mercer Island group on current events to a Everett book group working through classic literature. OLLI-UW has about 1,000 members on average, per year, with rolling enrollment — so students can sign up as they wish, says Lecher. In fall, winter, and spring, about 20 courses are offered throughout OLLI-UW’s locations, typically meeting for two hours per week, for three to five weeks. Members pay between $30–$50 per course. The program aims to keep fees low since many members have a fixed income. Lunch & Learn Another option for “seasoned” adult education is the Lunch & Learn program, OLLI-UW-sponsored, free noontime talks by experts on a wide range of subjects; members only need bring their lunch and optionally, a guest. Farrell, who retired from the Woodland Park Zoo’s education department, coordinates Lunch & Learn offerings at Trilogy. She recently brought in a conservation specialist who talked about the zoo’s conservation programs and wolverine project. “We get 150 people at these lectures,” she says. “We’re having one on media ethics. We have a full house and a waiting list for that one.” A sample of upcoming winter lectures: “Spotting Fake Health News,” “Hummingbirds: Masters of the Air,” “Washington’s History in 10 Songs,” and lectures on veteran privacy, happiness and Woody Guthrie’s FBI files. Members might have always been curious about some topics, but never before had the ability to study nature or history, art or science, says Lecher, who cites a lecture on orcas by a NOAA scientist as a standout. “So many of us retired people have the opportunity to delve into learning like we never did before,” Farrell says, thanks to Osher. “When you’re working or have kids you can’t find time or inclination. Now we have the time. And definitely the inclination.” One Day University A few times a year, The Seattle Times presents live talks by top professors from around the country at One Day University. The next session will be held March 30 from 9 a.m. to 12:55 p.m. at UW’s Kane Hall. Lecture topics include “World War I in America: What Really Happened, and Why it Matters” by Jennifer Keene, of Chapman University; “When Empires Collapse: What Can Americans Learn from Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome?” by Kara Cooney, of UCLA; and “American Immigration: Myths and Realities,” by Jeremi Suri, of University of Texas. Admission to One Day University usually costs $159, but readers who register here using the code SEA119 will save $40. — OLLI-UW locations Everett: Carl Gipson Senior Center Issaquah: University House Issaquah Mill Creek: Mill Creek Senior Center Mukilteo: Rosehill Community Center Redmond: Trilogy at Redmond Ridge Mercer Island: • Mercer Island Community & Event Center • Stroum Jewish Community Center Seattle: • Magnuson Park — The Brig Building 406 • Mirabella (downtown) • The Lakeshore • University House (Wallingford) • UW main campus

Jane,Powers,2473,https://www.enca.com/life/zimbabwe-cancels-flagship-arts-festival,"Latest Election News » This year's edition of Zimbabwe's flagship Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) has been called off. HARARE, Zimbabwe - This year's edition of Zimbabwe's flagship Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) has been called off due to the social and economic crisis, organisers announced Friday. ""HIFA will not stage the event in 2019,"" they said in a statement, adding ""the decision has been taken after much thought, soul-searching and discussion"". READ: Zimbabweans in SA to honour Mtukudzi at Zoo lake ""Zimbabwe is dealing with many important issues, both social and economic,"" it said. Zimbabwe has been battered by years of economic misery and in recent months been roiled by high inflation, a currency crisis and shortages of basic commodities. Annual inflation shot to 56.90 percent up from 42.09 percent in December 2018, according to official statistics released Friday, the highest increase in a decade. Economists say in reality prices have gone up more than three fold in recent months. ""It is obvious that the nation is seized with incredibly momentous and all-pervading matters that naturally, inevitably and clearly affect the feasibility and viability of any undertaking whatsoever and that the full focus of the nation should be on those issues,"" HIFA director Simba Tafadzwa told AFP. READ: Zimbabwe declares Oliver Mtukudzi national hero ""It is in those conditions and under those circumstances that HIFA is unable to responsibly commit to staging an event that is feasible, viable and a service to artists, audiences and the nation at large."" Founded in 1999, HIFA was first cancelled in 2002 and then abandoned again in 2016 as Zimbabwe's economy crumbled and left desperate locals unable to withdraw money from banks. Despite many sponsors pulling out, the following two years, festival organisers revived the event which is normally held in Harare's central park. HIFA is Zimbabwe’s largest and one of Africa's top arts and cultural festivals bringing together local, regional and international artists, and draws huge audiences. In previous years HIFA has brought together international artists including Malian singer Habib Koite, Portuguese Sara Tavares, Penelope Jane Powers from South Africa and a host of local performers such as the late Oliver 'Tuku' Mtukudzi who died last month.

John,O'Neil,2466,https://pcherald.com/node/1805,"Pickens County Medical Center is located in Carrollton. By BRIAN HAMILTON, Editor Pickens County Medical Center is entering into an agreement to partner with Boa Vida Healthcare, which will allow the hospital to maintain current operations and provide additional services to the community. Last February, PCMC brought in John O’Neil, the former CEO of St. Vincent’s Hospital, to be the hospital’s CEO and help identify a strategic partner to lead the hospital in the future. “John was brought on board to help steer us through the Delta Regional grant,” PCMC hospital board chairman Shawn McDaniel said. “Pickens County Medical Center was one of the ten hospitals from the southeast that was chosen, and the only one in Alabama.” O’Neil has worked with the PCMC board of directors for the last year to develop a partnership that would bring sustainability for the organization. With the help of the county commissioners, the PCMC board members and O’Neil, the Medical Center was able to partner with Boa Vida Healthcare. “As the board chair, I am grateful for John O’Neil and his leadership over the past year. I’m thankful for the hospital board and the support of the county commission, as well as the friends of the hospital,” McDaniel said. See complete story in the Pickens County Herald.

James,Forese,2552,https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/web-bosses-disagree-on-5g/,"Panellists offered differing views on the potential of 5G, with Niantic co-founder John Hanke (pictured) stating it is key to the company’s future, while Groupon chief Richard Williams dismissed the technology, insisting it won’t be a game changer. In today’s second keynote, Williams argued that for the business and retail sector, the real disruption came with smartphones and apps, as he questioned 5G’s future impact. “I’ve seen 5G mentioned everywhere at the show but no one can explain to me what it means,” he said. Williams added that, in his sector, it is more important to build a seamless experience, connecting more deeply with customers on a daily basis, and finding the right “enabler” whether that’s machine learning, AR, VR, chatbots or virtual assistants. 5G the AR future Also speaking, Hanke said the company has already pushed LTE networks to their maximum with its AR games and 5G is now key to the company and the technology’s future. “We are here because we are excited about 5G… We need 5G to deliver the kinds of experiences we want to offer,” Hanke said at Tuesday’s second keynote. The company behind the Pokemon Go phenomenon said its mission is to bring people closer together and for this reason it holds events which can sometimes be attended by 100,000 people in one tight space, all playing games that put a big strain on networks – something 4G wasn’t designed for. And that’s not the only reason it needs 5G. It recently demoed a “real-time multi player augmented reality” game called Codename: Neon, where all players are being tracked and their position is then shared with other players. “All their actions are being shared and this is a demonstration of the kinds of AR experiences we want to build,” adding that mobile edge computing is also essential. “Yes, 5G has been hyped but this is one of those paradigm changes that happens once a decade or every couple of decades,” he added. In the keynote, Citi President James Forese then addressed local partnerships, which he said are key to bringing financial services to the 1.7 billion people in this world who are unbanked. “The banking industry has suffered a break in trust… we have issues reaching communities, they are distrustful of institutions,” he said, adding the company had issues reaching areas even in countries where it has operated for years.

The building located at Lot 94 Carmichael Street, Cummingsburg, Georgetown was renamed the Valerie Rodway House in honour of Rodway’s work as a musician and her contribution to Guyana. The building houses the Ministry of the Presidency’s Public Information and Press Service (PIPS) Unit and the National Trust of Guyana. A commemorative stamp, issued by the Guyana Post Office Corporation was also unveiled at the ceremony which was held in front of the building. “Valerie Rodway’s talent was that she moved beyond ethnicity, beyond religion, beyond the prejudices of being urban or rural and she helped us to discover our ‘Guyaneseness’. When you read what she wrote and listen to what was played… there is no prejudice… this is all about Guyana, all about us,” the Head of State said. President David Granger (left) and Professor at the Scripps College of Communication, Ohio University, Vibart Cambridge. In this vein, the President said the Valerie Rodway House serves as more than an edifice but as an education facility for Guyanese and he reiterated his call for closer attention to be paid not only to Ms. Rodway’s repertoire of Guyanese music, but that of other local musicians as well. President Granger noted that it was once a struggle to build what is now recognised as the Guyanese nation and as such the cultural movement, which fostered and promoted art, music, drama and writing, and which ultimately led to Guyana’s diversity must never be forgotten or ignored. Professor at the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University and author of “Valerie Rodway – A National Treasure”, Dr. Vibart Cambridge shared similar sentiments and expressed gratitude to the President for recognising the importance of Guyanese music and culture. Dr. Cambridge said music has been and remains crucial to engendering a sense of belonging. “It connects us to family, community and nation… National songs are symbols of nationhood and help to foster a distinct national consciousness. They are an invariable part of our patrimony; they define us, remind us of our common experiences as a nation, reinforce our pride by depicting our country favourably, reaffirming our shared values and aspirations,” he asserted. Dr. Cambridge described Mrs. Rodway as “Guyana’s greatest composer of national and patriotic music” and noted that she has left behind a substantial body of work that represents various styles and reflects national pride and commitment. “Valerie Rodway’s work demonstrates the ability to transcend race and ethnicity to foster social cohesiveness,” he said, even as he called on the National Trust of Guyana to do more to preserve Guyanese music. Additionally, well-known musician, Mrs. Marilyn Dewar presented Dr. Ovid Fraser, the last surviving sibling of Mrs. Rodway, with Rodway’s handwritten musical score to “O Beautiful Guyana”. They lyrics to the song were written by Mr. Walter Mac. A. Lawrence. Mrs. Rodway wrote the musical score in 1965. Dr. Fraser then presented the document to Archivist at the Walter Rodney Archives of Guyana, Mrs. Nadia Gamel-Carter, where it will be stored. Mrs. Rodway was born in New Amsterdam, East Berbice-Corentyne (Region 6) on February 12, 1919 and is best known for her composition of national songs including “Hymn for Guyana’s Children”, written by Vere T. Daly and “Arise, Guyana”, written by J. W. Chinapen. Mrs. Rodway and her husband James wrote “Guyana, the Free”, which she submitted for the national anthem competition. Mrs. Rodway composed patriotic music, music for schools, test pieces for music festivals, music for community signing and art music. She also set music to the poems from some of Guyana’s famous poets such as Martin Carter, C.E.J. Ramcharitar-Lalla, A.J. Seymour, and Nellie Wishart. Valerie Rodway died in 1970. The birth centenary programme was chaired by Minister of Public Telecommunications and great niece of Mrs. Rodway, Mrs. Catherine Hughes. First Lady, Mrs. Sandra Granger; Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr. Barton Scotland; Attorney General and Minister of Legal Affairs, Mr. Basil Williams; Ministers of Public Health, Mrs. Volda Lawrence and Dr. Karen Cummings; Minister of Education, Ms. Nicolette Henry; Minister of Public Service, Dr. Rupert Roopnaraine; Minister of Social Cohesion, Dr. George Norton; Post Master General, Ms. Karen Brown, and members of the diplomatic corps also attended the event.

Chance of rain 40%. Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 3:41 pm Beckley, West Virginia CHARLESTON — A bill to increase the number of school psychologists in West Virginia is up for a vote Tuesday in the West Virginia House of Delegates. If it passes the House, it will then go to the state Senate for consideration. House Bill 2397, sponsored by Del. Martin Atkinson, R-Roane, states that beginning with the school year 2021-2022, each county school board shall employ full-time at least one school psychologist for every 1,000 kindergarten through seventh grade students, or that if needed, it may contract with school psychologists or psychiatrists. The bill, which does not list a cost, also says that each county board shall employ at least one full-time school psychologist. Karen Cummings, government and professional relations chair for the West Virginia School Psychologists Association, said in an email, that her organization supported the legislation. ""West Virginia is experiencing a drug epidemic that has plagued our families,"" she wrote. ""At the same time, West Virginia is severely lacking in behavioral and mental health services that families need to address the problem. ""Children are the most vulnerable and unseen victims of the drug crisis. These children are not only more susceptible to substance use disorders, but they have also experienced trauma and turmoil that negatively impact their development and the ability to effectively learn. This leaves schools at the forefront of providing the protective factors children and families need."" She said that while one school psychologist per 500 to 700 students would be ideal, the bill is ""an excellent start to implementing change"" and ""would cut the current average school psychologist ratio in half for kindergarten through seventh grade, where there is the greatest need and best chance of successful outcomes."" Health officials often say West Virginia has a shortage of mental health workers. Cummings said the bill attempts to address a possible shortage of school psychologists by allowing contracting with licensed school psychologists and psychiatrists. ""The bill sets an implementation date for the 2021-2022 school year, which allows some time for additional program graduates and recruitment to take place,"" she added. ""Marshall University has recently expanded their school psychology training program to reach out to master’s level educators who may want to retrain into the field of school psychology. These new graduate cohorts take place throughout different regions of the state and have thus far been very successful. ""While no single piece of legislation can address all the issues associated with the drug crisis, HB 2397 is a critical component. We hope that lawmakers will see this as an important step in the right direction and choose to fund this proposed initiative. It is our desire for West Virginia to continue addressing the lack of mental health services and provide funding for all school-based mental health providers.""

Michael,Gordon,2527,https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/roosters-unbelievable-with-way-they-manage-cap-matterson-20190222-p50zoh.html,"Wests Tigers new premiership-winning recruit Ryan Matterson says the way his former club the Sydney Roosters manage their salary cap is ""unbelievable"". Matterson was being genuine, not cheeky, when he spoke glowingly about his old employer and their ability to sustain such a powerhouse roster. Speaking up: Former Rooster Ryan Matterson.Credit:AAP How the Roosters can keep their star-studded rosters intact has become a bit of a running joke with rival teams. Souths hitman Sam Burgess was asked about the Roosters' World Club Challenge win this week and said: ""They haven't lost much, have they? They've gained Angus [Crichton], they've also brought in Brett Morris and Ryan Hall. ""Who else did they buy? They bought [Cooper] Cronk and [James] Tedesco the year before. They never seem to lose too many."" Matterson would often be teased by his mates when he played for the Bondi boys, but said the premiers deserved credit rather than ridicule. Star-studded: Boyd Cordner leads a roll call of big names with the Roosters.Credit:Sydney Roosters ""They have quality and depth, a couple of players leave and then even better ones come in,"" Matterson said. ""The way they manage their salary cap is unbelievable. Good on them. ""They are a well-structured club, very professional. As a person looking on from the outside you probably think they're cheating or they're doing something. ""But having been a part of the club, you know they have crossed their 'ts' and dotted their 'is'."" The Roosters moved on Dylan Napa who landed himself in the headlines, while Blake Ferguson shifted to Parramatta on a three-year deal. Prior to that Mitchell Pearce, Shan Kenny-Dowall and Michael Gordon left, and Cronk and Tedesco arrived. In 2016 Luke Keary was brought in and Jackson Hastings, who is now in England, was let go. Matterson said it was a lot easier leaving the Roosters knowing he had won a premiership with his mates. And now there is a hunger to clinch another title at the Tigers whose roster surprisingly features no fewer than nine players - Benji Marshall, Robbie Farah, Chris McQueen, Matterson, Elijah Taylor, Russell Packer, Ben Matulino, Josh Reynolds and Moses Mbye - who have won or featured in a grand final. ""Getting to a grand final is hard, winning one is even harder,'' said Matterson, who will start as the right-edge back-rower and also trained at lock. ""When you win one you feel so proud of yourself and all the people involved like your family and friends and the club and the fans. ""When I first came to the Tigers, I looked at our squad and the depth and how many people have actually played in a grand final. A lot of us have been to the 'big dance'. ""I've won a premiership, but I don't want to stop there and want to keep going. ""It feels good because we had a good side, we did it and now I'm moving on to the next chapter in my life.'' Matterson and the Tigers will fly out for New Zealand on Sunday for a week-long training camp before their one and only trial against the New Zealand Warriors.

Two young grizzly bears cavorted behind a tall fence at the Sportsmen’s and Outdoor Recreation Show at the Douglas County Fairgrounds on Saturday, to the delight of Scott and Tammy McCool of Myrtle Creek. “It was a lot of fun to watch them. It’s why we came,” Scott McCool said. The bears were one of the attractions at the annual show, in its 23rd year. Saturday was the second day of the three-day event, which featured exhibits on fishing, hunting, camping, boating and other outdoor activities favored by many Douglas County residents. The bears were brought by the Grizzly Ranch and Florida Black Bear Rescue from Naples, Florida, a nonprofit that provides a home for nuisance and orphaned bears. But for Tammy McCool, who said her maiden name was Bear, it was all about the grizzlies. She said she’d never seen one in person before. She thought it was about time she did. The McCools said the best part was watching the bears play with each other and their trainer after the official show was done. While some came to see the animals, others came to the Sportsmen’s show for the machines. George Kinman of Roseburg looked like he’d found a bit of outdoor heaven as he took a seat in a brand new Yamaha XYZ ATV. It was the newest model, and just sitting in an ATV that was built big enough to be comfortable for him was worth the visit to the show, he said. “I’m having a lot of fun,” he said. If he bought it, he said, he’s take it to the Oregon Dunes. Once he retires, he wants to take an ATV down to the sand dunes in places like Glamis, California and Utah. Levi and Andrew Davis of Roseburg found themselves “just resting” next to some large boats featuring plenty of space to move around. “We’re just dreaming I guess,” said Levi Davis. “That’s what this place is for, dreaming,” said Andrew Davis. The Sportsmen’s Show continues from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today at the Douglas County Fairgrounds, 2110 Frear Street in Roseburg. Admission is $8 for adults, of $6 with a Bi-Mart coupon, and $1 for children ages 6 to 12. Reporter Carisa Cegavske can be reached at 541-957-4213 or ccegavske@nrtoday.com.

Partly cloudy skies this evening will become overcast overnight. Low 6F. Winds N at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 2:56 pm Got ice? Yes, we do, everywhere! Today, which is Sunday morning, the sun was shining which made the ice sparkle and look glorious. But, walking or driving on the ice was treacherous. During the night, the rain turned to ice then snow came and then we got more icy rain. The sun was shining all day, but the temperature never rose much above 20 degrees. I didn't hear of anyone falling or having a wreck, so everyone must have walked and driven very gingerly. I know I did. We may get another round of bad weather later this week, but it's less than a month until spring. I hope Ol' Man Winter gets the message. Then, Daylight Saving Time comes March 10. Long evenings will be nice, but I think I'm going to purchase clocks that are atomic so I don't have to take my clocks off the wall and then get them back up. Clocks may be old school to the younger generation, but I still like them. My students don't know how to tell time on a regular clock. How did they miss out on that? I know I mention students pretty often in my column, but it amazes me that a freshman cannot quickly point to Montana on the map. A couple students told me they saw no point in memorizing the times table or knowing how to figure percentages without using a calculator. Some students just don't think those skills are important, so do not blame the teachers. Several weeks ago, Janet Neibling Tyler sent me an item about her parents celebrating their 71st wedding anniversary. But, I was scattered brained and didn't get it in my items. I am so sorry, Harvey and Maryellen. That is certainly a milestone and a cause to celebrate. A family celebration was enjoyed. (If this information is incorrect, please let me know Janet, if you're still speaking to me.) I'm sure they would still enjoy receiving cards of congratulations at their home on 102 South Avenue, Highland, KS 66035. I have the Academy Awards show on the TV as I write tonight. There are so many actors who present awards or win awards that I have never heard of. When I was young I enjoyed watching because I knew almost all the actors and the presenters: John Wayne, Loretta Young, Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Paul Newman, Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, Jane Wyman, Steve McQueen, etc. Weren't they great? I don't know what Bob would have watched on TV if the Western Channel had not been on. He watched Gunsmoke, Bonanza, Big Valley, and many more over and over again. When he switched channels it was to the Farm Channel. When we ate dinner, I would have Wheel of Fortune on the kitchen TV. He tried, but he just couldn't figure out the puzzle - especially when the category was Before and After. I am fair at solving them, but don't ask me to do math - that was his strong subject. I went to Mary's and Sherman's for lunch after church. Needless to say, Josh and Selena are anxious for Baby Smith to arrive. It seems the baby is lying on a nerve in the leg and making Selena pretty miserable. Her due date is March 1, but I think she would welcome baby any time now. So will we all. Several weeks ago, I was invited to the First Methodist Church at Hiawatha to answer questions about Community of Christ. I spoke to Paul's and Jodi's Sunday School class answering questions that had been given me prior to class time. This class has had representatives from different churches visit their class to become better acquainted with their beliefs and doctrines. It was a wonderful opportunity to clear up misunderstandings about our faith. They discovered that Community of Christ is not a cult and that people of every faith, lifestyle, and culture are welcome at Community of Christ. Our temple in Independence, Mo., is open to the public at all times. In fact, it was built for people of the world who seek and desire peace for all of God's children. Oh, and, I related to them that we never did, do not now, nor will we ever worship Joseph Smith. Four ladies who are widows phoned me to tell me that soon after their husbands passed, that people began asking - Are you selling that? Would you give me first bid on that implement? Are you going to sell your business? Rude and hurtful questions within a day or two after their husbands' passing. I would never approach someone with such questions. In other words, don't phone us, we'll phone you. Early March birthdays include: Bradly Culp and Jay Johnson on the 1st, Andrew Davis and Clarabelle Culp on the 2nd, Fred Twombly and Jesse Wilson on the 5th. Birthday blessings to each of you.

Bernard,Osher,2478,https://www.concordmonitor.com/What-makes-OLLI-roll-23483335,"Osher Lifelong Learning Institute members braved the cold, snowy weather on Wednesday to enjoy a “Mug ‘n’ Roll.” Three members brought soup and chili, one brought home-baked bread and another brought rolls and all were lapped up with great enthusiasm by members gathered for the last social gathering before classes begin next week. Veteran OLLI members, some part of the organization since its inception 15 years ago, greeted some of the 52 brand new members, regaling them with stories of OLLI adventures and a few misadventures as well. The program was a discussion of the members’ volunteer experiences outside of OLLI. A generous group, members talked about their services to Shea Farm, Granite State Ambassadors, the Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Agency, local online newspaper services, school libraries, community caregivers, Girl Scout Troop in the Women’s Prison, Concord Community Concert, Society of Decorative Painters, 4-H Parents, the Cold Weather Shelter, Pope Memorial SPCA’s therapy animals (taking kittens and bunnies to nursing homes!), the Tuftonboro Bicentennial Flotilla and one adventurous member’s church mission trip to Cuba. The stories were sometimes sad, often inspirational, occasionally funny and always fascinating. Volunteerism is baked into the OLLI tradition. In fact, the 123 OLLIs across the United States have at least two things in common – a vibrant educational program for adults over age 50 and a dynamic volunteer program. The volunteer aspect of OLLI is a qualifying component of the grant process from the Osher Foundation which has funded the 123 OLLI start-ups over the years. Bernard Osher, founder of the OLLI program, recognized that many older adults, after they retire, seemed to lose their sense of purpose and identity. Meaningful volunteer work, however, has the capacity to restore that sense of self-worth which, along with maintaining an active brain, leads to healthy aging, the main goal of OLLIs. OLLI at Granite State College is organized with a shared leadership model. A small paid staff and a volunteer governing body collaborate to run the organization of over 1200 members. While the staff is responsible for administration, infrastructure and coordination, volunteers are responsible for OLLI programming. Volunteer committees develop ideas for classes, secure presenters and arrange schedules. Presenters, all volunteers, research and design their courses, delivering them to registered members. Volunteers organize and run social events and trips, They produce a monthly newsletter, member and presenter handbooks and informational or promotional materials. They govern each of the four sites which compose OLLI at Granite State College with a committee structure entirely staffed with volunteers. They develop strategic plans, training programs, evaluate the member experience and perform continuous quality improvement in coordination with staff. OLLI at Granite State College begins its spring term on Feb. 18. With more than 230 courses across four learning sites including 70 in the Concord site, the work of the 500-plus volunteers is on display for all members to see and enjoy. Fifty brand new members who joined in Concord alone since Jan. 1 have certainly found something that will enrich their lives. Granite State College, which supplies classroom space, the paid staff and IT, financial and marketing expertise, is proud of this program providing noncredit courses targeted specifically to the over-50 population.

Michael,Gordon,2469,http://www.wbtv.com/2019/02/14/trial-delayed-man-accused-shooting-charlotte-protester-suspects-falling-asleep/,"CHARLOTTE, NC (Michael Gordon/The Charlotte Observer) - The first-degree murder of trial of Rayquan Borum was unexpectedly and indefinitely delayed Thursday after his lawyers told the judge that their client was falling asleep in the courtroom. Defense attorney Darlene Harris said Borum appeared to have been made groggy by anti-depression and anxiety medication he had taken at the Mecklenburg County Jail at 8 a.m. Thursday. Harris said she and co-counsel Mark Simmons had just heard about Borum’s medication, and that Borum had been “dozing off, falling asleep” and had been “unable to participate in the trial (at) the level he did.” The interruption came at the start of the second day of jury selection for Borum, who’s accused of the 2016 fatal shooting of Justin Carr. The killing occurred during protests and sometimes violent demonstrations that swept through uptown following the Sept. 20, 2016, police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. After a short discussion, Superior Court Judge Greg Hayes delayed the trial until the lawyers can get copies of Borum’s medical and disciplinary records from the jail, where he has been held since his arrest. [ Jury selection begins in trial for man accused in fatal 2016 protest shooting ] In raising his concerns about his client’s physical condition, Simmons asked that Hayes clear the courtroom of reporters and bystanders, a highly unusual move for a public trial. Hayes had done just that on Wednesday, and the court was closed to the public for about 45 minutes while the judge and attorneys discussed an undislosed “legal issue.” Despite questions from the Observer, the judge gave no further explanation and attorneys for both sides refused to comment. Thursday morning, the Observer made it known to the court that it would object to future moves to close the courtroom during the trial. On Thursday, after noting the Observer’s objection, Hayes asked that bystanders leave but allowed the three reporters on hand to stay for the discussion of Borum’s health issues. Hayes said he was trying to balance Borum’s right to a fair trial with public transparency of the process. He also asked that reporters be cautious at what they reported of the discussion. According to what was said in court, Wednesday’s closed hearing was also about Borum’s health issues. Harris told the judge that because Borum’s health problems were occurring in front of his possible jurors, she did not want his behavior to influence their opinion about him. Assistant District Attorney Glenn Cole agreed to the delay so Borum’s records could be gathered. But he questioned the timing of the defendant’s health problems, describing it as “mighty suspicious.” Cole said recent recordings of Borum made at the Mecklenburg Jail revealed him discussing trial activity in detail, and even questioning Cole’s speaking abilities, the prosecutor said. Cole also Borum’s ability to stand trial had come into question only after his attorneys had lost a series of fights this week to restrict the evidence that will be presented at trial. When Hayes wondered if Borum should be taken off the medication for the rest of the trial, Harris pushed back. She said Borum had reported “hearing voices” while he being kept in solitary confinement. To stop his medication now might worsen his condition, she said. Harris also said the request to assess Borum’s ability to stand trial is not a delaying tactic. “We’re all ready to move forward,” Harris said. “(Borum) does not want to sit in jail any longer, and he’s made that pretty clear.” Sleeping habits in the courtroom have had significant impact on Charlotte-area criminal trials in the past. In 2017, the N.C. Court of Appeals ordered a new trial in Gaston County for narcotics defendant Johnny Darnell Mobley, who was found competent to stand trial by Superior Court Judge Carla Archie of Charlotte, even though he slept through portions of the proceedings and appeared unable to follow what was happing. “Now, Mr. Mobley, your lawyer brought to my attention that you appeared to be sleeping. She heard you snoring, I believe,” Archie said, according to the appeals court opinion. “I’m tired right now,” Mobley replied. “I was going to ask, Can I sit back down?” The court said Archie should have brought in an expert to determine Mobley’s competence to stand trial. In 2016, the roles were reversed. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Nicholas Ragin’s conviction and 30-year-prison sentence because his attorney, Nick Mackey of Charlotte, slept through portions of the trial. [ Attorneys for man accused of killing demonstrator during Charlotte protests request new bond hearing ] “Based on this record, we find it impossible not to conclude that Mackey slept, and was therefore not functioning as a lawyer during a substantial portion of the trial,” the judges wrote in their order vacating Ragin’s 2006 conviction and sentence. Ragin later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in the case and received a shorter prison stay. In the Borum trial, it remains unclear how long it will take to determine if he is able to stand trial. Initial reports to the judge on Thursday were that it could take 48 hours to gather Borum’s medical records. Hayes said that was too long, and that he hoped to have a jury selected by midday Friday, when the trial will recess due to NBA All-Star Game festivities. “But I don’t want to do that at the risk of being overturned,” he said. “This is like a ball of yarn. The more gets pulled, the worse it gets.” 1 Julian Price Pl.Charlotte, NC 28208(704) 374-3500

Michael,Gordon,2496,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190218/jury-recommends-death-for-michael-gordon-in-brutal-stabbing-deaths-of-polk-mom-patricia-moran-daughter-deborah-royal,"Last week, the same 12 jurors deliberated about six hours before convicting Michael Gordon of first-degree murder for the stabbing deaths of Haines City mother Patricia Moran and her daughter, Deborah Royal, on Jan. 15, 2015. BARTOW — By unanimous vote, jurors agreed Monday to recommend that convicted murderer Michael Anthony Gordon be executed for the brutal home-invasion killings of two Haines City women in 2015. Gordon, 39, wearing a light-blue Oxford shirt, a gray cable-knit sweater vest, black slacks and shackles on his ankles, showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Jalal Harb read the jury’s decision. But as Harb was thanking the 12 jurors for their service, Gordon smiled and waved to a reporter videotaping the proceedings. The jury deliberated about five hours Monday to reach its verdict, which is solely a recommendation. The final decision on sentencing rests with Harb, who must, however, give the recommendation great weight in making his decision. No sentencing date was set Monday, but Harb scheduled a status hearing for April 26. Last week, the same 12 jurors deliberated about six hours before convicting Gordon of first-degree murder for the stabbing deaths of Patricia Moran, 72, and her 51-year-old daughter, Deborah Royal, on Jan. 15, 2015. Jurors also found him guilty of robbing the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale with three other assailants earlier that day, and firing on law enforcement during a pursuit that ended in the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City. The first to be caught was Devonere McCune, 26, who was taken into custody moments after the assailants’ car crashed near the entrance to the subdivision and the four ran from the car. Gordon would be captured next after murdering the women and crashing Moran’s car through the garage door of her home in an attempt to escape, according to court testimony. He drove across an open field, amid gunfire from officers, before slamming into an embankment along Lake Confusion. He was shot four times, but recovered. On Monday, in his closing argument to jurors, Assistant State Attorney Paul Wallace argued four reasons for recommending the death penalty, including Gordon’s violent past and the cruelty of the murders. Prosecutors are limited to 16 statutory reasons for seeking the death penalty, while defense lawyers are unlimited in presenting arguments for mandatory life imprisonment. Wallace stepped through previous convictions against Gordon involving violent crimes, including a Lakeland shooting that left a man injured and a 2005 prison stabbing, in which Gordon was charged with using a blade carved from a toothbrush. Wallace also recounted the vicious nature of the killings, and Gordon’s efforts to avoid capture after the pawn shop robbery. “The only reason he took a life was because he was bound and determined that he was going to avoid being arrested for the crimes that he had already committed on that particular day,” Wallace told jurors. “Patricia did not pose a threat to him other than being able to scream out and alert the officers who were coming by then, by the dozens, to flood the whole neighborhood. That is why he cut her throat, to prevent her from being able to cry out, and that is why he continued to stab her even though she valiantly fought for her life.” In his closing statement Monday, Clearwater defense lawyer Bjorn Brunvand reminded jurors that Gordon has been diagnosed with brain damage, likely dating to infancy and exacerbated by his father’s physical abuse, according to defense testimony. He said the damage to Gordon’s brain is concentrated in an area that causes him to react violently when angry. “His brain doesn’t function the way it’s supposed to function,” he told jurors. The problems, Brunvand said, began surfacing as early as grade school. “He was constantly getting in trouble, constantly doing things he wasn’t supposed to be doing,” he said. “That corroborates that something was going on with him at the time that basically caused him not to be able to act in the manner and the way that we’re supposed to.” Upon his release from prison in April 2014 after serving nine years for an aggravated battery conviction, Gordon failed to take his prescription medication regularly and began self-medicating with street drugs, including synthetic marijuana, Brunvand told jurors Monday. “Not only do we have brain damage, but we have someone whose brain is clouded by this behavior and by the use of these drugs and the actions of the psychotropic drugs,” he said. “So you say, well, he can make decisions. He should have made better decisions. The problem with that is he can’t make better decisions.” After Harb announced the jury’s decision Monday, Mary Feiock expressed relief that the jury recommended death for the killer of her mother and her sister, but said the memories of the trial will continue to haunt her. “I’m glad it’s over, but to have sat there and have heard what he did to them, and to know that my sister came out and saw my mother like that, and how much pain they were in — it’s going to take a long time to get past that,” she said after court. Gordon is the second of four co-defendants to face a jury in the 2015 rampage. In October, Terrell Williams was sentenced to life in prison after a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder, armed robbery and attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, among other charges. He and co-defendant Jovan Lamb were arrested within hours of Gordon’s capture. Williams, 33, was convicted under the state’s felony murder law, which holds all co-defendants legally responsible when someone is killed during the commission of a violent crime, including armed robbery. Jovan Lamb, 33, is scheduled for trial in September, but no trial date has been set for McCune. They are both being held without bail in the Polk County Jail pending trial.

Tara Enneking of Jefferson Forest (left) celebrates after her victory in the 50-yard freestyle for girls at the Class 4 state swim and dive meet in Richmond Friday night. RICHMOND — The gym at Blacksburg High School acquired an impressive piece of wall art Friday night. “This is our first state championship,” said Chris Reilly, whose BHS boys captured the VHSL’s Class 4 title at the SwimRVA aquatic center. “There’s an open spot on the gym wall for a banner and we’re going to fill it with a big, beautiful banner.” Depth and diving were the keys for Reilly’s Bruins, who didn’t win an individual event but piled up points whenever possible. They received a major boost from their divers, who were led by state runner-up Stephen Case. BHS divers also finished third and fourth. “Thank goodness it’s swim and dive,” Reilly said. “If it was just ‘swim,’ we wouldn’t have won.” Blacksburg’s 229 points edged out runner-up Lafayette, of Williamsburg (217 points). Jefferson Forest finished third with 216 points and saw its streak of two consecutive boys titles come to an end. Salem, with second-place finishes in the 500-yard freestyle (Nick Lawson, 4:28.89) and the 200-yard freestyle relay (1:28.02) took eighth place with 121.5 points. With three events remaining, Lafayette and Jefferson Forest were tied for first with 157 points, putting them one point ahead of third-place Jamestown and two points ahead of Blacksburg. “We got a big boost in the breaststroke when Sam Sterling finished third,” Reilly said. “We’d still have lost, though, if our last relay had been disqualified or didn’t have a good swim.” The sixth-seeded Bruins did better than that, claiming third place to lock out Lafayette, which won the event. Sterling returned for a leg and was joined by Lewis Rockwell, Leo Yang and sophomore anchorman Nick Zolovick. The Bruins also exceeded expectations in the girls meet, finishing second with 215.5 points. They were kept at arm’s length by winner Monacan, of Chesterfield County. The Chieftains finished first or second in every relay en route to amassing 282.5 points. E.C. Glass finished 10th with 109 points, and Jefferson Forest was 11th with 84 points. Jefferson Forest swept the two 50 free races, with seniors Matthew Davidson winning the boys race in 20.88 and Tara Enneking touching in 24.01 to take the girls gold medal. Both also collected a silver medal. Davidson finished second in the 100 free; his time of 44.96 was a lifetime best and earned him All-American status. Enneking (1:03.83) was second in the 100 breaststroke, finishing six tenths of a second behind winner Colby Hurt of Lafayette. Enneking entered the finals with the best prelim time of 1:04.28, which at the time was a VHSL Class 4 record. She and Hurt both eclipsed that time in the final race. “The 100 breast is probably my best event, but I like the challenge of the 50 free,” Enneking said. “It’s so short that you can’t make a mistake and win. I actually enjoy that kind of pressure.” Liberty Christian’s John Michael Gordon won the 200 free, his time of 1:39.45 beating out Lafayette’s Christopher Kostelni by 0.2 seconds. Gordon also was second in the 100 backstroke, finishing in 49.90, 0.49 seconds behind Carroll County’s Forest Webb. Gordon’s 100 back time earned him All-American status.

John,O'Neil,2458,https://neoskosmos.com/en/129274/hellas-is-not-a-dirty-word-reply-to-chris-nikous-open-letter-to-soccer-family-from-19-december-2018/,"Sport / Opinion George Kapnias 13 February 2019 10:35am In 1987, a few from my underage cohort broke into the South Melbourne seniors, including Paul Trimboli and Kimon Taliadoros. Kimon and I were school mates but Kimon was not bilingual and had not grown up with the fortnightly ritual of descending upon Middle Park on Sunday afternoons. Kimon was quickly immersed in the hotbed that was Middle Park and was mesmerised by the crowds – their excitement, pathos and fervour, especially at home games when the stands would shake with chants of H-E-L-L-A-S, H-E-L-L-A-S! One day, he plucked up the courage and asked (almost embarrassed that he didn’t know), “what does Hellas mean… because it sounds like a battle cry?” So, I answered with what Hellas meant for me. “Hellas – it means nothing. It’s just us, it’s who we are at Middle Park.” (!) Typical of most Greek migrant families, we went to church, Greek school, yiortes on Saturdays and visited relatives on Sundays and rarely ventured outside the Greek migrant ecosystem. But not once, was Hellas ever misconstrued as Eλλαδα (Greece). Sure, Hellas was largely supported by Greek migrants but also by Scots, ‘Poms’, Hungarians, Cypriots, as well as many other soccer loving Aussies. For us, going to see Hellas was a day pass from the suburban microcosm in which we were immersed. My dad would speak glowingly of watching players like Bourne, Bedford, Ackerley and Nestoridis in earlier years as well. Hellas meant Jimmy Armstrong, Ollerton, Evans, Davidson, Brown, Oscar walks-on-water Crino, Wadey, Trimmers, Durakovic, Angey etc. Hellas was never racially exclusive, was about fun, a great day out, the tension that comes with the build up to the big day and ultimately frustration or joy… all the emotional roller coaster that comes with competitive sport. Hellas was synonymous with success, intrinsically part of multicultural Melbourne and the inheritance of every soccer loving fan. Helping to save the Club After the NSL was disbanded, starved of its revenue streams but still laden with expensive real estate obligations, South (Hellas) had no way to trade out of its indebted position and in 2004, was put into administration. As a fan, who enjoyed all the privileges but none of the responsibility for 36 years, I answered ‘Lefteri’s’ trumpet call and along with hundreds of others, helped save the Club. We formed South Saviours and raised $75,000 as part of the $450,000 required to bail the Club out of administration. No FFA bailouts for South. And along comes John O’Neil, the then CEO of the FFA (yes that soccer aficionado that came and went like a penny banger) and he dismissively labelled all of the above… “old soccer”. O’ Neill… isn’t he the one that wrote the book “How to win friends and take your constituency with you?” And it wasn’t just me and our beloved South, it was the entire soccer fraternity as it existed up until then. All the great clubs and diligent people behind them who selflessly and tirelessly did all they could, as best they knew to build soccer in this country. And yes, they were mostly migrants who volunteered their time because of their love of the game. I won’t for a minute try to defend all that was old soccer. Over the years social norms have changed and (thankfully) so have we. Without doubt, the FFA has got rid of many of the unsavoury aspects of old soccer and instituted many improvements including a higher level of professionalism, media exposure and a television rights deal that old soccer could only dream of. The players’ union has also helped extricate soccer from shady player payment/transfer practices. And South and clubs like it, had to change – as they have. But the benefits achieved by the formation of the A-League do not have to be at the expense of all that came before and by labelling it ‘old soccer’, by disrespecting this deep soccer heritage, the FFA has thrown the baby out with the bath water. At this year’s Australian Open it was wonderful to once again witness Melbourne’s multicultural sport heritage play out in all its animation and exuberance. It was not just ‘Tsitsipamania’ or young teenagers draped in the Serbian flag but a whole kaleidoscope of colours and allegiances from all over the world. It was wonderfully civil, respectful, marvellous Melbourne at its best and the very essence of being Australian. The FFA’s determination to stamp out Australia’s multicultural soccer heritage, means ‘old soccer’ acolytes such as myself, will (regrettably) never deem the A-league worthy of anything more than passing interest. It is simply not good enough for Mr Nikou to now say he does not believe in the old soccer/new football divide as the organisation he leads, the FFA, has institutionalised this bias with rules such as, maximum $7,000 transfer fees for NPL clubs, a monopoly on the top flight, picking favourites and no promotion or relegation. No consequences for poor performance? In the business world it’s called moral hazard or a (banking) cartel. More simply, the FFA has one set of rules for the barons and one for the serfs. Melbourne City might be backed by the biggest soccer powerhouse in the world and yet despite the coverage and despite the press, the stands are (near) empty. Who’s missing? Melbourne’s soccer faithful. You see, as long as my team is locked out and not welcome at the pyjama party of ten and there is no mechanism (promotion/relegation) to allow it to ever get there, I will stay away and keep my powder dry. Asking me to support an A-League team when mine is not welcome is near on impossible – not so much because I’d feel like I am betraying South but because I’d be betraying myself. You see, South is a part of who I am. And that goes for thousands – many thousands – of fans around the country. If the FFA cannot understand this, then it doesn’t understand the basic psychology of a soccer fan. This is not a case of sour grapes but simply a cry from the heartland. Your heartland Mr Nikou, that you have been empowered with great responsibility to represent, to inspire and dare I say it, welcome with open arms. And just as Neos Kosmos has had to adapt, it has not thrown its predominantly first generation Greek readership ‘under a bus’ and deemed them ‘old soccer’ and those that are digitally literate ‘new football’. It has brought its readership (and its sixty years of heritage) on the journey. Mr FFA, if you are serious about engaging with the soccer ‘family’, set up the architecture that would allow every club without exception across Australia, to be part of the ONE soccer fraternity and dismantle the feudal system which has operated over the past fourteen years. It’s time to create a system that is open, inclusive, competitive, allows nature to run its course and see the cream rise to the top. A system that is equally available to all, including those who prefer their coffee from Brunetti’s rather than Starbucks. Sport Sport Sport

Michael,Gordon,2496,https://www.nrl.com/news/2019/02/19/aj-brimson-can-wait-michael-gordon-set-to-stay-gold-coast-no.1/,"TITANS Livewire youngster AJ Brimson is set to become the Titans’ supersub with coach Garth Brennan to entrust veteran Michael Gordon with the No.1 jersey when the side runs out for round one against Canberra next month. Brennan will unveil his first side for the 2019 season on Wednesday with a host of youngsters and players on the periphery of the starting 13 to be given a chance to impress against the Cowboys on Saturday. The club’s Indigenous and Maori All Stars representatives are not expected to play while the likes of Brimson, captain Ryan James and halves Ash Taylor and Ryley Jacks will also be missing as they continue to rehab injuries. In a season where the Titans finished 14th, the emergence of Brimson’s attacking brilliance in 15 games last year was one of the highlights, the last four games at fullback yielding four tries as he showcased his scintillating attacking spark. It led many to believe that he was a certainty to start the year in the same position but as the 20-year-old continues to recover from shoulder surgery, Brennan has given his best indication yet that it will be Gordon who gets first crack at the back. In what shapes as the 35-year-old’s final season in the NRL having made his debut for the Panthers in 2006 – when Brimson was just seven – Brennan says Gordon’s experience is invaluable to what is a relatively young group. “He probably will be at this point,” Brennan told NRL.com when asked if Gordon was the front-runner to be the side’s fullback against Canberra on March 17. “He’s well respected and it’s like having another coach out there. “He’s at the back-end of his career but he’s a very smart footballer. He knows his stuff and he’s a blessing for me because it’s like having a coach out on the field.” Not only will Gordon perform on-field coaching duties in terms of organising the team’s defence in 2019, he will play a critical role in the development of his long-term successor. “People say that AJ’s best position is fullback – and going forward I think it probably will be – but there’s a lot more to being a fullback these days,” explained Brennan. “Organising the defensive line and defensive structures is an art form and it’s not easy. “AJ can handle the attack side of things at fullback on his ear, we’ve seen that last year. I’ve got no concerns about that whatsoever. But organising the defence and directing middles around and putting them in the right place, that takes a little bit of time to understand and to learn. “Having Michael around this year to have that transition for AJ to learn that at training – how Michael organises the defensive line and where he puts people – it’s like having another coach out there for 12 months in educating AJ.” The other area that Brennan hopes to lean on Gordon throughout 2019 is to teach the younger players winning habits. Gordon played finals football with the Panthers, Sharks and Roosters before returning home to the Gold Coast and has seen first-hand what it takes to be successful in the NRL. “He’s a professional, ‘Flash’. He’s been in some really good systems, he’s been in winning systems at clubs like the Panthers and the Roosters,” said Brennan. “Winning is a habit. You get used to winning and you know what it takes to win and some of our young kids here at the Titans need to learn that a little bit because they haven’t tasted a lot of success. “It's a big help bringing in guys like Michael Gordon and Shannon Boyd who has played World Cup for Australia or Tyrone Peachey who has been in an Origin-winning series.” Titans James to steel himself for round one return Pressure mounting on cult hero Gold Coast Titans 2019 season preview Brimson proves a quick learner at kicking school Stat Attack: Rating each club's goal-kicking options

Michael,Gordon,2490,https://www.thecarrollnews.com/sports/5655/carrolls-webb-wins-state-swimming-title,"Soon you will be able to call Forest Webb a Hokie, but for now, state champion also has a nice ring to it. One year after placing second in the state in the 100-yard backstroke, the Virginia Tech-bound swimmer made the leap to state champion with an incredible performance in the Class 4 State Championships at Richmond SwimRVA. Webb’s time of 49.41 seconds not only was good enough to win the state, it also qualified as an All-American time. Webb’s state-winning time was a half-second faster than runner-up John Michael Gordon of Lynchburg Christian Academy, who finished in 49.91 seconds. Nobody else was under 51 seconds. Last year, Webb finished second in the state in the same event with a time of 50.29 seconds, behind only then-William Byrd senior Khalil Fonder, an eight-time state champion now on scholarship at Arizona State University. “The meet was awesome. Lots of fast swimming, many 4A records were broken. The energy in the Aquatic Center was intense the whole time,” Carroll County swimming coach Joi Ogle said. “Forest was very focused. He definitely had decided that he was going to win that event and he did.” Webb also finished third in the state in the boys’ 200-yard freestyle. His time of 1:40.11 was also good enough for All-American consideration. He also teamed up with Carroll’s Jackson Nester, Kaleb Payne and Matthew Perkins to place 13th in the state in the boys’ 200-yard medley relay with a time of 1:43.8. Webb, Nester, Payne and Lance Rotenizer also placed 21st in the state in the boys’ 200-yard freestyle relay with a time of 1:36.47. Just in its third season as a varsity swim team, Carroll County also had several other stellar performances at the state meet. Sophomore Jackson Nester placed in the top five in the state in two different events. His top showing came in the boys’ 500-yard freestyle, where he placed third in the state with a time of 4:39.24. Nester also placed fifth in the state in the boys’ 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:56.26. Forest Webb’s sister, Ellie, also turned in a top 10 state performance. A sophomore, Ellie Webb placed ninth in the girls’ 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:55.39. She also came in 23rd in the girls’ 200-yard individual medley with a time of 2:20.97. As a team, Carroll County’s boys finished 12th out of 28 teams with 74 points.

Rain and snow showers this evening. Overcast overnight. Low 17F. Winds W at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of snow 80%. Updated: February 27, 2019 @ 3:52 pm The following is part of an occasional installment of “old time headlines” compiled by the DuBois Area Historical Society. The headlines were researched by historical society board member Ken Wiser. Headlines and story samplings appear as they did when they were published in the newspaper. This installment is from the week of Feb. 11, 1919. q q q Tuesday, February 11, 1919 Failure Of Trolley Cars To Run Makes People Impatient The DuBois Traction company seems to be having more than its share of troubles the past few days. The public has realized this fact to a considerable extent because of the failure of the cars to get around on scheduled time. In fact the cars failed to move a greater part of either Sunday or Monday. The trouble commenced when the motor generator at the power house broke down. The generator furnishes the power for the movement of the cars, and the company, not being equipped with an auxiliary motor generator, caused the cars to stop. An auxiliary engine was put in operation but the plant is not, or was not, equipped with sufficient boiler capacity to generate steam for the movement of the cars. Mr. Blakeslee and his men have been working every minute since the break occurred early Sunday morning installing two additional boilers. They hope to have them installed early this morning and to have the trolley cars moving as usual today. The breakdown was a serious and expensive one for the traction company. The public has also been greatly inconvenienced, and to some extent impatient, and the company has received considerable criticism. However, if cars are running as usual again today there will be no further criticism. Efforts Being Made To Organize Basketball League Efforts are being made, and with success, to form a High school basketball league by towns in this territory for the season 1919-1920, and Altoona, Tyrone, Kane, Reynoldsville, Brookville, Grove City, Indiana, Punxsutawney and DuBois have already been asked to take part. The inception of the idea of such a league came from Punxsutawney, and DuBois, Indiana and Grove City have already signified their willingness to take part. It is probable that others will join as soon as the movement gains impetus, so that the prospects for an eight team league next season are excellent. Interest in such a league would be great. Only licensed referees would be used and the best interests of the sport promoted in a large measure in that way. Schedules could be arranged so that a decided saving in trips could be affected. The teams in the league would of course book games outside of the league as the schedule permitted. In addition to promoting interest in the sport, the high schools participating would receive much wider athletic recognition. The sportsmanship of the DuBois teams has always been recognized but it is at times gratifying to have recognition of that sportsmanship taken cognizance of by other cities. Wednesday, February 12, 1919 Gargelle Enters Plea Of Guilty Tony Gargelle, the Italian who fatally stabbed Andrew Davis, a DuBois young man, on the evening of September 21, while both of them were in the Central hotel bar, entered a plea of guilty of murder in the second degree yesterday morning at Clearfield. This followed the complications that developed as a result of the failure of the defendant’s lawyer to appear in his behalf. Counsel was arranged for the accused man on Monday afternoon and that evening Gargelle’s story was heard by them . Apparently the admissions made by the man himself convinced the lawyers that he was guilty and it was decided to make the plea of second degree murder. In order to establish the severity of the sentence it was decided to hear a portion of the evidence, and accordingly Judge Bell convened criminal court in the arbitration room. No jury was called, but the witnesses were all sworn, questioned and cross-examined by the attorneys. There was a large drawing of the bar room shown, after which Mrs. Davis was called and testified as to the age, height and other facts concerning her husband. She was followed by several other witnesses, some of whom were present at the time of the trouble and described the scenes as they occurred before and after the murder. The facts were substantially as told in The Courier at the time of the stabbing. The appearance of the Italian the first time in the bar room, the squabble that ensued between him and Davis and the putting out of the Italian by Bartender McAvoy were told. The testimony of the two lads who saw Gargelle standing in front of the bar room, where he was alleged to have opened a knife and placed it in his coat pocket, his re-entry into the hotel office, were narrated. Officer Brown described having been told of the trouble and the fact that an Italian had opened a knife and re-entered the hotel. The officer told of going to the bar room, where apparently everything had quieted down. He stated that he saw Gargelle standing in the office, but as he expected to find the seat of trouble in the bar room he paid no particular attention to Gargelle. The actual killing was told of by several witnesses, but their testimony varied somewhat. The accepted version was that Davis and another man were standing near the side entrance to the bar when Gargelle entered the bar room the second time, that Gargelle said to Davis, “Why you mad at me?” Then it is alleged that Davis went toward the Italian and that suddenly the Italian pulled the knife from his pocket and stabbed Davis. The Italian was put on the stand and told a story that in the main corroborated with the one he narrated at the lockup following the stabbing and which was printed in The Courier at the time. The one notable exception was the one in which he denied that he took the knife out of his pocket while standing in front of the bar room and before he went back into the hotel the second time. The defense placed no witnesses in the stand, but following the testimony Judge Reed made a short speech in which he asked for the mercy of the court. He stated that he himself had no doubt of the testimony given that Gargelle had taken his knife from his pocket and made it ready for business, but he maintained that this was done for the purpose of defense rather than offense; that the Italian did not deliberately go back into the hotel and attack Davis. Mr. Arnold, at the beginning of his address, stated that he was doubtful if any jury would bring in a verdict of murder in the first degree, owing to some of the circumstances of the case, but he did not believe that a plea of second degree murder was amply justified and he could see no reason why mercy should be shown. He stated that while there was mercy due the prisoner perhaps, there was also mercy due to the public and that the sentence should be in keeping with the gravity of the offense and as a deterrent to others. In connection with the testimony there were some facts revealed that are not favorable to the prisoner. According to his own word he has a wife and two children in the old country, while he had a woman in this country, by whom he has had one child. It was also shown that Gargelle had a nasty temper and on one other occasion had come down the street with an open knife stuck up his sleeve all ready for business. He maintained that on this occasion he was followed by a man whom he believed was going to hurt him. The Italian claimed that he and Davis had had trouble on at least two occasions and that the final quarrel was only a renewal of an old feud. Your comment has been submitted.

Michael,Gordon,2475,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190214/doctors-tell-jury-gordons-brain-was-damaged-from-violent-childhood,"Doctors take stage during penalty phase of convicted murderer Michael Gordon's trial for the brutal 2015 stabbing deaths of Patricia Moran and Deborah Royal in Haines City. BARTOW — Brain damage from childhood injuries, repeated beatings by his father and drug usage left convicted murderer Michael Anthony Gordon unstable and unable to control his aggressive impulses, doctors in the penalty phase of his trial testified Thursday. Michele Quiroga, a clinical neuropsychologist in Coral Gables, said Gordon requires ongoing medication to maintain control in his life, and in the weeks leading up to the murders of Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, in January 2015, Gordon wasn’t medicated. Another medical expert, Dr. Joseph Wu, told jurors that scans of Gordon’s brain revealed abnormalities in the front of his brain, likely caused by injuries and resulting in aggressive impulses. The medical testimony came Thursday as Gordon’s lawyers mounted a case against imposing the death penalty, which prosecutors are seeking. The defense team is expected to present more medical testimony Friday. Prosecutors have relied largely on testimony and evidence presented in the last three weeks during the guilt phase of Gordon’s trial. On Tuesday, jurors deliberated nearly six hours before finding him guilty of first-degree murder for each of the killings, along with 12 related charges in the January 2015 crime rampage. It began with an armed robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale, which led to a pursuit with law enforcement and ended with the murders of the two women in their Chanler Ridge home in Haines City. Gordon, who will be 39 Friday, was convicted of forcing his way into the women’s home as he ran from police. The women were stabbed more than 50 times each. Gordon had slashed Royal’s throat down to her spine. Prosecutors have presented evidence that Gordon served 10 years in prison for aggravated battery stemming from a shooting, and was released in April 2014 — nine months before the murders. They also argued that he killed the women to evade capture, and that the killings were particularly vicious. But Clearwater lawyer Bjorn Brunvand, representing Gordon, told jurors that his medical issues outweigh the brutality of the crime and his record of violent crimes. On Thursday, Wu said Gordon’s IQ was measured at 80 when he was in the second grade, but had fallen to 70 in recent testing, suggesting additional brain damage in the past 30 years.

John,O'Neil,2466,https://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion/no-regrets-for-preston-teen-who-chose-pickpocketing-over-prostitution-1-9592454,"Local historian Keith Johnson looks back at a time when a teen faced with the workhouse turned to crime instead... On the third Monday of January 1850 four persons, namely Thomas O’Gar, John O’Neil, Ellen O’Neil and John Green, were brought up at the Preston police court charged with picking the pocket of Miss Ann Boys, of Catterall, on the previous Saturday whilst she visited a draper’s shop on Cheapside. Her purse containing a sovereign and several shillings along with a watch key had been taken from her dress pocket whilst in the store of Messrs Wilson & Lawson. She had been on the premises about 15 minutes and when she came to pay for her purchases she realised her purse was missing. Witnesses, including Inspector Rigby, testified as to Ellen O’Neil along with Green and O’Gar being in the shop and standing close to Miss Boys and to John O’Neil loitering outside the premises. After leaving the shop, the prisoners made their way to Cannon Street where PC Hindle and other constables arrested them on suspicion of theft. At the police station all the suspects were searched and when O’Gar removed his hat, the purse, the watch key, a sovereign and other silver coins were discovered, the rest of the accused having pound notes and silver coins in their pockets. Initially, Ellen O’Neil and John Green gave false identities, but it was eventually discovered that Green was the brother of Ellen O’Neil and that she was the wife of John O’Neil. Claiming they were innocent of the crime all four were remanded in custody to stand trial at the next Preston Sessions in mid February. By the time the trial took place O’Gar, aged 18, had entered a guilty plea with the other three facing trial by jury. The evidence submitted suggested that all the accused had been working together on the streets that day indulging in light fingered theft. The jury took little time in delivering a guilty verdict. The chairman Mr T B Addison before passing sentence remarked that all the prisoners were known to the police as notorious characters. He then revealed that John Green, aged 18, had been convicted 12 times, John O’Neil, aged 21, had since 1844 been imprisoned six times and that his wife Ellen O’Neil, aged 17, had four previous convictions. All the prisoners were then sentenced to seven years’ transportation, at which point a crowd of female relatives of the prisoners who occupied the front seats of the public gallery commenced yelling and shrieking and making all manner of commotion. Tears and tantrums continued for a few minutes before calm was restored. Whilst being held at Preston awaiting transportation, Ellen O’Neil was visited by a reporter from Manchester who, along with the prison chaplain, the Rev John Clay, interviewed her. The outcome was a pamphlet entitled Extraordinary Confessions Of A Female Pickpocket that recorded her exploits. Born in Stockport, she had aged 14 been influenced by an elder brother who took her to Knot Mill Fair where she watched him stealing purses. Seeing it as easy pickings, she began to follow his example and events such as Blackburn fair where she pocketed £3 attracted her. She was soon travelling further afield with other girls and her brothers, being drawn to market days and fairgrounds. A good day in Hull earned her £7 and a festival in York shortly after she wed was fruitful with £12 thieved in a day. Preston on a Saturday had become a profitable place to visit, with £17 taken on one day. Unimpressed by the prospect of a life in the mill, or on the streets as a prostitute as some of her friends, she had chosen thievery, which had on occasions put beer and beef steak on the menu. As the transport ship awaited, she had no regrets. ©2019 JPIMedia Ltd. All rights reserved.

James,Forese,2545,https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/mobile-world-congress-kicks-off-in-barcelona-with-5g-at-the-forefront/,"2 days ago by Gary Elinoff Mobile World Congress 2019, MWC19, begins today and will continue through the 29th in Barcelona, Spain. Over 100,000 attendees are expected, along with 2,400 leading exhibitors. As the name suggests, Mobile World Congress focuses on connectivity, telecom, and communications. The topics covered at the event, however, span a wide range of electronics industries and applications. MWC19 is hosted by the Groupe Spéciale Mobile Association, better known as the GSMA, the mobile network operator’s trade group. According to CEO John Hoffman, the hyperconnectivity of 5G and the IoT, coupled with the nigh-omnipresent themes of intelligence in big data and AI, serve as the foundation of this year's theme. As John Hoffman’s introduction suggests, mobility nowadays means a lot more than mobile phones. The unprecedented breadth of the show is apparent from these published core themes. There are 39 keynote speakers listed at this time—and their affiliations are not limited to telecommunications companies. Their identities indicate how the new advances hyperconnectivity and intelligence will be for actors on many different stages. A complete list of the keynote speakers is here and a sampling is listed below. In addition, there are literally hundreds of other speakers on tap, listed here. The number of speakers representing governments, regulatory agencies, and businesses not directly involved in electronic design underlines the fact 5G and associated technologies are set to burst out of the research labs and onto the mainstream. An example from the regulatory sphere is a talk by Mustafa Jabbar, the Minister for Posts, Telecommunications, and Information Technology for the nation of Bangladesh. There will be far too many exhibits, workshops, conferences, and gatherings for any one individual to attend, so the conference goers will have to plan their viewings in advance. A link to the complete MWC19 Agenda is here. There's plenty of events and opportunities for industry investors. But what is there for EEs? MWC19 is presenting a range of topics on trends and future tech that may interest the industry-minded engineer. Also of interest may be this year's eSIM seminar on the challenges of deploying the IoT (identified as security, scalability, and connectivity), led by industry experts from Gemalto, Microsoft, Google, and more. Another session, led by Afilias, discusses the challenges of counterfeit devices, including regulation and data security. Chinese industry giant, Huawei, will also present several sessions, including a presentation of new 5G products. Do any of these topics stand out as particularly interesting to you? As an engineer, what topics would be helpful to you at a conference like this one? MWC19 stands out from other technology conferences in that its focus is not only about technology, itself, but also on the impact that the technology in question will have on a wide range of human endeavors. Overall, it is geared towards policy, marketing, and business, but it also features some relevant discussions about upcoming 5G and associated technologies have benefited from the huge amount of hype by the trade press as well as by the general press. There have also been a plethora of devices that manufacturers are now offering to exploit its capabilities. However, there are very few up-and-running implementations of 5G technology at the time of this writing. 5G and hyperconnectivity will link the factory floor, vehicles in motion, businesses, governments, and many other ventures into tighter links than ever before. As such, the effects of developing standards, and the competitions between governments to control those standards will be on stark display. For these reasons, MWC19 should be thought of as a show not about the present, but about the future—the very near, fast-approaching future. Are you at MCW19? Have you attended in the past?

Andrew,Davis,2463,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/TELEVISION-Who-is-John-Presloid-Gay-Jeopardy-champ-makes-waves/65453.html,"However, he also garnered the attention of the LGBT community when he subtly indicated he's part of the demographic when show host Alex Trebek asked him if he wanted to wager all of his winnings on a particular answer. ( Presloid said, ""My husband would kill me."" ) Presloid recently talked with Windy City Times about fame, the game and plans for his winnings. Windy City Times: What was something about the experience that you feel would surprise people? John Presloid: Everyone seems astonished that we shoot so many episodes in one day. We shoot an entire week in one day. It's really hectic; you're definitely exhausted by the end of the day. WCT: You had to keep this under your hat for how long? JP: We taped just after Thanksgiving, so it was about two months. People knew that I was on therethey just couldn't know the results. WCT: And this slice of fame [Presloid laughs]what's it been like? JP: It's been really weird. [Both laugh.] I didn't expect everything to blow up like this, going national and with the LGBT media. I know the fame won't last forever, though, but it's fun talking with people and basking in my 15 minutes. [Laughs] WCT: You casually mentioned your husband. He got a good laugh from that? JP: Oh, yeah. I mean he wouldn't have killed me. [Laughs] He said that was the only moment during my entire run that he wasn't having a heart attack. WCT: And is he as good at trivia as you are? JP: No, no. [Laughs] He jokes that when we go to bar trivia that he's happy just to get a couple questions. WCT: I'm on a pub trivia team myselfand the worst thing is when you think of the right answer just after you've turned in your [responses]. JP: Yeah; you're, like, ""Oh, crap!"" [Laughs] WCT: What's your advice for any aspiring Jeopardy! contestants? JP: Definitely keep trying. My first audition was the week after my 18th birthday, and that was almost 20 years ago. This was my fourth in-person audition [after passing the online test]. I think 100,000 people tried out in 2018, and I think they took one or two thousandand maybe 400 or 500 make it onto the show. Going to the auditions desensitized me to the point that I wasn't super-nervous the last time I went. I was thinking, ""It's going to happen or it's not."" Last time, I walked away feeling really good; I knew what to look out for. WCT: And what are your plans with your winnings? JP: Well, first, you have to wait 120 daysso I won't get the money until May or June. I have no set plans, although I'd like to take a trip to somewhere like Italy or Australianothing too crazy. But, actually, for the past couple years, I've been looking into having kids through adoption or surrogacy, and that's pretty expensiveso I'll probably set aside a good chunk of the money into something like that. Jeopardy! airs in Chicago at 3:30 p.m. weekdays on ABC.

Michael,Gordon,2475,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/feb/15/ex-senator-s-2-day-pass-draws-objection/,"A prosecutor asked a federal court Thursday to reconsider a decision allowing Gilbert Baker to leave an in-patient substance-abuse treatment center for more than two days this month, saying that long of an absence might interfere with Baker's treatment program. Baker, 62, of Conway is undergoing treatment at Freedom House in Russellville under court order as a condition of his release while awaiting trial on bribery and other charges. On Wednesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Harris had granted the former state senator's request to leave the center from 3 p.m. Feb. 22 through 5 p.m. Feb. 24 so that he could attend a son's wedding rehearsal dinner and wedding in Conway. Baker's attorney said in the request that a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office had authorized him ""to state the government has no objection to this request if the pretrial services office approves."" In asking Harris to reconsider her decision, Michael Gordon, who is criminal chief for the U.S. attorney's office, said that office ""believes there has been an inadvertent misunderstanding with defense counsel."" ""The United States does not oppose the defendant attending his son's wedding if Pretrial Services approves,"" Gordon added. ""However, the United States was not aware that the defendant would be requesting a [50-hour] pass, which amounts to the defendant missing more than two full days of his [30-day] treatment program."" Gordon said the prosecutor's office had spoken with the pretrial-services officer who is supervising Baker. ""After speaking with [the officer], who consulted with the defendant's counselor at Freedom House, the United States understands the recommendation of Pretrial Services and the Freedom House to be a day pass for the wedding,"" from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Feb 23, Gordon said. ""A longer pass may interfere with the defendant's success in the treatment program."" In 2016, Baker pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and refusing to take a breath test. A toxicology report later showed that he had tested positive for methamphetamine after the arrest. Baker, a former chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party, pleaded innocent in January to one count each of bribery and conspiracy and to seven counts of wire fraud. The charges resulted from an investigation of a purported scheme involving a nursing-home owner and a now-imprisoned former judge, Michael Maggio. Baker's trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 28. Maggio is serving a 10-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to a federal bribery charge. Nursing-home owner Michael Morton of Fort Smith has not been charged with a crime and has denied wrongdoing. Gordon is acting as U.S. attorney in the Baker case because U.S. Attorney Cody Hiland has recused.

Finish out your treatment program as mandated by the courts. Baker was an admitted meth head. The only pass that should be allowed is a day pass for the wedding which carries its own risks as there will most likely be drinking at the reception. Does the judge allow this for everyone else?!

Michael,Gordon,2469,https://www.theledger.com/news/20190213/convicted-killer-michael-gordon-breaks-down-in-tears-during-death-penalty-phase-of-trial-for-murders-of-polk-mother-patricia-moran-daughter-deborah-royal,"After weeks remaining stoic during his first-degree murder trial, Michael Anthony Gordon lost control Wednesday, breaking down in tears as his lawyer addressed the jury and shouting at a witness who was testifying about a jailhouse stabbing. BARTOW — After weeks remaining stoic during his first-degree murder trial, Michael Anthony Gordon lost control Wednesday, breaking down in tears as his lawyer addressed the jury and shouting at a witness who was testifying about a jailhouse stabbing. His outbursts came during the first day in the penalty phase of his trial. The 12-member jury convicted him Tuesday of brutally stabbing two Haines City women to death in a January 2015 home invasion. And because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, the same jurors began hearing additional testimony Wednesday. Based on the trial and penalty evidence, the jury will recommend whether Gordon should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment for the murders. Among the reasons prosecutors are arguing he should be sentenced to death is Gordon’s history of violence, including his conviction for an attack on another inmate while in custody. From the witness stand, Rasmes Simeon was telling the jury Wednesday that Gordon had stabbed him with a shank made from a prison-issued toothbrush. Gordon, who will be 39 Friday, began shouting at Simeon. “You had a knife on you,” he said. “Tell them the truth. You had a knife, that’s why. You was a bully. You was bullying everybody. Big bad Haitian Jack. Haitian Jack, the drug dealer that run Winter Haven.” As Gordon continued to shout, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb had court bailiffs escort the jury from the courtroom. “Everybody scared of you,” Gordon said, “coming in here with all your diamonds and your jewels on.” At one point, outside the jury’s presence, a court bailiff told Gordon he needed to shut up. “I shut up when I want to,” Gordon responded. Earlier in the day, when Clearwater lawyer Bjorn Brunvand addressed the jury, he discussed Gordon’s difficult upbringing, with an alcoholic father who abused him and his sister. He told them his sister had left home when she was 12, and will testify that she still regrets having left her brother in that situation. “To this day, she regrets that she left Michael Gordon behind — that she left him with a father who she knew was abusive,” he said, “and a mother who was unable and not capable of taking care of him and protecting him.” At that moment, Gordon fell into tears, his shoulders heaving as he wiped his eyes. “We’re not expecting that you will necessarily see God in Michael Gordon,” Brunvand said. “But we hope ... that you will see that Michael Gordon, despite the conviction, despite the horrific acts that he has participated in, is a fellow human being, a fellow man, a scared little boy inside that big man’s body of his.” He said Gordon appears to have experienced an injury as a child that affected the frontal lobe of his brain. “It’s the part of the brain that helps you respond appropriately when you are faced with fear,” Brunvand said. “It’s not working for Michael Gordon.” Medication enables Gordon to maintain control, he said, and for the decade he was in prison from 2005 until April 2014, the medication enabled him to live with others. But he wasn’t taking the medication after his release, and he started self-medicating with street drugs. “You will hear from a doctor, a pharmacologist, who will explain how that impacted him and how that may have affected what happened in this case,” he said. But Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme told jurors the viciousness of the killings can’t be ignored. “They are fighting for their lives,” she said, “all the while feeling what is going on.” Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, each was stabbed more than 50 times, and their throats were slashed so deeply, Royal was almost decapitated. Testimony is scheduled to continue today in the penalty phase, and jurors are expected to deliberate a recommendation by the end of the week. The final decision on sentencing will rest with Harb.

Bob,Diamond,2471,http://www.cityam.com/273287/qataris-pushed-quite-aggressively-barclays-fee-during,"A Barclays boss warned his colleagues that Qatari investors were pushing “quite aggressively” to be paid for a controversial services contract at the height of the financial crisis, a court heard today. Richard Boath told fellow executive Rich Ricci that Doha was growing impatient with the bank, after it apparently missed the deadline to pay for the first of two advisory service agreements (ASAs) struck during 2008. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) claims four senior Barclays executives used the ASAs to pay £322m in extra fees to the Qatar, in exchange for an investment that saved the bank from a bailout at the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago. The former Barclays employees on trial are Boath, former chief executive John Varley, Tom Kalaris, and Roger Jenkins. All four deny the charges, and claim the ASAs were genuine. It is the first criminal trial of top UK bank bosses since the financial crash. The Barclays trial – highlights so far: During a phone call on 4 August 2008, a recording of which was played to the jury at Southwark Crown Court, Boath told Ricci that apparent miscommunication within the bank meant the £42m payment for the ASA had not yet been made, despite the agreement having been signed over a month earlier. “The guy from [the Qatar Investment Authority] is pushing quite aggressively to get the money now,” Boath told Ricci. Ricci replied: “I’ll get an answer. We’ll get the payment out today.” Evidence presented today focused on the activities of Jenkins – known as ‘Big Dog’ – and Boath. The SFO claims Jenkins’ good relations with powerful Qataris meant he was instrumental to Barclays’ successful efforts to secure funding, with Boath helping to organise terms. In an email to former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius during July 2008, Jenkins described a seemingly positive appraisal meeting he had with the bank’s then-president, Bob Diamond, after the Qatari investment was secured. “I think I had lipstick marks on my left buttcheek,” Jenkins wrote. In a phone conversation with two senior Barclays lawyers – Mark Harding and Judith Shepherd – about how the second of the two ASAs could be presented, Boath described himself as “Big Dog’s bag boy”, in an apparent allusion to golf caddying. “Can’t we find a way through this that would enable us to pay a fee… and characterise the transaction in such a way that’s it’s, how will I say, defendable or appropriate?” he asked them during the conversation in September 2008. Shepherd said the terms of the first ASA, in which the Qataris agreed to provide political advice and help the bank with networking, could not easily be reused. “Clearly we can’t use a similar advisory arrangement because after all, how much advice do we need?” she said. Boath said he wasn’t privy to some conversations Jenkins was having at the time. “I don’t have Big Dog discussions,” Boath, whose phone was recorded because he was a trader, told the pair. “I’m a little dog.” The trial continues. * Terms and conditions

Bob,Diamond,2486,https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/capital-confidential-farage-delights-partipants-at-bob-diamond-linked-event-20190218,"Welcome to FN’s weekly diary column featuring all the best titbits from around the City of London... Farage delights ‘partipants’ Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond recently got the biggest cheer of the day at Funds Congress, London's largest asset management conference, when he passionately argued that the UK should remain in the European Union. Last June, Diamond took a 20% stake in Kepler Cheuvreux, the French brokerage. But while many French companies are not exactly cracking open the Moët & Chandon at the prospect of Brexit, Kepler Cheuvreux raised eyebrows in European finance circles last week by enthusiastically hosting Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, for lunch and then publicly blazing with bonhomie about its new friend. A report on the broker’s LinkedIn page said: “Very interesting presentation by an outstanding speaker to help investors and corporates achieve a better understanding of the next steps of Brexit and the European situation overall… close to 100 partipants [sic] joined the lunch and had the opportunity to debate with Mr Farage.” Diamond was understood not to be among the “partipants” and is known to take a dim view of Farage. However, a source close to him pointed out he’s a stakeholder of Kepler Cheuvreux and doesn’t run the company. The brokerage did not get back to Capital on how much it paid Farage for his “outstanding” oratory. Nothing to declare Anti-Brexit economist Dr Victoria Bateman has raised more than a few eyebrows by being interviewed naked for high-profile outlets to draw attention to the dangers of leaving the European Union. But what does her husband James Bateman, chief investment officer of investment giant Fidelity’s multi-asset investment team, make of his wife’s media campaign? Bateman was travelling in Europe for Fidelity when Capital called for a comment. His father Barry Bateman, a director of Fidelity Investments International and former president of the company, was also unavailable to speak about his daughter-in-law. But given James Bateman once allegedly sent colleagues a nude painting of his wife (which came to light during a sex discrimination lawsuit brought against Fidelity Worldwide Investment), presumably he approves of her Naked Truth approach. On the ball Now to the Conservative party’s Black and White Ball, the Tories’ most extravagant annual fundraiser. Except this year, with donors having to fork out £15,000 a table and parliament in chaos, the event was not at full capacity. Our spy reports a fake partition was installed at venue Battersea Evolution to give the appearance of a sold-out affair. One joke doing the rounds was: “There’s new money over there, old money over there and no deal over there!” Geoffrey Cox, the flamboyant attorney-general, was overheard jokingly telling fellow diners: “The first person to bring up Brexit will be hit.” Happily no physical violence ensued. Both Cox and the Conservative party did not respond when contacted for comment. No relation In a crowded category, Steve Cohen might well be the most reclusive billionaire hedge fund manager. So it’s unsurprising that misinformation surrounds the Point72 founder. A case in point is a popular rumour in New York hedge fund circles that Cohen has hired his daughter-in-law Tiffany Galvin-Cohen to work as his in-house PR. Galvin-Cohen married a Steven Cohen in New York in March 2017 and joined Point72 to work in media relations last October. This has led some to speculate that her husband is one of Cohen’s five children. Fake news, according to the lady herself, who in true hedgie style worked in comms for Goldman Sachs before Point72. “I’m glad that you asked because I’m not related to Steve at all,” Galvin-Cohen tells Capital about her boss. Happy to oblige! Quiet start-up In a development that might have passed you by, a new Financial Times-backed website Sifted has just launched. Sifted, devoted to the European start-up tech scene and young entrepreneurs, is the brainchild of FT innovation editor John Thornhill. The Pink ’Un has taken a 25% stake in Sifted, which is also backed by British, French, German, Greek and Swedish angel investors. While the FT has a licensing agreement with Sifted, the paper declares it is independent from the website. Perhaps too independent. A recent FT news story about economic pressure on start-ups by Aliya Ram and Tim Bradshaw warned: “For investors, the concern is that start-ups founded in the last 10 years will only have experienced a strong economy and could be unprepared for a downturn.” That piece has yet to appear on Sifted. Penn-demonium A copy of the latest quarterly investment review from the Capital Group, the private debt manager where the prime minister’s husband Philip May is relationship manager, landed on this column’s desk. The review rates the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at 20%. James Penn, Capital Group’s investment manager, writes in relation to Brexit and the stock market that “thus far into December, there isn’t much evidence of festive cheer”. He adds: “While it is hazardous to make predictions in the current environment, here’s my pennyworth about what may happen (no pun intended on the prime minister’s name) in the next few months.” Did Penn clear this awkward May moniker talk with the prime minister's husband in advance? Hanging in the air German airline Lufthansa is suing a passenger for saving money by opting not to take the last leg of a flight. However, frequent flyers note the company has previous form of its own in this regard. Eurowings, the Lufthansa-owned low-cost airline, recently delayed a flight from Cologne Bonn airport that a Capital acquaintance was flying on. Passengers based close to the airport were told by Eurowings that they could go home and return in five hours to take the delayed flight. But the airline then changed tack and moved the departure time forward by three hours, meaning some passengers missed the flight.

Simon,Stertzer,2479,http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/medical-startups-to-watch-in-2019-2019/,"Medical startups are challenged with finding solutions to some of today’s biggest killers. For example, 1 in 3 Americans die every year due to cardiovascular disease alone. However, with advancements being made every year in the healthcare industry, companies are finding more ways to bring these numbers down. In particular, stem cell research and heart medicines are making great strides. This article is going to show a few cardiovascular medicines and stem cell therapy startup companies to watch in 2019. photo/ pixels Codindus Vascular Robotics s a global technology leader in robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company’s ‘CorPath System’ uses robots to assist in percutaneous coronary interventions and vascular procedures. Corindus’ next-generation CorPath GRX System is advancing the field of robotic interventional cardiology, offering improvements in procedural control for the physician, workflow for the technologist, radiation protection for physicians and the potential to reduce radiation exposure for staff and patients. Codindus Vascular is gaining a lot of attention from leading physicians across the world. Simon Stertzer, a professor at Stanford University and the first doctor to perform coronary angioplasty in the United States, is particularly excited about this company. Prognos is a healthcare startup company leveraging AI to create a large integrated database of multi-sourced clinical diagnostics data. Prognos applies smartest AI to clinical data to drive the right decisions earlier and improve patient health. They use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure to provide an interpretation of clinical diagnostics. The platform uses clinical algorithms across more than 30 conditions to predict the patient’s condition early, identify treatment options indicate any risks associated and show opportunities for clinical trials. The database stores over 16 billion records for over 185 million patients and will only get bigger. Celularity is a biotechnology company that productizes allogeneic cells and tissues derived from the postpartum placenta. These are materials that can help the immune system and amplify the body’s ability to fight disease, heal, and regenerate itself. Celularity acts as a “biorefinery” to harness the power of the placenta to create therapies across autoimmune and degenerative diseases, immuno-oncology, and functional regeneration. They are the first healthcare company to own and deploy the full value chain from sourcing placental stem cells to patient treatment. Celularity also has a wide range of biosourcing options, providing access to more stem cells needed for current treatments. Today’s stem cell transplants are accepted as standard therapy for more than 80 diseases, including common conditions leukaemia but Celularity wants to cure other rare conditions with the use of stem cell therapy. ViaCyte is another healthcare startup company in the field of regenerative medicine. Based in California, ViaCyte is creating innovative products to cure diabetes. They have developed a device called the Encaptra, a cell delivery system, that matures pancreatic beta cell precursors into endocrine cells that secrete insulin and other hormones in a regulated manner to control blood glucose levels. ViaCyte’s goal is to free patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes from long-term insulin dependence. If successful, ViaCyte’s products will relieve patients of both the acute challenges and risks, as well as the long-term complications, associated with diabetes. In fact, in January 2019, they announced that a human stem cell-derived product candidate has been implanted in type 1 diabetes patients. Bay Labs is another great medical startup company. They are using artificial intelligence, with cardiovascular imaging to help in the diagnosis and management of heart disease, the world’s leading cause of death. They aim to use deep learning techniques to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. At NVIDIA’s Inception competition in 2017, Bay Labs was recognized as one of the most promising AI startups in the social impact category. Their vision is to improve worldwide healthcare and build new solutions that can help patients with long-term clinical problems. To achieve this, they are putting together a team of experts, including both IT and medical professionals. Rubius Therapeutics are transforming red blood cells into cellular medicines. They are focused on creating life-changing cellular therapies for patients with rare enzyme deficiencies, cancer and autoimmune diseases. Their medicine is called Red Cell Therapeutics ie RCTs. These are engineered to express biotherapeutic proteins within or on their cell surface to create highly selective, potent and allogeneic cellular medicines aimed at a range of treatments. They may also be used to treat patients with rare enzyme deficiencies, kill cancer tumours and regulate the immune system. K Health is a free, HIPAA-compliant AI healthcare app which collects information about a patient’s medical background. The app uses artificial intelligence to provide insights and tips to manage their conditions and has recently raised another 25 million in funding. Users enter their symptoms into the app which then provides a list of potential diagnoses. While this is incredibly useful, what’s even more important is that based on the information entered by the user, the app suggests a list of specialist physicians that can potentially help treat their condition. Considering 80% of all internet users have searched for health-related topics online, this massive database of healthcare information could help identify conditions early and save millions of lives every year. The final company on this list of best healthcare startups is ReNeuron. They are a leading, clinical-stage stem cell business, aiming to develop novel stem cell therapies targeting areas of significant unmet or poorly met medical needs. Their unique stem cell technologies develop cell-based therapies for significant disease conditions where the cells can be readily administered “off-the-shelf” to eligible patients without needing additional treatments. Their lead stem cell therapeutic candidate targets treating patients left disabled by a stroke. They are also progressing in their pre-clinical development of exosome nanomedicine platform. Exosomes are nanoparticles secreted into the culture media during the expansion of stem cells. They contain a number of biologically active molecules such as proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) that can regulate gene expression. These molecules may unlock therapeutic benefits across a number of disease areas. ReNeuron works closely with a number of key academic and industrial partners to achieve their goals.

Phillip,Frost,2468,https://cubanartnews.org/2019/02/13/cuban-art-curator-carol-damian-carlos-estevez/,"Carol Damian on her latest exhibition, the upcoming Havana Biennial & Cuban art right now Dr. Carol Damian is a former professor of art and art history and former director and chief curator at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, Miami. Over the years she has curated numerous exhibitions for museums and galleries—most recently, Carlos Estevez: Entelechy, Works from 1992 to 2018, on view through May 5 at the Tucson Museum of Art. After the exhibition’s recent opening in Tucson, Irina Leyva-Pérez spoke with Damian about the exhibition, about Cuban art and artists in Miami, and the evolving position of Cuban art in the international art world. Congratulations to you and Carlos on the exhibition. How did the show come about? I have been following Carlos’s work for over ten years, since he arrived in Miami. I was so impressed with it, and with the level of intellectualism informing everything he does. We began planning a monograph years ago. And an exhibition, but that takes time. How did the show come to the Tucson Museum of Art? I started planning the show around five years ago. Eventually my proposal found its way to the Freedom Tower, where Jeremy Mikolajczak was the director. When he left to take the position of director at Tucson, he took the show with him—happily for us. Carlos trained and began his career in Havana and has lived in Miami for many years. From your perspective, what’s the current relationship between the Miami and Havana art scenes? What has changed over the past few years? The Havana-Miami art scene has always been dynamic, with artists arriving over the years at different points in their career, and even growing up and going to school in Miami. So Cuban artists have been very dominant in the community. There are so many artists to name. But to limit it to the Miami scene, certainly masters like Cundo Bermúdez, Manuel Carbonell, and Rafael Soriano have made their mark. And now another generation of recognized artists—like José Bedia, Carlos Luna, Demi and Arturo Rodríguez, Gory, María Martínez-Cañas, María Brito, María Lino (to name a few)—are joined by emerging artists like Jorge Ríos, Aurora Molina, Leonor Anthony, and Rafael Domenech. Of course, there are many who have exhibited in Miami and have moved elsewhere—Jorge Wellesley, Douglas Argüelles, and Jairo Alfonso among them. Over the past few years, especially as relations opened up and tourism increased, there has been a remarkable interest in the art on the island. The ability of artists to go back and forth has also enhanced this situation and, in my opinion, added to the success and visibility of the arts. Sandra Ramos, Glexis Novoa, and Carlos Quintana move between both locations, while others exhibit in Miami regularly but live in Havana, including Manuel Fors, José Toirac, Diana Fonseca, and Abel Barroso. There is incredible exchange, respect, and dialogue among the many artists, most of whom find a Miami exhibition to be a feather in their cap. I am always impressed with exhibitions’ opening receptions, where the artists all come to support their colleagues. It never seems to be competitive, but genuinely supportive. The last Havana Biennial in 2015 was well attended by US visitors, and the next one is coming up in April. Will you be there? Yes. I am planning to bring a group, so I’ve been following the Biennial closely. I am most interested in the special projects that accompany the institutional exhibitions. I always think that Juan Delgado’s Malecón project [Detrás del muro] is important, and I’m looking forward to its expansion. I also find it interesting that the Italy-based Galleria Continua is opening a project, El País de Arte, in a new space. That adds to the international dimension. It’s exciting that the Biennial is venturing outside Havana. I’m planning to bring my group to Matanzas to visit María Magdalena Campos-Pons, who is coordinating the project Ríos intermitentes (Intermittent Rivers). That will be a site-specific installation throughout the city of her birth, and will focus on the significant African heritage of the island. The Biennial covers a lot of territory this year, and hopefully we will visit other places as well. There is always so much to pack in! As 2019 begins, how would you describe the position of Cuban art in the contemporary art world? I think every year there is more and more attention to Havana internationally, with international travel surpassing American travel because of the difficulties we face politically. On the art fair circuit, it seems that every year more Cuban artists are represented by galleries, increasing their reputation and accessibility. Since Miami and Miami Beach are home to the majority of Cuban artists and collectors outside the island, Art Basel Miami Beach in particular is an opportunity to see this work within an international market context. As a curator, what interests you most about Cuban art, on the island and abroad? There is a special spirit about Cuban art, and especially the artists. They have this great sense of survival that’s almost like a mission, and I admire that. Their use of materials is always extraordinary, and I find the art unique, without the baggage of art history’s classifications and movements. Cuban art is much broader in concept, with an independence that is very attractive. What’s next for you? What Cuba-related projects are you working on? I am doing a lot of writing—artist catalogues and reviews—and have my own Peruvian projects, including a book, as well. I continue to work closely with the Cuban artists in Miami and will soon begin something that is in the works now. For many years, I have worked closely with women artists, and taught specialized courses in the history of women in art. Teaching at a Miami university has given me the opportunity to include the local community of artists—especially Cuban women with whom I have become very friendly, and whose work I have supported over the years. They enjoy coming to the classes and the students find their life stories fascinating. My next projects will be about the women. One may be more historical, as I learned that there were many important artists in Cuba over the last hundred years who have been neglected. Another will be with a young Cuban woman just beginning a very exciting career. I am also interested in women activist artists. We are busy organizing an exhibition with several Cuban women who work as political, social, and environmental activists, as a continuation of a project I did at Art Miami 2017.

James Forese, el presidente de Citigroup, el coloso bancario estadounidense con presencia en más de 100 países del mundo, ha reconocido este martes ante el auditorio del Mobile World Congress en Barcelona que el sector bancario aún arrastra un grave problema de credibilidad. “En el conjunto, hemos sufrido un pérdida de confianza a raíz de la crisis financiera”, reconoció el ejecutivo, que alertó sobre la creciente presencia de “intrusos” en las finanzas, en una alusión al boom de sociedades de intermediación financiera (al estilo de los llamados bancos digitales o fintech) que están aprovechando estas debilidades para ganar mercado a las entidades tradicionales. Las entidades tradicionales compiten con las fintech y con su propia imagen Forese recordó que un tercio de la población mundial, unas 1.700 millones de personas, no tienen cuenta corriente bancaria, especialmente en las economías emergentes y que la baja credibilidad de la banca, precisamente, no ayuda a establecer las necesarias relaciones de confianza con estos usuarios potenciales. “Nos hemos dado cuenta de que solos no podemos llegar a estos clientes y por eso establecemos acuerdos con socios locales”, dijo Forese, En este ámbito, la tecnología es fundamental. Citigroup ha establecido acuerdos con operadores de telecomunicaciones en México (América Movil) y sistemas de pagos en África (ImpalaPay en Kenia) para que las personas puedan operar mediante el teléfono móvil, considerada como la herramienta clave para lograr una mayor bancarización. En el país africano han conseguido, por ejemplo, que 250.000 campesinos consigan llevar a cabo millones de micropagos. La gente tiene que entender que somos una parte responsable de la sociedad” Aún así, Forese reconoció que “nos tenemos que ganar la confianza”, de allí que la entidad busque también el respaldo también de instituciones, gobiernos y administraciones a la hora de implementar y ofrecer sus servicios. “La gente tiene que entender que somos una parte responsable de la sociedad”, aseguró el ejecutivo. En el 2010 Citigroup llegó a un acuerdo con la autoridad bursátil estadounidense para pagar una multa de casi 60 millones de euros “por engañar a los inversores sobre la exposición de la entidad a los activos relacionados con las hipotecas subprime”, que dieron lugar a la crisis financiera en el 2008. Este verano la Reserva Federal le impuso otra sanción de 7,5 millones de euros por irregularidades en la concesión de servicios relacionados con las hipotecas en EE.UU. © La Vanguardia Ediciones Todos los derechos reservados

DENVER, CO - FEBRUARY 22: Angel Rios of Valley High School competes in the Class 3A 106-pound match of the state wrestling tournament at the Pepsi Center on Feb. 22, 2019, in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post) The Colorado high school wrestling state tournaments take place Thursday, Feb. 21 through Saturday, Feb. 23 at the Pepsi Center in Denver. Our staff will be there throughout the weekend providing live coverage. Refresh this page for the latest updates and results. In addition, real-time Tweets from reporters around the state are at the bottom of this page. Note: Day 3 live coverage will begin late Saturday afternoon. We will link to that story once it’s live. (9:32 p.m.) Team scores heading into Saturday. In Class 5A, Pomona has 124.5 points while Ponderosa is second with 84.5, while Pueblo East (168) is outdistancing Pueblo County (134) and Windsor (130) in 4A. In the lower classifications, Alamosa (103.5) has the edge over Eaton (89) while Wray is dominating the 3A bracket with 126 points, far better than second-place Centauri (85). (9:10 p.m.) Four-peat history. Three wreslters advanced to the finals with a chance to earn a fourth-consecutive state title: Brendon Garica (Pueblo County), Andrew Alirez (Greeley Central) and Cohlton Schultz (Ponderosa). Never before has the state tournament crowned three four-time state champions in the same year. (8:14 p.m.) Robison’s four-peat falls short. In perhaps the biggest upset of the weekend, Regis Jesuit sophomore Antonio Segura took down three-time champion Theorius Robison of Pomona in the Class 5A 145 semifinals. Segura (35-8) needed extra time to knock off the Northern Colorado commit, pinning him 1:27 into the period to set up a finals showdown against Legacy’s Joey Joiner (35-12). (7:52 p.m.) Pomona, Ponderosa to clash for titles. The perennial Class 5A heavyweights will have wrestlers meet in two different weight classes in the title matches as the Panthers are running away with the team crown and the Mustangs seem like a sure bet for second place. Pomona freshman Daniel Cardenas (33-7) faces Ponderosa sophomore Jaron Mahler (37-8) for the 120 title Saturday after Mahler upset a defending champion, Grand Junction’s Dawson Collins, with a sudden victory in the semifinals. And at 126, Pomona junior Wyatt Yapoujian (24-4) takes on Ponderosa senior Mosha Schwartz (42-6) in a showdown everyone saw coming. (7:36 p.m.) Semifinals underway. With a strong crowd on hand, Monarch sophomore Vince Cornella was among the lightweights who made an early statement on Friday night. The 2018 champion at 106 cruised to a second-round pin of Pomona freshman Jacob Judd in the Class 5A 113 bracket to advance to Saturday’s finals, where he will take on Denver East sophomore Armando Garcia. Garcia beat Douglas County’s Max Black 3-0 to set up the title showdown. (6:29 p.m.) Unified wrestling sets stage. Outside the Pepsi Center, temperatures are dropping and snow’s starting to come down. Inside, Unified wrestling’s getting the fans warmed up, the crowd is filling in and a nervous buzz is permeating the arena with the semifinal matches for all classes set to begin in about 15 minutes. This is often the point in the bracket where the competition comes to a head — there are few, if any, blowouts and each grappler is going to scrap with everything he has for a chance to wrestle in Saturday’s finals. (5:59 p.m.) Girl power! Welcome to history, folks: For the first time in the state tourney, multiple female wrestlers are still alive in the bracket on Saturday, and they’re both in Class 3A and both repping the same weight class (106). Valley’s Angel Rios defeated Casteus Combs of Sterling, 9-0, in the second round of consolations on Friday, while Skyview’s Jaslynn Gallegos topped Alex Castaneda of Eaton, 9-5. Rios earlier this month became the first female wrestler in state history to win a regional and has drawn Brendan Johnston from The Classical Academy out of Colorado Springs in the placing round. Johnston has drawn Rios three times recently and declined to wrestle her — taking a forfeit — all three times for personal reasons. Johnston defeated Elijah Kitchens of Estes Park, 19-7. (3:23 p.m.) The consolation bracket matters. With the first round of consolation matches for all classes in the books, it’s important to keep in mind how critical the consolation side of the bracket can be when it comes to determining the team champions. Though Wray (2A), Pueblo East (4A) and Pomona (5A) are each running away from the field in their respective classes, there’s still some intrigue in the Class 3A race heading into this evening’s second round of consolation matches and semifinals. Alamosa is in the lead, but Lamar (13 qualifiers) and Eaton (10) are still in the picture if they can put up points by as many individuals as possible. (2:19 p.m.) Undefeated guys still alive. Pueblo East’s Andy Garcia extended his record to 23-0 with a pin in the Class 4A 285 quarterfinals, and his performance was preceded by other undefeated big-school wrestlers also extending their perfect seasons. Windsor’s Dominick Serrano (40-0 at 4A 132), Greeley Central’s Andrew Alirez (31-0 at 4A 152), Pueblo County’s Christopher Fasano (40-0 at 4A 160), Windsor’s Isaiah Salazar (41-0 at 4A 182), Pueblo East’s Zion Freeman (36-0 at 4A 195), Grand Junction’s Hunter Tobiasson (40-0 at 5A 220) and Ponderosa’s Cohl Schultz (44-0 at 5A 285) all advanced, too. (1:08 p.m.) Dawson Collins rolls into semifinals. The Grand Junction senior who won the 113 title last season continued his march for a repeat. After inducing a tech fall in Thursday’s preliminary round, Collins — a linchpin of the Tigers’ Class 5A title team last season — pinned Monarch sophomore Ryan Kuykendall in the third period of his 120 quarterfinal match. (12:21 p.m.) Pueblo East primed to increase lead. The Eagles put up 42 points to pace Class 4A after Day 1 as coach Pat Laughlin saw 11 of his 12 qualifiers advance. Junior heavyweight Andy Garcia headlines, as he’s aiming for a third state title and has been buoyed by extensive offseason wrestling, including a trip to Croatia. Meanwhile, senior Jace Trujillo (state champion as a freshman, two-time placer) is a force at 132, junior Aaden Valdez is hungry at 138 after his runner-up finish in 2018, and CSU-Pueblo commits Zion Freeman (undefeated at 195), Ryan Roth (126) and Dominic Robles (220) all have title potential as well. (11:45 a.m.) Rios moves on in consolation, Bauer remains perfect. Valley’s Angel Rios (3A 106), the other girl competitor left in the tournament, defeated Sheridan’s James Cordova in consolations to say alive. County Line’s Jayce Bauer (2A 220) extended his undefeated record to 40-0 and advanced to the semifinals with a pin in 3:39 over Fleming’s Andrew Davis. (10:00 a.m.) State champ advances, girl wrestler falls. The weight classes are getting bigger and the excitement is picking up as semifinalists are crowned and comeback efforts begin. No surprise here, but John Wall’s Wesley VanMatre (No. 1 in 2A 138) rolled to a 11-5 victory over Traycer Hall from Hotchkiss. VanMatre is a junior seeking his third-straight title. Skyview senior Jaslynn Gallegos (3A 106), one of two girls left in the state tournament, fell in the quarterfinals to Alamosa’s Davion Chavez by a 9-1 major decision. (8:52 a.m.) Quarterfinal round underway. A frigid chill hangs outside the Pepsi Center this morning, but the heat is on inside as 3A and 2A high school wrestlers from Colorado have completed their warmups for the state championship quarterfinals. A steady flow of fans are filing in their seats. Pockets of noise are exploding from different parts of the arena. It’s go-time.
