1020357,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Congressman Joe Kennedy III ( D-Massachusetts ) led efforts for a resolution opposing President Trump's ban on openly transgender servicemembers from serving in the nation's militaryand said resolution has 103 co-sponsors, according to a joint statement from The American Military Partner Association, OutServe-SLDN and SPARTA. American Military Partner Association President Ashley Broadway-Mack said, ""While the Trump-Pence administration unconscionably singles out these brave transgender Americans for discrimination, it's crucial that Members of Congress make clear they stand behind them and are grateful for their service and sacrifice. We are thankful for Representative Joe Kennedy's leadership on this important resolution."" The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) is honoring Black History Month by highlighting not only the straight Black icons and legends but also the LGBTQ ones as well, Instinct Magazine noted. The HRC released a blog post in which it named several Black figures in entertainment like Jussie Smollett, Janelle Monae, and the cast of Pose, politicians like Kamala Harris and Lauren Underwood, and historical figures like Marsha P. Johnson and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy. The life of late LGBTQ advocate Edith ""Edie"" Windsor will be immortalized in A Wild and Precious Lifea forthcoming memoir started by Windsor prior to her death two years ago, NewNowNext.com reported. Windsor made a name for herself nationwide in 2013, when she was the lead plaintiff on the federal lawsuit that successfully struck down the anti-gay Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ). Her case paved the way for the Supreme Court's groundbreaking 2015 ruling that legalized marriage equality in the United States. In Miami, Florida International University's Frost Art Museum will run the exhibit ""Jess T. Dugan and Vanessa Fabbre: To Survive on This Shore"" through April 28, according to a press release. In the exhibit, Dugan and Fabbre reveal how U.S. culture lacks representation of older adults who are transgender and gender non-conforming. ( Photos are also in the hardcover book To Survive on This Shore. ) The show is part of the museum's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which will include the presentation in the fall of Art After Stonewall ( 1969-1989 ), the first major museum exhibition about how the LGBT-rights movement impacted the art world. The Rev. Thomas James Brown was elected Feb. 9 to become the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Maineand is the married gay priest elected to lead a diocese, Episcopal News Service reported. He is married to the Rev. Thomas Mousin, who is currently the rector of St. John's Episcopal Church in Charlestown, a neighborhood of Boston. The Rt. Rev. Gene Robinson became the first openly gay and partnered bishop in the Anglican Communion in 2003 and served as the Diocese of New Hampshire's bishop until his retirement in January 2013; he and husband Mark Andrew divorced in 2014. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello's administration issued guidelines that are designed to make the U.S. commonwealth's public employees more sensitive to the needs of transgender people and same-sex couples and their children, The Washington Blade noted. The guidelines specifically refer to trans Puerto Ricans who want to change the gender on their birth certificates as well as children whose parents are legally married same-sex couples. The federal appeals court in the Fifth Circuit said its 40-year-old precedent that federal civil-rights law doesn't apply to gay workers also means that transgender workers aren't covered, Bloomberg Law reported. The ruling stemmed from a discrimination lawsuit filed by Nicole Wittmer, a transgender woman who applied for an engineering job with Phillips 66; she claims she was denied the position because of her gender identity. Federal Judge Stephanie M. Rose ruled that a Christian student group at the University of Iowa can't be stripped of its affiliation with the institutioneven if its members follow a ""statement of faith"" that bans those in LGBTQ relationships from leadership roles, InsideHigherEd.com reported. Pro-LGBTQ advocates are worried the decision would open the door for a challenge of a U.S. Supreme Court case from 2010 that allows colleges and universities to enforce anti-discrimination policies, even when student religious organizations claim those policies infringe on their beliefs. Also at the University of Iowa, the UI LGBTQ Resource Center has renamed itself the Pride Alliance Center in order to be more inclusive of diverse sexual and gender identities, as well as to clarify the purpose of the center, The Daily Iowan noted. Alex Barethe outreach director of Spectrum UI, a LGBTQ student organization on campussaid the LGBTQ abbreviation is not fully inclusive of all sexualities and gender identities. The Southern Black Policy & Advocacy Networka non-profit focused on improving health outcomes and reducing social and economic disparities impacting Black communities living in the U.S. Southlaunched the Southern Black HIV/AIDS Network's Advisory, a press release noted. The council will aim to provide strategic direction and organize Black leaders in the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. South. Also, the network is launching Organizing to End Black HIV NOW ( bit.ly/EndBlackHIV ), a campaign focused on organizing and mobilizing Black HIV leaders and advocates on the front lines of ending the epidemic in the U.S. South. The Virginia Board of Counseling, on Feb. 8, voted in favor of issuing guidance and documents that recommend a ban on licensed counselors from practicing conversion therapy on minors, The Washington Blade reported, citing TV station WWBT. Counselors in the state who continue to engage in conversion therapy will receive ""a finding of misconduct and disciplinary action"" from the board. Terry Tinsey was the only board member who opposed the measure, expressing concern over the impact the documents and regulations may have on the ""faith community."" The Human Rights Campaign Foundation ( HRC ) announced that it will honor actress/advocate Josie Totah with an Upstander Award at the organization's sixth annual Time to THRIVE Conference on Feb. 15-17 at the Anaheim Marriott in Anaheim, California. Last year, Totah, who starred in the NBC sitcom Champions, came out as transgender in an op-ed for Time magazine. HRC also announced that the band OneUp will perform on the opening night of the conference. In North Carolina, an openly lesbian Durham City Council member's appearance at a local Catholic institution Immaculata Catholic School was canceled because of planned demonstratinos, ABC11.com reported. The school said it had planned to kick off Black History Month celebrations at their morning prayer on Friday with a variety of speeches, including one from Vernetta Alston, an Immaculata alum. ""As pastor, I cannot place our Immaculata students into this contentious environment,"" said Pastor Christopher VanHaight. The U.S. Supreme Court blocked Louisiana from enforcing a law that women's groups said would leave only a single doctor legally allowed to perform abortions in the state, NBC News reported. By a five-to-four vote, the court said the restrictions must remain on hold while challengers appeal a lower-court decision in favor of the law. Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the court's liberal members. A first-of-its-kind conference in Ohio addressed issues once swept under the rug, as inaugural two-day LGBT Horizons of Aging Summit took place in Dayton, WDTN.com reported. Public Health of Dayton and Montgomery County, along with United Church Homes and Rainbow Elder Care, organized the summit in response to a growing need to support an aging LGBT generation that lived much of its lives openly. A security guard was stabbed in the back outside of Micky's Bar while escorting a man out of the West Hollywood spot, WeHo Times reported. Authorities say that deputies responded within seconds of the incident and detained the suspect. The victim suffered two non-life-threatening stab wounds in the upper back; he was transported to a nearby hospital and was expected to survive. In West Virginia, Del. Eric Porterfield, R-Mercer, caused controversy after comparing gay people to the Ku Klux Klan, WVGazetteMail.com noted. ""The LGBTQ is a modern-day version of the Ku Klux Klan, without wearing hoods with their antics of hate,"" Porterfield said in an interview. He also called the gay community a ""terrorist group"" and said he is being ""persecuted"" by the gay community in retaliation for his remarks, including receiving threats on Facebook and voicemails. House Republicans sought to distance themselves from Porterfield's remarks. Multiple bills filed in the Tennessee General Assembly would allow adoption agencies to deny services to same-sex couples based on religious objections, USA Today reported. One billfiled by Republican legislators Joey Hensley and John Raganspecifies that an adoption agency would not be required to provide services to a couple if it would conflict with the agency's ""sincerely held religious beliefs."" Legislation filed by Republican Tim Rudd puts in place similar protections for discrimination based on religious beliefs and would prevent a couple from suing the adoption agency for refusing to provide services. In Texas, the Carrollton City Council passed an employment nondiscrimination ordinance that bans discrimination based on, among other things, sexual orientation and gender identity. The ordinance, approved on a five-to-two vote that basically revised the city's existing nondiscrimination ordinance, protects city employees, contractors and political appointees. It also bans discrimination based on pregnancy and political beliefs. Julian is a Mermaid, by Jessica Love and published by Candlewick Press, and Hurricane Child, by Kheryn Callender and published by Scholastic Press, are the 2019 recipients of the Stonewall Book Awards-Mike Morgan & Larry Romans Children's & Young Adult Literature Award, an American Library Association ( ALA ) press release noted. The Stonewall Book Awards are given annually to English-language works of exceptional merit for children or teens relating to the LGBT experience. The award will be presented to the winning authors or editors at the ALA's Annual Conference & Exhibition in Washington, D.C., in June. Two government contractors35-year-old Peter Melendez and 27-year-old Robert Koehlerwere arrested after they were caught trying to get on the gay-focused Atlantis Events cruise to sell drugs, Instinct Magazine noted. The government contractors planned ""to smuggle the narcotics into the ship and distribute it once on board the ship,"" according to police records of the arrest. Before they could, a Homeland Security special agent intercepted the emails and alerted Miami-Dade police.

1015016,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"A Barclays boss warned his colleagues that Qatari investors were pushing “quite aggressively” to be paid for a controversial services contract at the height of the financial crisis, a court heard today. Richard Boath told fellow executive Rich Ricci that Doha was growing impatient with the bank, after it apparently missed the deadline to pay for the first of two advisory service agreements (ASAs) struck during 2008. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) claims four senior Barclays executives used the ASAs to pay £322m in extra fees to the Qatar, in exchange for an investment that saved the bank from a bailout at the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago. The former Barclays employees on trial are Boath, former chief executive John Varley, Tom Kalaris, and Roger Jenkins. All four deny the charges, and claim the ASAs were genuine. It is the first criminal trial of top UK bank bosses since the financial crash. The Barclays trial – highlights so far: During a phone call on 4 August 2008, a recording of which was played to the jury at Southwark Crown Court, Boath told Ricci that apparent miscommunication within the bank meant the £42m payment for the ASA had not yet been made, despite the agreement having been signed over a month earlier. “The guy from [the Qatar Investment Authority] is pushing quite aggressively to get the money now,” Boath told Ricci. Ricci replied: “I’ll get an answer. We’ll get the payment out today.” Evidence presented today focused on the activities of Jenkins – known as ‘Big Dog’ – and Boath. The SFO claims Jenkins’ good relations with powerful Qataris meant he was instrumental to Barclays’ successful efforts to secure funding, with Boath helping to organise terms. In an email to former Barclays chairman Marcus Agius during July 2008, Jenkins described a seemingly positive appraisal meeting he had with the bank’s then-president, Bob Diamond, after the Qatari investment was secured. “I think I had lipstick marks on my left buttcheek,” Jenkins wrote. In a phone conversation with two senior Barclays lawyers – Mark Harding and Judith Shepherd – about how the second of the two ASAs could be presented, Boath described himself as “Big Dog’s bag boy”, in an apparent allusion to golf caddying. “Can’t we find a way through this that would enable us to pay a fee… and characterise the transaction in such a way that’s it’s, how will I say, defendable or appropriate?” he asked them during the conversation in September 2008. Shepherd said the terms of the first ASA, in which the Qataris agreed to provide political advice and help the bank with networking, could not easily be reused. “Clearly we can’t use a similar advisory arrangement because after all, how much advice do we need?” she said. Boath said he wasn’t privy to some conversations Jenkins was having at the time. “I don’t have Big Dog discussions,” Boath, whose phone was recorded because he was a trader, told the pair. “I’m a little dog.” The trial continues. * Terms and conditions

1015016,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Welcome to FN’s weekly diary column featuring all the best titbits from around the City of London... Farage delights ‘partipants’ Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond recently got the biggest cheer of the day at Funds Congress, London's largest asset management conference, when he passionately argued that the UK should remain in the European Union. Last June, Diamond took a 20% stake in Kepler Cheuvreux, the French brokerage. But while many French companies are not exactly cracking open the Moët & Chandon at the prospect of Brexit, Kepler Cheuvreux raised eyebrows in European finance circles last week by enthusiastically hosting Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, for lunch and then publicly blazing with bonhomie about its new friend. A report on the broker’s LinkedIn page said: “Very interesting presentation by an outstanding speaker to help investors and corporates achieve a better understanding of the next steps of Brexit and the European situation overall… close to 100 partipants [sic] joined the lunch and had the opportunity to debate with Mr Farage.” Diamond was understood not to be among the “partipants” and is known to take a dim view of Farage. However, a source close to him pointed out he’s a stakeholder of Kepler Cheuvreux and doesn’t run the company. The brokerage did not get back to Capital on how much it paid Farage for his “outstanding” oratory. Nothing to declare Anti-Brexit economist Dr Victoria Bateman has raised more than a few eyebrows by being interviewed naked for high-profile outlets to draw attention to the dangers of leaving the European Union. But what does her husband James Bateman, chief investment officer of investment giant Fidelity’s multi-asset investment team, make of his wife’s media campaign? Bateman was travelling in Europe for Fidelity when Capital called for a comment. His father Barry Bateman, a director of Fidelity Investments International and former president of the company, was also unavailable to speak about his daughter-in-law. But given James Bateman once allegedly sent colleagues a nude painting of his wife (which came to light during a sex discrimination lawsuit brought against Fidelity Worldwide Investment), presumably he approves of her Naked Truth approach. On the ball Now to the Conservative party’s Black and White Ball, the Tories’ most extravagant annual fundraiser. Except this year, with donors having to fork out £15,000 a table and parliament in chaos, the event was not at full capacity. Our spy reports a fake partition was installed at venue Battersea Evolution to give the appearance of a sold-out affair. One joke doing the rounds was: “There’s new money over there, old money over there and no deal over there!” Geoffrey Cox, the flamboyant attorney-general, was overheard jokingly telling fellow diners: “The first person to bring up Brexit will be hit.” Happily no physical violence ensued. Both Cox and the Conservative party did not respond when contacted for comment. No relation In a crowded category, Steve Cohen might well be the most reclusive billionaire hedge fund manager. So it’s unsurprising that misinformation surrounds the Point72 founder. A case in point is a popular rumour in New York hedge fund circles that Cohen has hired his daughter-in-law Tiffany Galvin-Cohen to work as his in-house PR. Galvin-Cohen married a Steven Cohen in New York in March 2017 and joined Point72 to work in media relations last October. This has led some to speculate that her husband is one of Cohen’s five children. Fake news, according to the lady herself, who in true hedgie style worked in comms for Goldman Sachs before Point72. “I’m glad that you asked because I’m not related to Steve at all,” Galvin-Cohen tells Capital about her boss. Happy to oblige! Quiet start-up In a development that might have passed you by, a new Financial Times-backed website Sifted has just launched. Sifted, devoted to the European start-up tech scene and young entrepreneurs, is the brainchild of FT innovation editor John Thornhill. The Pink ’Un has taken a 25% stake in Sifted, which is also backed by British, French, German, Greek and Swedish angel investors. While the FT has a licensing agreement with Sifted, the paper declares it is independent from the website. Perhaps too independent. A recent FT news story about economic pressure on start-ups by Aliya Ram and Tim Bradshaw warned: “For investors, the concern is that start-ups founded in the last 10 years will only have experienced a strong economy and could be unprepared for a downturn.” That piece has yet to appear on Sifted. Penn-demonium A copy of the latest quarterly investment review from the Capital Group, the private debt manager where the prime minister’s husband Philip May is relationship manager, landed on this column’s desk. The review rates the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at 20%. James Penn, Capital Group’s investment manager, writes in relation to Brexit and the stock market that “thus far into December, there isn’t much evidence of festive cheer”. He adds: “While it is hazardous to make predictions in the current environment, here’s my pennyworth about what may happen (no pun intended on the prime minister’s name) in the next few months.” Did Penn clear this awkward May moniker talk with the prime minister's husband in advance? Hanging in the air German airline Lufthansa is suing a passenger for saving money by opting not to take the last leg of a flight. However, frequent flyers note the company has previous form of its own in this regard. Eurowings, the Lufthansa-owned low-cost airline, recently delayed a flight from Cologne Bonn airport that a Capital acquaintance was flying on. Passengers based close to the airport were told by Eurowings that they could go home and return in five hours to take the delayed flight. But the airline then changed tack and moved the departure time forward by three hours, meaning some passengers missed the flight.

But while many French companies are not exactly cracking open the Moët & Chandon at the prospect of Brexit, Kepler Cheuvreux raised eyebrows in European finance circles last week by enthusiastically hosting Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, for lunch and then publicly blazing with bonhomie about its new friend. A report on the broker’s LinkedIn page said: “Very interesting presentation by an outstanding speaker to help investors and corporates achieve a better understanding of the next steps of Brexit and the European situation overall… close to 100 partipants [sic] joined the lunch and had the opportunity to debate with Mr Farage.” Diamond was understood not to be among the “partipants” and is known to take a dim view of Farage. However, a source close to him pointed out he’s a stakeholder of Kepler Cheuvreux and doesn’t run the company. The brokerage did not get back to Capital on how much it paid Farage for his “outstanding” oratory. Nothing to declare Anti-Brexit economist Dr Victoria Bateman has raised more than a few eyebrows by being interviewed naked for high-profile outlets to draw attention to the dangers of leaving the European Union. But what does her husband James Bateman, chief investment officer of investment giant Fidelity’s multi-asset investment team, make of his wife’s media campaign? Bateman was travelling in Europe for Fidelity when Capital called for a comment. His father Barry Bateman, a director of Fidelity Investments International and former president of the company, was also unavailable to speak about his daughter-in-law. But given James Bateman once allegedly sent colleagues a nude painting of his wife (which came to light during a sex discrimination lawsuit brought against Fidelity Worldwide Investment), presumably he approves of her Naked Truth approach. On the ball Now to the Conservative party’s Black and White Ball, the Tories’ most extravagant annual fundraiser. Except this year, with donors having to fork out £15,000 a table and parliament in chaos, the event was not at full capacity. Our spy reports a fake partition was installed at venue Battersea Evolution to give the appearance of a sold-out affair. One joke doing the rounds was: “There’s new money over there, old money over there and no deal over there!” Geoffrey Cox, the flamboyant attorney-general, was overheard jokingly telling fellow diners: “The first person to bring up Brexit will be hit.” Happily no physical violence ensued. Both Cox and the Conservative party did not respond when contacted for comment. No relation In a crowded category, Steve Cohen might well be the most reclusive billionaire hedge fund manager. So it’s unsurprising that misinformation surrounds the Point72 founder. A case in point is a popular rumour in New York hedge fund circles that Cohen has hired his daughter-in-law Tiffany Galvin-Cohen to work as his in-house PR. Galvin-Cohen married a Steven Cohen in New York in March 2017 and joined Point72 to work in media relations last October. This has led some to speculate that her husband is one of Cohen’s five children. Fake news, according to the lady herself, who in true hedgie style worked in comms for Goldman Sachs before Point72. “I’m glad that you asked because I’m not related to Steve at all,” Galvin-Cohen tells Capital about her boss. Happy to oblige! Quiet start-up In a development that might have passed you by, a new Financial Times-backed website Sifted has just launched. Sifted, devoted to the European start-up tech scene and young entrepreneurs, is the brainchild of FT innovation editor John Thornhill. The Pink ’Un has taken a 25% stake in Sifted, which is also backed by British, French, German, Greek and Swedish angel investors. While the FT has a licensing agreement with Sifted, the paper declares it is independent from the website. Perhaps too independent. A recent FT news story about economic pressure on start-ups by Aliya Ram and Tim Bradshaw warned: “For investors, the concern is that start-ups founded in the last 10 years will only have experienced a strong economy and could be unprepared for a downturn.” That piece has yet to appear on Sifted. Penn-demonium A copy of the latest quarterly investment review from the Capital Group, the private debt manager where the prime minister’s husband Philip May is relationship manager, landed on this column’s desk. The review rates the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit at 20%. James Penn, Capital Group’s investment manager, writes in relation to Brexit and the stock market that “thus far into December, there isn’t much evidence of festive cheer”. He adds: “While it is hazardous to make predictions in the current environment, here’s my pennyworth about what may happen (no pun intended on the prime minister’s name) in the next few months.” Did Penn clear this awkward May moniker talk with the prime minister’s husband in advance? Hanging in the air German airline Lufthansa is suing a passenger for saving money by opting not to take the last leg of a flight. However, frequent flyers note the company has previous form of its own in this regard. Eurowings, the Lufthansa-owned low-cost airline, recently delayed a flight from Cologne Bonn airport that a Capital acquaintance was flying on. Passengers based close to the airport were told by Eurowings that they could go home and return in five hours to take the delayed flight. But the airline then changed tack and moved the departure time forward by three hours, meaning some passengers missed the flight.

1108635,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"Medical startups are challenged with finding solutions to some of today’s biggest killers. For example, 1 in 3 Americans die every year due to cardiovascular disease alone. However, with advancements being made every year in the healthcare industry, companies are finding more ways to bring these numbers down. In particular, stem cell research and heart medicines are making great strides. This article is going to show a few cardiovascular medicines and stem cell therapy startup companies to watch in 2019. photo/ pixels Codindus Vascular Robotics s a global technology leader in robotic-assisted vascular interventions. The company’s ‘CorPath System’ uses robots to assist in percutaneous coronary interventions and vascular procedures. Corindus’ next-generation CorPath GRX System is advancing the field of robotic interventional cardiology, offering improvements in procedural control for the physician, workflow for the technologist, radiation protection for physicians and the potential to reduce radiation exposure for staff and patients. Codindus Vascular is gaining a lot of attention from leading physicians across the world. Simon Stertzer, a professor at Stanford University and the first doctor to perform coronary angioplasty in the United States, is particularly excited about this company. Prognos is a healthcare startup company leveraging AI to create a large integrated database of multi-sourced clinical diagnostics data. Prognos applies smartest AI to clinical data to drive the right decisions earlier and improve patient health. They use HIPAA-compliant infrastructure to provide an interpretation of clinical diagnostics. The platform uses clinical algorithms across more than 30 conditions to predict the patient’s condition early, identify treatment options indicate any risks associated and show opportunities for clinical trials. The database stores over 16 billion records for over 185 million patients and will only get bigger. Celularity is a biotechnology company that productizes allogeneic cells and tissues derived from the postpartum placenta. These are materials that can help the immune system and amplify the body’s ability to fight disease, heal, and regenerate itself. Celularity acts as a “biorefinery” to harness the power of the placenta to create therapies across autoimmune and degenerative diseases, immuno-oncology, and functional regeneration. They are the first healthcare company to own and deploy the full value chain from sourcing placental stem cells to patient treatment. Celularity also has a wide range of biosourcing options, providing access to more stem cells needed for current treatments. Today’s stem cell transplants are accepted as standard therapy for more than 80 diseases, including common conditions leukaemia but Celularity wants to cure other rare conditions with the use of stem cell therapy. ViaCyte is another healthcare startup company in the field of regenerative medicine. Based in California, ViaCyte is creating innovative products to cure diabetes. They have developed a device called the Encaptra, a cell delivery system, that matures pancreatic beta cell precursors into endocrine cells that secrete insulin and other hormones in a regulated manner to control blood glucose levels. ViaCyte’s goal is to free patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes from long-term insulin dependence. If successful, ViaCyte’s products will relieve patients of both the acute challenges and risks, as well as the long-term complications, associated with diabetes. In fact, in January 2019, they announced that a human stem cell-derived product candidate has been implanted in type 1 diabetes patients. Bay Labs is another great medical startup company. They are using artificial intelligence, with cardiovascular imaging to help in the diagnosis and management of heart disease, the world’s leading cause of death. They aim to use deep learning techniques to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. At NVIDIA’s Inception competition in 2017, Bay Labs was recognized as one of the most promising AI startups in the social impact category. Their vision is to improve worldwide healthcare and build new solutions that can help patients with long-term clinical problems. To achieve this, they are putting together a team of experts, including both IT and medical professionals. Rubius Therapeutics are transforming red blood cells into cellular medicines. They are focused on creating life-changing cellular therapies for patients with rare enzyme deficiencies, cancer and autoimmune diseases. Their medicine is called Red Cell Therapeutics ie RCTs. These are engineered to express biotherapeutic proteins within or on their cell surface to create highly selective, potent and allogeneic cellular medicines aimed at a range of treatments. They may also be used to treat patients with rare enzyme deficiencies, kill cancer tumours and regulate the immune system. K Health is a free, HIPAA-compliant AI healthcare app which collects information about a patient’s medical background. The app uses artificial intelligence to provide insights and tips to manage their conditions and has recently raised another 25 million in funding. Users enter their symptoms into the app which then provides a list of potential diagnoses. While this is incredibly useful, what’s even more important is that based on the information entered by the user, the app suggests a list of specialist physicians that can potentially help treat their condition. Considering 80% of all internet users have searched for health-related topics online, this massive database of healthcare information could help identify conditions early and save millions of lives every year. The final company on this list of best healthcare startups is ReNeuron. They are a leading, clinical-stage stem cell business, aiming to develop novel stem cell therapies targeting areas of significant unmet or poorly met medical needs. Their unique stem cell technologies develop cell-based therapies for significant disease conditions where the cells can be readily administered “off-the-shelf” to eligible patients without needing additional treatments. Their lead stem cell therapeutic candidate targets treating patients left disabled by a stroke. They are also progressing in their pre-clinical development of exosome nanomedicine platform. Exosomes are nanoparticles secreted into the culture media during the expansion of stem cells. They contain a number of biologically active molecules such as proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs) that can regulate gene expression. These molecules may unlock therapeutic benefits across a number of disease areas. ReNeuron works closely with a number of key academic and industrial partners to achieve their goals.

1053951,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Carol Damian on her latest exhibition, the upcoming Havana Biennial & Cuban art right now Dr. Carol Damian is a former professor of art and art history and former director and chief curator at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, Miami. Over the years she has curated numerous exhibitions for museums and galleries—most recently, Carlos Estevez: Entelechy, Works from 1992 to 2018, on view through May 5 at the Tucson Museum of Art. After the exhibition’s recent opening in Tucson, Irina Leyva-Pérez spoke with Damian about the exhibition, about Cuban art and artists in Miami, and the evolving position of Cuban art in the international art world. Congratulations to you and Carlos on the exhibition. How did the show come about? I have been following Carlos’s work for over ten years, since he arrived in Miami. I was so impressed with it, and with the level of intellectualism informing everything he does. We began planning a monograph years ago. And an exhibition, but that takes time. How did the show come to the Tucson Museum of Art? I started planning the show around five years ago. Eventually my proposal found its way to the Freedom Tower, where Jeremy Mikolajczak was the director. When he left to take the position of director at Tucson, he took the show with him—happily for us. Carlos trained and began his career in Havana and has lived in Miami for many years. From your perspective, what’s the current relationship between the Miami and Havana art scenes? What has changed over the past few years? The Havana-Miami art scene has always been dynamic, with artists arriving over the years at different points in their career, and even growing up and going to school in Miami. So Cuban artists have been very dominant in the community. There are so many artists to name. But to limit it to the Miami scene, certainly masters like Cundo Bermúdez, Manuel Carbonell, and Rafael Soriano have made their mark. And now another generation of recognized artists—like José Bedia, Carlos Luna, Demi and Arturo Rodríguez, Gory, María Martínez-Cañas, María Brito, María Lino (to name a few)—are joined by emerging artists like Jorge Ríos, Aurora Molina, Leonor Anthony, and Rafael Domenech. Of course, there are many who have exhibited in Miami and have moved elsewhere—Jorge Wellesley, Douglas Argüelles, and Jairo Alfonso among them. Over the past few years, especially as relations opened up and tourism increased, there has been a remarkable interest in the art on the island. The ability of artists to go back and forth has also enhanced this situation and, in my opinion, added to the success and visibility of the arts. Sandra Ramos, Glexis Novoa, and Carlos Quintana move between both locations, while others exhibit in Miami regularly but live in Havana, including Manuel Fors, José Toirac, Diana Fonseca, and Abel Barroso. There is incredible exchange, respect, and dialogue among the many artists, most of whom find a Miami exhibition to be a feather in their cap. I am always impressed with exhibitions’ opening receptions, where the artists all come to support their colleagues. It never seems to be competitive, but genuinely supportive. The last Havana Biennial in 2015 was well attended by US visitors, and the next one is coming up in April. Will you be there? Yes. I am planning to bring a group, so I’ve been following the Biennial closely. I am most interested in the special projects that accompany the institutional exhibitions. I always think that Juan Delgado’s Malecón project [Detrás del muro] is important, and I’m looking forward to its expansion. I also find it interesting that the Italy-based Galleria Continua is opening a project, El País de Arte, in a new space. That adds to the international dimension. It’s exciting that the Biennial is venturing outside Havana. I’m planning to bring my group to Matanzas to visit María Magdalena Campos-Pons, who is coordinating the project Ríos intermitentes (Intermittent Rivers). That will be a site-specific installation throughout the city of her birth, and will focus on the significant African heritage of the island. The Biennial covers a lot of territory this year, and hopefully we will visit other places as well. There is always so much to pack in! As 2019 begins, how would you describe the position of Cuban art in the contemporary art world? I think every year there is more and more attention to Havana internationally, with international travel surpassing American travel because of the difficulties we face politically. On the art fair circuit, it seems that every year more Cuban artists are represented by galleries, increasing their reputation and accessibility. Since Miami and Miami Beach are home to the majority of Cuban artists and collectors outside the island, Art Basel Miami Beach in particular is an opportunity to see this work within an international market context. As a curator, what interests you most about Cuban art, on the island and abroad? There is a special spirit about Cuban art, and especially the artists. They have this great sense of survival that’s almost like a mission, and I admire that. Their use of materials is always extraordinary, and I find the art unique, without the baggage of art history’s classifications and movements. Cuban art is much broader in concept, with an independence that is very attractive. What’s next for you? What Cuba-related projects are you working on? I am doing a lot of writing—artist catalogues and reviews—and have my own Peruvian projects, including a book, as well. I continue to work closely with the Cuban artists in Miami and will soon begin something that is in the works now. For many years, I have worked closely with women artists, and taught specialized courses in the history of women in art. Teaching at a Miami university has given me the opportunity to include the local community of artists—especially Cuban women with whom I have become very friendly, and whose work I have supported over the years. They enjoy coming to the classes and the students find their life stories fascinating. My next projects will be about the women. One may be more historical, as I learned that there were many important artists in Cuba over the last hundred years who have been neglected. Another will be with a young Cuban woman just beginning a very exciting career. I am also interested in women activist artists. We are busy organizing an exhibition with several Cuban women who work as political, social, and environmental activists, as a continuation of a project I did at Art Miami 2017.

1106452,02/27/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Mea culpa. James Forese, el presidente de Citigroup, el coloso bancario estadounidense con presencia en más de 100 países del mundo, ha reconocido este martes ante el auditorio del Mobile World Congress en Barcelona que el sector bancario aún arrastra un grave problema de credibilidad. “En el conjunto, hemos sufrido un pérdida de confianza a raíz de la crisis financiera”, reconoció el ejecutivo, que alertó sobre la creciente presencia de “intrusos” en las finanzas, en una alusión al boom de sociedades de intermediación financiera (al estilo de los llamados bancos digitales o fintech) que están aprovechando estas debilidades para ganar mercado a las entidades tradicionales. Las entidades tradicionales compiten con las fintech y con su propia imagen Forese recordó que un tercio de la población mundial, unas 1.700 millones de personas, no tienen cuenta corriente bancaria, especialmente en las economías emergentes y que la baja credibilidad de la banca, precisamente, no ayuda a establecer las necesarias relaciones de confianza con estos usuarios potenciales. “Nos hemos dado cuenta de que solos no podemos llegar a estos clientes y por eso establecemos acuerdos con socios locales”, dijo Forese, En este ámbito, la tecnología es fundamental. Citigroup ha establecido acuerdos con operadores de telecomunicaciones en México (América Movil) y sistemas de pagos en África (ImpalaPay en Kenia) para que las personas puedan operar mediante el teléfono móvil, considerada como la herramienta clave para lograr una mayor bancarización. En el país africano han conseguido, por ejemplo, que 250.000 campesinos consigan llevar a cabo millones de micropagos. La gente tiene que entender que somos una parte responsable de la sociedad” Aún así, Forese reconoció que “nos tenemos que ganar la confianza”, de allí que la entidad busque también el respaldo también de instituciones, gobiernos y administraciones a la hora de implementar y ofrecer sus servicios. “La gente tiene que entender que somos una parte responsable de la sociedad”, aseguró el ejecutivo. En el 2010 Citigroup llegó a un acuerdo con la autoridad bursátil estadounidense para pagar una multa de casi 60 millones de euros “por engañar a los inversores sobre la exposición de la entidad a los activos relacionados con las hipotecas subprime”, que dieron lugar a la crisis financiera en el 2008. Este verano la Reserva Federal le impuso otra sanción de 7,5 millones de euros por irregularidades en la concesión de servicios relacionados con las hipotecas en EE.UU. © La Vanguardia Ediciones Todos los derechos reservados

(Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post) The Colorado high school wrestling state tournaments take place Thursday, Feb. 21 through Saturday, Feb. 23 at the Pepsi Center in Denver. Our staff will be there throughout the weekend providing live coverage. Refresh this page for the latest updates and results. In addition, real-time Tweets from reporters around the state are at the bottom of this page. Note: Day 3 live coverage will begin late Saturday afternoon. We will link to that story once it’s live. (9:32 p.m.) Team scores heading into Saturday. In Class 5A, Pomona has 124.5 points while Ponderosa is second with 84.5, while Pueblo East (168) is outdistancing Pueblo County (134) and Windsor (130) in 4A. In the lower classifications, Alamosa (103.5) has the edge over Eaton (89) while Wray is dominating the 3A bracket with 126 points, far better than second-place Centauri (85). (9:10 p.m.) Four-peat history. Three wreslters advanced to the finals with a chance to earn a fourth-consecutive state title: Brendon Garica (Pueblo County), Andrew Alirez (Greeley Central) and Cohlton Schultz (Ponderosa). Never before has the state tournament crowned three four-time state champions in the same year. (8:14 p.m.) Robison’s four-peat falls short. In perhaps the biggest upset of the weekend, Regis Jesuit sophomore Antonio Segura took down three-time champion Theorius Robison of Pomona in the Class 5A 145 semifinals. Segura (35-8) needed extra time to knock off the Northern Colorado commit, pinning him 1:27 into the period to set up a finals showdown against Legacy’s Joey Joiner (35-12). (7:52 p.m.) Pomona, Ponderosa to clash for titles. The perennial Class 5A heavyweights will have wrestlers meet in two different weight classes in the title matches as the Panthers are running away with the team crown and the Mustangs seem like a sure bet for second place. Pomona freshman Daniel Cardenas (33-7) faces Ponderosa sophomore Jaron Mahler (37-8) for the 120 title Saturday after Mahler upset a defending champion, Grand Junction’s Dawson Collins, with a sudden victory in the semifinals. And at 126, Pomona junior Wyatt Yapoujian (24-4) takes on Ponderosa senior Mosha Schwartz (42-6) in a showdown everyone saw coming. (7:36 p.m.) Semifinals underway. With a strong crowd on hand, Monarch sophomore Vince Cornella was among the lightweights who made an early statement on Friday night. The 2018 champion at 106 cruised to a second-round pin of Pomona freshman Jacob Judd in the Class 5A 113 bracket to advance to Saturday’s finals, where he will take on Denver East sophomore Armando Garcia. Garcia beat Douglas County’s Max Black 3-0 to set up the title showdown. (6:29 p.m.) Unified wrestling sets stage. Outside the Pepsi Center, temperatures are dropping and snow’s starting to come down. Inside, Unified wrestling’s getting the fans warmed up, the crowd is filling in and a nervous buzz is permeating the arena with the semifinal matches for all classes set to begin in about 15 minutes. This is often the point in the bracket where the competition comes to a head — there are few, if any, blowouts and each grappler is going to scrap with everything he has for a chance to wrestle in Saturday’s finals. (5:59 p.m.) Girl power! Welcome to history, folks: For the first time in the state tourney, multiple female wrestlers are still alive in the bracket on Saturday, and they’re both in Class 3A and both repping the same weight class (106). Valley’s Angel Rios defeated Casteus Combs of Sterling, 9-0, in the second round of consolations on Friday, while Skyview’s Jaslynn Gallegos topped Alex Castaneda of Eaton, 9-5. Rios earlier this month became the first female wrestler in state history to win a regional and has drawn Brendan Johnston from The Classical Academy out of Colorado Springs in the placing round. Johnston has drawn Rios three times recently and declined to wrestle her — taking a forfeit — all three times for personal reasons. Johnston defeated Elijah Kitchens of Estes Park, 19-7. (3:23 p.m.) The consolation bracket matters. With the first round of consolation matches for all classes in the books, it’s important to keep in mind how critical the consolation side of the bracket can be when it comes to determining the team champions. Though Wray (2A), Pueblo East (4A) and Pomona (5A) are each running away from the field in their respective classes, there’s still some intrigue in the Class 3A race heading into this evening’s second round of consolation matches and semifinals. Alamosa is in the lead, but Lamar (13 qualifiers) and Eaton (10) are still in the picture if they can put up points by as many individuals as possible. (2:19 p.m.) Undefeated guys still alive. Pueblo East’s Andy Garcia extended his record to 23-0 with a pin in the Class 4A 285 quarterfinals, and his performance was preceded by other undefeated big-school wrestlers also extending their perfect seasons. Windsor’s Dominick Serrano (40-0 at 4A 132), Greeley Central’s Andrew Alirez (31-0 at 4A 152), Pueblo County’s Christopher Fasano (40-0 at 4A 160), Windsor’s Isaiah Salazar (41-0 at 4A 182), Pueblo East’s Zion Freeman (36-0 at 4A 195), Grand Junction’s Hunter Tobiasson (40-0 at 5A 220) and Ponderosa’s Cohl Schultz (44-0 at 5A 285) all advanced, too. (1:08 p.m.) Dawson Collins rolls into semifinals. The Grand Junction senior who won the 113 title last season continued his march for a repeat. After inducing a tech fall in Thursday’s preliminary round, Collins — a linchpin of the Tigers’ Class 5A title team last season — pinned Monarch sophomore Ryan Kuykendall in the third period of his 120 quarterfinal match. (12:21 p.m.) Pueblo East primed to increase lead. The Eagles put up 42 points to pace Class 4A after Day 1 as coach Pat Laughlin saw 11 of his 12 qualifiers advance. Junior heavyweight Andy Garcia headlines, as he’s aiming for a third state title and has been buoyed by extensive offseason wrestling, including a trip to Croatia. Meanwhile, senior Jace Trujillo (state champion as a freshman, two-time placer) is a force at 132, junior Aaden Valdez is hungry at 138 after his runner-up finish in 2018, and CSU-Pueblo commits Zion Freeman (undefeated at 195), Ryan Roth (126) and Dominic Robles (220) all have title potential as well. (11:45 a.m.) Rios moves on in consolation, Bauer remains perfect. Valley’s Angel Rios (3A 106), the other girl competitor left in the tournament, defeated Sheridan’s James Cordova in consolations to say alive. County Line’s Jayce Bauer (2A 220) extended his undefeated record to 40-0 and advanced to the semifinals with a pin in 3:39 over Fleming’s Andrew Davis. (10:00 a.m.) State champ advances, girl wrestler falls. The weight classes are getting bigger and the excitement is picking up as semifinalists are crowned and comeback efforts begin. No surprise here, but John Wall’s Wesley VanMatre (No. 1 in 2A 138) rolled to a 11-5 victory over Traycer Hall from Hotchkiss. VanMatre is a junior seeking his third-straight title. Skyview senior Jaslynn Gallegos (3A 106), one of two girls left in the state tournament, fell in the quarterfinals to Alamosa’s Davion Chavez by a 9-1 major decision. (8:52 a.m.) Quarterfinal round underway. A frigid chill hangs outside the Pepsi Center this morning, but the heat is on inside as 3A and 2A high school wrestlers from Colorado have completed their warmups for the state championship quarterfinals. A steady flow of fans are filing in their seats. Pockets of noise are exploding from different parts of the arena. It’s go-time.
