By Christopher Thompson and Aimee Donnellan (The opinions expressed are their own.) LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Heard the one about the City grandee atop a British bank run by a Wall Street investment banker? Barclays investors certainly have. They will remember that when UK corporate financier Marcus Agius had a double act with hard-charging Chief Executive Bob Diamond it ended in vaudeville, with both eventually resigning over the Libor scandal. Appointing Rothschild & Co'sNigel Higgins to oversee Chief Executive Jes Staley should end less disastrously. In that light, the appointment looks like a defence of the status quo and, specifically, Staley's investment bank bolstering as European rivals Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse struggle. By contrast, outgoing chair John McFarlane, according to author Philip Augar, repeatedly clashed with former CEO Antony Jenkins over cuts to Barclays sizeable trading operations in particular. Higgins has three things to bear in mind. One is to avoid hubris: when McFarlane joined he predicted a doubling of the share price in three years, when it actually fell by a third. Another is the need to identify a replacement for Staley. Having led a bruising restructuring since joining in late 2015 and fallen foul of whistleblowing rules, it would make sense for the CEO to step down next year or 2020, ideally when Barclays has achieved its 10 percent return on tangible equity target, in line with its cost of capital. The final issue is Barclays shares' persistent discount to book, currently 30 percent. If returns falter, the age-old question about the utility of having a large investment bank will resurface - as will the appeal of activist investor Edward Bramson. If other shareholders suddenly become receptive to his pleas to cull the rainmakers and traders, Higgins will need to use his relationship skills to explain why Barclays' current structure is fit for purpose. On Twitter Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Barclays said on Nov. 1 that Nigel Higgins, the deputy chairman of Rothschild & Co, would succeed John McFarlane as chairman on May 2, 2019 when he retires after serving his four-year term. - Higgins will join Barclays' board as a non-executive director on March 1, 2019 and take over as chairman in May after the annual shareholder meeting, the bank said in a statement. - ""In Nigel Higgins we have found an ideal candidate. He is a hugely respected banker, a strategic thinker, someone with extensive international experience, and he has a strong positive leadership style,"" said Crawford Gillies, who led the process to appoint a successor to McFarlane. - Barclays, one of Britain's biggest banks, has been subject to radical transformation in recent years. - Since taking over as CEO in December 2015, Jes Staley has pushed an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson. - Bramson's Sherborne Investors holds a 5.4 percent stake in the bank and was in talks with Barclays earlier this year about replacing McFarlane as part of an overhaul, according to a news report by Reuters. - Barclays shares rose 1.4 percent to 178 pence as of 0931 GMT on Nov. 2.

Plans are announced for a new building to provide continued care for those with the development disorder. With an oversized tent and golf cart shuttles to the rescue, downpours didn’t stop the Signs of Hope lawn party Aug. 1 at the Falmouth Foreside home of Sheri and Joe Boulos, longtime supporters of Maine Behavioral Healthcare and Spring Harbor Hospital. “The goal this year is to open your hearts and minds to those who, for no fault of their own, have brains that work differently,” said Sheri Boulos, a member of the development committee. Signs of Hope fundraising was crucial in establishing the organization’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders four years ago, led by autism spectrum disorders expert Dr. Matt Siegel and serving individuals through age 21. The grand announcement at this year’s event was that long-term plans include a major expansion to continue care through adulthood in a new building that will be named after Dr. Girard Robinson. “This is a really important personal honor,” said Robinson, adding that it had been a major challenge in his career to expand access to behavioral healthcare. Over the past 40 years, Robinson has worked as chief medical officer at Spring Harbor Hospital, senior vice president for medical and clinical affairs at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Though retired from those roles, he is serving as interim director of substance use disorders at Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “Dr. Robinson was instrumental in bringing our developmental disorders program to Maine, and we have one of the strongest developmental disorders treatment centers in the country,” said Maine Behavioral Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Steve Merz. “But we want to meet the needs of the children who are now adults, so they don’t have to go away for the services they need.” “Tonight is the first step of raising funds for a major expansion to serve adults as well,” Siegel said. With 150 guests, the majority of whom were host committee members, Signs of Hope raised more than $95,000. “This is crucial to our success, helping us to expand services to a population that is underserved, both locally and nationally,” said Linda Durst, chief medical officer for Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Attendees included parents of young adults with autism who used to have to travel to Boston for care, then were able to access services locally when the center was established – until their children aged out. “We still need to do more for adults once they’ve aged out of high school and have graduated,” said Irene Kapothanasis, whose son Gregory is 25. “They’ve done a marvelous job with pre-K through high school. Now, we need to take the next step.” “Maine Behavioral Health has have done a tremendous job of meeting the needs of children and adolescents, but the specialized needs of this population do not vanish after the age of 21,” said Wendi O’Donovan, whose son Ryan is 22. “In fact, as these children or adolescents become adults, their ability to injure themselves or others grows exponentially.” “We need a whole continuum of care,” said Mary Jane Krebs, president of Spring Harbor Hospital and senior vice president for Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “We’re hoping in the next couple of years to have this larger center. It’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen. It’s really needed.” Amy Paradysz is a freelance writer and photographer based in Scarborough.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:20 EST, 18 August 2018 | Updated: 08:48 EST, 19 August 2018 14 View comments Bob Diamond, the former Barclays chief once dubbed the ‘unacceptable face of banking’, has come under attack from investor groups ahead of his new bank’s annual meeting. Two influential shareholder adviser groups have raised red flags over corporate governance issues at London-listed Atlas Mara, a bank Diamond set up to focus on Africa. Glass Lewis has recommended that investors should vote against Diamond’s election as chairman because as a co-founder of the firm he is not considered independent. Under fire: Atlas Mara chief Bob Diamond Fellow adviser group ISS has raised similar concerns and recommends that investors abstain from the vote on August 29. The organisations are urging shareholders to vote against three non-executive directors including Michael Wilkerson, chief executive of Atlas Mara’s largest shareholder Fairfax Africa, arguing that he is not independent. The other two directors are former Bank of Ireland chief executive Richie Boucher and Hisham Ezz Al-Arab, chairman and managing director of the Commercial International Bank of Egypt. Both groups also oppose a motion that would allow Atlas Mara to sell 15 per cent of its shares without first offering them to existing investors. Diamond, who resigned from Barclays at the height of the Libor-rigging scandal in July 2012, founded Atlas Mara in 2013 and has been chairman since October 2016. Atlas Mara’s shares have fallen 80 per cent in five years. In 2010, the then Business Secretary Lord Mandelson criticised Diamond’s rewards at Barclays and described him as the ‘unacceptable face of banking’. Atlas Mara said it takes governance ‘very seriously’, adding that Diamond’s ‘continued leadership at the board is important to delivering on our business plan and performance objectives’.

Recognizing whether CEO incentives are aligned with shareholders is a crucial part of investing. Incentives can be in the form of compensation, which should always be structured in a way that promotes value-creation to shareholders. Today we will assess McVey’s pay and compare this to the company’s performance over the same period, as well as measure it against other US CEOs leading companies of similar size and profitability. Check out our latest analysis for MarketAxess Holdings My analysis shows that McVey may be paid above the appropriate level, based on the size of MKTX and its recent year’s earnings performance. The question to answer now is whether this level of pay is justified. There are most likely other factors I have not account for, but in any case, this outcome should provide a basis for you as shareholders, to question the board’s decision to increase CEO pay in the future. If you have not done so already, I highly recommend you to complete your research by taking a look at the following: To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"At the launch of The Bank that Lived a little: Barclays in the age of the very free market*, Philip Augar, the author, said while this book is about Barclays it is also about the City. Barclays may have got closer than all the others in seeking to be a global bank in the era after Big Bang in 1986, but in essence all the others wanted that too. It was just that they weren’t any good at it and lost fortunes trying to make it work. So you know who you are Barclays did at least live a little. And Augar’s book makes a gripping read, partly by marshalling the facts, but more by interviewing the people who worked there or thereabouts. Understandably many preferred to remain anonymous but without them he could not have told the story. It helped too that he had worked in the City. The launch also featured Bob Diamond, for a long time the CEO of Barclays Capital, and then the chief executive of the whole group, who left amid the Libor scandal. It was as well he was there — it would have been like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark otherwise — but it was also rather odd. Clearly Augar had interviewed him several times, clearly Diamond did not get it all his own way, but they were surprisingly friendly. Perhaps Diamond has mellowed. Perhaps Augar does not like confrontation. Nevertheless he made some good points. He talked about Diamond’s stare, and how no one wanted to be in the room when it happened. Diamond, for his part, thought no CEO likes bad news. He was building the bank and there was no room for passengers. That actually was the crux of it. Diamond says Barclays had great strengths in its brand and credit rating. On top of that he imposed risk management and financing, which became the bank’s competitive strengths at a time when the euro was making European capital markets viable and companies were beginning to embrace bond finance. He also is a hard-driving American, and Barclays was among the best of the bonus payers, albeit only once he had got rid of the majority of Barclays Capital, who he says did not know what they were doing. Augar also says Barclays today is financially sound. So where did it go wrong? Risk management meant more leverage — much more — and that alarmed regulators. But it was only part of it. The financial crisis got all regulators belatedly on their mettle, but Barclays took no money from government and therefore saw no reason to stop doing what it was doing. Indeed because other banks were disabled it was even more gung-ho. When the regulators made it plain that Barclays Capital had to slow down, the bank took no notice. When the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, handed a letter of concern to the chairman of Barclays, Marcus Agius, the latter again took no notice. It was only when the Bank of England intervened that Diamond realised he had to go. The regulators had all had enough. It has to be said that the non-executives were also poor when they could have made a difference. They were in principle big-hitters but in fact in thrall to Diamond. They did not seem to think Barclays had to toe the line and in spite of the crisis they seemed not to have made any connection with the real world either. But perhaps it was ever thus. Martin Taylor (the earlier ceo who gets a good press in the book) rapidly became disillusioned with his earlier generation of non-executives and decided to quit. Diamond says he was a lightning rod for all the banks so he had to resign; he was the last one standing from the class of 2007 financial crisis, but he took it badly to start with. Augar for his part, thinks the Libor scandal, which was not of Diamond’s making, should not have forced him out. But is that really so? John Varley, the chief executive during the financial crisis, is facing fraud charges along with three others over the raising of share capital from Qatar. This was when the bank was determined to avoid government finance and was looking to raise it from elsewhere. Augar naturally cannot discuss this because it is sub judice, but it is unfinished business. And of course there are other scandals with Libor and the foreign exchange market showing how wrong the culture was. And there are billions of pounds of compensation for PPI, the mis-selling of mortgage protection insurance. But the one which rankles to most observers is how business customers were sold interest rate risk hedging products which only protected them from rates going up. When they in fact went down, the customers were left with huge losses and many lost their businesses as a result. It was a Barclays Capital product, and it made the bank a lot of money, although it has since paid out significant sums in compensation. Barclays has betrayed these customers and nothing will get them back. Did Diamond know; did he care, was it collateral damage or was it devil take the hindmost? Augar’s book is good but only those in the City will like it. The rest of the country has a different take on bankers and the way in which relationships went down the tubes while the bank jacked up profits. Barclays may indeed have lived a little, but is a scandal that so many others had to pay the price.

1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"– First half of 2018 marked by management’s successful execution of corporate, clinical and regulatory strategies – – Topline results from Phase 2a study evaluating CC-31244 for ultra-short treatment of HCV expected in Q4 2018 – ATLANTA, GA and BOTHELL, WA, Aug. 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: COCP), (“Cocrystal” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing novel antiviral therapeutics that target the replication machinery of hepatitis viruses, influenza viruses and noroviruses, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and provided a corporate update. Recent Corporate Highlights: Dr. Gary Wilcox, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cocrystal, commented, “We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of the first half of the year. Moving forward, our focus for the second half of this year is delivering on the milestones we have set for our clinical programs. We continue to make progress advancing our Phase 2a study of CC-31244 for the ultra-short treatment of HepC and expect to complete patient enrollment this quarter. Importantly, we look forward to announcing topline results from the CC-31244 Phase 2a study in the fourth quarter of this year and believe the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy data will be integral in guiding our next phase of development for our HepC program.” Clinical Programs Overview Pan-Genotypic Non-Nucleoside Inhibitor for the Ultra-short Treatment of Hepatitis C CC-31244, the Company’s lead product in development for HepC, is an investigational, oral, potent, broad-spectrum replication inhibitor called a non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI). It has a high barrier to drug resistance designed and developed using the Company's proprietary structure-based drug discovery technology. It is active against HepC genotypes 1-6 with low level cytotoxicity in multiple cell types. CC-31244 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical study for the ultra-short treatment of HepC-infected individuals. The Phase 2a open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CC-31244 with Epclusa®. Enrolled subjects will self-administer orally 400 mg of CC-31244 and a fixed dose of Epclusa for 14 days. After 14 days the subjects will continue the treatment for another 4 weeks on Epclusa alone. Subjects will be followed up until 24 weeks after the last dose of Epclusa to determine if they have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are SVR at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) and at 24 weeks post-treatment (SVR24), respectively. Expected Near-Term CC-31244 Clinical Program Milestones: Influenza A and Influenza A/B Inhibitors In addition to the Company’s HepC clinical program, Cocrystal is developing novel, broad spectrum influenza antivirals that are specifically designed to be effective against all important A strains of the influenza virus and to have a high barrier to resistance due to the way they target the virus. Cocrystal’s uniquely developed molecules target the influenza polymerase, an essential replication enzyme with several highly conserved regions common to all influenza strains, including pandemic strains. CC-42344, the Company’s lead molecule, binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 has shown excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu® resistant strains, and shows a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. CC-42344 is currently being evaluated in preclinical IND-enabling studies for the treatment of influenza. Further, the Company has identified molecules which have activity against both strain A and Strain B. Several of these have potencies approaching single digit nanomolar. Cocrystal is comparing them with its influenza A inhibitor, CC-42344 and will determine which program(s) to take forward based on data obtained in Q3 and Q4 2018. The Company is considering both oral and inhaled routes of delivery. Expected Near-Term CC-42344 Clinical Program Milestones: Summary of Financial Results for Q2 2018 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $1,343,000 and $2,897,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $1,002,000 and $3,551,000 for the same periods in 2017. Total research and development expenses were approximately $1,119,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with $1,255,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $136,000, or 11%, was due to the reduction in the timing of clinical trials costs. Total research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $1,997,000, compared with $3,325,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $1,328,000 or 40%, was the result of timing of clinical trials activity. On May 3, 2018, Cocrystal announced the closing of an underwritten public offering. The gross proceeds to Cocrystal from this offering were approximately $8.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. On May 14, 2018, the underwriter exercised the option to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover overallotments for additional gross proceeds of $439,000. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, cash provided by financing activities totaled $8,869,000. Our 2018 financing activities included $7,684,000 net proceeds from the sale of common stock, $1,000,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $185,000 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to approximately $3,000,000 in proceeds from our sale of common stock. About Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.
