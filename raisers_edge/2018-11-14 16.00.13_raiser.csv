Sep 20, 2018 @ 1:03 pm By Bruce Kelly It's time for Dr. Phillip Frost to resign as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., the home of 4,300 retail brokers and financial advisers. The risk to Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation, as well as to the four independent broker-dealers it controls, is simply too great for Dr. Frost to continue his association with the brokerage. All brokerage firms are required to have a minimum level of liquid assets, or net capital, to remain in business and meet their financial obligations. A broker-dealer's reputation is almost an intangible sort of net capital; if it is less than sterling, the reputational capital can drain out of the firm, sometimes overnight. Clients get nervous or complain, and advisers start looking around to jump to a new broker-dealer. That's why Dr. Frost, who owns close to 36% of the company's stock, must go. Dr. Frost, who has a medical degree, is an octogenerian whose past investments have mostly been in the pharmaceutical arena. On September 7, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Dr. Frost and nine other individuals for allegedly participating in ""long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock."" The SEC's complaint illustrates in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off the ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges. Dr. Frost's involvement in the alleged scheme poses tremendous risk to Ladenburg's reputation and brand. The market clearly believes that there is new risk associated with Ladenburg Thalmann. The company's stock price has cratered since September 7, the day the SEC released its complaint. It opened that day at $3.43 per share before falling 15% for the day. And the share price has worsened. On Wednesday afternoon, shares were trading at $2.35, down 31.5% since the SEC's complaint. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network Inc. ""The controversy is likely to lead to further fundamental deterioration; financial firms are sensitive to reputational risks,"" according to a post published Tuesday on Seeking Alpha, whose author, Hindenburg Investment Research, is a short seller of Ladenburg Thalmann shares. That means that aptly titled Hindenburg is betting the price of those shares will go down. ""Plus, the worst may not be over; signs point toward possible criminal charges."" ""We think Phil Frost should resign to avoid more reputational damage to the firm,"" according to the article. ""As the investigation and enforcement process continues forward, it is almost assured to create more negative headlines and spook clients."" The Seeking Alpha post also details the amount of leverage on Ladenburg Thalmann's balance sheet and the drag that could present for shareholders. Hindenburg Investment Research is led by Nate Anderson, who describes himself as performing hedge fund due diligence and marketing in his profile on Twitter. Other analysts, including those on Seeking Alpha, have had kinder outlooks on Ladenburg Thalmann in the wake of the SEC's allegations about Dr. Frost. ""If you are convinced that the issues with [Dr. Frost] are not life threatening, (and I do not believe they are), then the baby bonds are definitely worth a look,"" wrote a firm called Rubicon Associates in another Seeking Alpha post. ""Of these, I favor the Ladenburg Thalmann 7.25% notes due 9/30/2028."" Others were also sanguine about Ladenburg's future. ""It is important to note for Ladenburg shareholders that Dr. Frost serves as a non-executive member of the board of directors and does not hold any operational executive position at the company and that, as noted in previously published reports, Ladenburg's business is robust and its financial position is strong, with $390 million in book value and nearly $250 million in cash,"" wrote Alexander Paris, an analyst with Barrington Research, an investment bank that has done business with Ladenburg Thalmann in the past year. ""This opinion piece was published by investors disseminating misleading information to push their own agenda, and we categorically reject its wrongheaded conclusions with respect to Ladenburg's financial strength and stability,"" wrote Ladenburg CEO Richard Lampen in a message to InvestmentNews. ""Ladenburg continues to be one of the most well-capitalized and well-resourced firms in the independent financial services industry."" A spokesman for Dr. Frost, Jamie Tully, did not respond to questions about the future of Dr. Frost at Ladenburg. But in a statement, Dr. Frost wrote: ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives. I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name."" Was the Seeking Alpha post by Hindenburg an example of a short seller trying to take advantage of negative news about a company? It could very well be. What is clear is that Ladenburg Thalmann's reputation must be protected, for the benefit of its advisers and their clients. That means Dr. Frost should leave the company as soon as possible.

1053951,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Phillip Frost is a Miami billionaire and one of 10 people the SEC charged with fraud on September 7th. He is accused of being a part of when the SEC calls a series of ""classic pump and dump schemes"" that generated more than $27 million. Frost is the founder of the pharmaceutical company OPKO Health. The SEC alleges that Frost and nine other investors manipulated the stock prices of three companies for their own gain. Basically, the 10 investors allegedly promoted the companies without admitting that they owned a stake. Then they waited for the stock prices to rise and sold their shares. This meant that the so called retail investors were left holding stock that was nearly worthless. The group is accused of ""brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,"" said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP/Getty Images Both Frost and OPKO Heath are named in the suit. The SEC believes that Frost allegedly participated in two of the three pump and dump schemes that earned him about $1.1 million. Frost has a net worth of $3.7 billion. In a statement, OPKO Health said that the SEC did not notify them of their plan to file a lawsuit and said the complaint was riddled with ""serious factual inaccuracies."" The company said that if the SEC had followed its own standard procedures, Frost and OPKO would have happily provided documentation that answered a number of the SEC's questions and cleared Frost and OPKO of the charges. The pump and dump scheme was reportedly spearheaded by South Florida businessman Barry Honig. He is one of the biggest shareholders in the cryptocurrency company Riot Blockchain Inc. The virtual currency company's stock took a nosedive of 24.3% after the news of the fraud charges broke. Riot Blockchain was subpoenaed in April as part of a formal SEC investigation. Honig is believed to be the primary ringleader who asked the other defendants in the case to buy or sell stock, engage in promoting the companies, among other things. Honig allegedly made more than $3.4 million while running the pump and dump scheme. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved"

One of these patents is already the subject of an inter partes review by the Patent Trial and Review Board of the USPTO to determine the patent's validity, and both are the subject of existing litigation against ChromaDex charging it with misuse of its intellectual property. ""While we would not normally issue a statement, and instead prefer to let these matters play out in court, ChromaDex's actions have made it necessary to do so,"" said Elysium Health CEO Eric Marcotulli. ""We have built our growth strategy around scientific research and product development, while ChromaDex has built its around litigation and misrepresentation, which are not new tactics for their leadership."" The press releases issued by Elysium Health in 2018 included announcements that the company had been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA for its experimental therapeutic EH301 for the potential treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), was recognized by the Good Housekeeping Institute for innovation, and had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Mayo Clinic and Harvard University to use nicotinamide riboside for dietary supplement applications in the slowing of aging and age-related diseases. During the same period, ChromaDex announced that it had abandoned direct involvement in development of a nicotinamide riboside-based treatment for children afflicted with Cockayne Syndrome so that it could focus on its TruNiagen dietary supplement sales strategy, coopted the results of studies carried out by independent research institutions to promote TruNiagen, and frequently sought to publicize its dispute with Elysium Health and the ongoing litigations, including in direct advertising for TruNiagen. ChromaDex has thus far remained silent on the alleged involvement of several of its major investors and the former co-chairs of its board of directors in a fraudulent ""pump and dump"" scheme detailed in a civil complaint filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 7, 2018, and described in an SEC press release entitled ""SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes."" Among those named as defendants, Phillip Frost and Michael Brauser are and historically have been among the largest holders of ChromaDex stock, and Barry Honig was, along with Brauser, co-chair of ChromaDex's board of directors until March 2015 when they abruptly resigned. Current ChromaDex board member Steve Rubin is also an executive and board member of OPKO Health, which invested in ChromaDex in 2012, of which Frost and his affiliates are significant shareholders, and is also named as a defendant in the SEC's lawsuit. ""It is not surprising that the SEC is investigating the alleged unscrupulous conduct of these ChromaDex-affiliated individuals, who have previously represented to us their continuing control over the company,"" said Marcotulli. ""We have reason to believe that ChromaDex's efforts to undermine Elysium Health, including through these baseless lawsuits, is connected to these individuals and their current associates at the company. In deference to the judicial system, we have declined to comment publicly for the last two years and we do not intend to make a habit of commenting on ongoing litigation."" Elysium Health takes intellectual property rights very seriously and respects the intellectual property rights of others. Elysium Health is confident that it does not infringe any valid claim of the patents described in ChromaDex's most recent baseless lawsuit and trusts that the court will arrive at the same conclusion.

1053951,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Menu Source: Shutterstock Now that the biotechnology sector is well on its way to bouncing back after bottoming in May 2018, investors may feel like they missed out. The fears that previously plagued biotech stocks are no longer as big a threat. The government is no longer putting companies hiking drug price in their cross-hairs, at least not for now. This favorable environment should help biotech firms carry out their plans for the rest of the year. So, if you’re interested in getting into biotech stocks, where should you begin? Well, here is a list of seven great options to get you started. OPKO Health (NASDAQ:OPK) fell by over 20% in the last month after the SEC suspended trading in the stock on Sep. 11. The regulator asked the company to provide information related to the securities lawsuit against OPKO’s Chairman and CEO, Phillip Frost. On Sept. 7, the SEC charged the CEO and others with a stock promotion scheme. Despite this distraction for the company, the value of the business could improve if RAYALDEE, which treats patients suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism, is a commercial success. The FDA approved the drug, which works by raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D and lowers parathyroid hormone levels in patients with chronic kidney disease. In the second quarter, prescriptions for the drug rose 36% from Q1. OPKO expanded its sales team to 64 representatives, a move that helped drive that growth. The drug is now available to 83% of the overall insured population. Adoption, reimbursement and growing awareness of the drug through the marketing efforts from the sales team will drive sales higher. Operationally, improving collection yield and cutting the accounts receivable balances and DSO will eventually help the bottom line. Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) lost half its value in 2018. The downtrend started when Roche and Exelixis ended Roche’s Phase 2 MODUL study. This included Exelixis’ COTELLIC (cobimetinib) for patients suffering from CRC or metastatic colorectal cancer. The negative developments will hurt future earnings, which is why the stock continued to fall with no “bottom” in sight. In its second-quarter report, released on Aug. 1, the company reported earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue of $186.1 million, up 88%. Both numbers beat consensus estimates and yet the stock continued falling. EXEL is looking to complement its cabozantinib development activities. Still, management sees healthy growth for this business, even after factoring increased competition. It is developing potential new indications for cabozantinib, be it single agent or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is seeking collaborations with early stage biotech this year and beyond, keeping its financial risks low. Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN), whose shares rallied to $6.99 recently only to pull back, made only $210,000 in revenue in its second quarter. This biotech’s potential lies in its imetelstat drug, which is being tested in two randomized clinical trials. The drug is a potential treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer and also a “maintenance treatment following a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen in patients with NSCLC.” On Sept. 13, GERN stock fell in the double-digits and gave up over 20% gains intraday after markets worried over Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) continuing with imetelstat. In its presentation, JNJ appeared more likely to continue, since it mentioned the Myelofibrosis-treating drug as a 2019-2021 potential filing (slide 15). The irrational drop in GERN stock in so short a time may have created an entry point. When JNJ added imetelstat on its compassionate use list and, together with Geron, spent four years planning for its use, chances are good JNJ remains committed to the project. Amicus Therapeutics (NASDAQ:FOLD) is not having a good year, after falling by a third from its yearly high. The company won the FDA’s approval for Galafold (migalastat), a drug that treats adult patients with Fabry disease, an inherited disorder. The approval, posted on Aug. 10, sent the stock lower in what could have been a “sell on the news” event. Markets may have shifted their concerns over the launch risks. But Amicus already hired and trained a full launch team. With over 3,000 diagnosed with the disease in the U.S. and Japan and a peak worldwide TAPP (Total Amenable Patient Population) of 4,200–6,000, FOLD stock could recover as revenue from drug sales grows steadily in the years ahead. Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR) recovered from its lows in July, topped around $70 by the start of the month, only to close recently at $58.33. Last month, the company reported revenue of $1.09 million, up sharply from $34.59 million last year. EPS totaled $5.33. These solid numbers should have sent the stock higher but markets may have expected more or, once again, sold on the news. Nektar has an excellent future ahead. Its pipeline of I-O candidates beyond NKTR-214 includes NKTR-262, which studies TLR-78 agonist. Nektar — 255 looks at an IL-15 candidate that stimulates both NK-cells and memory T-cells. At the end of 2019, Nektar will report the first data for NKTR-214. This study will enroll patients who have relapsed to at least two prior lines of therapy but have no more than three prior treatments. That is just one of the studies I mention. Nektar is embarking on the initiation of 20 registrational trials with NKTR-214 and will initiate trials for other targeted therapies and I-O therapies. The company is a strong believer of the molecule as a central therapy in immune-oncology. Wall Street analysts are bullish on NKTR stock. From the four analysts (tracked on Tipranks.com) offering a price target, the average is $92 a share, which would give investors 58% in upside. Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG) did not fall big like the other picks but is still stuck in a range and is down 16% year-to-date. Valuations are very compelling as shares trade at a 24 times earnings and 8 times forward earnings. Much of Celgene’s deep future value depends on management accelerating its next innovation cycle. Ozanimod and fedratinib regulatory submissions are on track, so expect at least two blockbusters adding to Celgene’s revenues. The company reported two positive Phase III trials — MEDALIST in MDS and BELIEVE in beta-thalassemia. If approved, patients suffering from chronic anemia have a treatment option. In the second quarter, Celgene reported a 17% year-on-year growth in net product sales. Earnings rose 16% in that period. Management raised its revenue forecast to $15 billion, up from $14.8 billion. It now expects net sales of REVLIMID, a drug treating multiple myeloma, to top $9.7 billion, up from a previous guidance of $9.5 billion. Investors seeking a slow, steady biotech stock should consider Celgene. The round trip from $90 in August to $120, and back to $94 on Sept. 18 should pique investor interests. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALNY) rose after the European Commission approved ONPATTRO (patisiran), a drug that treats adults afflicted with hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis. Investors sold ALNY shares in the last week after the company failed to win the FDA’s support for the cardiac indication. The full manuscript, entitled ‘”Effects of Patisiran, an RNA Interference Therapeutic, on Cardiac Parameters in Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis: an Analysis of the APOLLO Study,” will be published in Circulation. Patients suffering from neuropathy will be prescribed this medicine. The heart block is not a major risk for those taking the drug. With the stock nearly 40% below its yearly high, biotech investors may want to pick up some ALNY stock. As of this writing, Chris Lau did not own any of the shares mentioned in this article.

1053951,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused one of Republican Attorney General candidate Ashley Moody’s financial supporters of manipulating stock markets to make millions for himself and co-conspirators. According to a complaint brought against Barry Honig, he and a ring of South Florida investors orchestrated a classic pump-and-dump scam. Moody campaign officials say they are refunding Honig’s contributions and disassociating from him completely, but the micro cap fraud case draws fresh questions how Moody as attorney general might treat white collar crime should more donors come under scrutiny. Pump and Dump SEC officials say Honig and other investors arranged the discount purchase of stock in three different companies, then engaged in deceitful trading to create the illusion of market activity. The group of investors sold the stock at inflated prices, reaping millions at the expense of duped investors. “As alleged, Honig and his associates engaged in brazen market manipulation that advanced their financial interests while fleecing innocent investors and undermining the integrity of our securities markets,” said Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “They failed to appreciate, however, the SEC’s resolve to relentlessly pursue and punish participants in micro cap fraud schemes.” According to the SEC, Honig acted as “primary strategist” in the micro cap fraud scheme. The scheme involved at least three unnamed companies, according to the SEC. First, Honig and other investors, including Miami billionaire Phillip Frost in two of the businesses, bought a large amount of stock at a discount by purchasing a shell company, executing a reverse merger or engaging in financing favorable to the company. Then investors sat on the cheap stock while Seeking Alpha blogger John H. Ford, another defendant in the complaint, or another “promoter” wrote misleading articles hyping the stock, the SEC alleged. The ring of investors meanwhile engaged in trades to create a false impression of market activity right before “news” broke in the blogs. The SEC says Honig directed executives at the companies to sign public filings omitting his and other defendants’ ownership in stock or the size of their holdings. Finally, the investors dumped their stock as prices jumped. The SEC complaint says investors made $9.25 million in stock sales from one company, $9.5 million from a second and $8.3 million from a third. Potential for Favoritism All the investors in the scheme — Honig, Frost, John Stetson, Michael Brauser, John R. O’Rourke III and Mark Grossman — live in South Florida, while the company executives facing charges were based in New York at the time of the activity; Ford lives in California. The SEC says the illegal practices took place from 2013 through this year. Only Honig donated to the Friends of Ashley Moody committee. In the past, he has given to congressional campaigns for former Republican U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite and retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, according to Open Secrets. The SEC filed its complaint in federal court in Manhattan, but it involves plenty of financial activity in Florida, and as more details come out, state laws may come into play. The Florida Attorney General’s Office includes a Consumer Protection Division that investigates and litigates civil cases including theft and deceptive trade practices. Officials with the Moody campaign now are distancing themselves from Honig. “Upon learning of the SEC complaint filed against Barry Honig earlier this month, Melanie Bonanno, chair of the Friends of Ashley political committee, started the process to refund his contribution,” said Christina Johnson, a Moody campaign spokeswoman. The refund doesn’t yet show up in the state’s campaign finance database, but the committee shared a copy of the check. Bonanno sent a letter to Honig on Sept. 11, three days after the SEC announced charges: “In light of the pending SEC complaint, enclosed please find a refund of your donation.” But opponents likely won’t make distancing Moody from Honig easy. The Boca Raton businessman had been one of the top 30 donors to Friends of Ashley Moody as of Sept. 7, the last filing deadline. Of course, the potential influence of political donations has caused headaches for the Attorney General’s Office before. Attorney General Pam Bondi suffered withering criticism over a $25,000 donation by the Trump Foundation in 2013 to a political committee supporting Bondi’s candidacy. The donation came as New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a lawsuit accusing Donald Trump and his Trump University of deceptive conduct. Officials at the Attorney General’s office before the donation was made told two newspapers they were looking into the Trump University case, but after the donation, the office said it was not pursuing its own investigation, according to liberal watchdog group CREW. The issue became a national story after Trump launched his presidential bid and Bondi endorsed him. Bondi also endorsed Moody immediately after she launched her candidacy. Democratic opponent Sean Shaw‘s campaign made mention of the Bondi controversy in its own critique of the Friends of Ashley Moody connection to Honig. “America already has its hands full with the amount of corruption coming from the Trump White House,” said Shaw spokesman Michael Starr Hopkins. “Pam Bondi accepted $25,000 to call off the Trump University investigation and it looks like Ashley Moody was willing to be bought for less until she got caught.
