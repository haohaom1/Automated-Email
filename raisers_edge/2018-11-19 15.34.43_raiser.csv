1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Highlights: MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL, LTSF) today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very pleased with our robust second quarter 2018 results with continued strong growth in client assets as well as revenues and profitability. Solid execution by our management team, together with stable equity markets and the increasing interest rate environment, contributed to our strong performance. Our focus remains on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.” Richard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All segments of our businesses continued to perform well in the second quarter, with revenues of $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from the prior year period, and a 96.4% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $25.8 million. The continued growth of our nationwide network of approximately 4,300 independent financial advisors reflects our successful recruiting efforts of talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $168.0 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $75.2 billion, up 13.6% and 18.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to further drive margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.” Adoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (""ASC 606""). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Tables 3 and 4). For the three months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $27.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $31.3 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $3.9 million, and increase in net income per basic and diluted common share of $0.02. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $58.3 million, a decrease in total expenses of $65.8 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $5.7 million, and decrease in net loss per basic and diluted common share of $0.03. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company's net income as reported is greater than the net income amounts without the adoption of ASC 606 due to the following: 1) the timing of revenue recognized for commissions on future renewals of insurance policies sold is accelerated, as these future commissions represent variable consideration and are required to be estimated, 2) certain costs to obtain a contract with a customer are now capitalized and have historically been recorded as a period expense, and 3) forgivable loans to independent financial advisors are now amortized over the expected useful lives of their relationship period with the Company's subsidiaries; previously these loans were amortized based on their legal terms. For the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Second quarter 2018 revenues were $357.8 million, a 14.8% increase from revenues of $311.5 million in the second quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.7% to $180.4 million from $133.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity, mutual fund and fixed annuities/insurance products, and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2018 decreased by 8.9% to $122.6 million from $134.6 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the second quarter of 2018 decreased by 9.0% to $11.7 million from $12.9 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to a decrease in capital raising revenue and strategic advisory services. Also, service fees revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 35.6% to $27.6 million from $20.3 million, primarily due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs. Net income attributable to the Company for the second quarter of 2018 was $9.3 million, as compared to net income attributable to the Company of $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2017. Net income available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $0.8 million or $0.00 per basic and diluted common share for the second quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $6.6 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The second quarter 2018 results included $4.6 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.4 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $2.2 million of interest expense. The second quarter 2017 results included $0.1 million of income tax benefit, $8.7 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.7 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company had revenues of $687.1 million, a 14.2% increase from revenues of $601.8 million for the comparable 2017 period. Net income attributable to the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $14.8 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $2.3 million in the comparable 2017 period. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $2.3 million or ($0.01) per basic and diluted common share for the six months ended June 30, 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $18.2 million or ($0.09) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $6.7 million of income tax expense, $14.6 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.2 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $4.6 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $4.0 million of interest expense. The comparable 2017 results included $1.0 million of income tax benefit, $17.5 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $3.3 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $1.0 million of interest expense. Recurring Revenues For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.1% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment. EBITDA, as adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was $25.8 million, an increase of 96.4% from $13.2 million in the comparable 2017 period. EBITDA, as adjusted, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $46.0 million, an increase of 122.8% from $20.6 million for the prior year period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the second quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment and our insurance brokerage segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue due in part to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Client Assets At June 30, 2018, total client assets under administration were $168.0 billion, a 13.6% increase from $147.9 billion at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.3 billion, including approximately $4.0 billion participating in our cash sweep programs. Stock Repurchases During the quarter ended June 30, 2018, the Company repurchased 489,591 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 472,215 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.47. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.6 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $59.5 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.15. As of June 30, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,392,170 shares under its current repurchase plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.

Opko Health has completed recruitment of patients in its global phase 3 study of somatrogon (hGH-CTP) in growth hormone deficient children. Subscribe to our email newsletter The company has used multi-dose disposable pen to deliver an investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon. Somatrogon is a new molecular entity, which maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone and can be combined with a C-terminus peptide to expand its half-life. The study is a randomized, open-label and active-controlled study designed to assess a weekly injection of the investigational long-acting human growth hormone product in more than 30 countries. Opko Health recruited around 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD in the study. The patients were randomized1:1 into two arms, including once-weekly somatrogon and once-daily Genotropin. According to the company, the primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks and secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. In addition, the children completing this study are expected to be recruited in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will secure somatrogon. Somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety in a phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon. Opko also noted that the long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is proved the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. The company secured orphan drug designation in the US and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. Opko Health chairman and CEO Dr Phillip Frost said: “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” Opko entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer to develop and commercialize somatrogon.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 | Updated: 16:51 EST, 2 August 2018 3 View comments Of all Britain’s High Street banks Barclays is the most intriguing. It has been through regulatory hell and back as a result of the antics of former bosses Bob Diamond and John Varley, and the effort to steer clear of a UK Government bail-out. Its choice of a Gulf rescue a decade ago, involving Qatar, left a stain which is not yet erased. Under the stewardship of former JP Morgan banker Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank. It has been helped by the Lehman legacy, which gave it a strong client base in America, but has not received unqualified support from Whitehall which has preferred Goldman Sachs and US banks for share sales, such as the return of Royal Bank of Scotland to the public markets. Under the stewardship of Jes Staley, Barclays set a new course, ridding itself of its historic interests in Africa and focusing on becoming Europe’s only fully functioning investment bank Latest results suggest that, in spite of having an arm tied behind its back, Barclays is picking up momentum. A strong quarter for equities in the US saw revenues rise 30 per cent, ahead of some Wall Street peers, and the investment bank’s profits were up 17 per cent. That may not be enough to send activist Ed Bramson, agitating for a break-up of the investment bank, scuttling back to his New York burrow. It is not very helpful for the City and financial services that one of the big backers of Bramson’s outfit Sherborne is Aviva Investors. Indeed, Aviva boss Mark Wilson, who maintains Chinese walls with the investment management arm, is understood to have had his ear bent on the subject. The underlying picture at Barclays is starting to look healthy, with pre-tax profits before various conduct and litigation matters up 20 per cent at £3.7billion in the first half and the bank’s capital base strengthening. But, like other UK financials, it is suffering a Brexit draft. Big fund managers by necessity steer clear of uncertainty. Nevertheless, years of regulatory chaos and management upheaval mean that Barclays has been a serial underperformer. That should be an investment opportunity but not just for renegade, short-term investors in search of sugar rush returns. Brexit bonus The reality about the City and Brexit is that it has little to fear but fear itself. The latest scare story about the migration of Deutsche Bank’s derivatives trading to Frankfurt has left UK competitor, the London Stock Exchange, unfazed. New LSE chief executive David Schwimmer notes that its London Clearing House offshoot saw a 34 per cent increase in client clearing of euro-swaps in the last six months and says that support continues to build. City exports hit a record level in 2017 at £59.6billion in 2017, a rise of £3.6billion on the previous year, says official data just published. And inward investment into UK financial technology was the highest among the major industrial countries in the first half of the year, outpacing the United States. The main downer for the City is uncertainty about a future deal in financial services. There were hints from Brussels this week that something around ‘equivalence’ may be possible if the issue of a tribunal to handle disputes can be resolved. The concern among insurers is that, unfavourable weather in Canada notwithstanding, the Square Mile could be putting itself at a disadvantage. Trump is deregulating Wall Street while the UK is over-regulating, making it more expensive and bureaucratic to work in the City. The UK has been good at exploiting tax and regulatory loopholes which is how the Eurodollar market, followed by US investment banks, arrived here. At times it seems that a legalistic Financial Conduct Authority is fighting battles of a decade ago rather than dealing with the opportunities of being the global financial centre. Onwards and upwards. High off the hog A wonderful insight from Stobart of the way that some directors of public companies regard corporate funds as a personal piggy bank. Former boss and significant shareholder Andrew Tinkler may be a brilliant entrepreneur but it came at a heavy price. As we disclose today, court papers show that Tinkler spent £1m on helicopter travel, £51,399 on a horsebox and bought a £50,000 Range Rover mainly for his daughter’s use. How gallant.

1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"MIAMI, Aug. 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) has completed enrollment in the Company’s global pivotal Phase 3 study in growth hormone deficient children, evaluating a single weekly injection of its investigational long-acting human growth hormone product, somatrogon, delivered in a multi-dose disposable pen. The somatrogon Phase 3 trial is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study taking place in over 30 countries. This study enrolled approximately 225 treatment-naïve children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) who were randomized 1:1 into two arms: once-weekly somatrogon vs once-daily Genotropin®. The primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints are safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints. Children completing this study may enroll in an open-label long-term extension, in which they will receive somatrogon. Somatrogon (hGH-CTP) is a new molecular entity that maintains the natural sequence of growth hormone, fused with a C-terminus peptide to extend its half-life. In a Phase 2 pediatric trial in which growth hormone deficient children were treated with once-weekly injections of somatrogon, somatrogon produced pharmacodynamic effects similar to daily growth hormone replacement therapy with comparable efficacy and safety. The long-term safety of somatrogon and absence of neutralizing antibodies is confirmed in the ongoing extension, as 43 of the Phase 2 pediatric patients are in their fourth and fifth year of treatment. Somatrogon has received Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of children and adults with GHD. “We are pleased to have completed enrollment for this study, as the pediatric segment represents approximately 80% of the market for the treatment of GHD,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We are hopeful that the outcome of this study will support a dosing change from daily to weekly administration and positively impact the quality of life for children with GHD.” OPKO has a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the development and commercialization of somatrogon. Under the agreement, OPKO is responsible for conducting the clinical program and Pfizer is responsible for registering and commercializing the product. About OPKO Health, Inc.OPKO Health is a diversified healthcare company. In diagnostics, its BioReference Laboratories is the nation's third largest clinical laboratory; GeneDx is a rapidly growing genetic testing business; the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test is used to confirm an elevated PSA to help decide about next steps such as prostate biopsy; Claros® 1 is a point of care diagnostics platform with PSA and testosterone as the most advanced in development.

OPK88004, a SARM (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator) for treating BPH (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy), urinary incontinence, and other conditions, is in clinical trials.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Published on By Union Bank Nigeria Plc, the Nigerian lender owned by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara Limited, expects to boost lending for the rest of this year after a N64 billion ($177-million) writedown in the first half caused its book to shrink. UBN’s loan book will probably expand 10-12 per cent this year by focusing on consumer goods, agriculture, agri-processing, services such as education and health, transportation, manufacturing and small businesses, Chief Financial Officer Oyinkan Adewale said on a conference call on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg News. It shrank 9 per cent in the first half compared to the end of 2017 because of the write offs. The Lagos-based company’s ratio of non-performing loans to total credit will improve to below 10 per cent for the full year from 10.8 per cent in the first half and 19.8 per cent at the end of 2017, she said. The real estate industry accounted for about 32 per cent of NPLs, the CFO said. Union Bank recorded a profit after tax of N11.5 billion for the half year ended June 30, 2018 as against N9.2 billion posted in 2017, representing a growth of 25 per cent. The lender in filing with the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) also saw profit before tax up 23 per cent to N11.7 billion from N9.5 billion in H1 2017. Gross earnings grew by 16 per cent to N83.3 billion against N72.1 billion in H1 2017, driven by a 10 per cent increase in interest income and 37 per cent increase in non-interest income. Net interest income before impairment was up by 14 per cent to N34.4 billion from N30.1 billion in H1 2017) driven by an improvement in net interest margins from 7.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent on the back of lower cost of funds. Customer deposits grew by 3 per cent to N826.7 billion in contrast to N802.4 billion in Dec 2017; reflecting 66 per cent increase in foreign currency deposits and the optimization of our local currency deposit book towards low-cost deposits. Commenting on the results, Emeka Emuwa, CEO said: “In the first half of the year, we have continued to see positive results from our efficiency and productivity drive. Across all our business lines, we witnessed strong underlying performance, translating into improved earnings. We continue to focus on the recovery of non-performing loans. “With the resolution in Q2 2018 of the large real estate exposure which was impaired in December 2017, the Group NPL ratio is down to 10.8% from 14.9 per cent at 31 March 2018 and 19.8 per cent at 31 December 2017. The Group continues to demonstrate its ability to deliver strong results notwithstanding a competitive and challenging operating environment.” Gross earnings rose by 16 per cent to N83.3 billion from N72 billion in H1 2017, underpinned by improved Net Interest Margins (NIM), robust treasury trading income, recoveries and alternate channel revenues, on the back of increased customer adoption. Emuwa said :”Our Profit Before Tax (PBT) grew by 23 per cent compared to H1 in 2017. In the second half of the year, we will continue to focus on productivity, leveraging our enhanced platform to deliver best-in-class services to our customers and taking advantage of targeted opportunities across business lines and geographies.” Stakeholders stall new maritime security bill Stock market closes July on positive track Your email address will not be published.

She also saw her team make the SAC Tournament and earn IWLCA All-Academic team honors all four seasons. “I am thrilled to be returning to PC as the women’s lacrosse coach,” said Handshoe. “Thank you to President Staton and Danny (Sterling) for allowing me this opportunity. I look forward to helping the program continue to grow, develop and compete within the Big South Conference and Division I.” In their inaugural season, Handshoe coached the Pioneers to an overall record of 10-5 and a conference record of 5-3 to secure a third place finish in the SAC. She was named the SAC Coach of the Year and saw her offense ranked 23rd in the nation with 13.67 goals per game. Tusculum boasted four All-SAC honorees that season, and Handshoe had four players named to the Athletic Director’s Honor Roll. In 2016, Tusculum won a program-record 11 games and advanced to the SAC Tournament semifinal for the first time in program history. That team boasted two All-Conference picks, one All-Tournament team selection and a CoSIDA Academic All-District first team recipient. Then in 2017, the Pioneers went 5-12 against an extremely tough schedule that included four matches against nationally-ranked teams, two of which were ranked in the top-10. Tusculum battled to earn a spot in the SAC Tournament for the third consecutive year, saw three players earn All-SAC recognition and had four players earn IWLCA Academic Honor Roll honors. In 2018, the Pioneers again challenged themselves with a grueling non-conference schedule, facing three nationally ranked teams. The team won a program-record four consecutive SAC games and earned a spot in the conference tournament for the fourth time. Handshoe had two players named to All-SAC teams. Prior to her time at Tusculum, Handshoe was the head coach at Tennessee Wesleyan College for two seasons. During her time with the Bulldogs, Handshoe posted a 17-18 record and led TWC to the National Women's Lacrosse League tournament twice, where they finished fifth and fourth. While at Tennessee Wesleyan, Handshoe served on the National Women's Lacrosse League Membership committee and was the Appalachian Athletic Conference chair for the Coaches committee. Handshoe started her coaching career as a volunteer coach at Presbyterian College in 2011. Prior to that, Handshoe was a four-year starter at PC from 2007-2010. She earned second-team All-National Lacrosse Conference honors in 2010 and was an All-Tournament Team selection in 2009. Handshoe led PC in scoring her junior and senior seasons. In 2010, the Greenville, SC, native led the team in points (49), goals (36), free position goals (8), shots (70), and shots on goal (60). Her junior year, she paced the team with 28 goals and 20 assists for 48 points. During the shortened 2008 season, Handshoe scored 15 goals over four games. In 2007, she was nationally ranked in NCAA Division II for ground balls and caused turnovers. Her freshman year, Handshoe also was a member of the PC women's basketball team. In the summer of 2007, Handshoe played with USA Athletes International in Prague, Czech Republic, in the Prague Cup International Lacrosse Tournament where she helped the team finish second overall. Handshoe was a key player for J.L. Mann High School during her prep years and led the Patriots to the 2006 SCHSL State Championship. She was named the Tournament MVP and the South Carolina Defensive Player of the Year. Handshoe graduated from PC in May of 2010 with a bachelor's degree in history and minors in physical education and athletic coaching. She then graduated with honors from Tusculum in 2016 with a master's degree in education and a concentration in human resource development. Handshoe is currently enrolled the doctorate of business administration program with a concentration in sports management at Lincoln Memorial University where she has one year left of classes before focusing on her dissertation. Pollock Adds Miller, O'Neil to PC Baseball Staff Presbyterian College head baseball coach Elton Pollock has announced the additions of assistant coach Blake Miller and volunteer assistant coach John O’Neill to the program’s coaching staff. ""Blake Miller and John O'Neil will have an immediate and positive impact on our baseball program,"" Pollock said. ""Miller will take over as our pitching coach and assist with recruiting, while O'Neil will take over with as our infield coach and assist with our hitters. Each brings a wealth of knowledge and experience from prior coaching stints at the Division I level. I am extremely excited to have them joining our staff."" Miller comes to PC from Inspiration Academy in Bradenton, Florida, where he was the post-graduate program’s head coach and director of player development since August 2017. While there, Miller oversaw all aspects of running the program including player development, recruiting, budgeting and games. Prior to his time at Inspiration Academy, Miller spent four seasons as the pitching coach at the United States Air Force Academy. In his tenure with the Falcons, he helped elevate their pitching staff to new heights and several new school records. The bullpen collected a program-record 381 strikeouts in 2015 and then 385 strikeouts in 2016. The team posted a program-best 4.54 ERA in 2015, its lowest since 1979. That season, the pitching staff also held opposing batters to a .265 average, the lowest since 1974. Miller helped the program improve its win total from 16 in 2013 to 30 in 2016. Miller saw three of his players drafted during his time at the Air Force Academy. Senior closer Ben Yokley struck out 45 batters in 34.0 innings in 2015 and was a 29th round draft pick of the St. Louis Cardinals. Yokley went on to pitch for the Johnson City Cardinals, in the Appalachian League (Class A), during the summer of 2015. Then in 2016, juniors Griffin Jax and Jacob DeVries were both drafted. Jax was coming off a 9-2 season where he posted a school-record 2.05 ERA and was a third round selection (93rd overall) of the Minnesota Twins. The Cleveland Indians took DeVries in the 38th round of the 2016 MLB Amateur Players Draft. Prior to his time with the Air Force, Miller spent two years as the pitching coach at Savannah State. He was a part of the program’s historic 2013 season that included winning the school’s first MEAC Championship and NCAA Regional bid. Along with defeating two top-25 teams that season, the Tigers improved their win total from 19 wins in 2012 to 33 wins in 2013 and lowered their team ERA from 6.15 to 4.93. During the 2013 season, pitcher Kyle McGowin, under the tutelage of Miller, established himself as one of the best pitchers in the nation. McGowin posted a 12-2 record with a 2.02 ERA. He led the MEAC and ranked third nationally with 135 strikeouts that season. McGowin became the first pitcher in school history to be named a Division I First Team All-American (NCBWA) and win the MEAC Pitcher of the Year award. He was a top-10 finalist for the National Pitcher of the Year award and top-30 finalist for the Golden Spikes Award. Following his junior season, McGowin became Savannah State’s first pitcher to be drafted. The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected him in the fifth round (157th overall) in the 2013 MLB Amateur Players Draft. In addition to McGowin’s success, Miller had two pitchers named to the MEAC All-Conference Team and saw five members of his pitching staff earn MEAC Conference pitcher-of-the-week honors. In addition, pitcher Rex Davis was named MEAC Freshmen of the Year in 2012. Prior to coaching at Savannah State, Miller was the pitching coach at Emerald High School in Greenwood, 2008-10. While at Emerald, the pitching staff set school records for team ERA in 2009 and again in 2010. Two of Miller’s pitchers were named to the All-Region Team and three players went on to pitch at the collegiate level. Miller holds a bachelors degree in history from Coker College. He graduated in 2007 after playing four years of baseball for the Cobras. A relief pitcher, Miller’s career record was 6-2 and during the 2005 season he set the previous school record for most appearances in a season with 28. Miller’s coaching career began at Coker when he was a student assistant during the 2007 season. O’Neil comes to PC from the University of Tennessee at Martin where he spent one season as an assistant coach. He worked with all infield positions, base runners, assisted with team offense and coached third base while also overseeing team travel, field maintenance and scouting reports. Prior to his time with the Skyhawks, O’Neil previously served as the associate head coach and recruiting coordinator at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, a member of the Mid-Eastern Atlantic Conference, where he was responsible for managing all recruiting efforts and overseeing team offense and infielders during the 2017 season. He served as the Hawks’ interim head coach from January 2015 through August 2016, leading the program to their most non-conference wins (nine) in 2016 and most conference wins (14) in 2015. Under his guidance, the program also saw its most wins over a two-year span (32) in over two decades. Not just focused on the field, the Hawks earned consecutive Male Team Scholar Awards for having the department’s highest team GPA and saw 25 MEAC All-Academic honorees. O’Neil also oversaw the program’s improved fundraising campaigns, playing facility, player equipment and community service involvement. O’Neil served as an assistant coach at Maryland Eastern Shore from August 2011 until he assumed the role of interim coach. In 2012, he assisted the Hawks to the most conference wins in program history and a third place finish in the MEAC Tournament. During the summer of 2011, O’Neil coached the Middlesex Rays of the Atlantic Baseball Confederation Collegiate League. He oversaw the expansion team during their first season with the collegiate wooden bat league. During the 2010-11 baseball season, O’Neil served as the top assistant at the University of the Sciences, which is located in Philadelphia, Pa. He helped guide the NCAA Division-II team to its most conference wins, first conference tournament appearance, first conference tournament win, two First Team All-CACC players, a First Team All-Region infielder and two All-Academic honorees. From 2008-10, O’Neil was the lead assistant at Colby-Sawyer College, a NCAA Division-III program located in New London, NH. He assisted the team to a conference tournament appearance while coaching three All-CCC players, an All-Region selection and two All-Academic honorees. O’Neil played collegiately at Colby-Sawyers College from 2004-08, serving as the team’s starting catcher and designated hitter. At the prep level, he received state awards as an infielder at Burrillville High School in Rhode Island. O’Neil graduated in 2008 with a bachelors degree in Exercise and Sport Sciences with a focus on Sport Management. In 2010, he completed his masters in Sport and Recreation Management with a focus in Coaching from New England College. P.O.

The oncology segment is anticipated to witness the fastest growth. According to various sources, more than USD $38.0 Billion is currently spent by the healthcare industry towards preclinical and clinical development of oncology therapy products. Hence, it is anticipated to grow at a lucrative CAGR and contribute over USD $15.0 Billion towards the clinical trials market by 2025. Advances in new treatments have made cancer a hot investing theme over the past 18 months, helping to power fresh interest in biotechnology stocks. Active companies in the markets today include: Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX), OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK), Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG), Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ: NKTR), BioTime, Inc. (NYSE: BTX). Moleculin Biotech, Inc. (NASDAQ: MBRX) BREAKING NEWS: Moleculin Biotech, a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of oncology drug candidates, all of which are based on license agreements with The University of Texas System on behalf of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, today announced enrollment has opened for a physician-sponsored clinical trial of WP1066 for the treatment of glioblastoma and brain metastases in adults. ""We have been eagerly awaiting the beginning of this physician sponsored clinical trial,"" commented Walter Klemp, Chairman and CEO of Moleculin. ""The trial, which is now listed on clinicaltrials.gov and being conducted at MD Anderson Cancer Center, is now open for enrollment. This is our first investigator initiated trial of WP1066 and an important milestone. Given the unique potential of WP1066, we expect more trials to follow."" The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of WP1066 that can be given to patients with recurrent (has returned after treatment) cancerous brain tumors or melanoma that has spread to the brain. The safety of this drug will also be studied. WP1066 is designed to target the STAT3 pathway in cancer cells, which makes these cells divide, increases new blood vessels to the tumor, causes the cancer cells to move throughout the body and brain, and avoids them being detected by the immune system. We believe that targeting this pathway may cause the immune system to kill the cancer cells.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"BancABC Bank BancABC, the local unit of African Banking Corporation, is among the top banks that are generating the bulk of their revenue from interest-bearing activities, a survey of financial institutions operating in the country conducted by the Zimbabwe Independent has revealed. By Kuda Chideme In the year ended December 2017, the bank generated interest income of US$35 million to give it a non-interest-income-to-total-net-income ratio of 39%. The ratio signifies the extent to which a bank’s income is reliant on non-core activity earnings. For the purposes of ranking, the lower this ratio is, the better, even though an entity might be realising more income. Other banks’ ratios are relatively much higher. This type of income can be incidental in nature and, hence cannot be relied upon to continue flowing in. When the interest income is compared in relation to operating expenses, the bank is ranked 5th at 83%. This ratio reflects the ability of the entity to meet the operating expenses from the interest earned. Any figure below 100% means that the bank has to either earn some non-interest income to bridge the gap or face the losses that would be incurred. The bank is sitting on US$400 million worth of deposits, accounting for 4,6% of the industry’s US$8,6 billion. In terms of loans, BancABC has 5,34% of the total US$3,4 billion represented issued loans as at 31 December 2017. The bank reported more than US$50 million in deposit capture in Zimbabwe for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the back of a strong agency banking programme. The group said the agency banking programme continues to be a strong driver of customer growth and deposit capture. In line with the growth in use of plastic money in Zimbabwe due to cash shortages, BancABC also upgraded its digital platforms during the financial year. The programme included the re-introduction of mobile banking, as well as adding instant interbank transfers. The survey also showed that BancABC, at US$20 million, ranks third in terms of total non-performing loans (NPLs). These represent the loans that the borrower is not servicing; neither the interest nor the principal debt. They are not yet regarded as write-offs because of the possible fact that the collateral security could still be sufficient to recover the loan. In the full year, the bank reported an after-tax profit of US$5 million. BancABC has the second lowest return on assets (ROA) at 1,1 %. This is an indication of the return that an entity has made on the assets of the business. A positive ROA is the desired one and the higher the better. National Building Society (NBS) ranks last as it has a negative ROA of -1,2% and that is largely due to the fact that the financial institution is a new market entrant and still establishing the business. In terms of return on equity (ROE), BancABC is also lowly ranked at 6,23%, performing only better than NBS which is the only entity that has a negative ROE of -3,56%. This is a profitability ratio that reflects the return earned on the equity invested in the business, and a high and positive rate represents a good return, whilst a negative one means the erosion of equity. Out of the 18 banks, BancABC is among the institutions with the highest staff-cost-to-total-expenses ratio of 36,7 %. The ratio basically indicates the contribution to total expenses that human resources costs make. A service-based business would tend to have a higher ratio compared to a manufacturing concern. African Banking Corporation, the parent company of BancABC, was acquired by Atlas Mara, an investment group founded by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond. It has operations in Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and a group services office in South Africa. BancABC has 23 branches in Zimbabwe.

1020357,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Andrew Walker Davis worked for two years in the office of Illinois Rep. Daniel Lipinski. (Courtesy Andrew Walker Davis’ family) Updated 5:22 p.m. | Andrew Walker Davis, former senior policy adviser for Rep. Daniel Lipinski, will be remembered Friday in a memorial service in West Hartford, Connecticut. Davis, 29, who died on Sunday after a two-year battle with cancer, worked for Lipinski for two years, most recently on transportation and infrastructure issues. He left the Hill in 2016 to work as an associate at the government relations firm, Chambers, Conlon and Hartwell. “Andrew was a great employee and a terrific guy who I very much enjoyed having on my staff. Very smart and analytical, he helped me achieve a number of legislative victories, especially on the FAST Act surface transportation bill,” Lipinski said in a statement. The Illinois Democrat added, “He worked hard, never shied from long hours or tough challenges, and he made it possible for me to be an effective legislator. He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man. I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” Davis was an avid Washington Nationals and New England Patriots fan and a politics buff. He could recite all the names of the presidents in chronological order and also was a fan of sports trivia, according to his obituary in the Hartford Courant. His family has asked those attending Friday’s memorial service to wear red, his favorite color, or Patriots colors. Davis was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and lived in Silver Spring, Maryland, with his wife Caitlin O’Donnell Davis and their three-year-old son, Alden Stone Davis. “Not only was Andrew a devoted staffer and colleague, he was also someone who I valued as a good friend. Despite whatever we might be working on, he kept a positive attitude, refreshing us all with his humor and wit, never short of a funny rejoinder about some Member’s floor comments,” Lipinski's chief of staff, Eric Lausten, said in a statement. Davis graduated from Union College and Georgetown Law School. Correction 5:22 p.m. | An earlier version of this story misstated the number of years Davis served on Lipinski’s staff.

You can unsubscribe at any time. 07/27/2018 10:00 AM EDT With help from Brianna Gurciullo, Tanya Snyder and Lauren Gardner TRUST THE PROCESS: The Senate FAA bill (S. 1405 (115)) continues its long slog through the sausage-grinder that is the legislative process, and it's likely to take a bit longer, our Lauren Gardner reports for Pros. The latest wrinkle, according to Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) and an aide, is that Democrats want the bill’s tax title — currently part of the manager’s package being hotlined on the GOP side — to be folded into the substitute amendment instead. Ranking member Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) as recently as Wednesday told reporters that Democrats “didn’t want some monkey business coming around of trying to add taxes on it, but it looks like it’s clean.” Though procedurally either approach leads to the same outcome, Democrats seem to believe that including a clean tax title in the substitute will offer a degree of comfort that it’s inoculated from any extraneous tax amendments that could cause the legislation to implode. Story Continued Below Tl;dr: The bill’s not making it to the floor next week, in all likelihood. WORKING FOR THE WEEKEND: Happy Friday!

Recently named a federal driverless car proving ground, Michigan’s American Center for Mobility offers real world testing environments to validate self-driving systems. Learn how public-private ventures are helping Michigan create a safer world. Visit PlanetM.com ** JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME: Senators wrapped up the week by clearing a House-passed measure (H.R. 5729 (115)) that would prevent the Coast Guard from moving forward with a rule requiring biometric card readers for transportation worker IDs. The bill passed by unanimous consent. It would postpone implementation of the rule, currently set to go into effect on Aug. 23, until the Coast Guard submits a report to Congress showing the effectiveness of its Transportation Worker Identification Credential program as a whole. The service had proposed a three-year delay of the rule for some facilities, but industry groups have pressed for an extension for all facilities, given what they have referred to as years of unclear guidance from the Coast Guard. MONEY DOWN: Amtrak announced Thursday that it plans to spend $370 million over the next three years on a track laying system and other equipment to improve on-time performance for the Northeast Corridor. The investment also will include freight cars, five high-speed surfacing machines and heavy lift cranes for New York Penn Station. “More than 890,000 Amtrak customers and commuter passengers rely on the Northeast Corridor for transportation every weekday, and we are working to make their ride smoother and more reliable,” said Scot Naparstek, Amtrak’s executive vice president and chief operating officer. UP THE TRACKS: Rural-state senators lavished praise on their long-distance Amtrak services during a Thursday hearing on two rail-related nominees — former Trump aide Rick Dearborn to serve on Amtrak’s board of directors and Martin Oberman to become a Surface Transportation Board member. Many of them sought assurances from Dearborn (a former Senate staffer well liked by members) that those routes are crucial to Amtrak’s national network, which he gave without making many promises besides vowing to work with senators and their staffs. When asked by Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) what he would do if he had to choose between lowering Amtrak’s operating losses or shutting down a long-distance line, Dearborn said: “I hope I’m never faced with that decision.” He added that he plans to focus on boosting ridership, which would spur revenue gains that he hopes would help Amtrak’s stewardship of its various services. Mark your calendars: The committee will consider both nominations at an Aug. 1 markup. For your files: A bipartisan coterie of senators wrote to Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson Thursday concerned about the prospect of the railroad suspending service along its Southwest Chief route. They asked him to “uphold Amtrak's commitment to intercity rail service across the entire national network” and apply for grant funding recently made available by FRA for rail infrastructure upgrades. MEH: Rep. Bill Shuster's infrastructure plan is running into a familiar stumbling block: revenue. The Pennsylvania Republican, who isn’t running for reelection, has nothing to lose by getting behind a 15-cent gas tax hike, but other lawmakers oppose the move. Shuster’s playing the long game, though — 10 more years of gas tax, and then it disappears entirely to make way for a mileage fee. BACK TO BASICS: TSA needs to set clear goals for its basic training program for airport screeners, GAO said in a new report. The Transportation Security Officer training program offers a two-week intensive course for newly hired agents and private screeners to identify security threats. Though TSA has a model for evaluating its training, it “has not yet established specific program goals and performance measures to assess TSO Basic Training,” according to the report. Specifically, GAO said the agency needs to identify what the trainees are expected to achieve. TSA concurred and said it planned to collect more data from screeners to help it assess the potential impacts of the program. MILESTONE: FAA announced Thursday that it’s issued more than 100,000 Remote Pilot Certificates to commercial and recreational drone users — and that’s on top of the hundreds of thousands of “model aircraft” hobbyists who don’t have to comply with Part 107 certification requirements. MT MAILBAG: Democratic Reps. Frank Pallone (N.J.) and Jan Schakowsky (Ill.) sent a letter to NHTSA Thursday raising concerns about a recently released inspector general report that said the agency had been slow to react to consumer complaints about Takata airbags and ineffectively used its enforcement authorities to push for affected vehicles to be repaired as soon as possible. The lawmakers write that, “despite repeated calls now for NHTSA to open an investigation into the Kia and Hyundai fores, NHTSA has still failed to take meaningful action to keep drivers and passengers safe.” Also: The We Will Ride Coalition, a disability rights group, issued an open letter to automakers urging them to manufacture driverless vehicles that could accommodate wheelchair users and others with disabilities. “We worry that self-driving cars will fall short of the mobility promise they hold because we see no signs that auto manufacturers are developing a fully accessible passenger vehicle,” the group said. This day in history: Today marks one year since the Energy and Commerce Committee approved its driverless car bill (H.R. 3388 (115)) in a 54-0 vote. SHIFTING GEARS: Lynden Tennison will become Union Pacific’s executive vice and chief strategy officer on Aug. 1. Tennison has been with the railroad for 26 years and has served as senior vice president and chief information officer for more than a decade. And Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl has become the new chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority board of directors. She succeeds outgoing board chairman L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. MT INFLUENCE: Southwest Airlines hired Heideh Shahmoradi — former staff director of the Senate Transportation-HUD spending panel — to lobby on appropriations and reauthorizing the FAA. IN MEMORIAM: Andrew Davis, a former staffer for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), died this week following a lengthy battle with cancer. Davis, who was 29, served as Lipinski’s senior policy adviser on transportation and infrastructure for two years. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” (h/t POLITICO Huddle) THE AUTOBAHN: — ""Trump administration to freeze Obama-era fuel standards for cars, light trucks."" USA Today. — “5G mobile internet is (potentially) about to revolutionize transportation.” The Drive. — “For disabled subway riders, the biggest challenge can be getting to the train.” The New York Times. — “Southwest boosts inspections of engine involved in fatal failure.” Bloomberg. — Uber touts the positive impacts it has on the economy.

1096862,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Second Quarter Financial Highlights* *All comparisons versus second quarter 2017. NEW YORK, July 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq:MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018. ""The second quarter results show a solid 16.4% year-over-year increase in total trading volume and record Open Trading™ activity, "" noted Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. ""International client breadth and trading activity continues to improve, led by a 27.0% increase in emerging market trading volume and a 32.3% increase in Eurobond volume. We are seeing rapid growth in trading automation in credit, driving improved trading efficiency and lower trading costs for our dealer and investor clients."" Second Quarter Results Total revenues for the second quarter of 2018 increased 11.1% to $107.0 million, compared to $96.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. Operating income was $52.0 million, compared to $49.0 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.2%. Operating margin was 48.6%, compared to 50.9% for the second quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $40.5 million, or $1.07 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $38.0 million, or $1.00 per share, for the second quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the second quarter of 2018 increased 10.5% to $96.1 million, compared to $87.0 million for the second quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 1.5% to $71.7 million on total trading volume of $420.8 billion for the second quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $70.6 million on total trading volume of $361.5 billion for the second quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.4% for the second quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.0% for the second quarter of 2017. All other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services and other revenue, increased 16.7% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $1.1 million. Total expenses for the second quarter of 2018 increased 16.1% to $54.9 million, compared to $47.3 million for the second quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $2.0 million, professional and consulting fees of $1.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.0 million, technology and communication costs of $1.0 million and employee compensation and benefit costs, mainly due to an increase in headcount, of $0.9 million. Occupancy costs in the second quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.8 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.03. Other income (expense) increased to $1.2 million from $0.6 million due to a $0.5 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2018 was 23.9%, compared to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $5.3 million of excess tax benefits, or $0.14 per diluted share, related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on August 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 9, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,900 shares were repurchased in the second quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.6 million. Balance Sheet Data As of June 30, 2018, total assets were $617.6 million and included $420.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of June 30, 2018 was $557.4 million.

The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding the Company's operating results.

You can unsubscribe at any time. 07/26/2018 08:00 AM EDT By Nolan D. McCaskill (nmccaskill@politico.com or @NolanDMcCaskill) MIDTERM MONEY SPRINT -- House leaders will crisscross the country to raise millions of dollars for candidates and incumbents during the five-week August recess as both parties compete for control of the chamber. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s offices say the leaders have scheduled dozens of events during their summer break. McCarthy aides say he will do more than 30 events in a dozen states, including stops in Ohio, Tennessee, Nebraska, Minnesota, New York and Maine. McCarthy has ramped up his fundraising this year, ascending to a level matched only by Ryan and Pelosi. Story Continued Below “McCarthy’s multiple fundraising entities took in more than $12 million last quarter, with a huge chunk of that coming from a joint committee McCarthy set up with Vice President Mike Pence, another key player in the Republican money chase,” Bres and Heather report. A Ryan aide says the retiring speaker will spend part of next month in Wisconsin doing events with its GOP delegation. The state’s primary is Aug. 14. Then he’ll travel to Illinois, Washington, Oregon and Colorado for fundraisers for incumbents. Pelosi will swing through the Southwest, appearing with Democratic candidates in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, then travel the country with stops in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Boston, New York, Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego, Indianapolis and San Francisco. Pelosi will host her annual donor retreat in Napa in mid-August. Scheduled speakers include former Secretary of State John Kerry, California Gov. Jerry Brown and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. More on other leaders’ summer cash dash: http://bit.ly/2LNIFa9 LEADERS STRATEGIZE TO AVOID SHUTDOWN -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) presented President Donald Trump a government spending strategy designed to minimize the threat of a government shutdown over border wall funding a month before Election Day. The congressional leaders said they will prioritize less controversial bills before the Sept. 30 funding deadline and hope to fund the majority of the government through the appropriations process by the end of September, leaving a fight over border wall funding until later in the year. “Trump made clear to the GOP leaders that he still wants a $5 billion down payment on his wall this year, but he signaled to the leaders that he might be willing to wage that fight after the midterms,” Burgess reports. “Though the House plans to pass a spending bill giving Trump $5 billion for the wall, Senate Democrats are unlikely to agree to fund more than the $1.6 billion initially requested by the Trump administration -- meaning any attempt to fund the Department of Homeland Security could lead to a shutdown.” More: http://bit.ly/2LsRxGo GOP TORN APART OVER TARIFFS -- With the president threatening $500 billion in additional tariffs on China and new duties on foreign cars, Senate Republicans are increasingly focused on crafting legislation to tie his hands. Even Trump ally Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, is working on a bill limiting the president from imposing new national security-based tariffs. There’s just one problem: House Republicans. “[A]cross the Capitol, Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP leaders have all but rejected that approach,” Rachael and Burgess report. “House Republicans, who rarely push back on the president, say it’s more productive to try to convince Trump privately or through letters or committee hearings than to force his hand legislatively.” “Ask them how they expect the president to sign it,” House Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) said of the Senate. “The split-strategy undermines Hill Republicans’ drive to blunt Trump’s protectionist trade policies,” they write. “Instead, the political party of free markets is watching the president dole out $12 billion in subsidies for farmers hurt by his trade war with China, Europe, Canada and Mexico.” Republicans in both chambers agree that an escalating trade war is the greatest threat to their majorities, but House Republicans are far less inclined to challenge the president. More: http://bit.ly/2NLgZDy Trump, for his part, announced Wednesday that the U.S. would pause its plans to impose new tariffs on the European Union and move to resolve differences over trade in an effort to avoid a full-blown trade war.

Senate Majority PAC plans to pour at least $20 million into a voter-mobilization campaign in Republican-leaning states. “The initiative … will span more than a dozen states where Senate seats are at stake, but it is to focus on four states above all: Missouri and Indiana, where endangered Democrats are seeking re-election, and Arizona and Tennessee, where strong Democratic challengers are running for open seats currently held by Republicans,” The New York Times’ Alexander Burns reports. “Those four races are among the country’s most competitive. And for Democrats to take control of the Senate, they would likely have to win at least three of them, or perhaps all four, depending on the outcome of races in other states.” Much more: https://nyti.ms/2LSD1Ue CONSERVATIVES REACH TO IMPEACH ROSENSTEIN -- Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) filed articles of impeachment late Wednesday in an attempt to oust Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. “Meadows sidestepped a procedural move that could have forced the issue to a vote this week and laid bare divisions among Republicans,” Kyle reports. “Instead, the House is leaving Thursday for a five-week recess and it's unclear whether conservatives will attempt to force the issue when lawmakers return in September.” The filling followed a meeting with top DOJ officials over a lingering demand for documents. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has rejected impeachment calls, recently describing the document dispute as a “compliance” issue that was on its way to being resolved. “Without GOP leaders’ support, it’s unlikely an impeachment bid could pass the House -- and even if it did, it would be doomed in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to oust any executive branch official,” Kyle adds. “But Rosenstein’s sharpest House critics have previously suggested that laying out articles of impeachment could be enough to prompt Trump to act against Rosenstein on his own.” Much more: http://bit.ly/2LrWv68 Related read: “Election meddling bill would curb president's power, Paul warns,” from Stephanie Murray: http://bit.ly/2Lt4f84 POMPEO DEFENDS TRUMP ON RUSSIA -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told lawmakers the president accepts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Pompeo assured the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Trump “has a complete and proper understanding of what happened” because he briefed the president on it as CIA director. Pompeo “repeatedly urged lawmakers to pay attention to the administration's policies as opposed to what the president may be implying through public comments,” Nahal Toosi and Stephanie Murray report. Pompeo also said the U.S. “does not and will not recognize the Kremlin's purported annexation of Crimea.” More from the hearing: http://bit.ly/2LFAlMM DEADLINE DAY -- Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who met with Kirstjen Nielsen on Wednesday say the DHS secretary told them the Trump administration would meet today’s court deadline to reunify families that were separated at the border due to its zero-tolerance enforcement policy. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters that members “questioned her numerous times” on that claim. “That’s impossible,” he said of the possibility. “We all said this to her.” In a statement, Nielsen said she had a “productive and frank conversation” with lawmakers that included the administration’s reunification efforts. Members had a far different characterization, though. They said the meeting ended with few concrete answers and some unresolved issues.

Davis, 29, spent nearly two years as a senior policy adviser for Rep. Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), focusing on transportation and infrastructure issues. “He was a gracious person, a joy to be around, and a true family man,” Lipinski said in a statement. “I am very saddened by his passing, and my staff and I will greatly miss him.” “He had a larger than life presence and a passion for making others smile,” his obituary reads. “He was known for his altruistic disposition and could always be counted on to help family or friends in need. Even in the bleakest of conditions, he was someone who always saw the positive in life.” Davis is survived by his 3-year-old son, Alden, college sweetheart and wife, Caitlin O’Donnell Davis, parents and siblings.

Partly cloudy skies early will give way to cloudy skies late. Low 51F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 3:17 pm MADISON COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) - A community is trying to heal after a 6-year-old boy in Madison County was hit and killed by a car. ""He enjoyed class, he loved to dance and he was easy to make friends with,"" said Tamisha Ealy, a teacher at Madison County Central School. Andrew Davis Jr. was the light of his classroom at Madison County Central School. ""He was a sweet little boy,"" Ealy said. ""He reminded me of my son actually because he was quiet and humble and very smart."" According to FHP, a driver was traveling north on Parramore avenue, approaching the intersection at Miller street. That's when FHP says the driver tried to avoid hitting 6-year-old Andrew Davis Jr. ""It devastated me because like I said he's an angel. He was very precious, very mannerable and to hear that someone that young passing away that you had an opportunity to interact with is very devastating,"" said Ealy. On Facebook, comments came pouring in about the loss of the child. ""Everyone made sure they were calling the family, calling people that interacted with this young boy to make sure that everyone was together and okay,"" Ealy explained. ""You know it just seemed like this is the most love I've seen in Madison County."" FHP says alcohol did not play a factor in the accident and charges are currently pending for the driver. Funeral services for Davis are scheduled for Saturday, July 28 at 11 a.m. at the Mount Zion AME Church. We're always interested in hearing about news in our community. Let us know what's going on!

1016437,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Race leaders will have to stay on their toes for stages 14 and 15 As the 2018 Tour de France heads towards the end of its second week, the race moves from the Alps to the Massif Central for what is predicted to be a weekend for breakaways. So far, the main breakaway of the day has only succeeded in winning one stage, with Julian Alaphilippe's efforts into Le Grand-Bornand on stage 10. But the coming two stages should be a prime opportunity for the escapees to take the honours. Related ArticlesCalmejane wins Tour de France stage with panacheTwo-year extension for Calmejane at Direct EnergieTour de France: The Alps in review with Thomas, Dumoulin and Roglic - PodcastGeraint Thomas prepares for next yellow jersey battle at MendeHistory repeats itself with Thomas and Froome's leadership contest First up on Saturday is a lumpy stage 14 from Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Mende, which features rolling terrain followed by four classified climbs at no higher than second category. The final ascent in Mende – the Côte de la Croix Neuve – may only be deemed to be a category 2 climb, but it's no joke: while only three kilometres in length, it averages a whisker over 10 per cent in gradient. The top of the climb comes 1.5km from the finish, allowing the weaker climbers to get back on, or the stronger time triallists to potentially take a few seconds. Team Sky directeur sportif Nicolas Portal expects any escapees to be successful, but it won’t be a day off for the general classification riders. ""It will be the breakaway that goes for the stage win, but behind them it will be a fight for the GC,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""On the short uphill in Mende, someone is going to try. Sometimes, if you can get 10 seconds on this climb, it's better than nothing. So, for us, it's going to be a case of being very focused on trying not to lose any time, and maybe gaining time."" The Mende finale last appeared at the 2015 Tour de France with Steve Cummings surprising a duelling Thibaut Pinot and Romain Bardet. Cummings had been dropped by the two flyweight climbers, but his power worked to his advantage as he tracked them down over the top of the ascent. Back in the main pack, Chris Froome and Nairo Quintana came over the top together, but Froome was able to add another second to his lead over the Colombian with a faster sprint. Given his finishing move on top of Alpe d'Huez, Froome's Sky teammate Geraint Thomas could potentially pull out a couple of seconds on the line with his superior sprint. Perhaps third-placed Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) will utilise his time trialling skills to eke out a few of his own as the finish flattens out. As Portal says, 10 seconds is better than nothing at all. The Massif Central journey continues on Sunday with a 181-kilometre ride from Millau to Carcassonne. The three classified climbs – a third, a second and a first category one, in that order – are spread across the parcours. The final ascent of the Pic de Nore comes with just over 50 kilometres remaining before a long descent and a flat run to the line, with a final flick upwards before the line. The 12.3km-long category 1 Pic de Nore is a new addition to the Tour de France, with narrow roads and a long drag to the top with an average gradient of 6.3 per cent. There is one ramp of just over nine per cent, but much of the climb is a steady grind. French breakaway specialist Lilian Calmejane, of Direct Energie, is from France's Tarn department, where the climb is situated, and thinks that it could surprise a few people. ""This is a famous col in my region, but it's not a famous Tour de France climb,"" Calmejane told Cyclingnews. ""We climb it by a small, forest road, so I don't think anybody knows this climb very well, and I don't think that even the GC riders will have reconned this stage because it's a transition stage, so they could be surprised by it. ""It makes for a difficult stage, but I don't think it will be a particularly busy day for the riders chasing the overall classification. It's more a day for a breakaway, and for riders like me, I hope."" Portal is also from the south of France, from the nearby department of Gers, in the larger region of Occitanie. While Team Sky did not go to recon the stage, as Calmejane predicted, Portal has first-hand knowledge of the Pic de Nore, having climbed it several years ago. He believes that someone like Peter Sagan could take the stage if he chooses to go on the attack, and says that the general classification riders are unlikely to take too much out of the day. ""It would be quite complicated,"" he said when asked if any of the GC contenders could feasibly take time. ""The Pic de Nore is a climb I did when I was young, and is part of the Montagne Noire range. It's not an easy climb: it's got rough tarmac, and if the weather continues to be hot, then it could be terrible. ""It could be a good stage for Sagan because if he decides to go in the break, then he could win. He could use the team to drop some sprinters because it's pretty hard, and then, from the top, I think there are only around 40 kilometres to go, but that's just enough to possibly stay away. The race could be pretty full on from the bottom of the climb."" After three tough days in the high mountains, followed by a sprint day, stage hunters like Calmejane are eager for a piece of the pie. The 25-year-old, who won a stage at last year's Tour, has already been on the attack numerous times in this year's race, but he has been eyeing up this weekend in particular. ""I'm quite tired, like everybody in the peloton,"" Calmejane admitted. ""But the stages on Saturday and Sunday are two stages that I've reconned and in fact already know very well. They suit me much better than the big mountains."" Team Sky hold the first two positions in the overall classification, with Thomas holding the yellow jersey with a 1:39 advantage over Froome. Sunweb's Dumoulin is very close behind, only 11 seconds down on Froome. At the start of the Tour, Sky had said that they were 100 per cent behind Froome but Thomas' performance has earned him equal billing with the defending champion. Portal says neither has more support than the other, and that having two riders at the top of the GC is the best possible scenario. ""For us, it's a pretty good situation: we have two cards to play. I always say that, but it's true,"" Portal told Cyclingnews. ""Maybe at the beginning it was more about Froome, but now, to be honest, Thomas has shown that he's super-strong, and who knows how long he can hold it? He doesn't even know. ""It's the same for Froome, coming from the Giro. Who knows how long he can perform? He could pay the price. At the moment, it looks pretty good because we are in first and second, but let's see what the road brings. We need to support them both,"" said Portal.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The chairman of Italian banking group Intesa Sanpaolo, Gian Maria Gros-Pietro, says he knows nothing of his bank’s involvement in co-financing Atlas Merchant Capital’s takeover of Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) or the pan-African Africell mobile-telephone network in cooperation with the US government’s Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Sources in Washington say Intesa Sanpaolo has expressed interest in entering a co-financing deal with OPIC on the two mega African M&A deals: The circa US$1 billion takeover of Africell – the Beirut-based Lintel Group of Companies’ mobile-phone carrier with subsidiaries in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo and The Gambia – and former Barclays Bank chief executive officer Bob Diamond’s move to take control of Union Bank of Nigeria. Diamond has teamed up with the Dubai-based founder of Atlas Mara, Ashish Thakkar, to create a pan-African universal bank network that currently has banking operations in Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania, and now a major presence in Nigeria through UBN. Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing two African deals with OPIC – now a strategic arm of US President Donald Trump’s administration’s use of private-sector investment in Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia as a national-security objective – could cement Italy’s role as the United States’ closest NATO ally. However, it is understood that OPIC and Intesa Sanpaolo co-financing talks are being led by former Intesa Sanpaolo CEO Corrado Passera through his €600 million (US$698 million) Italian SME lending startup Spaxs. Diamond, through Atlas Merchant, is the largest investor in Spaxs. Intesa Sanpaolo spokesman Stefano Lucchini said he had no knowledge of Passera’s or Bob Diamond’s involvement with Intesa Sanpaolo. An Intesa Sanpaolo source said the bank’s London operations had looked at co-financing the UBN and Africell deals along with OPIC. Italian banks, as with Italian companies in general, are top-down institutions in which the board of directors is directly informed of almost any strategic or potentially controversial activity. While co-financing with OPIC carries little risk as the underlying investments are guaranteed by the US government, any involvement by Intesa Sanpaolo with a US government agency such as OPIC could be easily misconstrued by the Italian press harking back to past US-government-connected Italian banking scandals such as the bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano (Vatican/IOR) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro’s Iraqgate scandal. However, Intesa San Paolo co-financing OPIC deals in Africa, Central Asia and North Africa is likely to be raised during Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s meeting with Trump on July 30, sources close to the matter said.
