The event, in Lagos, Nigeria, on December 11, will showcase the launch of 15 of the hottest startups in Africa onstage for the first time. We’ll also be joined by some of the leading investment firms in the region. The event is now sold out, but keep your eyes on TechCrunch for video of all the panels and the Battlefield competition. Here are just some of the investors and founders who will be judging the startups competing for US$25,000. Olugbenga Agboola is the CEO of Flutterwave, a payments technology company headquartered in San Francisco with operations and offices across Africa and Europe. Prior to co-founding Flutterwave, Olugbenga contributed to the development of fintech solutions at several tech companies and financial institutions such as PayPal and Standard Bank, among others. He is a serial entrepreneur with two successful exits under his belt. He is a software engineer with a Master’s Degree in Information Technology Security and Behavioral Engineering, as well as an MBA. Barbara Iyayi is the chief growth officer and managing director of Africa for Element, which deploys AI-powered mobile biometrics software to develop digital platforms globally. Barbara was part of the founding team of Atlas Mara, a London stock exchange-listed company, co-founded by Bob Diamond, ex-CEO of Barclays Bank, which was the first-ever entity to raise more than $1 billion to invest in, operate and manage financial institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa. As the Regional Lead for M&A and Investments, she led investments into banks and developed the banking platform’s entry into seven countries in Africa. Notably, she led the acquisition and first-ever merger of two banks in Rwanda, to be the leading innovative retail bank — Banque Populaire du Rwanda — and led a $250 million equity investment in Union Bank of Nigeria. Aaron is an early-stage investor, entrepreneur and strategic advisor to both startups as they scale and corporates as they transform to gain agility for disruptive innovation. Over the last five years he has specifically focused on innovation in Africa, working with global brands and entrepreneurs across diverse industries, from financial services to health to mobile to agriculture. As managing director at MEST, he is dedicated to training, investing in and incubating the next generation of global software entrepreneurs in Africa.

His contribution in establishing the startup business ecosystem in Kenya, through Nailab, has been significant, and as a result was invited as a key speaker during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit, held in Nairobi and officiated by then U.S. President Barack Obama. Sam has been instrumental in propagating the development of a strong and vibrant entrepreneurship ecosystem, and it’s through this engagement that he was most recently selected by Jack Ma to lead, through Nailab, the Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative, a $10 million Initiative that seeks to discover, spotlight and support 10 African entrepreneurs every year for the next 10 years. Olufunbi Falayi is a partner at Passion Incubator, an early-stage technology incubator and accelerator that invests in early-stage startups.

Commercial real estate brokerage CBRE|The Boulos Co. of Portland is dropping its affiliation with international brand CBRE Group Inc. after 17 years. Boulos, which operates brokerages in Maine and New Hampshire, said Thursday that going independent will allow it to have more autonomy and build new relationships. The company, founded by Joe Boulos in 1975, said it will drop CBRE from its name as of Dec. 31 but will not make any changes to its ownership, management or personnel. The company has over 30 employees working at its Portland headquarters. “Our relationships with local developers, business owners and property owners will not change, nor will our commitment to their success or our ability to tap into the national marketplace,” said Boulos Managing Director and Partner Drew Sigfridson in a news release. Boulos said the change will allow for more flexible, local advertising and marketing decisions. The company said it plans to enhance its property listing service and deploy more creative and agile marketing strategies with a more customized platform. It is developing a new website that will feature a more user-friendly and visually appealing listing searches as well as property photo galleries, according to the release. An expanded social media presence is also in the works, it said. A worldwide company with roughly 450 corporate and franchise locations, CBRE has a long and complex ownership history but was essentially formed by the merger of Coldwell Banker and Richard Ellis International in the late 1990s. The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CBRE. J.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Throughout the pages of the Bible you can find tales of all sorts of women — seducers, betrayers, the virtuous and the heroic. You don’t have to be a churchgoer to appreciate the various tales of lust, jealousy, faithfulness and honor — and you certainly don’t have to be religious to admire the fine art on display at the Cornell Fine Arts Museum. The Winter Park museum, on the Rollins College campus, is hosting “Dangerous Women,” mostly Renaissance and Baroque works by painters who were inspired by biblical women — Mary Magdalene, Salome, Queen Esther, Potiphar’s wife, Judith and others. If you don’t recognize these names, don’t worry — the exhibition gives the plot and context for each of the stories and related artwork. On view are paintings by artists such as Pietro da Cortona, Fede Galizia, Pordenone, Giovanni Andrea Sirani and Francesco del Cairo, as well as Old Master prints and drawings. “Dangerous Women” was created by the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University in Miami, the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota and the Cornell. Virginia Brilliant curated the works, drawn from the Ringling, which is the state art museum. So why use the word “Dangerous”? “Seductive women are potentially dangerous to men because they invoke the fear of women’s power over them,” writes feminist art historian Mary D. Garrard in the hardcover book that accompanies the exhibition. “From earliest antiquity, woman was associated with a paradoxical fusion of sexual appeal and danger,” notes Kimberly L. Dennis, a Rollins professor who coordinates the college program in sexuality, women’s and gender studies. Seen with modern eyes, “Dangerous Women” provides a fascinating look at how these women were depicted in accordance with the norms of society hundreds of years ago. And contemplating how their stories might be told now adds to the enjoyment. These women aren’t just dangerous — they’re fascinating. ► “Dangerous Women runs through Dec. 12. The Cornell, at 1000 Holt Ave., Winter Park, is open 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Tuesdays, 10 a.m.-4 p.m. Wednesdays-Fridays, and noon-5 p.m. Saturdays-Sundays. Admission is free. In addition, a free tour of the exhibit will be given at 1 p.m. Dec. 1. No reservations required. More information at rollins.edu/cfam Orlando Sentinel arts writer and critic Matthew J.

1015016,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Sarah Butcher 7 days ago If you want to know how it feels to feel wanted in finance, you could always ask Liberum. The diminutive pan-European brokerage firm is reportedly being wooed by Macquarie. However, it is not so long ago (last week) that Liberum was also reportedly being sniffed by Bob Diamond's Panmure Gordon. It's clearly got something. Named after the Latin world for independence, Liberum was founded in 2007 by chief executive Shane Le Prevost. It's had its ups and downs - in 2015, then chief executive Simon Stillwell left as the firm struggled with a high cost base and falling profits. Headhunters at the time told us Liberum was known for treating a small coterie of senior people very well indeed and for being less generous to the rest. In 2018 some things have changed. Liberum made a profit of nearly £5m last year according to its accounts for 2017, up from £1.4m in 2016. Accordingly, the highest paid individual at the firm (likely Le Provost) took home £956k, up from £655k the year before. However, the average of Liberum's 178 employees took home £171k, down from £175k in 2016. Irrespective of staff pay, rivals clearly think Liberum has something. Observers suggest it's the whiff of scale. By plugging Liberum's 122 front office staff into their own equities businesses, the likes of Macquarie or Panmure Gordon can grow overnight and hopefully vanquish MiFID II. The UK Liberum franchise is deemed ""strong"" by headhunters, although the smaller U.S. franchise raises a few eyebrows. Not everyone is convinced, though. One equity research headhunter points out that Macquarie and Liberum suffer the same problem - both are smaller players with mostly unranked staff. ""Macquarie would have been better off buying a best in class broker like a Numis,"" says one. In this year's Extel rankings, Liberum ranked third among small and mid cap brokers in the UK, behind Numis and Peel Hunt. For Liberum's employees, Macquarie may yet provide some shelter from the MiFID mayhem. Even big rivals like Numis have been cutting costs, and Berenberg has decided its recent expansion was all a terrible mistake. Macquarie, meanwhile, has been hiring heavily in equities sales and trading this year under Daniel Kaye, the former Credit Suisse trader who's been building the equities business since early 2017, and will undoubtedly welcome the mass injection of new staff. However, some observers suggest the recent departure of Peter Crampton from Macquarie's oil and gas equity research team augurs badly for Liberum researchers. Crampton joined Macquarie in 2014 with a mandate to build the European utilities franchise at the Australian bank. Utilities have traditionally been Macquarie's strongest area and Crampton therefore had one of Macquarie's most prestigious jobs - but left (seemingly for Barclays) nonetheless.

1028440,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Most of the money will go toward relieving the burden of student debt, while some will be used on the college's strategic plan. Philanthropists Peter and Paula Lunder have given Maine College of Art $3 million to help pay the tuition of Maine students and help the college plan for its future. The gift from the Lunder Foundation, which MECA plans to announce Tuesday, includes $2.5 million for the existing Lunder Scholars program at MECA and $500,000 toward the college’s strategic plan. It’s the largest gift MECA has received for financial aid, said President Laura Freid, and “secures the promise of equal opportunity for all students. The immediate impact is that it will encourage more students of low- and middle-income families to apply.” The Lunder gift is a challenge match. If the college meets its fundraising goals, the gift could add up to $6 million, including $5 million for additional student aid and $1 million for college operations. The promise of the gift holds the potential to be transformative for MECA, Freid said. The college endowment is currently about $8 million, “and a gift that could add $5 million to that is a pretty significant gift,” she said. Though smaller in scale and narrower in scope than the $1.8 billion that businessman and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg last week donated to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University, the Lunder gift represents a similar goal of making college affordable for low- and moderate-income students “to ensure they do not graduate with a burden of significant student debt,” said Matt Goetting, MECA’s vice president of institutional advancement. “Reducing the student debt burden that so many young people have as they move into their lives nowadays seems to be the issue that everybody is talking about nationwide.” The Portland-based Lunder Foundation previously gave MECA more than $1 million for financial aid to establish the Lunder Scholars program, which has provided need-based aid to more than 100 undergraduates from Maine since its inception in 2002. About 25 percent of MECA’s 500 undergraduate students are from Maine. The Lunder gift will allow the school to pay a larger portion of students’ tuition, increase the number of students it recruits from Maine or both, Goetting said. MECA currently charges $35,000 annually for tuition. On average, it provides $16,000 in scholarship support to each student annually, bringing the effective tuition down to $19,000. Freid said the college provides some kind of financial assistance to all of its undergraduate students, and the school awards more than $7 million annually in scholarships, grants and other forms of financial assistance. In addition to its 500 undergraduate students, MECA has about 40 master’s of fine arts students and 1,500 continuing education students. The most popular undergraduate programs are animation, illustration and design. Freid began as MECA president in July 2017 and met the Lunders soon after at a dinner arranged by a MECA board member intended to introduce Freid to the community. Peter Lunder later gave Freid a tour of the Colby College Museum of Art, which the Lunders have supported with the gift of money and art. “We began talking about the importance of financial aid about a year ago,” Freid said, and “met many times over the year” in ongoing conversations about ways the Lunder Foundation could most effectively help MECA and its students. She said the gift of money for financial aid “is the most important investment any donor can make to a college education. It secures the promise of equal opportunities for all students.” Goetting said the college will begin the legwork of the strategic planning process right away. The strategic plan will address several areas of priority, including a comprehensive fundraising campaign that will include the match for the Lunder gift. In a statement, Peter Lunder said: “We are pleased to support MECA’s efforts to make higher education accessible to students regardless of their financial situation through this new gift to the Lunder Scholars fund. Offering opportunity to a wide spectrum of students who bring both academic and artistic strengths and diverse cultural perspectives is central to our mission.” Bob Keyes can be contacted at 791-6457 or at: [email protected] Twitter: pphbkeyes Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"By María Carla Chicuén November 22, 2018 03:08 AM Florida International University has always been an epicenter of the Cuban heritage in our community. Since our opening day in 1972, FIU has welcomed one of the greatest concentrations of students and faculty of Cuban origin in the country, and gained international recognition in the field of Cuban studies. Today, the Cuban spirit continues to thrive at the university. FIU is proud to offer more than 70 courses related to Cuba across more than 20 disciplines, spanning the humanities and social sciences, the natural sciences, law, architecture and medicine. Indeed, FIU draws upon the expertise of the largest nucleus of specialists on Cuba of any university in the United States — over 50 faculty members representing most academic disciplines. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. Since 1991, moreover, the Cuban Research Institute at FIU has stood at the forefront of interdisciplinary teaching, research and public programming focused on Cuba and its diaspora. Through the generosity of numerous donors, the FIU library and museums have accumulated important Cuban collections ranging from Cuban genealogy materials to memorabilia, art and music. The FIU Library, for example, is home to the renowned Díaz Ayala Cuban and Latin American Popular Music Collection, the most extensive publicly available collection of Cuban music in the United States. The Enrique Hurtado de Mendoza Collection also holds thousands of unpublished family genealogies and manuscripts, now available in digital format worldwide. At the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum at FIU, the Darlene M. and Jorge M. Pérez Collection features works by many of the best-known masters of Cuban art. All of these contributions have helped position FIU as a major resource on Cuban art, music, history and family genealogy. In 2015, under the leadership of President Mark B. Rosenberg, FIU envisioned a dedicated space to harness these outstanding resources and all scholarly and cultural activity related to Cuba. Agustín Arellano, Sr. — now Chairman of the CasaCuba Board of Advisors — was the first to join the president in this vision. Together, they recruited a group of prominent community members to form a board and fuel the creation of a center, right on FIU´s campus, that would preserve the Cuban heritage, celebrate the contributions of Cubans from around the world, and gather top scholars for the study of Cuba. A place where our children, and their children, will learn about the history of our island and our cultural traditions. A hub of resources for the community to advance our education and professions. A meeting place for conferences, exhibitions, and artistic performances. The most consequential, global think tank focused on Cuba and the Cuban people. That vision is CasaCuba. We are so energized by the progress we have made already. FIU has granted CasaCuba a choice piece of land for an iconic center, right at the entrance of our main campus, on 107th Avenue. We have also begun our fundraising campaign to finance the design and construction of the facility. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and Ray Rodríguez, Vice-Chairman of the CasaCuba Board of Advisors, provided seed funding, and the Arellano Family recently honored us with a gift of 1 million dollars. Even before our facility is built, CasaCuba will launch programs across the areas of education, research, public discussion, and the arts. We are also planning a festival to help the community preserve and understand the historical value of personal objects related to the Cuban experience. Through future initiatives, we hope to reach and connect Cuban diasporas from around the world and engage not just Cubans, but everyone with a passion or interest in Cuba. The magnitude of our dream to build CasaCuba can only be matched by our conviction in our capacity to achieve it. No other university can claim FIU´s expertise in Cuba scholarship, or FIU´s commitment to preserving the Cuban heritage. Yet, to make our dream a reality, we need your help. The door of CasaCuba is open. Please join us and share your ideas to shape our programming and the scope of our facility. Contribute your talent and time through participation in one of our board committees.Donate through our website, casacuba.fiu.edu, or get in touch with us through casacuba@fiu.edu if you have an interest in making a major, legacy gift towards our fundraising campaign. I hope that today you will consider becoming a founding member of CasaCuba, and helping FIU build an inspiring and inclusive second home for the Cuban community and beyond. María Carla Chicuén is the Executive Director of FIU’s CasaCuba. View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"On Wednesday, Nov. 21, President Mark B. Rosenberg sent the following message to the FIU community: Dear FIU family, This has been a November to remember! With Thanksgiving fast approaching, we will finally have a well-deserved moment to pause, reflect and appreciate our many blessings. FIU remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. This semester, you’ve shown tremendous strength and optimism that’s given us an incredible burst of energy and taken our efforts to the next level. These past few weeks are proof of our impact! Here are a few highlights: • Student success: Recently, PBS News Hour brought us national recognition for our innovative, groundbreaking student success efforts in this era of performance funding. FIU will now be helping drive change at other institutions as a part of an Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) initiative called Powered by the Publics: Scaling Student Success. • Celebrating our alumni and faculty: Last weekend, our Torch Awards came home! We celebrated the achievements of our alumni and faculty who are charting new courses in their professions and our community – and reflect the incredible opportunities our FIU provides! It was a spectacular evening full of pride and music, during which Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Sam Moore sang a wonderful rendition of the Beatles’ “Imagine.” • Cybersecurity: FIU is an international research and education hub for cybersecurity. That’s why we were selected as a partner to host the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Conference. Earlier this month we wrapped up a very successful conference that brought together cybersecurity workforce developers, federal and state government leaders, education and training providers to help build the cybersecurity workforce. Our commitment to cybersecurity doesn’t end there. On November 8, we welcomed 200 girls from seven different Miami-Dade schools for “IBMCyberDay4Girls,” a one-day conference that educates young women about cybersecurity. • Leadership: In January, our Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine will celebrate another milestone moment when we welcome Dr. Robert Sackstein as the new dean! Dr. Sackstein comes to us from Harvard Medical School and is going to build on the strong foundation put in place by founding dean Dr. John Rock. That’s not all! Our professional staff is also being recognized for their efforts. FIU Vice President and Chief Information Officer Robert Grillo received the Hispanic IT Executive Council (HITEC) Top 100 award. The HITEC recognizes influential and notable Hispanic professionals who are making a difference in the technology industry. • Research: Our research is changing lives. Years after he lost his hand in a traumatic accident, a hand amputee can “feel” again, thanks to technology FIU engineers have developed. This incredible system was developed by Dr. Ranu Jung and her Adaptive Neural Systems Laboratory team. • Community Engagement: We’re more connected to our community than ever! We earned national designation as an Innovation and Economic Prosperity University by the APLU for our commitment to talent and workforce development; innovation and technology-based economic development; and community engagement. Recently, our Office of Engagement partnered with Forward Cities to host their annual meeting, in which 300 leaders from more than 30 cities across the U.S. gathered to learn more about Miami’s joined efforts to create innovation and economic growth. • Strengthening Partnerships: Our partnership with North Miami is going strong! We recently hosted the North Miami Brewfest – which started as a project led by FIU students. This event not only includes educational seminars that reveal the science behind brewing, but also connects our students to hands-on experience and the chance to network with leading craft brewers. • Arts: We’re bringing world-class art, culture and entertainment to our community. Our School of Music just completed a successful 2018 FIU Music Festival. We held our 32nd annual Festival of the Trees exhibit and auction, benefiting our Interior Architecture Department. Our FIU Theatre students are in the middle of a fantastic season of shows. Our Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum has several exhibitions you’re not going to want to miss! And more than a dozen students are gaining first-hand experience during Art Basel! • Athletics: FIU football has had another record-breaking season. Our Panthers are on the hunt for a conference championship! We’re also bowl eligible for the second year in a row! Please join us for the final game of the regular season on Saturday, November 24 at noon. FIU’s volleyball team has also had a successful season – after qualifying for the C-USA Tournament for the first time since 2015 and earning its most wins in the regular season since 2011! We can certainly be thankful for this meaningful work that is having a positive impact on our community! And there’s so much good yet to come. One of the most joyous times of year is right around the corner. In December, we will celebrate the accomplishments of more than 4,200 students who will graduate in 10 ceremonies. There is no better reminder of who we are and why we are here! I look forward to sharing more with you in my New Year’s letter. Until then, Rosalie and I wish you a Thanksgiving filled with peace and joy. Sincerely, Mark B. Rosenberg President If you're new here, you may want to subscribe to our newsletter.
