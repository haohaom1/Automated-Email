Fixed income electronic trading specialist MarketAxess has said its Open Trading platform reached a new monthly record in January, shortly after reporting record quarterly activity at the end of last year. Open Trading set a new monthly trading record of $45.5 billion in January, while overall trading volumes at MarketAxess also set a new record of $176.5 billion in the first month of the year. Open Trading’s monthly record follows its quarterly record, set in the fourth quarter of 2018, where volumes surged 96% year-on-year to $118 million. “The record January trading volumes are a great sign that market participants are finding increased value from the platform in a variety of market environments,” said Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess. “Market conditions reversed in January from the fourth quarter with investors increasing exposure to credit products and credit spreads narrowing,” Open Trading is an all-to-all platform that allows buy- and sell-side firms to connect anonymously through a central network to improve liquidity and reduce transaction costs. Speaking to investors on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call, Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess, said that Open Trading volumes grew rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients “embrace the platform” as an important source of new liquidity. Also on the earnings call was industry veteran Chris Concannon, who recently departed Cboe Global Markets and was appointed chief operating officer at MarketAxess. He told investors that the fourth quarter was challenging for clients in credit markets, which is one of the reasons market participants were leaning on the Open Trading platform. “That execution quality that MarketAxess is delivering is an opportunity to drive more business to the company’s platform as clients become more educated about the superior execution quality. The prices that clients are achieving are setting the standard for best execution in the fixed income market,” Concannon said. New monthly records were also set in US high-grade, US high-yield, emerging markets and Eurobond trading volumes at MarketAxess in January. « FactSet expands data ecosystem with IHS Markit March 6, 2019Webinar

1053951,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"No Results No Results Nick Mulcahy February 07, 2019 A big issue in prostate cancer is differentiating patients with an aggressive tumor that needs immediate treatment from patients with lower-risk disease that may never spread and can be managed with active surveillance. One test that addresses this problem is the 4Kscore (Opko Health), a blood test that predicts the likelihood of having a high-grade prostate cancer after an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result. However, this test has received a ""noncoverage"" determination from a Medicare administrative contractor, according to a report in the South Florida Business Journal. The Medicare contractor, Novitas Solutions, said they found flaws with clinical studies of the test. Opko will appeal the decision with the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the report added. More than 12,000 practicing physicians have ordered the 4Kscore test, according to the company. 4Kscore is an assay panel that combines three PSA measures (total, free, and intact) with another prostate-specific measure, human kallikrein 2, in an algorithm that takes into account a patient's age, digital rectal examination result, and previous biopsy status. The test reportedly helps distinguish men who are at higher risk for aggressive disease from those at lower risk, possibly aiding in personal decisions to undergo biopsy. Novitas, which acts as stand-in for Medicare and makes coverage decisions in 10 states and Washington, DC, issued a proposed ruling that Medicare should not reimburse for the 4Kscore in May 2018. Last week, the test manufacturer said that Novitas set March 20 as the date that the noncoverage determination goes into effect, according to the South Florida Business Journal. ""We remain committed to our goal of widespread and affordable access to 4Kscore,"" said Phillip Frost, CEO of Opko. In an apparently unrelated matter, Frost recently agreed to a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil case related to ""lucrative market manipulation schemes"" worth $27 million, per CNBC. The new Medicare ruling may come as a surprise to clinicians who have followed the story of the blood test. In 2014, 4Kscore investigator Daniel Lin, MD, from the University of Washington in Seattle, told Medscape Medical News that ""this is a test that can personalize the risk of having a clinically relevant prostate cancer that deserves diagnosis."" In 2015, Medscape urology expert commentator Gerald Chodak, MD, highlighted the fact that the American Medical Association has issued a CPT (current procedural technology) code rating of level I for the test, ""which means that it is likely that insurance companies and Medicare will find the test more acceptable for reimbursement in the future."" Chodak said the 4Kscore test ""clearly is better"" than traditional PSA testing in identifying men at risk for high-grade disease before biopsy. However, he also said that one of the test's shortcomings is that ""it misses in the range of 10% to 18% of potentially high-risk cancers.""

1015016,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"520 Park Avenue and Arthur Zeckendorf Two more $30 million-plus penthouses at Zeckendorf Development’s 520 Park Avenue closed over the past week, continuing a string of closings at the luxury tower. One nearly 4,600-square-foot simplex sold to an anonymous buyer for $32 million, according to a record filed Thursday with the city’s finance department. It was being offered for $39.5 million, according to the condominium’s offering plan. And late last week, former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and his wife Jennifer dropped $30.1 million on another penthouse, Mansion Global reported. The closings come amid several recent buys at the 33-unit condominium that started closing last September. In January, an anonymous buyer shelled out $32.4 million for a penthouse that spans roughly 4,600 square feet. The purchase price represented a 23 percent discount from its offering. But another closing that month marked one of the priciest deals to kick off the year. Another anonymous buyer, “CJFGK, LLC,” bought a duplex for just over $64 million. Other prominent buyers include James Dyson, founder of the vacuum company that bears his name, who bought a penthouse for $73.8 million. Meanwhile investment banker Ken Moelis snapped up another in November for $62 million. The developer recently moved to split the tower’s $130 million triplex penthouse in two, falling in line with other developers that have done the same in the past. The simplex’s offering price is $40 million, and the duplex’s is between $80 million and $100 million.

Mr. Diamond, 67, had been one of the rumored buyers at the Midtown Manhattan limestone building, and he, along with his wife, Jennifer, have now closed on their $30.1 million purchase. More: Billionaire Steve Cohen Lists Second NYC Mega-Condo in a Month No details on his new condo were readily available. The tower, designed by Robert A.M. Stern and developed by Zeckendorf Development, is becoming one of the most exclusive condominiums in Manhattan, as its big-ticket closings gradually reveal the host of high-net worth individuals that have bought apartments in the 54-story building. In fact, the most expensive sale in Manhattan in 2018 was in the tower, according to StreetEasy data. The $73.8 million penthouse reportedly sold to British billionaire inventor James Dyson in November. In the same month, prominent Wall Streeter Ken Moelis snapped up another penthouse in the building for $62 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile last week, a $64.25 million duplex penthouse sold at the building to an unknown buyer. From Penta: Is Whiskey a Legitimate Investing Opportunity?

It has over 15,000 square feet of amenity space, including a club room, a fitness center with a pool, exercise rooms, a treatment room, a sauna and steam rooms and a children’s playroom. Guest suites, wine cellar and storage are also available for purchase, according to the building’s website.

1015016,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Daniel Davies 29 January 2019 If you're looking for gems of insight into what goes on at the very top levels of a slightly dysfunctional investment bank when the pressure is on, the Barclays trial is a trove of treasures. One of the clearest takeaways is that the very richest of the rich bankers get that way because, as well as going the extra mile to get key transactions done, they never lose sight of the need to make sure they get paid themselves. In the immediate aftermath of the shareholder vote approving the controversial Qatar investment, BarCap’s Roger Jenkins sent a stream of consciousness internal email making his case and divulging the inner workings of his brain. It’s possible to piece together the whole text from various news reports: “So vote goes thru. This capital did the trick why can’t varley diamond go to renco and say we need to make a special payment for this endeavour now. It was not his job no one else in the organization or at any other bank except credit suisse did this. Did it four times this year to save our arses and jobs guys you know the sell! If not what is the plan” There’s a lot to decipher here; Mr Jenkins was clearly from the school of thought that saw email as an informal means of communication. But the context makes it clear and pretty easy to translate. The message is topped and tailed with the request for action “Why can’t [John] Varley [and Bob] Diamond go to Renco [typo for RemCo, the remuneration committee]” leads to “Guys, you know the sell! If not, what is the plan?” This will be familiar to a lot of us – Jenkins is writing to his immediate boss, Rich Ricci, and asking him to enlist the two even bigger bosses in making a case (the “sell”) for him to the committee that makes the decisions about his pay. Since Bob Diamond was the overall head of Barclays Capital and John Varley the group CEO, this is interesting in itself as it suggests that the committee was not a rubber stamp and needed to be persuaded; at this level, the bonus cheques are so big that even the chief executive can’t sign them off on his own. In between the two, we have some standard-issue banker boasting which will also be recognised, in style if not in size, by many. Big up your successes - “save[d] our arses and jobs”. Make comparisons to the competition, both external – “any other bank except Credit Suisse” and internal – “no one else in the organisation”. The only slightly false note is “It was not his [that is, Robert Jenkins’] job”. If you’re a middle ranking VP then it’s OK to point out when you’re going outside your role and title, but at this level of seniority one might have expected that people might see the big picture and volunteer to work on survival capital issues to save the whole bank without demanding extra credit for doing so. In any case, it appears that RemCo accepted the “sell” and a “special payment for this endeavour” was made, of £25m (around $40m at the prevailing rate). It’s quite unusual for an individual banker to be given a special commission on a single deal, outside the normal bonus cycle. But then, nothing about the Barclays/Qatar transaction seems to have been normal. The situation between Andrea Orcel and Santander is also a long way from normal. The latest development seems to be that he is considering suing the bank for his lost UBS compensation. At the time when the job move first fell through, many of us were surprised that Orcel seemed to have made the elementary mistake of resigning without having established all the remuneration details in writing, but it appears that he was in possession of a contractual letter and therefore believes himself to have a strong case. Even so, this is an unusual move and a rather paradoxical one. The main reason to sue would be that Mr Orcel expects to take another job in banking; otherwise, consistent with the non-compete details of the UBS deferred compensation scheme, he could sit at home and collect the money, without paying lawyers’ fees. Then again, if he wants to get another banking job, employers are likely to be put off someone who brings litigators into an HR dispute, particularly when the party that they’re suing is that single biggest client relationship on which their investment banking career was based. Perhaps he intends to use the lawsuit proceeds to start up Orcel & Co? Where do you go to from the top levels of investment banking? Sometimes, into the top levels of executive recruitment. Miles Millard, one of the senior Deutsche bankers shaken out by the last Cryan reorganisation, will be leading business development at JD Haspel (Financial News) A variation on the “Marathon, not a sprint” cliche; David Solomon gives an interview comparing Goldman Sachs to an NBA basketball team, and saying the difference is that Goldman judges its performance over a Soviet-style five year plan rather than after every game (Business Insider) Shifting squares on the organogram at JP Morgan’s European investment bank, as David Lomer is moved from EMEA M&A to co-head of the UK franchise and Dwayne Lysaght goes from UK M&A to the EMEA head, among other moves (Financial News) A real nightmare story as the housekeeper of Warren Stephens (founder of the eponymous Arkansas-based Stephens Inc) was stuck in the elevator of Mr Stephens’ New York townhouse for 72 hours. (BBC) The latest HackerRank survey of trends in software development skills and recruitment is out (Venturebeat) Just in case you were worrying; LVMH have stockpiled champagne and cognac in UK warehouses, so there need be no Brexit-related interruptions to supply (Bloomberg) Or if your lifestyle is less exciting, a New York startup is promising to improve “al desko” office lunches (Bloomberg) And researchers at Columbia University have managed to process brain waves into intelligible speech. It’s not necessarily “a step closer to reading your mind” as the headline says, but it gives some hope for patients who had lost their own voices through injury or illness.

1016437,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Head of Performance says internal competition can be positive After a year that yielded just seven wins and saw their leaders underperform on nearly every front, changes were needed at Dimension Data. Step forward Rolf Aldag, who alongside Douglas Ryder, were the men with the plan to kickstart a struggling team that had fallen to the lower echelons of the WorldTour.Related ArticlesDimension Data finalise 2019 rosterDimension Data to wear Assos kit in 2019Dimension Data 'guarantee' Tafi will not race Paris-Roubaix with themValgren: Dimension Data will shoot with one missile, hopefully that will be meDimension Data to make Hammer Series debutO'Connor sets sights on Green Mountain at Tour of Oman The challenges facing Aldag and the rest of the management at Dimension Data were huge. For one, they had endured a season in which their frontline of Mark Cavendish, Louis Meintjes, Steve Cummings and Edvald Boasson Hagen had failed to produce a single WorldTour win between them. A drop in performance from their leaders only highlighted the lack of depth within the rest of the team, and without the two stage wins at the Vuelta a España, courtesy of Ben King, the team would have gone an entire season without tasting WorldTour success. Throw into the mix a lack of fit and experienced captains, riders calling out the team's equipment in public, a star sprinter out of contract, and a responsibility to support African talent, and Dimension Data’s task looked insurmountable. ""Most of all we needed stability in our racing,"" Aldag told Cyclingnews during a series of conversations during the off-season that started in September and ran until late November. ""So last year we'd have maybe Edvald in a race, but the rest of the guys were a bit more random. We needed to get to a point where we had five or six stable guys. If you have some jokers, that's fine, but you need to be able to predict the results from your riders more."" At times, Dimension Data appeared to be racing with one hand tied behind their back in 2018. With Cavendish on the tarmac more than on the podium, Eisel out injured and Cummings pushed and pulled from race to race, the team was stretched too thinly. The first task was to solidify their core in the transfer market. With roughly half the roster out of contract, the management at least had wiggle room to invest. They targeted the highly talented Michael Valgren almost as soon as they heard that the Dane was on the market, while Roman Kreuziger and Enrico Gasparotto followed 'officially' after the Tour de France. While one could point to the fact that all signings filled the podium at Amstel Gold Race last year, the reality is that they provide very different skillsets. In Valgren - a rider Aldag had been keeping close tabs on for three years - the team has a rider who can perform on a number of terrains and who could be future a world champion if his ride at the Innsbruck Worlds last year is anything to go by. Kreuziger comes with the ability to compete in one-day races, but also provides much-needed mountain support to Meintjes in Grand Tours. Gasparotto - although nearer the end of his career than the start - gives the team another communication channel within the peloton and takes pressure off the directors when it comes to issuing instructions to the less experienced riders. ""The quality on the bike and leadership have come up another level. Michael is still young, but he knows what he wants. Roman is definitely a guy who is one of the most professional riders I've ever met. He really is one of the role models of professional cycling. That really helps,"" Aldag says. The team's second row was also strengthened. Danilo Wyss and Lars Bak - who Aldag knew from his Highroad days - are two highly underrated domestiques, while the move for Giacomo Nizzolo provided both extra cover in the sprints and a fresh pair of legs for Cavendish in the lead-out. The team also looked at Niki Terpstra, but a deal couldn't be reached. ""Giacomo is definitely a sprinter, not just a lead-out guy, and we want to see how far he gets. He's had difficult times, but I see them in multiple ways. He was leading out for John Degenkolb most of the time at Trek, and when he was sprinting he was mostly alone. ""Look at Viviani at Sky,"" Aldag says as a way of comparison. ""He was a good rider - no one ever questioned that. But he also didn't win 18 races at Sky. And then suddenly he comes into an environment where they look after sprinters, they have a plan, they give him a chance and build a train around him. So, I think Giacomo wants to prove himself, and he has a team that believes in him. But first, we need to help him recover from his knee injury."" It's unlikely Nizzolo can match the winning streak that Viviani produced in 2018. He's not the Olympic Omnium champion, and, with all due respect, Dimension Data is not a lead-out force in the same bracket as QuickStep. But as Aldag points out, Nizzolo picked up more WorldTour points in two months of the 2018 season than Dimension Data did in the first half of the season. He is ultimately an improvement. Another important element in the recruitment drive was the hunt for crucial ranking points. Given that Dimension Data have regularly struggled when it comes to the GC at races, and that the UCI's points system is tilted towards the overall standings in races rather than sprints, the team was always struggling to keep up with squads decked with top-10 regulars. ""Only a few teams can pay for the second row of winners,"" Aldag says. ""The rest of the teams live and die by their captains, but you also need to look at the UCI system. If they had enforced the relegation system, we'd have been out the last three years. Valgren had more points last year than we did as a team."" If points are the currency of success within modern cycling, then Dimension Data's desired aim of developing African talent remains their dream. However, reality can be harsh, and the simple fact is that the team has not been able to produce consistent performers from their home continent. The numbers back this up. In 2015, in the team's final season at Pro Continental level, the squad signed 24 riders, from which nine were South African, while a further five were from other African nations. Fast forward to 2019 and the roster has grown by three, yet there is one less South African and only one rider from another African nation. It's a delicate matter, and few professional teams work as hard as Dimension Data at establishing roots within a home community and provide a charitable outlet as a result. For that, the team should certainly be applauded. ""Our big focus is Qhubeka, but we have to support them by showing quality in races and not just quantity,"" Aldag says. However, idealism doesn't reward a team with ranking points and security. And for all the goodwill, there simply isn't enough time for the team to bring through as many African riders as they perhaps would like. For all the sport has done to globalise itself, it's still incredibly difficult, even from a logistical point of view, to secure visas for African riders at races such as the Tour Down Under or the Tour of California, for example. However, Aldag justifies the team's stance with the fact that a win for the team will always lead to greater rewards for the Qhubeka cause. ""We can't say out of principle that we'll have 50 per cent African riders. There is a need for points, the need to perform on the road, but also the need to perform for Qhubeka. If we go to the Tour with a full African team, there would be some really nice stories, but after stage 1, it's all about how you do against the other riders. The next story would be on the rest day and about how we have some guys still fighting to survive until Paris. ""But if you look at 2016, Cavendish won and wore yellow. He donated and auctioned his first ever yellow jersey, which was good to donate 260 bikes for Qhubeka. You can put that in numbers. Every time we win a bike race, you see a spike in donations. Get into the headlines, then bring your message."" Away from the new signings, the team were desperate to keep hold of Eisel, even with his advancing years and the uncertainty after his early-season head injury last year. Mark Renshaw was also given a new deal, while the future over Cavendish remained unclear until the late winter. The sprinter's plans were linked to Eisel, and there was genuine talk of a move that would have taken the pair to Bahrain-Merida. Although the Bahrain-Merida management were somewhat lukewarm on the idea - they had already signed Phil Bauhaus - they held two spots for the sprinter and the Austrian in case their new sponsor, McLaren, pushed for the pair to form part of the company's wider sponsorship commitments. Aldag played no part in the Cavendish negotiations, but the German was always keen on the sprinter remaining within Dimension Data. However, by the point at which a deal was finally struck, most of Dimension Data's budget had been soaked up in the pursuit of other transfers - such as Valgren - but Aldag was keen for everyone, including Cavendish, to move in the same direction. As far as Aldag was concerned, re-signing Cavendish was only part of the puzzle when it came to improving the team. ""Absolutely, and Bernie was one of the most important riders we re-signed. Internally, the riders look up to him and I think we're going to have to figure a way over time of finding a replacement. He gives all his know-how and passes it on. ""When it came to Mark, it was between him, Douglas and Dimension Data. But we know that there were alternatives for Mark and the team. So, ultimately, there was a lot of waiting from both sides. Did he want to change team and were there going to be changes in the team? So that's why it took so long - to make sure it made sense for both sides."" Cavendish wasn't the only star the team looked to rally around as the new season approached. Louis Meintjes was given a substantial contract to re-join the team from UAE Team Emirates at the end of 2017, but his first season back was an unmitigated disaster. The South African finished inside the top 10 in just one stage race he started, while his two Grand Tour efforts in Italy and Spain resulted in a DNF and 58th overall. Aldag admits that collective mistakes were made throughout the year and that the team effectively tried to alter an already successful formula with new methods in relation to the rider’s training and race programme. Too much time was spent at altitude camps, racing blocks were too long and too demanding, and by the time Meintjes was meant to hit peak form, he was drained. ""I think his preparation was too ambitious,"" Aldag admits after a year of hard knocks for the 26-year-old. ""He had a super-positive attitude and knew where he wanted to kick ass. And there was this mentality of doing everything 20 per cent better, and that would result in a podium at a Grand Tour or even two Grand Tours. And because of that, I think it was overdone. He should have started slower and not gone too extreme. And that was not just his own mistake but also the team's. ""He went to altitude training above 3,000m and came back super light. He did Algarve, Tirreno, Catalunya, and went to altitude again, but we didn't really give him the chance to recover. Then he went straight into the Tour of the Alps and then straight into recon for the Giro mountain stages. It was too much, too ambitious."" On stage 1 of the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana on Wednesday, Edvald Boasson Hagen took a shock win. It was the Norwegian's first time trial victory outside of a national title since the Tour of Qatar in 2016. With the fact that the UCI’s ranking system now rolls over points from 2018, and has incorporated races outside of the WorldTour, Dimension Data are on far more stable ground. Cavendish is building up slowly in South America, Valgren is racing without pressure, and the rest of the team are waiting in the wings for their opportunities. The new depth within the team, coupled with the chance to wipe the slate clean and start again, is clearly paying off. ""If you look at our signings, they are multi-talented. Valgren can win a stage at the Tour de France and Kreuziger can also win at big races,"" says Aldag. ""What does work is a little bit of internal competition, in a positive way. At Highroad, when Andre Greipel won in Paris-Nice, you could bet your life Cav would win the next day in Tirreno. It's not racing against each other - it's just getting more out of it and lifting team spirit. The race programme is so heavy - we race around 280 days or something - that you want to be present and competitive in multiple events at one time, and then we can add up our resources and bundle them together for the really important stuff. I think we can be competitive now in multiple events.""

1011008,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"February 1, 2019 At a time when competition for federal grant funding has never been greater, Colby College has established the Pulver Science Scholars Program, designed to create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue research at the nation’s top biomedical laboratories. Trustee David Pulver and his wife, Carol, made the $5-million commitment to help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health. The program will provide selected students with a set of experiences to prepare them to be scientific leaders and innovators. Working in tandem with the recently launched Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the Pulver Science Scholars Program will fund and facilitate high-level student research with Colby faculty at places like The Jackson Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, among others. After a research experience at The Jackson Laboratory as a student, Jocelyn Thomas ’16 is now a full-time research assistant at the leading biomedical research institution. For the first time in the post-World War II era, the federal government no longer funds the majority of the basic research done in the U.S. Federal funding dipped to just 44 percent of the research dollars awarded in 2015, down from more than 70 percent in the 1960s and ’70s. By training the most talented science students, the program will have a positive impact on potential life-saving discoveries and cures that could otherwise be delayed. “Funding challenges for research labs have led to constraints on research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students,” said Colby President David A. Greene. “These research assistantships are critical learning experiences for science students and are essential to scientists’ ability to make life-altering discoveries that could have immediate impacts on human health. The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders.” The Pulver Science Scholars Program will provide funding for science research by training the most promising liberal arts undergraduates to work alongside—and eventually become—world-class scientists tackling pressing health challenges such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Adding to Colby’s well-established undergraduate research program, Pulver Scholars will be given the opportunity, often in their first year, to work collaboratively with Colby science faculty. Students will ultimately join top research teams in the fields of biology, chemistry, biochemistry, computer science, statistics, computational biology, and other relevant disciplines. Research scientists report that funding challenges have restricted the number of research assistants they can employ. This program establishes a direct pathway that will supply a steady stream of high-achieving, well-trained students to ensure the productivity of important research labs. David Pulver, who graduated from Colby in 1963 and went on to run major national clothing brands, was inspired to establish the program by his own experience with bladder cancer. Pulver, cancer free for ten years, is the author, with his sister Fran and the expert guidance of Mark Schoenberg, M.D., of a guide for bladder-cancer patients. He sees the cross-disciplinary education offered at Colby as key to achieving significant progress on cancer and other public health challenges. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” said David Pulver. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” The program’s investments in scientific exploration will capitalize on Colby’s recent upgrades in high performance computing infrastructure, aided by a grant from the National Science Foundation. As medical research becomes increasingly data-driven, students must be able to work efficiently with large, complex data sets in rapidly evolving scientific fields. Pulver Scholars will have the tools and analytical skills necessary to achieve high levels of performance, reliability, and predictability for science applications. In addition to on- and off-campus research opportunities, the Pulver Science Scholars Program will fund a network-in-residence program to bring industry leaders to campus to engage and collaborate with the scholars. Events designed to build intellectual exchange and collaboration among the Pulver Science Scholars will also be offered. In 2018, Colby announced the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, which supports programs for students to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. A year earlier, the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change was established at Colby to support internships, research, and global experiences in issues broadly related to climate disruption. These initiatives, including the Pulver Science Scholars Program, support ongoing efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. Founded in 1813, Colby is one of America’s most selective colleges. Serving only undergraduates, Colby offers a rigorous academic program rooted in deep exploration of ideas and close interaction with world-class faculty scholars. Students pursue intellectual passions, choosing among 58 majors or developing their own. Colby’s innovative and ambitious campaign, Dare Northward, will support deeper connections between the College and the world and a fully inclusive experience for all Colby students. Colby is home to a community of 2,000 dedicated and diverse students from more than 80 countries. Its Waterville, Maine, location provides unique access to world-class research institutions and civic engagement experiences.

The Sustainability Challenge (Wellesley STEM Expo/ Wellesley Education Foundation) welcomes submissions by K-12 students who are residents of Wellesley and/ or enrolled at Wellesley Public Schools. The challenge asks students to work of a project promoting a local resource, policy or behavior change that makes Wellesley greener; this can be in the form of an advertisement, op-ed or essay, video commercial, infographic, poem, music or another form of audio/visual artwork — convince your audience that it’s a great way for them to help the environment. Furthermore, each entry must explain the problem that a current local resource or policy in Wellesley, or a behavior change you are proposing, aims to help solve. The entry must provide a convincing argument for the positive impact this resource or activity can make. Here are some questions to answer: • What environmental problems does this organization/resource/behavior change help solve? Provide data or examples of how the environment is negatively impacted by this problem. • What is the positive impact of your topic? How does it help solve the problem? Be as specific and concrete as possible. • What can Wellesley residents do to help or how can they participate? Convince them this resource deserves their support or participation. Last year students submitted projects that included green energy such as solar and wind power, devised ways by which to reduce pollution, recycle and reduce our carbon footprint. This years key organizers include Kelly Caiazzo and Naglaa El-Abbadi and Jessica Stanton. When asked why this is important — both the Sustainability Challenge and the environment, Caiazzo said, “the challenges our environment faces can feel pretty grim, whether it’s plastic in our oceans or gas leaks right here in our town. It’s important not just to cultivate awareness of the problems, but to highlight potential solutions. We wanted a Sustainability Challenge that would encourage students in Wellesley to learn more about existing environmental practises in town, or about behavior changes people can make. We hope students of all ages in Wellesley will learn the importance of protecting our environment, and also know that many organizations in Wellesley are working towards positive change and could use their help. Whatever students care about most, there are likely organizations right here in town that they could join or work with. As environmentalists, we don’t have to work alone; we’re stronger together! We hope this Sustainability Challenge will inspire students and their families to get involved.” “There are many changes and habits that individuals, families and the community as a whole can make that together add up to great benefits for the environment,” El-Abbadi said. “Our town is fortunate to have great people and resources dedicated to programs such as transitioning to renewable energy, environmental food programs, diverting organic waste to compost or biofuel, reducing pesticide use, and many others. By highlighting these Sustainable Wellesley initiatives as part of the WEF Sustainability Challenge, we hope to channel the ingenuity of our students to bring these issues into focus in creative and engaging ways, as well as empower them to recognize the positive differences they can make through their own sustainability-oriented behaviors.” “Wellesley has always considered itself to be a leader in many areas — including in education and care for the environment,” Stanton, a longtime proponent of Wellesley-sustainability said. “WEF’s Sustainability Challenge creates a link between the two and provides students with an opportunity for truly creative, out of the box thinking about how and why our town and residents care about the natural world. Students these days are growing up under the cloud of climate change and that can be fairly scary. This challenge allows them to understand how they can participate in the solution and highlights that small changes in thinking and behavior can add up to some pretty substantial impact and encourages others to be part of the solution too.” Sustainability Challenge finalists will be recognized and awarded at Wellesley STEM Expo on April 6.

1053951,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"By Maria Di Mento A roundup of notable gifts compiled by the Chronicle: Marilyn Hohbach gave $25 million through her Harold C. and Marilyn A. Hohbach Foundation to establish a research center focused on the university’s archive of more than 300 collections related to the history and development of Silicon Valley. The money will also be used to endow the Silicon Valley Archive program and create new classrooms and spaces for group study, seminars, events, and exhibitions. Hohbach is the widow of Harold Hohbach, a patent attorney and prominent real-estate developer in Palo Alto, who died in 2017. Brett and Louise Samsky donated $11 million to create the Samsky Invasive Cardiovascular Services Center. Brett Samsky is chief executive of Credigy, a financial firm in Atlanta. He has been a Piedmont Atlanta Hospital patient over the years and underwent heart surgery there several years ago. The couple gave the organization $6 million in 2015 to establish the Samsky Advanced Heart Failure Center at Piedmont Heart Institute. Phillip and Patricia Frost pledged $10 million to endow the dermatology department that will be named the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. Phillip Frost leads OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He previously founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, a generic-drug manufacturer that he sold to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 for $7.4 billion. A physician by training, he completed his residency at the university’s Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. The Frosts have been giving to the university since 1989. In 2016 they gave $100 million for applied sciences and engineering, and they have appeared on the Chronicle’s Philanthropy 50 list of big donors several times since 2003. Charles Phipps committed $5 million to endow the Charles H. Phipps Dean at the Case School of Engineering. Phipps is partner emeritus at Sevin Rosen Funds, a venture-capital firm in Dallas. He earned a degree in electrical engineering from the Case Institute of Technology in 1949 and worked at Texas Instruments for 30 years, eventually becoming the director of strategy. He has been a longtime donor to the university and in 2011 gave $2 million to establish the Phipps Endowment Fund, which supports the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. John and Susan Sobrato donated $5 million to help pay for the construction of a new medical office building, to be called the Sobrato Pavilion, which is expected to open in the fall. The Sobratos founded Sobrato Development Company, a commercial real estate and development firm in Palo Alto, Calif. They have given extensively to nonprofits in the Silicon Valley region with a focus on helping low-income families and providing rent-free office space to local charities. They appeared on the Philanthropy 50 in 2106. Joel and Gail Morrison Morganroth gave $5 million for the Sky Garden, a vertical garden and visitor-services building that will house a stormwater-management system and generate energy to power the organization’s renovation efforts. Joel Morganroth is a cardiologist who founded the company that became eResearchTechnology, or ERT, a medical data and technology corporation. Gail Morganroth is a nephrologist who serves as vice dean for education at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.

1023719,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Rama K. Ramaswamy Wellesley has a unique and longstanding history of environmental conservation. For example, Wellesley is the longest running Tree City USA community in Massachusetts and boasts 26 miles of marked trails interconnecting open spaces and conservation lands. The idea that humans cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around them has often been the focal point of discussion by conservationists such as Jane Goodall and members of Wellesley Green Schools (WGS) alike. ""Wellesley has always considered itself to be a leader in many areas - including in education and care for the environment,” explained Jessica Stanton, a longtime WGS member and one of the founders of the Sustainability Challenge. “WEF’s [Wellesley Education Foundation’s] Sustainability Challenge creates a link between the two and provides students with an opportunity for truly creative, out-of-the-box thinking about how and why our town and residents care about the natural world. Students these days are growing up under the cloud of climate change, and that can be fairly scary. This challenge allows them to understand how they can participate in the solution and highlights that small changes in thinking and behavior can add up to some pretty substantial impact and encourages others to be part of the solution, too.” Sustainability Challenge 2019 is now welcoming submissions by K-12 students who are residents of Wellesley and/or enrolled at Wellesley Public Schools. The Challenge asks students to work on a project promoting a local resource, policy or behavior change that makes Wellesley greener. This can be in the form of an advertisement, op-ed or essay, video commercial, infographic, poem, music, or another form of audio/visual artwork. Students are asked to convince their audience that it’s a great way for them to help the environment. Furthermore, each entry must explain the problem that a current local resource or policy in Wellesley, or a proposed behavioral change, aims to help solve. The entry must provide a convincing argument for the positive impact this resource or activity can make. The questions to answer in the entry are as follows: What environmental problems does this organization/resource/behavior change help solve? Provide data or examples of how the environment is negatively impacted by this problem. What is the positive impact of your topic? How does it help solve the problem? Be as specific and concrete as possible. What can Wellesley residents do to help or how can they participate? Convince them this resource deserves their support or participation. Last year, students submitted projects that included green energy, devised ways by which to reduce pollution, recycle, reduce the community’s carbon footprint, and more. “Whether wind or solar power, this is our time, this is our hour,” said 2017 Sustainability Challenge finalist Noa Lil Helmbrecht. This year's key organizers for the Sustainability Challenge also include Kelly Caiazzo and Naglaa El-Abbadi. “The challenges our environment faces can feel pretty grim, whether it’s plastic in our oceans or gas leaks right here in our town,” explained Caiazzo. “It’s important not just to cultivate awareness of the problems, but to highlight potential solutions. We wanted a Sustainability Challenge that would encourage students in Wellesley to learn more about existing environmental practices in town, or about behavior changes people can make. We hope students of all ages in Wellesley will learn the importance of protecting our environment, and also know that many organizations in Wellesley are working towards positive change and could use their help. Whatever students care about most, there are likely organizations right here in town that they could join or work with. As environmentalists, we don’t have to work alone; we’re stronger together! We hope this Sustainability Challenge will inspire students and their families to get involved"". “There are many changes and habits that individuals, families, and the community as a whole can make that together add up to great benefits for the environment,” added El-Abbadi. “Our town is fortunate to have great people and resources dedicated to programs such as transitioning to renewable energy, environmental food programs, diverting organic waste to compost or biofuel, reducing pesticide use, and many others. By highlighting these Sustainable Wellesley initiatives as part of the WEF Sustainability Challenge, we hope to channel the ingenuity of our students to bring these issues into focus in creative and engaging ways, as well as empower them to recognize the positive differences they can make through their own sustainability-oriented behaviors.” Sustainability Challenge finalists will be recognized and awarded at Wellesley STEM Expo on April 6.

1011008,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers A recent $5 million donation from David and Carol Pulver will bring experts to Mayflower Hill and finance biomedical research done by Colby College students. The first recipients of the award, selected based on high school achievement, will be members of the Class of 2024, according to the college's communications office. WATERVILLE — Ten students in each Colby College class, starting with the Class of 2024, will receive scholarship funding from the new Pulver Science Scholars Program, according to the school’s Vice President for Communications Ruth Jackson. The college announced the creation of the program along with a $5 million commitment from alumnus and trustee David Pulver and his wife, Carol, on Friday afternoon. It is designed to “help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health” by subsidizing on- and off- campus student biomedical research as well as bringing prominent experts to campus to engage with the recipients. It will not cover tuition or room and board costs, which hover around $69,400 per year, according to a pamphlet from the college. Candidates will be selected upon admission to Colby based on their demonstrated achievement in the sciences during high school. Applicants’ socioeconomic status is not a determining factor, according to Jackson. “The Pulver Science Scholars Program supports the experiences — not demonstrated financial need — for these students to attend Colby,” Jackson wrote in an email to the Morning Sentinel. All prospective students — including those admitted during early decision — will be eligible for the funds. When the program is fully rolled out in five years time, a total of 40 students will be enrolled in the Pulver Science Scholars Program, said Jackson. Colby has an annual matriculation of about 2,000. A competitive liberal arts institution, it accepted 13 percent of 12,313 first-year applicants last year, according to its Class of 2022 profile. Jackson noted that the Pulver funding is one of the college’s only merit-based awards distributed to incoming freshmen. She maintained that all of Colby’s financial aid is need-based, and the school touts a vow to meet 100 percent of accepted students’ demonstrated financial need without requiring loans. Its Presidential Scholars Program is the other main source of funds granted to first-years “based on their scholarly achievement in high school,” Jackson said. There are about 30 Presidential Scholars in each class. “It supports additional opportunities, not financial aid,” Jackson said of the Presidential Scholars Program. Recipients have access to paid fellowship opportunities with Colby faculty during their first year and can access grants of up to $3,000 during the summer of their sophomore or junior years or during a January term. The school also offers at least three merit-based scholarship programs specifically for students from underrepresented communities, including Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences, the Posse Program and the Ralph J. Bunche Scholarship Program. The Pulver Science Scholars Program is specifically science-oriented. It was created in part to combat heightened competition for federal research funding, which the college’s Friday news release noted has dropped to 44 percent of the amount awarded in 2015. Colby’s president, David Greene, stated that institutions have been able to hire fewer research assistants as a result. “The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders,” he wrote in the announcement. Pulver scholars will work with scientists at Jackson Laboratory, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory in addition to members of Colby’s faculty. The new program marks Colby’s third major financial commitment to the sciences in the past three years. In 2018, it introduced the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation — which funds biotechnology-, biomedicine-, biochemistry-, ocean sciences-, genomics- and bioinformatics-related research — and internship or travel opportunities for students during summer or January terms. In 2017, it created the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change to finance similar opportunities for students interested in climate disruption. David Pulver decided to contribute the multi-million dollar gift partially out of gratitude for the medical technology involved with his recovery from bladder cancer 10 years ago. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” said David Pulver. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” Meg Robbins — 861-9239 [email protected] Twitter: @megrobbins Send questions/comments to the editors.

1011008,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Colby College announced on Friday the creation of the Pulver Science Scholars Program, which will finance student research, helping ease competition for federal grants, and bring distinguished scientists to campus. WATERVILLE — Colby College has received a $5 million donation to support student biomedical research, marking the school’s third major financial commitment to the sciences in the past three years. Trustee and alumnus David Pulver and his wife, Carol, committed the money, which will be used to create the Pulver Science Scholars Program, according to a news release from the college Friday afternoon. The program aims to “help ensure future discovery, leading to treatments and cures in critical areas of human health.” It is unclear how many students will be able to use the money each year and when applications for the program will open. Colby currently enrolls about 2,000 undergraduate students. It consistently has been ranked as one of the nation’s top liberal arts institutions. The college noted that the biomedical science-focused program was designed in part to combat heightened competition for federal grants. “Federal funding dipped to just 44 percent of the research dollars awarded in 2015, down from more than 70 percent in the 1960s and ’70s,” the release notes. “By training the most talented science students, the program will have a positive impact on potential life-saving discoveries and cures that could otherwise be delayed.” Colby President David Greene stated that the decline in federal funding has constrained research opportunities for the college’s undergraduates, including by reducing the number of research assistants institutions are able to hire. “The Pulvers’ vision allows us to create a private solution to this serious challenge while encouraging and educating the next generation of scientific leaders,” he wrote. As part of the new program, selected students will work closely with members of the Colby science faculty and at local laboratories, including Jackson Laboratory, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory. The funds also will bring industry leaders to campus to collaborate with students. Pulver noted that his personal battle against bladder cancer 10 years ago motivated him to support students who are interested in researching treatments and cures for a range of human diseases and conditions. “Carol and I are thrilled to contribute to Colby in this way,” he said. “We know Colby will recruit remarkable students for this program and are fully confident in the College’s ability to create opportunities that will prepare them to become leaders in the scientific world.” In 2018, Colby rolled out the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, which supports research, internship and travel opportunities in the summer or January term for students pursuing careers in biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics and bioinformatics. In 2017, it introduced the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change to finance similar opportunities in fields related to climate disruption. “These initiatives, including the Pulver Science Scholars Program, support ongoing efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all regardless of their financial means,” Friday’s news release stated.

1053951,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"MIAMI, Jan. 31, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) today announced that Novitas Solutions, Inc. has issued a notice of a future non-coverage determination for the 4Kscore test® to be effective March 20, 2019. The notice released by Novitas today does not appear to be different from the draft local coverage determination released by Novitas on May 18, 2018. OPKO is evaluating options to appeal the decision and undertake other steps with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in an effort to have this determination rescinded or reversed. “The 4Kscore test is proven to offer significant benefits to patients. It can identify men at higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer who will benefit from a prostate biopsy, while also helping to avoid biopsies in men who are at low risk,” said Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We remain committed to our goal of widespread and affordable access to 4Kscore. Our test provides an additional important tool in the prostate cancer diagnostic paradigm and helps guide treatment decisions for both physicians and patients. We have also been working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and intend to submit the 4Kscore test to the FDA next quarter for approval.” “The 4Kscore test has become an invaluable component to my evaluation of patients with an elevated serum PSA,” stated Mitchell Benson, M.D., Herbert and Florence Irving Professor of Urology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital. “The results of the test dictate the judicious use of prostate MRI and is used to determine the need for prostate biopsy. The 4Kscore test is integral to the care of my patients.” This determination by Novitas was made despite widespread support for the test from leading urologists. The 4Kscore test has been included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines® (NCCN) since 2015 and the European Association of Urology Prostate Cancer Guidelines since 2016. Recommendations for inclusion in these guidelines to provide clinical standards for prostate cancer care are based upon the assessment by expert panels of peer-reviewed literature. Both guidelines recommend that the 4Kscore test be used as an aid in decision making before a first or repeat prostate biopsy in men with elevated PSA or other clinical symptoms. The 4Kscore test has 95% sensitivity and 93% negative predictive value for the identification of aggressive prostate cancer in the patient population recommended by the NCCN. We have and will continue to commit substantial efforts to obtaining broad reimbursement coverage for the 4Kscore test. We have obtained a positive coverage decision from at least one national private payor and pricing agreements from several regional payors. The 4Kscore test has been ordered by more than 12,000 practicing physicians worldwide, with over 200,000 tests ordered and extensively studied in more than 25,000 patients with results presented in 18 peer-reviewed scientific publications. Results of five new studies covering the 4Kscore test were presented at the American Urological Association's 2018 Annual Meeting, including a study demonstrating the test’s ability to stratify risk of prostate cancer mortality in men with elevated PSA. Novitas serves as the Medicare Administrative Contractor for a jurisdiction that includes the State of New Jersey, where OPKO’s BioReference Laboratories is located and where all 4Kscore test samples are processed. About OPKO Health, Inc. OPKO Health is a diversified healthcare company. In diagnostics, its BioReference Laboratories is the nation's third largest clinical laboratory; GeneDx is a rapidly growing genetic testing business; the 4Kscore® prostate cancer test is used to confirm an elevated PSA to help decide about next steps such as prostate biopsy; Claros® 1 is a point-of-care diagnostics platform with PSA and testosterone as the most advanced in development. In our pharmaceutical pipeline, RAYALDEE is our first pharmaceutical product to be marketed. OPK88003, a once-weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity in Phase 2 clinical trials, is among a new class of GLP-1 – glucagon receptor dual agonists. OPK88004, a SARM (selective androgen receptor modulator) is currently being studied for benign prostatic hyperplasia but for which we are exploring other potential indications. The Company’s most advanced product utilizing its CTP technology, a once-weekly human growth hormone for injection, is in Phase 3 trials, and is partnered with Pfizer.

1053951,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"02.27.2019 Miller School of Medicine Departments and Centers Miller School Departments, Centers and Institutes Close The University of Miami is naming its distinguished dermatology department the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery in recognition of alumnus and renowned South Florida philanthropist Phillip Frost, M.D. The department, part of the University’s Miller School of Medicine and known for its innovation, discovery, clinical care, and development of leaders, will receive a $10 million endowment. Dr. Frost recently announced the transformational gift with an eye toward advancing innovative treatments and cures in dermatology. The gift is the culmination of his lifetime of dedication to medicine, particularly in dermatology and medical entrepreneurship. “Patricia and I are here in Florida because of the Department of Dermatology at UM. When I was working as a clinical associate at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Harvey Blank, the chairman of the Department, came to Bethesda to invite me to come to Miami to join the Department. This was an offer we’re glad we couldn’t and didn’t refuse,” said Dr. Frost, who, along with his wife, Patricia, is a champion for science, the arts, and education in South Florida. Dr. Frost’s longstanding relationship with the University spans nearly six decades. After receiving his medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he completed his residency at UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. “Patricia and Phil Frost have helped to transform leading institutions across South Florida,” said University of Miami President Julio Frenk. “The University of Miami is grateful for their extraordinary and meaningful support at the highest levels and across a diverse spectrum of disciplines.” “Before Dr. Frost became a giant in industry, he was a dermatology icon whose research continues to impact clinical care,” said Robert S. Kirsner, M.D., Ph.D., Harvey Blank Professor and chair of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. “Dr. Frost’s gift, the associated prestige and the confidence Dr. Frost has demonstrated in our Department, will empower our current and future clinicians and scientists to improve patients’ lives beyond the Miller School of Medicine.” The Frosts’ philanthropic support of the University began in 1989, when they made gifts establishing the Patricia L. Frost Professorship of Music, which is bestowed on the dean of the music school, the Anna Frost Music Scholarship Fund, and the Abraham Frost Prize in Music Composition. In 2003, the University renamed its music school the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music in recognition of a $33 million gift, the largest ever given to a university-based music school in the United States. In 2015, the state-of-the-art Patricia Louise Frost Music Studios complex opened on the Coral Gables campus. And the Frosts also donated $1 million to establish an endowment to support the “Band of the Hour” marching band and $1 million to name the Donna E. Shalala MusicReach Program in honor of the former UM president. In 2016, the Frosts solidified their philanthropic legacy at the University with a landmark $100 million gift to support path-breaking research in science and engineering. Henri R. Ford, M.D., MHA, dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School, said the Frosts’ gift “is a critical step toward accelerating the innovative research taking place in the Department of Dermatology, helping us to promote team science and advance the field. We are extremely grateful for this investment.” Frost is CEO and chair of OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest U.S. generic drug manufacturers, selling the company to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 while continuing to serve on the TEVA board until 2015. “We applaud Dr. Frost for his generous gift and his vision,” said Edward Abraham, M.D., executive vice president for health affairs and CEO of UHealth. “This investment will be transformative in helping UHealth build another destination program that draws patients from across the region, because of its innovative clinical expertise.” Dr. Frost has been a member of UM’s Board of Trustees since 1983 and served as board chair. He also served as campaign chair for UM’s first Momentum fundraising campaign. He currently is a member of the UHealth and School of Law visiting committees, and both he and Patricia serve on the Frost School of Music Board of Advisors.

Full Year 2018 Financial Highlights** **All comparisons versus full year 2017. NEW YORK, Jan. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. “The fourth quarter was one of our best quarters ever for year over year market share gains, as well as volume growth in Open Trading™,” said Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. “The liquidity pool provided by Open Trading was increasingly valuable as credit spreads widened, leading to record estimated transaction cost savings for our clients of $57 million for the quarter. I am very happy to welcome Chris Concannon to MarketAxess as our President and COO to kick off the new year.” Fourth Quarter Results Total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 14.1% to $112.4 million, compared to $98.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Operating income was $54.0 million, compared to $48.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.5%. Operating margin was 48.0%, compared to 49.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $45.8 million, or $1.21 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $33.5 million, or $0.88 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 15.3% to $101.4 million, compared to $88.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 17.0% to $76.6 million on total trading volume of $442.3 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $65.4 million on total trading volume of $355.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 19.3% for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.6% for the fourth quarter of 2017. All other revenue increased 4.0% to $11.0 million, compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, principally due to higher information services revenue of $0.3 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.2 million. Total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 17.6% to $58.5 million, compared to $49.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher employee compensation and benefit costs of $3.6 million, occupancy costs of $2.3 million, technology and communication costs of $0.8 million, clearing costs of $0.8 million and depreciation and amortization of $0.6 million. Occupancy costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $2.1 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.05. Other income increased to $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 from $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a $0.9 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 18.3%, compared to 32.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected $1.9 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. The fourth quarter of 2017 income tax provision includes a one-time tax charge totaling $11.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was signed into law in December 2017, offset by excess tax benefits of $11.4 million related to a new share-based compensation accounting standard (ASU 2016-09) adopted as of January 1, 2017. Full Year 2018 Results Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 10.7% to a record $435.6 million, compared to $393.4 million for 2017. Operating income was a record $212.6 million, compared to $199.6 million for 2017, an increase of 6.5%. Operating margin was 48.8%, compared to 50.7% for 2017. Net income totaled $172.9 million, or $4.57 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $148.1 million, or $3.89 per share, for 2017. Commission revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 10.0% to a record $390.8 million, compared to $355.3 million for 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 5.1% to $293.9 million on total trading volume of $1.7 trillion, compared to variable transaction fees of $279.8 million on total trading volume of $1.5 trillion for 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 18.1%, compared to an estimated 16.9% for 2017. All other revenue increased 17.3% to $44.7 million in 2018, compared to $38.1 million for 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $4.3 million and information services revenue of $2.4 million. Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased 15.1% to $223.0 million, compared to $193.8 million for 2017. The increase in total expenses was principally due to higher occupancy costs of $8.1 million, employee compensation and benefits costs of $6.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 million, technology and communication costs of $3.8 million and marketing and advertising costs of $2.4 million. Occupancy costs in 2018 included duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $7.3 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.15. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 20.7%, compared to 26.6% for 2017. The 2018 income tax provision reflected $5.6 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. The 2017 income tax provision included $26.1 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards offset by the one-time tax charge of $11.7 million related to the enactment of the Tax Act.

The risk of investing in the stock market is a systematic crash. This is when all the stock prices start falling around the same time. But this risk is also an opportunity for those that understand the fickle nature of the market. High quality, proven companies tend to stick around in the long run, although their share price may be temporarily impacted by a crash. This is the best time to buy stocks like MarketAxess Holdings Inc. at a discount. See our latest analysis for MarketAxess Holdings MarketAxess Holdings Inc., together with its subsidiaries, operates an electronic trading platform that enables fixed-income market participants to trade corporate bonds and other types of fixed-income instruments worldwide. Founded in 2000, and led by CEO Richard McVey, the company provides employment to 429.00 people and with the company’s market cap sitting at US$8.1b, it falls under the mid-cap category. Generally, large-cap stocks are well-resourced and well-established meaning that a bear market will cause it to rejig some short-term capital allocations, but stock market volatility is hardly detrimental to its financial health and business operations. Therefore large-cap stocks are a safe bet to buy more of when the wider market is going down and down. With zero debt on its balance sheet, MarketAxess Holdings isn’t constrained to debt obligations and covenants, which can be burdensome during financial downturns. Highly-levered companies have to maintain a cash cushion to meet near-term interest payments as well as meet unforeseen circumstances. With no lenders’ needs to tend to, MarketAxess Holdings enjoys financial flexibility and independence – an invaluable position to be in during bear markets. Its cash and short-term investment is also sufficient to cover other upcoming liabilities, which means MKTX is financially robust in the face of a volatile market. MKTX’s year-on-year earnings growth has been positive over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of 20%, outperfoming the industry growth rate of 14%. It has also returned an ROE of 28% recently, above the industry return of 18%. Characteristics I value in a long term investment are proven in MarketAxess Holdings, and I can continue to sleep easy at night with the stock as part of my portfolio. To help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

(NYSE: OPK; TASE: OPK; TASE: OPK) yesterday announced its intention to activate a shelf prospectus for a convertible senior notes issue of up to $200 million.

Opko will use the proceeds from the issue for its activity and to repay earlier debt. The company had $317 million in current liabilities, and had $43 million in cash at the end of the third quarter of 2018.

Opko also signed a $60 million line of credit with an entity associated with Frost. Yesterday's announcement followed a tumultuous period for Opko, during which the company published three announcements (probably in order to make sure that its issue is held with all the relevant information being disclosed). Opko first reported a decision by Novitas Solutions, an important US insurance concern, not to grant insurance reimbursement for Opko's kScore4 product. Novitas asserted that Opko had not proved the importance of its test for decisions about treatment of prostate cancer. Later that same day, Opko reported failure in a trial of its OPK-88004 product for preventing the absorption of male hormones in the prostate, while encouraging their absorption in the rest of the body, thereby reducing the risk of benign and malignant prostate tumors, improving muscle mass, and reducing body fat. The trial revealed failure in measuring the prostate with enough precision to produce significant results from the trial. Furthermore, safety problems at high dosages of the product were found.

1096862,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Craig McLeod, head of emerging markets product management, CEEMEA & Asia at MarketAxess, said the fixed income platform could add thousands more clients in the next decade as electronic trading continues to grow. McLeod joined MarketAxess last September from the buy side. He had previously been head of fixed income and foreign exchange trading at Investec Asset Management. He told Markets Media: “The problem for the buy side is that a lot of liquidity has moved from the big banks post-2008, noticeably shifting into the inventories of regional and local emerging market participants. More and more buy-side clients have therefore begun to partner with MarketAxess, as our Open Trading platform gives them easy access to this fragmented liquidity.” Open Trading is MarketAxess’ all-to-all trading model which allows multiple parties in a network to come together to trade, rather than the traditional model of only banks supplying liquidity to the buy side. Craig McLeod, MarketAxess “We strongly believe that it’s possible to add thousands more clients to Open Trading in the next decade so there is huge growth potential,” added McLeod. Kevin McPartland, head of research for market structure and technology at consultancy Greenwich Associates, estimated in a report last year that 15% of emerging market hard currency bond trading in US dollars or euros on MarketAxess is through the Open Trading platform. He was the author of Greenwich’s study, Emerging Market Bond Traders Embrace E-Trading, which found that 70% of US investors are trading emerging market fixed income products electronically, amounting to 14% of the notional volume traded. “US investors favor MarketAxess here, which is not surprising, given they are the market share leader in US investment grade and high-yield bonds,” McPartland added. “The top dealers trading on the emerging market platforms differ little from the top dealers in emerging market bonds overall, with Barclays, Jefferies and JP Morgan the most used electronic counterparties by the US investors in our study.” The research showed that nearly one third of asset managers and half of the hedge funds in the US expect their volumes in emerging markets fixed income to increase in the coming year and at least 70% of those investors will execute some trades electronically. Kevin McPartland, Greenwich Associates McPartland wrote: “Technology is increasing the flow of information, removing the language hurdle and connecting disparate brokers and investors from all over the world, allowing trades to consummate that only a few years ago would have been too expensive, if not impossible, to get done.” Growth strategy McLeod continued that MarketAxess currently covers all emerging markets hard currency sovereign and corporate bonds. “Rollout to 26 emerging market local currency debt countries on Open Trading started in 2018, with Poland and South Africa, and we expect three more countries will debut by the end of this quarter,” said McLeod. Local currency trading has become an increasing proportion of MarketAxess’ overall emerging markets volumes. Last November MarketAxess said local currency trading represented approximately 30% of emerging market activity in the third quarter of 2018. McLeod added that priorities in emerging markets are to expand Open Trading to more local markets; roll out automated execution features for emerging market products and to improve block trading by making “request for market” (RFM) more prominent. Investors trading emerging market local currency bonds can use an RFM inquiry and receive two-way pricing, which allows them to trade in larger size. In November last year MarketAxess said more than $14.2bn (€12.4bn) had been traded via the RFM protocol in the year-to-date, up 78% from 2017. “RFM volumes crept up in November and we have found that it is a very powerful protocol for trading in volatile markets – just like Open Trading itself,” said McLeod. “It is currently at the user’s discretion as to whether they use RFQ or RFM. We are currently considering analytics to guide users on how to gauge which protocol will help them fulfil their best execution obligations.” Results MarketAxess reported its 2018 full year results today and said the firm had achieved its tenth consecutive year of record full year trading volume, revenue and operating income. Adoption of #OpenTrading accelerated during 4Q18 with volumes up 96% to a #record level of $188 billion. #OpenTrading represented 27% of overall platform volume in 4Q18, up from 17% last year. https://t.co/UcJQpfAh3l pic.twitter.com/h4oeQvWYws — MarketAxess (@MarketAxess) January 30, 2019 Emerging market volume was $378bn, up 23.3% on 2017, with local markets trading volume up 35%. In addition, Open Trading reached an all time high of $117.5bn last year, up 96.5% from 2017. Rick McVey, MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey, chairman and chief executive of MarketAxess, said in a statement: “The fourth quarter was one of our best quarters ever for year over year market share gains, as well as volume growth in Open Trading. The liquidity pool provided by Open Trading was increasingly valuable as credit spreads widened, leading to record estimated transaction cost savings for our clients of $57m for the quarter. I am very happy to welcome Chris Concannon to MarketAxess as our president and chief operating officer to kick off the new year.” And receive exclusive articles on securities markets Fixed income is trying to shed its caveman image.

1053951,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The University of Miami is naming its distinguished dermatology department the Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery in recognition of renowned South Florida philanthropist Phillip Frost. The department, part of the University’s Miller School of Medicine and known for its innovation, discovery, clinical care, and development of leaders, will receive a $10 million endowment. Frost recently announced the transformational gift with an eye toward advancing innovative treatments and cures in dermatology. The gift is the culmination of his lifetime of dedication to medicine, particularly in dermatology and medical entrepreneurship. “Patricia and I are here in Florida because of the Department of Dermatology at UM. When I was working as a clinical associate at the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Harvey Blank, the chairman of the Department, came to Bethesda to invite me to come to Miami to join the Department. This was an offer we’re glad we couldn’t and didn’t refuse,” said Frost, who, along with his wife, Patricia, is a champion for science, the arts, and education in South Florida. Frost’s longstanding relationship with the University spans nearly six decades. After receiving his medical degree from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he completed his residency at UM/Jackson Memorial Hospital and later served as a professor of dermatology at the Miller School from 1966 to 1972. “Patricia and Phil Frost have helped to transform leading institutions across South Florida,” said University of Miami President Julio Frenk. “The University of Miami is grateful for their extraordinary and meaningful support at the highest levels and across a diverse spectrum of disciplines.” “Before Dr. Frost became a giant in industry, he was a dermatology icon whose research continues to impact clinical care,” said Dr. Robert S. Kirsner, Harvey Blank Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery. “Dr. Frost’s gift, the associated prestige, and the confidence Dr. Frost has demonstrated in our Department will empower our current and future clinicians and scientists to improve patients’ lives beyond the Miller School of Medicine.” The Frosts’ philanthropic support of the University began in 1989, when they made gifts establishing the Patricia L. Frost Professorship of Music, which is bestowed on the dean of the music school, the Anna Frost Music Scholarship Fund, and the Abraham Frost Prize in Music Composition. In 2003, the University renamed its music school the Phillip and Patricia Frost School of Music in recognition of a $33 million gift, the largest ever given to a university-based music school in the United States. In 2015, the state-of-the-art Patricia Louise Frost Music Studios complex opened on the Coral Gables campus. And the Frosts also donated $1 million to establish an endowment to support the “Band of the Hour” marching band and $1 million to name the Donna E. Shalala MusicReach Program in honor of the former UM president. In 2016, the Frosts solidified their philanthropic legacy at the University with a landmark $100 million gift to support path-breaking research in science and engineering. Dr. Henri R. Ford, dean and chief academic officer of the Miller School, said the Frosts’ gift “is a critical step toward accelerating the innovative research taking place in the Department of Dermatology, helping us to promote team science and advance the field. We are extremely grateful for this investment.” Frost is CEO and chair of OPKO Health, a biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company. He founded IVAX Pharmaceuticals, one of the largest U.S. generic drug manufacturers, selling the company to TEVA Pharmaceuticals in 2006 while continuing to serve on the TEVA board until 2015. “We applaud Dr. Frost for his generous gift and his vision,” said Dr. Edward Abraham, executive vice president for health affairs and CEO of UHealth. “This investment will be transformative in helping UHealth build another destination program that draws patients from across the region, because of its innovative clinical expertise.” Frost has been a member of UM’s Board of Trustees since 1983 and served as board chair. He also served as campaign chair for UM’s first Momentum fundraising campaign. He currently is a member of the UHealth and School of Law visiting committees, and both he and Patricia serve on the Frost School of Music Board of Advisors. Copyright: 2019 University of Miami.

1008941,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Board of Visitor in the News,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The donation brings the college's total number of prints by the Dutch master to 12. The Colby College Museum of Art has acquired three etchings by Rembrandt, bringing its holdings of prints by the Dutch master to 12. The newly acquired prints come to the museum as a gift from longtime benefactors Paula and Peter Lunder. Colby President David Greene announced the acquisition at an event in Portland on Friday hosted by the Portland Press Herald. Rembrandt made the etchings in the mid-1600s, and all are relatively small. The largest, “A Scholar in His Study (Faust),” is about 9 inches by 7 inches. The others are the size of postcards. Rembrandt made these prints more 350 years ago, “but they look as if they were printed as recently as yesterday. They are fresh and vibrant,” said Colby museum director Sharon Corwin. “Rembrandt was a master for a reason. You can see his facility and his mastery of the medium. The detail he is able to get into the etched line, that is where the magic comes in.” The prints are not yet on view. One arrived in January, another was delivered this week and the third is due to arrive at the Waterville museum soon. The museum could not provide images of the artwork. Rembrandt was skilled at painting, drawing and printmaking. While his paintings are worth millions of dollars, his prints hold far less value. Colby College would not discuss the value of the newly acquired prints, but Rembrandt prints generally sell for between a few thousands dollars apiece to $100,000 or more at auction. Art scholars believe he made about 300 etchings. He died in 1669 at age 63. The smaller prints donated by the Lunders are “Christ Returning from the Temple with His Parents,” made in 1654, and “Woman Bathing Her Feet at a Brook,” from 1658. During Rembrandt’s time, a small etching was similar to a photograph today and was considered a key form of cross-cultural communication. During his life, he was better known for his prints than his paintings. He often depicted landscapes, biblical scenes and portraits. The newly acquired Rembrandt prints add to a growing print collection at Colby, which already includes nine Rembrandt prints donated by the Lunders, as well as works by Picasso, Dürer, Goya and James McNeil Whistler, who was influenced by Rembrandt. Justin McCann, a Colby curator, said the prints will serve Colby’s art community well. “We have printmakers here, and students in the studio-art classes and art history classes will learn from them, as well,” he said, calling Rembrandt’s line work and printing “exquisite.” At the event in Portland on Friday – part of the newspaper’s Like A Boss series of live interviews with local leaders – Greene called the Lunders “the most amazing people in the world” and credited them for caring so deeply about Maine “that they are investing in it in just incredible ways, completely transforming institutions and opportunities for people in this state.” The Lunders have given Colby numerous gifts of cash and art. Both serve on the museum’s board of governors and are former Waterville residents. Peter Lunder is a 1956 Colby graduate, former president of Dexter Shoe Co. and a nephew of its founder, Harold Alfond. In 1995, the Lunders pledged the lead gift to the museum’s Lunder Wing. In 2007, the couple donated hundreds of works of art valued at more than $100 million. Six years later, the Alfond-Lunder Family Pavilion opened to display the works. In 2016, the Lunders donated a set of 100 of Pablo Picasso’s etchings from the 1930s, and in 2017 they gave the museum another gift of $100 million.

Union Bank of Nigeria Nigeria remains a flagship market for Atlas Mara and is central to the Company's overall strategy. The Company is focused on execution of its previously stated objectives, including achieving consolidation of UBN. Atlas Mara remains committed to supporting UBN's strategies for growth within the Nigeria banking industry. Notably, Atlas Mara will support a growth strategy consistent with prudent management of capital and liquidity and a sustainable dividend policy. Digital Banking As part of its strategic imperative to be a positive disruptive force in the banking industry, Atlas Mara will focus on developing a digital banking platform that can be implemented across its markets to strengthen its retail banking franchise, and which is expected to lead to a broader base of deposits and lower cost of funds. Sub-Saharan Africa remains one of the greatest global opportunities for enhancing financial intermediation using technology, and Atlas Mara intends to use the Digital Bank to accelerate its core business growth and profitability across the Group. Atlas Mara believes that the Digital Bank presents a significant opportunity for growth, and the Company is increasing its focus on the initiative. As a result, the Board has asked John Staley, CEO, who has significant experience and expertise in this area, to focus his efforts in 2019 on developing this opportunity for the Company. Leadership Changes Atlas Mara announces that Bob Diamond, a founder of the Company, has decided to transition from his role of Chairman and return to his role as a non-executive director of the Board, to enable him to increase his focus on his other executive roles while continuing to contribute actively to Atlas Mara's growth and strategic direction. As previously announced, Mr. Diamond assumed the role of Chairman on an interim basis with the expectation that a new Chairman would be appointed in due course. He has served as Chairman for two years, guiding Atlas Mara through a substantial transformation, including its strategic financing with Fairfax Africa and the increase in its ownership of UBN from 31% to 49%. Concurrently, the Board has appointed Michael Wilkerson, a non-executive director of Atlas Mara, to assume the role of Executive Chairman. Mr. Wilkerson currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of Fairfax Africa, a TSX-listed company focused on investments in Africa, and the largest shareholder in Atlas Mara. In other changes, Funke Opeke, Chair of the Nominations Committee and Hisham Ezz Al-Arab have resigned as directors of Atlas Mara to focus on their leadership responsibilities with other companies, as CEO and as Chairman and Managing Director, respectively. The Board has appointed Mr. Diamond to assume the role of Chair of the Nominations Committee in place of Ms. Opeke. The Board of Directors is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Jawaid Mirza as an independent non-executive member of the Board, effective April 1, 2019. Mr. Mirza has over 30 years of experience in banking with global financial institutions, including senior executive positions with Citibank and ABN AMRO Bank. He served as ABN AMRO's CFO European Region, Managing Director and COO for Global Private Banking, Asset Management and New Growth Markets, and Managing Director and CFO for Asia, Middle East and Australia. Mr. Mirza also served as Group COO and later CEO and Managing Director for Consumer & Commercial at Commercial International Bank of Egypt. Mr. Mirza is currently an independent non-executive board member of Eurobank Ergasias (Athens), where he chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk Committee, and of Commercial International Bank (""CIB"") of Egypt, where he chairs the Audit Committee and is a member of the Risk and Board Technology & Operations committees. He is also a non-executive board member of the South African Bank of Athens. Mr. Diamond said, ""I am excited to return to my original role on the Board and to continue to partner with Michael to accelerate the execution of our strategy. My belief in our ambition - to create a premier sub-Saharan African financial institution to better serve continental and global customers - remains as strong as the day we founded the Company."" Mr. Diamond also said of the transitions, ""On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Funke and Hisham for their valuable contributions to the growth and strategic direction of Atlas Mara. They provided extraordinary service and leadership, and we wish them all the best with their companies. I am also excited to work with Jawaid, who I know will bring incredible value to the Board."" Mr. Wilkerson said, ""On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Company, I want to express our gratitude to Bob for his leadership as Chairman through the challenging times of the past two years. I look forward to continuing to work together on the Board to build on our partnership to fulfill the vision of creating a leading, sub-Saharan African financial services platform to better serve our customers and communities. Mr. Wilkerson continued, ""We thank Funke and Hisham for their service and look forward to welcoming Jawaid to the Atlas Mara Board of Directors. We have high regard for Jawaid's expertise and know that he will add substantial value to the Company going forward."" Atlas Mara further announces that Muhammad ""Omar"" Khan has been appointed Chief Financial Officer of Atlas Mara effective April 2019. Kenroy Dowers, who served as Acting Chief Financial Officer, will continue in his role as Group Managing Director for Strategy and Investments. Mr. Wilkerson said, ""We greatly appreciate Kenroy's strong leadership and significant contributions as Acting CFO, and look forward to continuing to work with him."" Mr. Khan was previously Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Commercial International Bank (""CIB""). Mr. Khan has over 24 years of banking experience in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Canada with Citibank, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland and CIB, among others. During this time Mr. Khan has developed expertise in a multitude of areas of banking, including Finance, Asset & Liability Management, Service & Quality, Retail, Operations, Human Resources, Project Management and Administration. Proposed Acquisition of 35% stake in GroCapital Consistent with the strategic alignment outlined above, Atlas Mara and Fairfax Africa have entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding whereby Atlas Mara would explore the acquisition, in a proposed share exchange transaction on terms to be agreed, Fairfax Africa's 35% stake in GroCapital Holdings Limited (""GroCapital""), a South African financial services provider with a core focus on the agricultural and food processing sectors. This transaction will be subject to finalizing definitive agreements, as well as the approval of the South African Reserve Bank, the Minister of Finance, and the Competition Commission, and other regulatory approvals and customary conditions precedent. In addition to Fairfax Africa, GroCapital's shareholders include the Public Investment Corporation of South Africa (35%) and AFGRI Holdings Limited (""AHL"") (30%). Fairfax Africa has a 43% indirect beneficial interest in AHL. GroCapital offers through its subsidiaries comprehensive traditional business banking such as lending, transactional banking and treasury functions, as well as alliance, business and international banking. Its subsidiaries are known for a focus on the development of market-leading, niche alliance transactional banking offerings in partnership with businesses. GroCapital's go-forward strategy is to focus on companies in agriculture and food production, offering debt origination, forex and commodity trading, specialised finance and broking services, and an array of financial and insurance products and services directly to the farmer and agricultural intermediaries. As part of AHL, GroCapital has an established track record in financial services, offering bespoke financial products and services to the agribusiness and food sectors. AHL maintains c. $1 billion in farmer and corporate loan portfolios, with a proven history of negligible bad debts through multiple agricultural cycles. When concluded, this transaction would position Atlas Mara to access the South African banking market, enabling it to participate in financing of trade flows, foreign exchange, commodity finance and retail banking, and allow for operational integration into the core banking and technology environment of the Company, including with regard to digital banking and cross-border payments. The Board sees considerable potential for the Company to capitalize on the large market opportunity in agricultural finance (""agrifinance"") in sub-Saharan Africa and the unique positioning Atlas Mara could achieve with this strategic transaction to enhance its capabilities in this industry vertical. The World Bank estimated in a 2016 report on agribusiness in sub-Saharan Africa that the sector faces an annual financing gap of at least $11 billion, and agribusinesses routinely cite the lack of access to financing as one of the key impediments to their growth. Atlas Mara's current footprint includes markets in which agriculture is a leading contributor to economic output but remains underbanked. For example, in Nigeria, the Company's largest market, agriculture is one of the largest economic contributors at more than 20% of GDP and more than 30% of employment per the World Bank's 2017 data, but represents a far smaller proportion of credit and financial services transactions. Atlas Mara's footprint is well matched to a focused agrifinance strategy, and the Board foresees the potential of such a strategic transaction to enhance the Company's agrifinance-specific capabilities and expand its reach into new, attractive agrifinance markets. The Board of Directors of Atlas Mara will form a special committee of independent directors who are unaffiliated with Fairfax Africa or GroCapital to assess the strategic merits of the potential transaction, and to oversee negotiation of the key terms of a proposed agreement. Operating Structure The Company is also reviewing its operational structures. Dubai will for the time being remain the corporate headquarters of Atlas Mara, while the Company accelerates the shift of key functions and personnel closer to Atlas Mara's banking operations in Africa. Over time, the Group expects to eliminate various duplicative structures that were inherited from previous acquisitions, which is expected to result in greater operational efficiencies and lower costs. As part of the review the Company has also determined to reposition the Markets & Treasury offshore business segment, to be more strategically located for additional business opportunities, and in light of the potential agreement to acquire a substantial position in GroCapital, which will give Atlas Mara its first presence in South Africa. The offshore segment will transition from its base in Dubai, with further plans to be announced in due course.
