1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"3 Min Read * New “challenger” bank will not have branches * Bank to scout for riskier companies with good potential * Italian banks slowly emerging from loan crisis By Valentina Za MILAN, July 20 (Reuters) - An Italian bank being set up with backing from former Barclays chief Bob Diamond said on Friday it aimed to trounce industry returns by chasing higher-margin borrowers and going digital to keep costs down. It targets a return on equity (ROE) of about 25 percent in its plans to 2023, compared with just 4 percent for Italian lenders in 2017 net of one-offs and 14 percent at Banca IFIS , a specialty bank which buys and manages bad debts. “This project is an act of confidence in Italy,” Corrado Passera, the chief executive of the new bank whose name has yet to be announced, told journalists. The veteran banker and former industry minister said the bank would scout for small businesses seen to have potential but which had trouble securing funds from mainstream lenders. It would also buy bad loans from rivals. The bank, which will not have branches, aims to tap the expertise of retired corporate executives and use artificial intelligence to identify companies that qualify for lending. Italian banks are slowly emerging from a bad loan crisis triggered by a deep recession. Credit losses and negative interest rates have hammered returns in the sector, which is weighed down by fragmentation and too many branches. The number of specialised banks, known as “challenger banks”, seeking to compete with established players has grown in Britain and other countries but they are still rare in Italy. Passera, who headed Intesa Sanpaolo until 2011, raised 600 million euros ($703 million) in January by listing SPAXS, a special purpose acquisition company that he used to buy small lender Banca Interprovinciale. Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital Fund indirectly owns a 7.7 percent stake in SPAXS and is its biggest investor. Alongside Passera, the chief financial officer will be Francesco Mele who held the same job at Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The new bank aims to deliver a net profit of 40 million-50 million euros in 2020 rising to about 300 million euros in 2023, broadly split between the small- and medium-sized (SME) enterprises lending unit and the bad loan business. Andrea Clamer, who has moved from Banca IFIS to head the bad loan unit, said the bank would invest 3 billion euros buying some of the 135 billion euros in bad corporate loans Italian banks were expected to offload in 2018-2023. The SME unit would also buy so-called “unlikely-to-pay” loans, which are not yet in default and could be recovered by turning around the troubled borrower. Clamer said the new group had agreed to buy a 300 million euro bad loan portfolio, a deal that would go ahead after Aug. 8 when SPAXS shareholders approve the tie-up with Banca Interprovinciale, which also needs regulatory clearing. The new bank targets a core capital ratio of more than 15 percent and plans to rely on digital technologies to keep costs below 30 percent of its income. $1 = 0.8537 euros Reporting by Valentina Za Editing by Edmund Blair All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1012769,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Former First Lady Michelle Obama will take a high-profile role in the 2018 campaign, but in order to keep herself from getting to deep in the muck she’ll seek to elect Democrats under the guise of an ostensibly nonpartisan group which launches Thursday and that is being called “When We All Vote.” According to Politico report about the $8 million effort: The initiative, scheduled to be launched Thursday, is the result of months of quiet conversations and planning full of false starts and uncertainty about whether to go forward. It will have the former first lady appear in public service announcements and at live events throughout the country into the fall, according to multiple people informed of the plans. She’ll be joined by several A-list celebrities, including actor Tom Hanks, country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Houston Rockets star Chris Paul, singer Janelle Monae and “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda. The first PSA will go out Thursday, with more in the process of being lined up, featuring other prominent activists and players. The group will be incorporated as a nonprofit, separate from the Obama Foundation, the personal offices of Barack and Michelle Obama, and Citizen 44, the LLC that the former president himself pays for to handle his own political involvement. Named “When We All Vote,” it will be stocked with prominent Obama alumni, including Valerie Jarrett as president of the board and former first lady chief of staff Tina Tchen as treasurer. Pete Rouse, an Obama senior adviser who served as interim White House chief of staff, will also be on the board . . . Organizers intend to send personal messages to people urging them to register. According to one document describing the group’s plans, it will partner with “outlets that young Americans use most.” So its nonpartisan, right? And the Obamas don’t deceive people, right? I mean, look at the roster of participants. And they’ll be trying to get young people off their video games and to stop texting for a few minutes to vote. Of course, they all vote Democratic. Here’s the video, which has just been released and has not yet been widely seen or even published, far as I can tell. I mean, honestly, have a look that people featured in this video. Young African Americans. An effusive young pajama-boy style white guy with a goatie. Um, Tom Hanks. Unfortunately, they are not likely conservative Republicans, as the makers of this video fully understand. And they are there to appeal to Democrats. This will be a tax-free effort to register Democrats. Thank you for contributing to Michelle’s new project. Michelle Obama is expanding her role in the Obama campaign, heading up a new effort… She raised money last night in Chicago for Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias and then at… President Obama will raise substantially less in the second quarter of his campaign than the… LOL, have they checked out the videos and testimonials at the FB #WalkAway Campaign site ? That’s where all their “targeted” reach seems to be hanging out. If Trump weaponized the IRS like obama did, they’d be dead in the water,lol! Well, we knew it was coming, didn’t we? We just weren’t sure of how they were going to format their anti-Trump, anti-American campaign for the midterms. Now we know. Good for her. If there’s one thing voters like? It’s a lecturing scold telling them what to do. You go, girl! Hope it works as well as her school lunch campaign did… I wonder if she’ll grow bored with this…remember #BringBackOurGirls? Re: When we ALL vote. That includes the illegals in California. And everywhere else. Screw each and everyone. Celebrities? BWAHAAAA. Dead to me. Amazing she could find time between attending Beyoncé concerts in Paris and vacations and all. This isn’t quite as extreme as the Democrat preparation for the Supreme Court nominee hearings but it’s close. See: https://freebeacon.com/culture/liberals-send-female-senate-democrats-pee-proof-underwear-oppose-trumps-scotus-pick/ OMG, what next? Reading the Freebeacon article was really quite disgusting. The idea of Elizabeth Warren wearing pee absorbing undies is just too much. Obviously, this limelight for MO leads to her being the nominee for president of our Republic in 2020. Follow the money right to the billionaire who has been NObama’s puppeteer for a long time! Do they really believe they are fooling us? Bring it, Moochie! Cheesey comes to mind, you go girl! Hand out those Obama iPads all day, don’t forget to check ID Ah, yes, and I am oh so sure (not) she will continue to adhere to her own standard of “when they go low, we go high”. I do so hope that the Republicans (well, Trump and his allies) do well in November. First, we need a better Congress and second, if/when the blue wave doesn’t materialize that will drive even more of the leftists insane. Just-call-me-Meesh-coat-tail rider seems to have put on the pounds — why doesn’t she just eat some healthy school lunch menus?

We’d like to be able to buy some in the $120s, $130s, but I think [CEO Scott] Santi, who’s been on the show, should come on and talk about why business isn’t as bad as the stock indicates.” Deutsche Bank AG: “Look, the company did say that things are better than expected. I think that it wouldn’t be a bad idea for them to raise capital. They have not said that. I don’t care what the book is. I’ve been fooled by book value before.” Forescout Technologies, Inc.: “I feel even [more] strongly about this now and I also like, by the way, Palo Alto. I like Cyberark. I think those are absolutely terrific. I like Nice, I think that is good. And I like Proofpoint, particularly because now we are back battling with the Chinese on intellectual property and that means that the Chinese might be making it so that we need more cybersecurity.” Applied Materials, Inc.: “Applied Materials, I think, at this level, is too cheap. I saw Lam Research going up. Now, it may take the whole cycle. It may actually literally take six to nine months for Applied Materials to come back, but I am urging patience.” Cardinal Health, Inc.: “It yields almost 4 percent. I liked it higher. It is hard for me to imagine how this stock got all the way down to $50. It is just not that bad at 10 times earnings.” Buckeye Partners: “Don’t buy any more. Last night, [Enbridge CEO] Al Monaco, I think, opened a lot of people’s eyes with Enbridge when he basically said that the master limited partnership model is not working, therefore I think that my inclination is don’t buy any more of that stock.” Opko Health, Inc.: “Opko’s coming back and we know [CEO] Dr. [Phillip] Frost never sold any stock and we know the stock is low, but I have no thesis to recommend the stock without Dr. Frost coming on here and telling us.” Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Illinois Tool Works.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Bradford 7°c Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond Former Barclays chief Bob Diamond has said he “didn’t think it was fair” that he took the blame for banking misconduct during the Libor scandal, but admitted he could have “done things better” during the financial crisis. The long-time banker – whose short stint as chief executive lasted from 2011 to 2012 – recalled the day he was asked to step down as chief executive, calling it “the most challenging” professional decision of his life. He had been told he had lost the confidence of the Bank of England, the Chancellor and the City watchdog despite Barclays having been the first to settle with authorities over Libor-rigging – paying £290 million in 2012. He begrudgingly bowed to board pressure. “The request for me to resign was, in my mind, not the right decision in terms of how I conducted myself, how I behaved, how I was doing in the institution, the support I had from the various constituencies.” Mr Diamond claims he decided to step down to protect both the bank and his family. “I decided that if I act according to everything I believe, then the number one is what’s good for Barclays and the second thing is what’s good for my family. “And I had to admit that I had become a lightning rod. I didn’t like that. “It didn’t feel like me, it didn’t look like me, I didn’t think it was appropriate, I didn’t think it was fair, but I had become a lightning rod and I thought it was better for me to step down and do the right thing than ask the board to support me.” When asked whether he thought it was fair that current Barclays chief executive Jes Staley has been able to keep his job despite having been fined by regulators for unmasking a whistleblower, Mr Diamond told the Press Association: “I don’t worry about that stuff.” Mr Diamond, who was speaking at a How to: Academy event in Westminster, also recalled how the Libor scandal brought him in front of the Treasury Select Committee, where he came face to face with its former chairman and Tory MP Andrew Tyrie. “It was gruelling to be in front of the Treasury Select Committee. There are few people I have met that I respect more than Andrew Tyrie. He had a tough job that day. I had a bit of a harder one, but I think he … is a good man.” The former Barclays boss – who now heads his own financial services firm Atlas Mara – stressed that Barclays remains one of the few to have survived the financial crisis without a Government bailout. But Mr Diamond said he was willing to admit he had not always done his best, particularly in the lead-up to the financial crisis. “There was no banker who didn’t make mistakes during this period, so could I have done things better? Absolutely. “I think what I’m proud of though, is that during that period Barclays survived, we were stable.” ­Looking ahead, he expects the banking landscape to become more localised, with successful strategies set to be more regional than global for international lenders. The transition away from “universal” banks will mean the sector will innovate and fail if necessary, without bringing down the entire financial system, he said. Mr Diamond added: “If I am correct and the exciting part of financial services is going to be more national, regional and less global – more focused on selective and less universal – then failure again is an option. “If these smaller, national firms fail, we’re not creating systemic risk. “It’s OK, some of them are going to fail and many of them are going to be very successful so … I’m very optimistic about the future of financial services.” Get involved with the news in your community This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation's Editors' Code of Practice.

1096862,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission staff might be toying with the idea of regulating electronic fixed-income trading venues at self-regulatory organizations, according to the line of questioning from the latest Fixed-Income Markets Structure Advisory Committee open meeting. During the last panel discussion, Brett Redfearn, director of the Division of Trading and Markets at the SEC, posed questions to the subcommittee on technology and electronic trading how they would address regulating the electronic fixed-income market starting from a clean slate. He raised the issues of which key regulatory objectives there should be, whether regulations should support operational transparency, system integrity, resiliency standards, as well as other typical topics that SROs face currently. The subcommittee went as far as proposing that the SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board create a working group tasked with reviewing the regulatory framework for the corporate and municipal bond markets’ electronic trading platforms. The proposal also noted that any revised regulatory framework should ensure fair and effective markets without any regulatory gaps or hamper the innovation of new trading protocols and business models. At the same time, the proposal’s authors also recommended that the SEC should amend Regulation ATS and any other applicable rules to take in the account the nature of fixed-income market structure and trading protocols as well as the cost-benefit of existing and future regulations. Ben Macdonald,Bloomberg “It might have cost the industry $2.5 billion to implement MiFID II just to arrive at pre-trade transparency for about 400 bonds,” Ben Macdonald, global head of enterprise products at Bloomberg and president of Bloomberg SEF. “The cost-benefit of that is worth bearing in mind. With that said, what I think MiFID II does very well is laying the foundation of an ecosystem of trading that ultimately provides a funnel of post-trade reporting.” “There are a lot of lessons to be learned from that process,” agreed Doug Friedman, general counsel at Tradeweb. “The regulation must recognize the differences in how markets trade, the impact of trading, and reporting on liquidity, the time and cost of resources associated with any implementation, and also the opportunity costs. You have to prioritize regulatory and compliance over what might be commercial innovation potentially.” No matter what happens, regulators need to address the arbitrary nature of the existing regulatory framework regarding electronic fixed-income trading, stressed Rick McVey, CEO of MarketAxess and chairman of the subcommittee. Depending on whether a venue caters to click-to-trade retail investors or institutional investors who prefer requests-for-quotes, the SEC and FINRA may regulate them as an ATS operator or a broker-dealer, he noted. “There is at least one example of an e-trading participant in both retail and institutional markets that are not regulated by either FINRA or ATS regulations today,” McVey added. “The committee believes that the differences are based on trading protocols and not business models and, to a certain extent, revenue models.” And receive exclusive articles on securities markets Cantor Fitzgerald cites execution quality, customization, and access to liquidity as trading differentiators.

1106452,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citi (NYSE: C) has been awarded World’s Best Investment Bank at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence, held in London on 11th July. The bank was also named World’s Best Bank for Financing and World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility. Commenting on Citi’s success, Euromoney noted that: “The rationale behind Citi’s nomination as the world’s best investment bank this year is simple, but impressive. In every part of the world that Euromoney considered the credentials of the leading regional investment banks, Citi was a genuine contender. These arguments speak to two incontrovertible facts about Citi’s Institutional Clients Group (ICG) today: no other firm comes close to the scale and breadth of Citi’s wholesale banking operations; and Citi hasn’t just built and maintained a global network, it has built one that works and is increasingly valued by its clients, who view Citi as a true partner to their own global businesses. Competitors are now catching on that Citi has something they don’t. Clients realized this a lot earlier.” Citi was also recognized across a number of regional categories including: Jamie Forese, President of Citi and Head of Citi's Institutional Clients Group commented: ""Citi has had a tremendous 12 months, delivering on our commitments by leveraging the synergies of our ICG platform. We continue to see evidence in our results that our major advantage when serving large, sophisticated clients is our global network -- one that cannot be replicated by our competition. Being recognized by Euromoney is a testament to our capabilities."" On being named World’s Best Bank for Corporate Responsibility, Ed Skyler, Citi’s Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chair of the Citi Foundation said: “The societal issues impacting our communities today require a different level of engagement from companies. It’s no longer about being a good corporate citizen. We must use our business, our philanthropy and our voice to stand for issues that matter most.” The Euromoney Awards for Excellence are recognized as the most prestigious in the financial services industry. About Citi: Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.

1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"See our top picks around the globe. Sarah Cascone & Caroline Goldstein, July 10, 2018 There’s art to be seen all over the world this summer, so why not plan a vacation with an exhibition or two in mind? We’ve scoured the globe to bring you this list of the 29 most tantalizing art shows going on view in the next few months. Glexis Novoa, Wat [detail], 2013, graphite on canvas, 49 x 107 inches, Courtesy of the artist and David Castillo Gallery Gustav Klimt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (1907). Courtesy of Neue Galerie. There are shows all over the world this year dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the deaths of Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, but only one of them features the famed “Woman in Gold,” Klimt’s gilded masterpiece Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I. It’s the jewel of the Neue Galerie’s collection, and if you haven’t seen it yet, the museum’s upcoming show, which examines the two artists’ work in light of the so-called “joyous apocalypse”—the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I—is the perfect opportunity to do so. Susan Meiselas, Roseann on the way to Manhattan Beach, New York, 1978, from the series “Prince Street Girls,” 1975-90; © Susan Meiselas/Magnum Photos Since the 1970s, photographer Susan Meiselas has documented occurrences as wide-ranging as the armed conflict in Central America to the Kurdish genocide to carnival strippers. Timed here to the release of her new book, Mediations, an exhibition of the same name comes to SFMOMA from the Fundació Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona, and the Jeu de Paume, Paris. Joana Vasconcelos’s Lilicoptère (2012). Work produced in collaboration with Fundação Ricardo do Espírito Santo Silva, Lisbon. © Joana Vasconcelos, VEGAP, Bilbao, 2018. Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos named her current show after a Velvet Underground song, as a tribute to Nico, who sang vocals on the track. The title work, a massive carnival mask sculpture made of bronze and mirrors, is joined by some of the artist’s greatest hits, as well as new works. Robert Rauschenberg, L.A. Uncovered #1 (1998). Photo courtesy of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, gift of the artist and Gemini G.E.L., ©Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. LACMA makes the case that Robert Rauschenberg, who lives between New York and Florida, is actually a Los Angeles artist. He was inspired to pursue a career in the arts after being stationed with the Navy at California’s Camp Pendleton in 1944 and ’45, and later worked closely with the LA print workshops Gemini G.E.L. and Styria Studio. The exhibition also touches on Rauschenberg’s work with scientists and engineers from Teledyne Technologies as part of LACMA’s Art & Technology program, as well as his 1981 photography project In + Out City Limits, and 1998 screenprint series LA Uncovered, both of which feature views of the city. Lee Friedlander’s Miles Davis (1969). Image courtesy of the artist and Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco. New York-based photographer Lee Friedlander made his first trip to New Orleans in 1957 and has been visiting ever since. Now, the New Orleans Museum of Art has brought together some of the artist’s earliest streetscapes, self-portraits featuring reflections and shadows, and documentation of jazz culture. The latter work captures not only the musical greats and second-line parades, but also New Orleans’s lesser-known jazz musicians. Choctaw-Cherokee painter and sculptor Jeffrey Gibson destroyed much of his early work before recommitting to his artistic practice in 2011. That date marks the starting point for this exhibition at the Denver Art Museum, which is known for its commitment to showing Native American art. Gibson’s colorful wall hangings, beaded punching bags, rawhide paintings, sculptures, and videos draw parallels between the Native American experience and the Civil Rights movement, all while reflecting the influence of the history of contemporary art. The show will later travel to the Mississippi Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art. Gabriele Münter, Portrait of Marianne von Werefkin (1909). Photo courtesy of the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. The Louisiana Museum in Copenhagen will exhibit some 130 works by the late German Expressionist Gabriele Münter, many of which are being shown for the first time, in the artist’s first comprehensive retrospective in decades. A founding artist of the Blaue Reiter group (Blue Rider) with her romantic partner Wassily Kandinsky and artist Franz Marc, Münter has—surprise, surprise—long been overshadowed by her male contemporaries. With an oeuvre of more than 2,000 paintings, and some 1,200 photographs, watercolors, stained glass works, and prints—not to mention thousands more drawings—it’s hopefully just a start to an overdue reassessment of her career. Robert Delaunay, Circular Forms (Sun and Moon), (1913–31). Courtesy of Kunsthaus Zürich. A master of light and color, Robert Delaunay was a major figure of the Parisian avant-garde in the early 20th century. For its upcoming comprehensive show, the Kunsthaus Zürich has amassed 80 paintings and works on paper by the artist to complement two major Delaunay canvases from its permanent collection: Circular Forms (Sun and Moon) (1913–31) and the monumental Circular Forms (1930). The Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. In this historical exhibition, the Ashmolean Museum examines the way our lives are influenced by superstition and so-called “magical thinking.” Objects on view will include engraved rings meant to ensure another’s love and mummified cats. Laure Prouvost’s Ahead of Us (2018). Courtesy of the artist and Nathalie Obadia (Paris and Brussels), carlier | gerbauer (Berlin), and Lisson Gallery (London and New York). For her first Paris museum show, 2013 Turner Prize winner Laure Prouvost—on tap to represent France at the 2019 Venice Biennale—presents a world overrun by nature, a possible vision of the future inspired by global warming. Visitors enter through a corridor of woven tapestries, and can drink from the centerpiece, a large fountain of breasts. Miriam Schapiro, The Beauty of Summer (1973–74). Courtesy of Eric Firestone Gallery, ©Miriam Schapiro/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York. Pioneering feminist artist Miriam Schapiro, who died in 2015, was a founding member of the Pattern and Decoration movement. The Museum of Arts and Design pairs 29 works by Schapiro, including her signature collage-painting hybrids, which she dubbed femmages, alongside 28 works by contemporary artists, such as Sanford Biggers, Jeffrey Gibson, and Sara Rahbar. The show reveals her widespread influence and her willingness to embrace disciplines traditionally relegated to the realm of craft and women’s work. Blending traditional Hungarian textile techniques with contemporary art influences—as well as the feminist art movement of the 1960s and ’70s—Anna Torma’s vibrant embroidered multimedia works straddle the line between domesticity and fantasy. “Mike + Doug Starn: Big Bambú,” installation in progress at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Photo courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, ©Mike and Doug Starn. Brothers Mike and Doug Starn have created a new version of their massive interactive project Big Bambú, which was a hit when it appeared on the rooftop of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2010. They’ve now built a multi-story installation of 3,000 bamboo poles at the MFA Houston, the first indoor edition of the piece. Guests who want to climb onto the upper levels should plan ahead and wear flat, rubber-soled, enclosed footwear. Guerrilla Girls at Abrons_preview (2015). Photo courtesy of Andrew Hindrake. In the wake of the #MeToo movement there couldn’t be a better time to revisit the work of the anonymous female art collective the Guerrilla Girls, known for their searing critiques of the art world. The Dallas Museum of Art has brought together 109 posters, books, videos, and ephemera created by the group between 1985 and 2016. Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg, Worship (2016). Film still courtesy of Lisson Gallery and Gio’ Marconi, Milan, ©Nathalie Djurberg & Hans Berg/Bildupphovsrätt, 2017. Nathalie Djurberg’s darkly fantastical stop-motion animated films are scored by Swedish producer Hans Berg. In their latest show, the duo will present new sculptures and installations, as well as their recent efforts in virtual reality. Eduardo Chillida, Mesa de Omar Khayyâm III (1983). Photo courtesy of the Telefónica Art Collection. The Rijksmuseum has secured loans of nine of Eduardo Chillida‘s monumental steel sculptures for an impressive outdoor exhibition. The Spanish artist is known for blending traditional artisanal iron-forging techniques with the innovations of Modernist abstraction. Don’t miss his Homenaie a Calder, inspired by the mobiles of Alexander Calder. Installation view of “The Music of Color: Sam Gilliam, 1967–73” at the Kunstmuseum Basel. Photo courtesy of the Kunstmuseum Basel. The Kunstmuseum Basel revisits the most radical period in the career of American artist Sam Gilliam, who, in 1967, began painting on unstretched canvases and then folding and crumpling the wet paintings to create works that border between sculpture and painting. The show also highlights Gilliam’s signature drape painting series, which he began in 1968. ©Viviane Sassen, Ra (2017). Courtesy of Stevenson Gallery, Cape Town, South Africa The Hepworth Wakefield showcases the work of Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen, who cites Surrealism as a major influence on her work. The exhibition is presented as a series of “image poems” in the tradition of Surrealist collage, featuring photography series from the last decade as well as the artist’s new work. For the follow up to her ground-breaking installation The Dinner Party, the pioneering feminist artist Judy Chicago set about creating works of art that depicted the miracle of birth—an act rarely pictured in the history of art. (Chicago has argued if men delivered babies, art museums would use much more space emphasizing this essential part of the human experience.) In making these bold female symbols, Chicago continued championing woman-centric art traditions historically denigrated as craft, working with professional textile artists—as she did with The Dinner Party—to help execute her vision. Works from the series will appear this fall at the ICA Miami, but see them in Pasadena first, as the museum has sadly announced its imminent closure.

The adventures of Italian autobiographer Giacomo Casanova have become reduced in the popular imagination to his famed exploits with women. But his writings offer an unparalleled account of everyday life and customs in 18th-century European society. The MFA takes a look at Casanova’s world—and the persistently relevant issues of political, social, economic, and sexual power—presenting a selection of 250 paintings, sculptures, works on paper, decorative arts, furniture, costumes, and musical instruments.

The Getty presents 198 fashion-related objects, from magazine covers and ad campaigns to garments and photographs, in this in-depth survey of the history of fashion photography, which rarely gets institutional attention. The show takes as its starting point Edward Steichen, who took the first artistic photographs back in 1911. It then traces the century since, ending in the digital (but still pre-Instagram) age of 2011. The show includes some of the field’s most famous photos, as well as lesser-known masterpieces and experimental work by the likes of Man Ray and Dora Maar, which contributed to the art form’s development and challenge the notion that fashion photography is merely commercial.

The Bowdoin College Museum of Art makes the case that landscape painter Winslow Homer was heavily influenced by the burgeoning art of photography. The exhibition presents photographs, paintings, and prints, as well as a professional-grade dry plate camera that was once owned by the artist. Frida Kahlo, by Guillermo Kahlo (1932). Photo: Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons. Perhaps art history’s most celebrated female artist, Frida Kahlo became an icon on the strength of her self-portraits, in which she often wore richly embroidered Mexican garb and colorful flowers in her hair. The Victoria and Albert Museum explores her work and identity through the lens of her fashion, bringing together her clothing and personal possessions, many of which have never been publicly shown before. Her famous wardrobe has remained untouched in the 50 years since her death. Paula Crown, The Architecture of Memory (2018). Photo courtesy of PAHC/studio. Timed to the 16th Venice International Architecture Biennial, the Dallas Contemporary presents an exhibition of work by artist Paula Crown, who has turned the simple red solo cup into an architectural building unit. “Germinal” at Portugal’s Museum of Art, Architecture, and Technology. The eminent sculptor Pedro Cabrita Reis was a great champion of emerging Portuguese artists in the 1990s and amassed a collection of more than 400 artworks. This is the first time that the public will have access to a selection of his treasure trove. Chris Moore, photograph of an Alexander McQueen look from Autumn/Winter 2010.

Over the last 60 years, Chris Moore has become known as the king of catwalk photography, shooting fashion shows from all the major designers: Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, John Galliano, Comme des Garҫons, Alexander McQueen, Yves Saint Laurent, Vivienne Westwood, and many more. In the Bowes Museum’s current exhibition, Moore’s historic images ae paired with garments on loan from the world’s foremost fashion houses. Fanette Mellier’s Poster: Specimen (2008).

The San Francisco sensation Color Factory is participating in the exhibition with a chromatic-walkway that extends from the museum show into the garden, and corresponds with real-life colors encountered in New York City. Modernist master Constantin Brancusi transformed the field of sculpture with his sleek, elegantly simple forms, which often bordered on abstraction. MoMA has mined its own collection to present 11 sculptures by the artist as well as drawings, photographs, and archival materials.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Barclays' modest valuation could be compelling proposition.(AP) Barclays was a traditional, Quaker High Street clearing bank whose roots in Britain and its colonies literally went back centuries. The bank was a traditional and commercial bank with branches across the world Barclaycard was the best-known financial brand in the UK. The transformation of Barclays into Britain's only real bulge bracket investment bank began during London's Big Bank in 1986. I had the honour to interview Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd for the Wharton Journal and he literally predicated a transformation in global banking and the Eurobond market we both adored. My own career saw me shuttle between the Wall Street of the Sherman McCoy era and the late Mrs Thatcher's City of London, amid the trading rooms where Ivy League and Oxbridge brats moved billions of dollars of money across the digital arteries of world finance. Sir Martin and Lord Camoys knew that London's Big Bang was a game-changer event even as asset securitisation and the derivative markets changed the DNA of banking, with debt trading and capital markets the hottest game in deregulated Londonium. Not since Sir Sigmund Warburg had such visionary, cosmopolitan financiers built a global investment bank in a mere decade. Barclays exited equities, failed to compete in mergers and acquisitions with the financial gunslingers of Wall Street and incurred huge trading losses in the Asian/Russian meltdowns of 1998. This was the moment Bob Diamond, a Credit Suisse First Boston bond specialist, became chief executive of Barclays Capital and transformed it into Britain's only real bulge bracket global investment bank. I had the privilege of working with and knowing several Barclays Capital executives in London, Geneva, Dubai and Hong Kong and was awed by their prowess in trading fixed income and currencies across the world. It did not surprise me that Barclays Capital contributed 50 per cent of its parent bank's profit even before the multiple traumas of 2008 that culminated in the failure of Lehman Brothers. Bob Diamond's fall was a Sophoclean tragedy too, when hubris found its nemesis in disgrace and failure. Barclay botched a capital raising mission in the Gulf in 2008 to avert naturalisation by HM Treasury and a cap on banker bonuses, the ultimate anathema. Barclays traders were prominent in the post-crisis Libor and foreign exchange rate manipulation scandal. Bob Diamond was grilled by the House of Commons in Westminster and reputedly fired by Dr Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England. Diamond had made untold billions of dollars for Barclays shareholders but failed the basic tenets of risk compliance. Anthony Jenkins, Diamond's successor, failed to reinvent Barclays as a retail bank and lost the confidence of the board and the City's fund managers with his lack of a compelling strategic vision. Jenkins was fired in 2015 and replaced by Jes Staley, an American investment banker who has shed Barclays' African/Middle East and continental Europe footprint to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays still trades at well below tangible book value on the LSE. New York hedge fund Tiger Global has accumulated $1 billion in Barclays shares but has failed to act as a catalyst for a valuation rerating. In an age of Brexit, Barclaycard and its UK retail banking/mortgage business are obviously devalued, eclipsed by the Serious Fraud Office investigation of the 2008 capital raise and the UK mortgage misselling scandal. Barclays' modest valuation below 190 pence seems compelling to me, even in a world where the Stoxx 600 Bank Index has lost 16 per cent and is the worst-performing sector in Europe. True, the bank suffers from the flattening of the US Treasury, British gilt and German Bund yield curves and the old Lehman equities business in New York has hardly set the bottom line on fire. Thankfully, the Crown Court has dismissed criminal charges against Barclays for its 2008 capital raise since a conviction could have cost it its banking licence. Yet fund managers have still not forgiven the bank for its dividend cut or colossal litigation linked losses after the Libor scandal. Barclays paid $2 billion in March 2018 to a Department of Justice probe into the sale of toxic mortgage backed securities to investors. However, all these grim realities are amply reflected in the huge regulatory/litigation risk discount in the shares. The non-core excess baggage is gone. The Basel Tier One capital ratio has been boosted by the restructuring. When will Barclays rerate? Not now. The writer is a global equities strategist and fund manager.

Using ICFs and IFAs to enhance energy efficiency Effective sound control of doors Several U.S. projects are among the shortlisted contenders for this year’s World Architecture Festival (WAF) Awards. Now in its 11th year, the international program received more than 1000 entries from 81 countries. “This has been a terrific year for the WAF Awards, reaching our largest entry total to date,” said Paul Finch, program director. “This has not resulted in any decrease in quality—if anything the opposite. It has been extremely gratifying to review entries from more than 81 different countries and note the way in which architects are absorbing lessons from contemporaries across the world.” The shortlist contains 536 entries across 31 categories. Shortlisted projects represent a variety of building types, including educational institutions, healthcare facilities, hotels, cultural/civic projects, and landscaping. Among the U.S. shortlisted projects is San Francisco’s Studio Dental II, which appears in the Health–Completed Buildings category. Designed by Montalba Architects, the facility is a redesign of a historical building in the city’s financial district, which features modern amenities and aesthetics, while simultaneously remaining true to its historic base. The Form4 Architecture-designed Innovation Curve in Palo Alto’s Stanford Research Park is cited in the category of Office–Completed Buildings. The project, which also made the shortlist in 2014 in the Future Projects category, is an open, flexible workspace design, which features sweeping metal curves that are intended as architectural metaphors for the ups and downs of exploratory research and development. Atlanta’s new Mercedes-Benz Stadium, designed by global design firm HOK, received mention in the Sport–Completed Buildings category. The 71,000-seat facility features eight triangular ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) “petals” that move together along 16 individual tracks, allowing the semitransparent roof to open and close like the aperture of a camera. Other shortlisted U.S. projects include: The United States is among the top five countries entering WAF 2018, alongside China, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The winners will be announced in November at the World Architecture Festival in Amsterdam. In addition to the awards presentation, the three-day event will include keynote addresses from architecture critic and theorist Charles Jencks; Caroline Bos, cofounder/principal urban planner at UNStudio; Aaron Betsky, president of the School of Architecture at Taliesin; and Sir David Adjaye, principal at Adjaye Associates, who recently spoke at AIA Conference on Architecture 2018 in New York City.

""The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,"" de Rossi told Us Weekly. ""I'm not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, 'Oh, now we're finally accepted.' We get the same st as every celebrity couple."" The Arrested Development star and DeGeneres tied the knot in 2008. Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is starting a human-rights organization called Highest Hopes Foundation, Page Six revealed. The rock singer said the nonprofit will support ""communities subject to discrimination or abuse on the basis of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity."" Panic! at the Disco will donate one dollar of each ticket from U.S. dates of its ""Pray for the Wicked Tour"" to Highest Hopes. The tour starts July 11 in Minneapolis and will also visit cities like Chicago, Indianapolis, Tampa and New York City. Urie also announced on June 29 on the Today show that he's pledged a $1 million gift to GLSEN to provide resources, training, and support to students working to create student-led GSA clubs in their K-12 schools, through his foundation, a press release noted. Rolling Stone has released a list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the Century So Farand topping the list is Beyonce's ""Crazy in Love,"" ETCanada.com noted. Filling out the rest of the top five, in order, were ""Paper Planes"" by M.I.A., ""Seven Nation Army"" by The White Stripes, ""Hey Ya!"" by Outkast"" and ""99 Problems"" by Jay-Z. A few of the other songs included Kylie Minogue's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" ( #95 ), Mariah Carey's ""We Belong Together"" ( #87 ), LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"" ( #77 ), Kendrick Lamar's ""DNA"" ( #64 ), Sia's ""Chandelier"" ( #52 ), U2's ""Beautiful Day"" ( #40 ), Outcast's ""Ms. Jackson"" ( #23 ), Adele's ""Rolling in the Deep"" ( #8 ) and Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" ( #14 ). Olympic figure skater and Dancing with the Stars winner Adam Ripponthe first openly gay U.S. athlete to medal in the competitionrecently explained in InStyle how, for him, coming out was ( and still is ) an ongoing process. In part, he stated, ""My coming-out wasn't one moment. It's a process never really ends. Coming out is about about finding out who you are in stages, through moments of self-discovery."" An executive in the luxury Hakkasan nightclub firm, Beth Bartolini, caused controversy after calling Katy Perry BFF and nightlife maven Markus Molinari a ""tr—ny"" in a text messagethen accidentally sending it to him, Page Six noted. Molinari posted the misdirected texts to Instagram, and received support from Hollywood pals Milla Jovovich, Lydia Hearst and Mia Moretti. Molinari posted Bartolini's texts with the caption: ""Normally I wouldn't reply or give any attention to negativity people may say about me because it doesn't effect my universe, but it being PRIDE MONTH and you being a longtime 'friend' I decided to post this because this type of bullying/ignorance/ and just out right mean girl behavior should NEVER be tolerated & should be brought to light."" Bette Midler was accused of homophobia after posting ae tweet about President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Gay Star News noted. ""Trump and Putin are meeting in Finland next month,' she wrote., adding, ""That's a long way to travel for a blowjob, but hey  Putin's got the money."" Some criticized Midler, while others defended her. In 2016, Midler apologized after a transphobic tweet about Caitlyn Jenner.

VH1 announced the grand finalewhich ( spoiler alert ) had New York City native Aquaria winning the titlebroke a ratings record for the Emmy-winning reality series, posting its most-watched conclusion in its nine-year history. Roughly 527,000 viewers in the 18-49 demographic tuned in to watch the finale. Terry Crews said he was threatened with retaliation for speaking out about a sexual assault by a Hollywood agent, saying the producer of The Expendables 4 warned of vague ""troubles"" unless he withdraws his civil suit, according to Deadline.com . In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Crews said Expendables producer Avi Lerner called his manager and asked that the actor to drop his sexual-assault case against Adam Venit in order to appear in the fourth installment of the action film. Lerner himself has been sued for sexual harassment, hostile work environment and gender discrimination by a woman identified only as Jane Roe. On a related note, rapper/actor 50 Cent ridiculed Terry Crews for testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is a survivor of sexual assault, Out.com revealed. The rapper took to Instagram to post a photo of Crews shirtless with the words, ""I got raped / My wife just watched"" and then another photo of Crews with a rose in his mouth that said ""Gym time."" The post has since been taken down. Crews told TMZ of 50's post, ""I prove that size doesn't matter when it comes to sexual assault."" NBC has made a final decision on the show Champions, opting not to renew the freshman comedy for a second season, Deadline noted. Reportedly, there have been discussions with Netflix about picking up the series. Created by Charlie Grandy and Mindy Kaling, Champions centers on Vince ( Anders Holm ), a gym owner who lives with his younger brother, Matthew ( Andy Favreau ), and is on the verge of secretly selling the gym and moving to Florida when his high school fling, Priya ( recurring guest star Kaling ), unexpectedly drops off their 15-year-old son, Michael ( J.J. Totah ) on his doorstep. Totah, who's out, was often applauded for his depiction of an openly gay teen. Lee Daniels has been slapped with a $5 million lawsuit by Roc-A-Fella Records co-founder Damon Dash, who alleges that Daniels stiffed him out of a producer credit on a biopic about legendary comedian Richard Pryor, TheWrap reported. The suit says that attorneys for both sides went back and forth for years in an effort to mediate the situation. Alleging breach of contract and other counts, the suit seeks damages ""in an amount to be determined at trial, but estimated at no less than $5 million."" ""He believed in me when nobody else did,"" Daniels later said of Dash, with a promise to end the lawsuit, Deadline noted. A judge has ordered Sony to disclose the names of people it interviewed as part of an internal investigation into its former Kemosabe Records CEO Dr. Lukefollowing claims by singer Kesha that he raped her, Page Six noted. The record label has previously argued that information is protected by attorney-client privilege, but Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter disagreed in her order, demanding they name names within 20 days. Dr. Lukereal name Lukasz Gottwaldsued Kesha in 2014 after she went public with allegations that he'd raped her. Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse is teaming with tennis champion Serena Williams to fight domestic abuse, ReelChicago.com noted. Since 2005, Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse has empowered more than 1.3 million survivors on the road to safety and security through its educational resources, including The Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse Moving Ahead curriculum. Beginning this summer, Purple Purse will team with female artists in six cities: New York, Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Seattle and Los Angeles; Williams unveiled the first mural, by artist Isabel Castillo Guijarro, in New York City. Sony Music Entertainment announced y that it has signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Prince's estate for 35 previously released albums from the legendary musician's catalog, CBS Los Angeles noted. The music will be distributed by Legacy Recordings, a division of SMEwith worldwide rights beginning immediately for 19 previously released album titles originally released between 1995-2010. However, several of Prince's biggest albums, including Purple Rain, are not part of the new deal due to their status as soundtrack recordings, Complex added. Camila Cabello has become the first artist to top the Billboard pop and adult pop charts with the first two songs from a debut album, according to the publication. Cabello's ""Never Be the Same"" reaced the top of Billboard's Adult Pop Songs radio airplay chart, dated June 30. The set's lead single, ""Havana,"" featuring Young Thug, led Pop Songs for seven weeks ( beginning Dec. 9 ) and Adult Pop Songs for one frame ( March 3 ). Multi-platinum award-winning singer/songwriter and global superstar Josh Groban announced his eighth studio album, Bridges, which will be released on Sept. 21 via Reprise Records, a press release noted. The album is available for pre-order at joshgroban.lnk.to/Bridges, and fans who pre-order the album will receive three downloads of new songs including the new single, ""Granted,"" along with songs ""Symphony"" and ""S'il Suffisait D'Aimer."" The album will also be available as in a deluxe version with two bonus tracks. Oscar winner Jared Leto ( Dallas Buyers Club ) will star in and Daniel Espinosa will direct Morbius, based on the Marvel comic, TheWrap.com noted. The Morbius character was created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane and first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man comic book in 1971. In the comics, Michael Morbius is a Nobel Prize-winning biochemist who is transformed into a vampire while attempting to cure a rare blood disease. A Manhattan judge had a message for Madonna: Stop messing with your neighbors, Page Six noted. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gerald Lebovits said the pop superstar was ""merely harassing"" fellow residents of her Upper West Side co-op for continuing to seek records from the board after she lost a legal bid challenging a rule that required her to be physically present in her $7.3-million home when any of her family or staff are there. Drake has confirmed that he is a fathervia music on his new album, Scorpion, JustJared.com noted. The rumors dropped over a year ago that Drake got former porn star Sophie Brussaux pregnant and now he finally is confirming that he is the father of her baby. On the song ""Emotionless,"" Drake raps, ""I wasn't hiding my kid from the world, I was hiding the world from my kid."" Following a $20-million suit over his song ""Photograph"" ( which was settled out of court ) and another over ""The Rest of Our Life,"" which he composed for Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, singer Ed Sheeran is facing another lawsuit over ""Thinking Out Loud,"" Variety noted. Owners of that song's copyright claims that it lifts from Marvin Gaye's 1972 classic ""Let's Get It On"" and are seeking $100 million in damages. Neon has acquired worldwide rights to Sharp Edges, a 1986 documentary about Tonya Harding competing at the National Figure Skating Championships at the age of 15, Page Six reported. Yale University student Sandra Luckow made the film as part of her senior thesis. It follows Harding going to her first National Figure Skating Championships, where she placed sixth. The movie features interviews with Harding and her mother, LaVona Golden. ( Alison Janney won an Oscar this year for portraying Golden in the film I, Tonya. ) Already facing rape and criminal sex act charges and a potential 25 years behind bars, Harvey Weinstein has been hit with even heavier legal weight from the Manhattan D.A.that could see him in jail for life, Deadline noted. ""A Manhattan Grand Jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York's Penal Law,"" said District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. Joining the two women identified in the previous indictment in late May, the new indictment also includes two counts of predatory sexual assault. In a new interview, Australian actor Guy Pearce suggested that Kevin Spacey inappropriately touched him during their time together filming the 1997 movie L.A. Confidential, TheWrap noted. When asked by TV host Andrew Denton about his time working with Spacey, Pearce said, ""Yeah… yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor; incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He's a handsy guy. ... Thankfully I was 29, and not 14."" Actress Heather Locklear has gone to rehab, according to a Page Six item that cites TMZ. The former Melrose Place star voluntarily agreed to check herself into a long-term treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health issues after she spent time in a psychiatric ward. She was recently arrested after drinking a bottle of tequila, crashing her Porsche at her California mansion and then attacking cops when they arrived. Wynonna Judd's daughter, Grace Pauline Kelley, has been sentenced to eight years in prison after violating probation in November, according to Page Six, which cited Radar Online. The country star's 22-year-old daughter has landed herself time at West Tennessee State Penitentiary after leaving a drug recovery program last year and violating her probation. Jerry Seinfeld questioned ABC's decision to cancel Roseanne Barr's rebooted sitcom in the wake of her incendiary tweet about former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, TheWrap noted. ""I didn't see why it was necessary to fire her,"" Seinfeld told Entertainment Tonight ""Why would you murder someone who's committing suicide? ""I think they should get another Roseanne. They brought Dan Conner backhe was dead and they brought him back. So, why can't we get another Roseanne?""

Tournament winners pictured from left to right are David Turner- A Flight, Danny Daniel-B Flight, Tony Burtt-C Flight, and Brian Martin-D Flight. There were 25 area golfers who left home on Tuesday, June 26 heading to Olde Mill Golf Resort in heavy fog and 100% rain in the forecast to participate in the Laidback Golf Tours first MAJOR of this season. Upon arrival they found the fog lifted and a beautiful seventy degree overcast perfect golfing day. It was like God had an umbrella over the course as clouds and rain mist surrounded the area. The fifty- year old breath-taking Ellis Maples designed course again proved it’s worth giving up only three rounds in the seventies, one eagle and twenty birdies to the entire field. The A Flight had to be determined by a play-off by the same top two finishers from the 2017 event here. Both David Turner and Steve Cummings finished regulation play tied at 76. They proceeded to the par 5 first hole where the both made par. On the second play-off hole a par 3; David Turner claimed his first win of this season as he again made par while Cummings bogied the hole. This was the third year in a row Turner has taken the top spot here at Olde Mill. Turner also claimed a skin with one of his three birdies of the day. Cummings got his fourth second place finish of the season to go along with one win in his five season starts. Johnny Gauldin collected third place with his round of 78. Danny Daniel captured his first win of the season by carding two birdies for a score of 84 in the B Flight. Both his birdies were capped by Turner in the skins game but aided in holding off second place finisher Lyle Heath. Heath who was playing in his first tournament of the season had one birdie on his way to finishing at 86. Tony Burtt shot ten strokes below his average today in the C Flight. Burtt whose average score is 92 posted three birdies today and turned in a score of 82. It was his second lowest round in four seasons on the Tour and gave him his first win since the two he won back in 2016. Mike Reynolds claimed the flight’s second place with his round of 86. This was Reynold’s second outing since joining the Tour. Brian Martin has only played in two tournaments this season due to his work schedule but has won both times. Martin carded one birdie on his way to claiming his second win of the season in D Flight with a score of 87. Jody Myers who won the flight here back in 2016 finished second today with a score of 89. It was Myers first outing of the season also due to heavy work schedule. With double points being awarded today at the Major; Randy McCann was able to pass Bob Foyle and Willard Vicks slightly in the season points race. McCann now leads with 1650 points; followed by Foyle with 1640 and Vicks at 1600. The Tours next tournament is scheduled for Tuesday July 10 at Southern Hills in Danville beginning at 10am.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Sarah Butcher 28 June 2018 Bob Diamond is a busy man. After taking over loss-making British stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon in March 2017, the former CEO of Barclays this week invested in Kepler Cheuvreux, a French brokerage firm created from the combination of the former equity brokerage arms of Crédit Agricole, Julius Baer, UniCredit, Dexia, Swedbank and Rabobank. Diamond now owns 27.7% of Kepler Cheuvreux in a deal funded by his Atlas Merchant Capital investment vehicle and by Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies. - He's up to something. That something may well involve expanding his new mid-cap empire. Diamond's hiring intentions at Panmure are well known. In April, the British bank hired Bill Dale, formerly head of research at Nomura, to expand its coverage of small and mid-cap companies in the UK. In May, Panmure also let it be known that it plans to double its UK headcount as it pushes into corporate finance. What's less well known is that there's been quite a lot of hiring at Panmure already. Analysis of the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) register suggests that the number of registered employees at Panmure has risen 17% since Diamond took the helm 15 months ago. Following the addition of 13 people, Panmure Gordon now has 88 UK registered employees in total. Recent additions include Emma Earl as a director in corporate finance (formerly of Cairn Financial Advisors), Charles Lesser as head of natural resources banking (formerly of Macquarie), Matthew Webb as an equity researcher covering food and beverages (also formerly of Macquarie), and Sandra Bjorck as an associate in the investment bank. There have also been a handful of exits, including Duncan Monteith, a healthcare banker who went to Numis, and Mark McGuinness, a sales trader who left in February 2018 and has yet to resurface. Even so, the direction of travel is clear. Not everyone at Kepler Cheuvreux is enamoured of their new part-owner. ""Everything in the press concerning us is now about Bob Diamond,"" says one senior employee at the French firm. ""But he is just one of several shareholders and doesn't have the controlling vote. Our aspirations are much bigger than Bob."" Laurent Quirin, chairman of Kepler's advisory board, said Diamond's investment will help the brokerage expand globally in an environment where MiFID II and bank disintermediation are creating opportunities. Kepler's traditional method of growth has been to create alliances with banks looking to outsource business areas, although Quirin said there may be organic growth too. Some market observers have suggested that Diamond could look to combine Panmure and Kepler - a move which could lead to layoffs in London, where both firms have equity brokerage staff. The insiders we spoke to suggested this is unlikely, however. ""This is just about growth,"" said one. ""Kepler is looking for expansion opportunities both internally and through external alliances."" Have a confidential story, tip, or comment you’d like to share?

Ex-Barclays CEO Bob Diamond’s investment vehicle Atlas Merchant Capital and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild’s equity strategy arm have acquired stakes in French brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux. Atlas acquired a 19.7% stake in Kepler Cheuvreux, while Edmond de Rothschild Equity Strategies (ERES) acquired an interest of 8%. Purchase prices were not revealed. Last year, Atlas partnered Qatari investment firm Qinvest to buy UK-based stockbroker Panmure Gordon. Atlas managing director and head of UK and European business Matthew Hansen said: “The decision to invest in Kepler Cheuvreux was based on an analysis of their market leading positions in pan-European Research, Advisory and Execution. In Research, which is the cornerstone of their business, they have the largest research coverage in mainland Europe and are prospering in the post Mifid II research environment. “The Advisory business is perfectly suited to the firm’s partnership model. In Execution, they have an algorithmic trading capability which competes head-to-head with the global brokers.” The French broker also has equity capital markets partnerships with UniCredit, Credit Agricole CIB, Rabobank, Swedbank and Belfius. Italian lender UniCredit has now increased its stake from 5.2% to 10.3% in Kepler Cheuvreux, while French private equity firm BlackFin Capital Partners and its co-investors have offloaded their stake. The shareholding changes are subject to regulatory nod. Kepler Cheuvreux chairman of the supervisory board Laurent Quirin said: “We now look to leverage the contacts and expertise of Atlas Merchant Capital and Bob Diamond, its founding partner and CEO, on a global scale. “Both Atlas and ERES will help us to invest in our organic expansion and in our targeted acquisition strategy. We believe that Mifid II and bank disintermediation create opportunities. We envisage signing more alliances with banks which are looking to outsource processes or businesses.” Kepler Cheuvreux offers research, execution and advisory services. The group employs nearly 550 staff across offices in Paris, Amsterdam, Boston, Brussels, Frankfurt, Geneva, London, Madrid, Milan, New York, Oslo, Stockholm, Vienna, and Zurich.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Thu 28 Jun 2018 01.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 4 Jul 2018 06.14 EDT ‘Guys, you’ve got to hear this,” I said. I was sitting in front of my computer one day in July 2012, with one eye on a screen of share prices and the other on a live stream of the House of Commons Treasury select committee hearings. As the Barclays share price took a graceful swan dive, I pulled my headphones out of the socket and turned up the volume so everyone could hear. My colleagues left their terminals and came around to watch BBC Parliament with me. It didn’t take long to realise what was happening. “Bob’s getting murdered,” someone said. Bob Diamond, the swashbuckling chief executive of Barclays, had been called before the committee to explain exactly what his bank had been playing at in regards to the Libor rate-fixing scandal. The day before his appearance, he had made things very much worse by seeming to accuse the deputy governor of the Bank of England of ordering him to fiddle an important benchmark, then walking back the accusation as soon as it was challenged. He was trying to turn on his legendary charm in front of a committee of angry MPs, and it wasn’t working. On our trading floor, in Mayfair, calls were coming in from all over the City. Investors needed to know what was happening and whether the damage was reparable. A couple of weeks later, the damage was done. The money was gone, Diamond was out of a job and the market, as it always does, had moved on. We were left asking ourselves: How did we get it so wrong? At the time I was working for a French stockbroking firm, on the team responsible for the banking sector. I was the team’s regulation specialist. I had been aware of “the Libor affair”, and had written about it on several occasions during the previous months. My colleagues and I had assumed that it would be the typical kind of regulatory risk for the banks – a slap on the wrist, a few hundred million dollars of fines, no more than that. The first puzzle was that, to start with, it looked like we were right. By the time it caught the attention of the mainstream media, the Libor scandal had reached what would usually be the end of the story – the announcement, on 27 June 2012, of a regulatory sanction. Barclays had admitted a set of facts, made undertakings not to do anything similar again, and agreed to pay fines of £59.5m to the UK’s Financial Services Authority, $200m to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and a further $160m to the US Department of Justice. That’s how these things are usually dealt with. If anything, it was considered quite a tough penalty. But the Libor case marked the beginning of a new process for the regulators. As well as publishing their judgment, they gave a long summary of the evidence and reasoning that led to their decision. In the case of the Libor fines, the majority of that evidence took the form of transcripts of emails and Bloomberg chat. Bloomberg’s trading terminals – the $50,000-a-year news and financial-data servers that every trader uses – have an instant-messaging function in addition to supplying prices and transmitting news. Financial market professionals are vastly more addicted to this chat than tween girls are to Instagram, and many of them failed to realise that if you discussed illegal activity on this medium, you were making things easy for the authorities. The transcripts left no room for doubt. Trader C: “The big day [has] arrived … My NYK are screaming at me about an unchanged 3m libor. As always, any help wd be greatly appreciated. What do you think you’ll go for 3m?” Submitter: “I am going 90 altho 91 is what I should be posting.” Trader C: “[…] when I retire and write a book about this business your name will be written in golden letters […]”. Submitter: “I would prefer this [to] not be in any book!” Perhaps it’s unfair to judge the Libor conspirators on their chat records; few of the journalists who covered the story would like to see their own Twitter direct-message history paraded in front of an angry public. Trading, for all its bluster, is basically a service industry, and there is no service industry anywhere in the world whose employees don’t blow off steam by acting out or insulting the customers behind their backs. But traders tend to have more than the usual level of self-confidence, bordering on arrogance. And in a general climate in which the public was both unhappy with the banking industry and unimpressed with casual banter about ostentatious displays of wealth, the Libor transcripts appeared crass beyond belief. Every single popular stereotype about traders was confirmed. An abstruse and technical set of regulatory breaches suddenly became a morality play, a story of swaggering villains who fixed the market as if it was a horse race. The politicians could hardly have failed to get involved. It is not a pleasant thing to see your industry subjected to criticism that is at once overheated, ill-informed and entirely justified. In 2012, the financial sector finally got the kind of enemies it deserved. The popular version of events might have been oversimplified and wrong in lots of technical detail, but in the broad sweep, it was right. The nuanced and technical version of events which the specialists obsessed over might have been right on the detail, but it missed one utterly crucial point: a massive crime of dishonesty had taken place. There was a word for what had happened, and that word was fraud. For a period of months, it seemed to me as if the more you knew about the Libor scandal, the less you understood it. That’s how we got it so wrong. We were looking for incidental breaches of technical regulations, not systematic crime. And the thing is, that’s normal. The nature of fraud is that it works outside your field of vision, subverting the normal checks and balances so that the world changes while the picture stays the same. People in financial markets have been missing the wood for the trees for as long as there have been markets. Some places in the world are what they call “low-trust societies”. The political institutions are fragile and corrupt, business practices are dodgy, debts are rarely repaid and people rightly fear being ripped off on any transaction. In the “high-trust societies”, conversely, businesses are honest, laws are fair and consistently enforced, and the majority of people can go about their day in the knowledge that the overall level of integrity in economic life is very high. With that in mind, and given what we know about the following two countries, why is it that the Canadian financial sector is so fraud-ridden that Joe Queenan, writing in Forbes magazine in 1989, nicknamed Vancouver the “Scam Capital of the World”, while shipowners in Greece will regularly do multimillion-dollar deals on a handshake? We might call this the “Canadian paradox”. There are different kinds of dishonesty in the world. The most profitable kind is commercial fraud, and commercial fraud is parasitical on the overall health of the business sector on which it preys. It is much more difficult to be a fraudster in a society in which people only do business with relatives, or where commerce is based on family networks going back centuries. It is much easier to carry out a securities fraud in a market where dishonesty is the rare exception rather than the everyday rule. The existence of the Canadian paradox suggests that there is a specifically economic dimension to a certain kind of crime of dishonesty. Trust – particularly between complete strangers, with no interactions beside relatively anonymous market transactions – is the basis of the modern industrial economy. And the story of the development of the modern economy is in large part the story of the invention and improvement of technologies and institutions for managing that trust. And as industrial society develops, it becomes easier to be a victim. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith described how prosperity derived from the division of labour – the 18 distinct operations that went into the manufacture of a pin, for example. While this was going on, the modern world also saw a growing division of trust. The more a society benefits from the division of labour in checking up on things, the further you can go into a con game before you realise that you’re in one. In the case of several dealers in the Libor market, by the time anyone realised something was crooked, they were several billions of dollars in over their heads. In hindsight, the Libor system was always a shoddy piece of work. Some not-very-well-paid clerks from the British Bankers’ Association would call up a few dozen banks and ask: “If you were to borrow, say, a million dollars in [a given currency] for a 30-day deposit, what would you expect to pay?” A deposit, in this context, is a short-term loan from one bank to another. Due to customers’ inconvenient habit of borrowing from one bank and putting the money in an account at another, banks are constantly left with either surplus customer deposits, or a shortage of funds. The “London inter-bank offered-rate” (Libor) market is where they sort this out by borrowing from and lending to each other, at the “offered rate” of interest. Once they had their answers, the clerks would throw away the highest and lowest outliers and calculate the average of the rest, which would be recorded as “30-day Libor” for that currency. The process would be repeated for three-month loans, six-month loans and any other periods of interest, and the rates would be published. You would then have a little table recording the state of the market on that day – you could decide which currency you wanted to borrow in, and how long you wanted the use of the money, and the Libor panel would give you a good sense of what high-quality banks were paying to do the same. Compared with the amount of time and effort that goes into the systems for nearly everything else that banks do, not very much trouble was taken over this process. Other markets rose and fell, stock exchanges mutated and were taken over by super-fast robots, but the Libor rate for the day was still determined by a process that could be termed “a quick ring-around”. Nobody noticed until it was too late that hundreds of trillions of dollars of the world economy rested on a number compiled by the few dozen people in the world with the greatest incentive to fiddle it. It started to fall apart with the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, and all the more so after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when banks were so scared that they effectively stopped lending to each other. Although the market was completely frozen, the daily Libor ring-around still took place, and banks still gave, almost entirely speculatively, answers to the question “If you were to borrow a reasonable sum, what would you expect to pay?” But the daily quotes were published, and that meant everyone could see what everyone else was saying about their funding costs. And one of the telltale signs that a bank in trouble is when its funding costs start to rise. If your Libor submission is taken as an indicator of whether you’re in trouble or not, you really don’t want to be the highest number on the daily list. Naturally, then, quite a few banks started using the Libor submission process as a form of false advertising, putting in a lowballed quote in order to make it look like they were still obtaining money easily when, in fact, they could hardly borrow at all. And so it came to pass that several banks created internal message trails saying, in effect, “Dear Lowly Employee, for the benefit of the bank and its shareholders, please start submitting a lower Libor quote, signed Senior Executive”. This turned out to be a silly thing to do. All this was known at the time. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal about it. I used to prepare PowerPoint slides with charts on them that had gaps for the year 2008 because the data was “somewhat hypothetical”. Even earlier, in late 2007, the Bank of England held a “liaison group” meeting so that representatives from the banks could discuss the issue of Libor reporting. What nobody seemed to realise is that an ongoing fraud was being committed. There was a conspiracy to tell a lie (to the Libor phone panel, about a bank’s true cost of funding) in order to induce someone to enter into a bargain at a disadvantage to themselves. The general public caught on to all this a lot quicker than the experts did, which put the last nail in the coffin of the already weakened trust in the financial system. You could make a case that a lot of the populist politics of the subsequent decade can be traced back to the Libor affair. Libor teaches us a valuable lesson about commercial fraud – that unlike other crimes, it has a problem of denial as well as one of detection. There are very few other criminal acts where the victim not only consents to the criminal act, but voluntarily transfers the money or valuable goods to the criminal. And the hierarchies, status distinctions and networks that make up a modern economy also create powerful psychological barriers against seeing fraud when it is happening. White-collar crime is partly defined by the kind of person who commits it: a person of high status in the community, the kind of person who is always given the benefit of the doubt. In popular culture, the fraudster is the “confidence man”, somewhere between a stage magician and the trickster gods of mythology. In films such as The Sting and Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, they are master psychologists, exploiting the greed and myopia of their victims, and creating a world of illusion. People like this do exist (albeit rarely). But they are not typical of white-collar criminals. The interesting questions are never about individual psychology. There are plenty of larger-than-life characters. But there are also plenty of people like Enron’s Jeff Skilling and Baring’s Nick Leeson: aggressively dull clerks and managers whose only interest derives from the disasters they caused. And even for the real craftsmen, the actual work is, of necessity, incredibly prosaic. The way most white-collar crime works is by manipulating institutional psychology. That means creating something that looks as much as possible like a normal set of transactions. The drama comes later, when it all unwinds. Fraudsters don’t play on moral weaknesses, greed or fear; they play on weaknesses in the system of checks and balances – the audit processes that are meant to supplement an overall environment of trust. One point that comes up again and again when looking at famous and large-scale frauds is that, in many cases, everything could have been brought to a halt at a very early stage if anyone had taken care to confirm all the facts. But nobody does confirm all the facts. There are just too bloody many of them. Even after the financial rubble has settled and the arrests been made, this is a huge problem. It is a commonplace of law enforcement that commercial frauds are difficult to prosecute. In many countries, proposals have been made, and sometimes passed into law, to remove juries from complex fraud trials, or to move the task of dealing with them out of the criminal justice system and into regulatory or other non-judicial processes. Such moves are understandable. There is a need to be seen to get prosecutions and to maintain confidence in the whole system. However, taking the opinions of the general public out of the question seems to me to be a counsel of despair. When analysed properly, there isn’t much that is truly difficult about the proverbial “complex fraud trial”. The underlying crime is often surprisingly crude: someone did something dishonest and enriched themselves at the expense of others. What makes white-collar trials so arduous for jurors is really their length, and the amount of detail that needs to be brought for a successful conviction. Such trials are not long and detailed because there is anything difficult to understand. They are long and difficult because so many liars are involved, and when a case has a lot of liars, it takes time and evidence to establish that they are lying. This state of affairs is actually quite uncommon in the criminal justice system. Most trials only have a couple of liars in the witness box, and the question is a simple one of whether the accused did it or not. In a fraud trial, rather than denying responsibility for the actions involved, the defendant is often insisting that no crime was committed at all, that there is an innocent interpretation for everything. In January this year, the construction giant Carillion collapsed. Although they had issued a profits warning last summer, they continued to land government contracts. It was assumed that, since they had been audited by KPMG, one of the big-four accounting firms, any serious problems would have been spotted. At the time of writing, nobody has been prosecuted over the collapse of Carillion. Maybe nobody will and maybe nobody should. It’s possible, after all, for a big firm to go bust, even really suddenly, without it being a result of anything culpable. But the accounting looks weird – at the very least, they seem to have recognised revenue a long time before it actually arrived. It’s not surprising that the accounting standards bodies are asking some questions. So are the Treasury select committee: one MP told a partner at KPMG that “I would not hire you to do an audit of the contents of my fridge.” In general, cases of major fraud should have been prevented by auditors, whose specific job it is to review every set of accounts as a neutral outside party, and certify that they are a true and fair view of the business. But they don’t always do this. Why not? The answer is simple: some auditors are willing to bend the rules, and some are too easily fooled. And whatever reforms are made to the accounting standards and to the rules governing the profession, the same problems have cropped up again and again. First, there is the problem that the vast majority of auditors are both honest and competent. This is a good thing, of course, but the bad thing about it is that it means that most people have never met a crooked or incompetent auditor, and therefore have no real understanding that such people exist. To find a really bad guy at a big-four accountancy firm, you have to be quite unlucky (or quite lucky if that was what you were looking for). But as a crooked manager of a company, churning around your auditors until you find a bad ’un is exactly what you do – and when you find one, you hang on to them. This means that the bad auditors are gravitationally drawn into auditing the bad companies, while the majority of the profession has an unrepresentative view of how likely that could be. Second, there is the problem that even if an auditor is both honest and competent, he has to have a spine, or he might as well not be. Fraudsters can be both persistent and overbearing, and not all the people who went into accountancy firms out of university did so because they were commanding, alpha-type personalities. Added to this, fraudsters are really keen on going over auditors’ heads and complaining to their bosses at the accounting firm, claiming that the auditor is being unhelpful and bureaucratic, not allowing the CEO to use his legitimate judgment in presenting the results of his own business. Partly because auditors are often awful stick-in-the-muds and arse-coverers, and partly because auditing is a surprisingly competitive and unprofitable business that is typically used as a loss-leader to sell more remunerative consulting and IT work, you can’t assume that the auditor’s boss will support their employee, even though the employee is the one placing their signature (and the reputation of the whole practice) on the set of accounts. As with several other patterns of behaviour that tend to generate frauds, the dynamic by which a difficult audit partner gets overruled or removed happens so often, and reproduces itself so exactly, that it must reflect a fairly deep and ubiquitous incentive problem that will be very difficult to remove. By way of a second line of defence, investors and brokerage firms often employ their own “analysts” to critically read sets of published accounts. The analyst is meant to be an industry expert, with enough financial training to read company accounts and to carry out valuations of companies and other assets. Although their primary job is to identify profitable opportunities in securities trading – shares or bonds that are either very undervalued or very overvalued – it would surely seem to be the case that part of this job would involve the identification of companies that are very overvalued because they are frauds. Well, sometimes it works. A set of fraudulent accounts will often generate “tells”. In particular, fraudsters in a hurry, or with limited ability to browbeat the auditors, will not be able to fake the balance sheet to match the way they have faked the profits. Inflated sales might show up as having been carried out without need for inventories, and without any trace of the cash they should have generated. Analysts are also often good at spotting practices such as “channel stuffing”, when a company (usually one with a highly motivated and target-oriented sales force) sells a lot of product to wholesalers and intermediaries towards the end of the quarter, booking sales and moving inventory off its books. This makes growth look good in the short term, at the expense of future sales. Often, an honest auditor who has buckled under pressure will include a cryptic-looking passage of legalese, buried in the notes to the accounts, explaining what accounting treatment has been used, and hoping that someone will read it and understand that the significance of this note is that all of the headline numbers are fake. Nearly all of the fraudulent accounting policies adopted by Enron could have been deduced from its public filings if you knew where to look. More common is the situation that prevailed in the period immediately preceding the global financial crisis.Analysts occasionally noticed that some things didn’t add up, and said so, and one or two of them wrote reports that, if taken seriously, could have been seen as prescient warnings. The problem is that spotting frauds is difficult and, for the majority of investors, not worth expending the effort on. That means it is not worth it for most analysts, either. Frauds are rare. Frauds that can be spotted by careful analysis are even rarer. And frauds that are also large enough to offer serious rewards for betting against them come along roughly once every business cycle, in waves. Analysts are also subject to very similar pressures to those that cause auditors to compromise their principles. Anyone accusing a company publicly of being a fraud is taking a big risk, and can expect significant retaliation. It is well to remember that frauds generally look like very successful companies, and there are sound accounting reasons for this. It is not just that once you have decided to fiddle the accounts you might as well make them look great rather than mediocre. If you are extracting cash fraudulently, you usually need to be growing the fake earnings at a higher rate. So people who are correctly identifying frauds can often look like they are jealously attacking success. Frauds also tend to carry out lots of financial transactions and pay large commissions to investment banks, all the while making investors believe they are rich. The psychological barriers against questioning a successful CEO are not quite as powerful as those against questioning the honesty of a doctor or lawyer, but they are substantial. And finally, most analysts’ opinions are not read. A fraudster does not have to fool everyone; he just needs to fool enough people to get his money. If you are looking to the financial system to protect investors, you are going to end up being disappointed. But this is inevitable. Investors don’t want to be protected from fraud; they want to invest. Since the invention of stock markets, there has been surprisingly little correlation between the amount of fraud in a market and the return to investors. It’s been credibly estimated that in the Victorian era, one in six companies floated on the London Stock Exchange was a fraud. But people got rich. It’s the Canadian paradox. Although in the short term, you save your money by checking everything out, in the long term, success goes to those who trust.

1011876,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"German-born conductor Christian Reif, described as ""the complete package"" by the San Francisco Chronicle, makes his New York conducting debut on Thursday, August 2, 2018 at 7:30 pm at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College, part of Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival. A former conducting student of Alan Gilbert at The Juilliard School, Reif leads the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE) in a program celebrating the fusion of piano and technology, centered around John Adams's Grand Pianola Music. The concert also includes Courtney Bryan's Songs of Laughing, Smiling, and Crying and a newly revised version of George Lewis's epic chamber piece Voyager using Artificial Intelligence technology. One of the most promising conducting talents of his generation, Christian Reif is currently the Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony and Music Director of the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra. He began his tenure in San Francisco during the 2016-17 season following two years in Miami as Conducting Fellow with the New World Symphony, working closely with Michael Tilson Thomas. His April 2018 San Francisco Symphony subscription concerts prompted Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle to write: ""He's a conductor of considerable stature, and everything felt like the work of a significant musical artist."" In the 2018-19 season, Reif will conduct Prokofiev's Symphony No. 5 and the world premiere of Andrew Norman's Cello Concerto with Johannes Moser on subscription with the San Francisco Symphony and a program that includes works by Britten, Shostakovich and Haydn with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra. Additionally, he will make debuts with the Indianapolis Symphony, Omaha Symphony, and Hong Kong Philharmonic and return to work with the Berkeley Symphony and San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He will also conduct a production of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci at Opera San Jose and a new chamber version of John Adams's El Niño with the American Modern Opera Company as part the Metropolitan Museum of Art's MetLiveArts series in New York. In the 2017-18 season, Reif made a highly praised subscription debut with the San Francisco Symphony and led concerts with the Orchestre National de Lyon, Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz, Brucknerorchester Linz and Berkeley Symphony. As part of his duties as Resident Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony, Reif regularly conducts the orchestra in many different concert formats, including performances of Hansel and Gretel, an Oktoberfest concert, and two successful Soundbox shows - the orchestra's cutting-edge late-night series. Previous performance highlights include the Juilliard Orchestra, Israel Chamber Orchestra, Nürnberger Symphoniker, Meininger Hofkapelle, Georgian Chamber Orchestra, Salzburg Chamber Soloists and the Munich Chamber Opera in performances of Mozart's La finta semplice. Reif was a Conducting Fellow at the Tanglewood Music Center in the summers of 2015 and 2016. During his time there, he stepped in for Seiji Ozawa to conduct the Seiji Ozawa International Academy Switzerland, and he led the TMC Orchestra in Shostakovich's 14th Symphony with soprano Dawn Upshaw, baritone Sanford Sylvan and TMC vocalists. He has worked as cover conductor for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, and New York Philharmonic at the NY PHIL BIENNIAL. Reif's enthusiasm in performing contemporary music has led to several world premieres. Among those are Michael Gordon's El Sol Caliente - a city symphony in honor of Miami Beach's centennial - and concertos for DJ and orchestra performed at New World Symphony PULSE events where the concert hall is transformed into a nightclub. A dedicated and enthusiastic educator, Reif has taught piano, and he coaches instrumentalists and works with singers as a répétiteur. He has worked as a Teaching Fellow in the Juilliard School's Ear Training Department and a Music Master Teacher in Miami's National YoungArts Foundation. In his work at the New World Symphony from 2014 to 2016, he regularly hosted and conducted the orchestra's education concerts which were viewed by a global online audience. Christian Reif studied with Alan Gilbert at the Juilliard School, where he completed his Master of Music in Conducting in 2014 and received the Charles Schiff Conducting Award. Prior to that, he studied with Dennis Russell Davies at the Mozarteum Salzburg, where he received a diploma in 2012. He is winner of the 2015 German Operetta Prize, awarded by the German Music Council, and two Kulturförderpreise awards given to promising artists of the region who promote cultural advancement in their communities. Reif is a member of Germany's Conductor's Forum (Dirigentenforum) and is one of the forum's 2017-18 and 2018-19 featured ""Maestros of Tomorrow"".

Image: SWPix Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) will wear the stripes of British national time trial champion in the year ahead, having bettered second place rider Harry Tanfield (Canyon-Eisburg) by over half a minute. Tanfield – who had trained on the roads and knew them well – crossed the line in 49 minutes 31 seconds to Thomas’ 48-54. Third place went to five-time National champion, Alex Dowsett (Team Katusha-Alpecin) in 49-48. Defending champion Steve Cummings (Team Dimension Data) did not take to the start line of the 39.7 kilometre course. Tao Geoghegan Hart (Team Sky) set a benchmark at the first intermediate time check, with a time of 18-14. Tanfield was the first rider to post a faster split of 17-38. Tanfield – like his brother Charlie who won the under-23 race – had trained on the course, but Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) showed his post Critérium du Dauphiné form by cruising through in 17-25. Dowsett was not able to match the pace, at 17-45. The second intermediate time check saw Thomas clock 31-16, to Tanfield’s 31-46, Dowsett continuing to lose time to his rivals with 32-03. At the finish, John Archibald (Ribble Cycling) was left in the hot seat for a considerable period, with a finishing time of 50-41. Even Geoghegan Hart – who posted an intermediate time check 15 seconds faster – was not able to better him, clocking a finish time of 51-00 to hold second place until the leaders rolled in. The first rider to knock Archibald off the top spot was Tanfield, but Thomas quickly followed, with Dowsett eventually pushing him off the podium. Archibald was able to hold on to fourth – still an impressive performance for the Scottish rider. Last year’s under-23 champion, Chris Lawless (Team Sky) did not make it to the finish, with reports suggesting he crashed out during the race. “It’s great. Winning Dauphiné was a big boost. I’ve done a good bit of training since and to come here and win the nationals for the first time is great,” Thomas commented after the race. “I’m really happy. I was confident but I really didn’t know what to expect. Obviously Tanfield has been riding really well this year and Dowsett, it’s what he does. “Time trial in the UK is a strong discipline anyway – to come and win is super nice. It’s going to be great, especially in the Tour, to wear that jersey. I won the road race a few years ago and to add the time trial to it is really nice.” 1 Geraint Thomas (Team Sky) in 48-54-78 2 Harry Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), at 37s 3 Alex Dowsett (Team Katusha-Alpecin), at 54s 4 John Archibald (Ribble Cycling), at 1-47 5 James Gullen (JLT Condor), at 2-03 6 Tao Geoghagen Hart (Team Sky), at 2-05 7 Jonathan Dibben (Team Sky), at 2-05 8 Daniel Bigham (Ribble Cycling), at 2-30 9 Ashley Cox (Flamme Rouge Cycling Team), at 2-49 10 Connor Swift (Madison Genesis), at 3-03 Charlie Tanfield at the National Time Trial The under-23 men’s title went to Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), who covered the 28.6km course in 36-01. The 21-year-oldwas joined on the podium by a surprising addition of Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling) who clocked in at 36-29, with the less surprising podium appearance of Tom Pidcock (Team Wiggins) rounding off the podium in 37-23. Tanfield placed third in the competition last year, but has had an exceptional season, already taking World and Commonwealth titles in the team and individual pursuit respectively. >>> British National Road Race course Tanfield said after the race: “It’s a local course for me so I’ve spent the last few weeks riding on it on most days.” “I knew exactly what I wanted to do coming into it and how I wanted to ride it so it’s about executing the plan and making sure nothing went wrong on the day. “I’m really happy to have finished it off today, I had two road targets this year – the national time trial and trying to get to the worlds as well. I wanted to show everyone what I could do – it’s my last year in the U23s as well and I wanted to make the most of it.” 1 Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg) in 36-01-85 2 Charlie Quarterman (Leopard Pro Cycling), at 27s 3 Thomas Pidcock (Team Wiggins), at 1-21 4 Ethan Hayter (100% Me), at 1-23 5 Robert Scott (Team Wiggins), at 1-33 6 Matt Langworthy (Saint Piran, at 1-41 7 Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling), at 1-45 8 Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins), at 1-47 9 Joey Walker (Team Wiggins), at 1-54 10 William Perret (University of Derby Cycling Club), at 1-54 The British Road National Championships continue on Sunday, with the women’s and men’s events taking place on the same day.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"3 Min Read * Kepler: eyeing possible acquisitions, IPO * Bob Diamond’s Atlas Merchant to take stake * Edmond de Rothschild firm also buys stake in Kepler * UniCredit ups stake in Kepler to 10.3 pct vs 5.2 pct By Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard PARIS, June 27 (Reuters) - Paris-based independent brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux said on Wednesday that former Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Swiss private bank Edmond de Rothschild had agreed to take minority stakes in the firm, which has eyes on a possible flotation. Atlas Merchant Capital, the firm Diamond co-founded in 2013 after his departure from Barclays, will buy a 19.7 percent stake, while Edmond de Rothschild will take 8 percent. Kepler added it was counting on its new partners to help it keep growing through acquisitions, and did not rule out looking for potential targets in the United Kingdom once Brexit terms were clearer, or in the United States. Kepler, which has grown rapidly over the past 10 years through purchases and partnerships with large European banks such as Italy’s UniCredit, also said it could ultimately carry out an initial public offering (IPO) within the next five years. “It’s not unthinkable, it’s part of our plans,” Laurent Quirin, the chairman of Kepler’s supervisory board, told reporters. “We’d need to keep on growing at a good pace.” Kepler did not give financial details of the transactions. As the new investors come in, French-based private equity fund Blackfin Capital Partners, which held 19.7 percent, and French bank Credit Mutuel ARKEA, which held 4.2 percent, will sell out of their current holdings. The company’s management will reduce the stake it holds collectively to 25.5 percent from 31.9 percent, although they will keep 40 percent of the voting rights. UniCredit, meanwhile, will raise its stake in the brokerage to 10.3 percent from 5.2 percent, while French state-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC) will trim its holding to 5.2 percent from 7.8 percent. Since Kepler’s management bought out the company in 2009, its revenue has jumped fivefold, reaching 252 million euros ($294 million) in 2017. It is expected to hit 270 million euros this year with a 40 million net profit, Quirin said. $1 = 0.8585 euros Reporting by Inti Landauro and Matthieu Protard; Editing by Sarah White/Sudip Kar-Gupta All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The new acquisition represents one percent but brings its holding in the bank to 49 percent and signposts Atlas Mara’s intent to maintain its presence in Nigeria and perhaps, also a bigger plan for the Nigerian economy, say analysts covering the banking industry. The financial services company said it was pleased “that it has agreed to acquire an additional 280,956,166 shares of Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, approximately a 1.0% shareholding in UBN, following which its combined direct and indirect shareholding in UBN will increase to 49.0% from 48.0%. The company will issue 2,360,032 ordinary shares as consideration for the UBN shares acquired,” it said in a statement. It also said it had made applications for the new shares to be admitted to the official list of the UK Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange, noting that “admission is expected to become effective, and dealings in the new shares are expected to commence, at 8:00 am BST on 27 June 2018.” The new shares are expected to rank pari passu with the existing ordinary shares. “Following admission of the new shares, the company will have 174,618,767 ordinary shares in issue, of which 1,545,764 shares are in treasury and 3,298,298 shares are held in escrow as part of the contingent consideration for the acquisition of Finance Bank Zambia Limited, as disclosed to the market on 1 July 2016. Atlas Mara hereby confirms that the total number of voting rights in Atlas Mara is 169,774,705. This figure should be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the company under the FCA’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules,” the statement concluded.

1016437,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Course Schedule How to follow Rider Timings Elite men Steve Cummings, winner of both the road race and time trial at the National Road Championships in 2017, will return as he looks to defend his title in Northumberland on Thursday. Five-time national time trial champion, Alex Dowsett will start as another favourite in the elite men’s time trial this week. The Katusha-Alpecin rider will be looking to improve on recent good form in time trials during the Giro d’Italia and Tour of Slovenia. 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné winner Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), who is fine form will be looking to cause an upset and add another British champion jersey to his collection before taking on the Tour de France in July. An intense challenge will most certainly come from last year’s bronze medallist James Gullen (JLT Condor) and 2018 Commonwealth Games silver medallist Harry Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg). Cummings’ Team Dimension Data team mate and four-time under 23 National Time Trial champions Scott Davies will also compete in the elite men’s category for the first time. Start list Elite women Hannah Barnes (Canyon SRAM Racing) who finished second in last years’ time trial and Dani Rowe MBE (WaowDeals Pro Cycling) who secured the best British rider in the Women’s Tour earlier this month are two notable early favourites to win the national champions jersey. Two-time national time trial champion Hayley Simmonds (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) will return to challenge for her third title. Last year’s winner in the elite women’s time trial Claire Rose (Cervélo-Bigla Pro Cycling) and third placed Katie Archibald (WNT Rotor Pro Cycling Team) are both notable absentees from this year’s start list, both currently recovering from injury. Anna Christian (Trek-Drops) the 22-year-old will be looking to have a big impact against her older competitors, using her gold medal in the under-23 championship from last year as motivation. Multiple Paralympic champion Dame Sarah Storey will also ride the 28.6km course in Northumberland alongside her Storey Racing team mates Neah Evans and Melissa Lowther. Start list Under-23 men Thomas Baylis (One Pro Cycling) and Charlie Tanfield (Canyon Eisberg), second and third placed in 2017 respectively will dreaming of wearing the national jersey come Thursday with the exclusion of Scott Davies (Team Dimension Data). Four-time winner Davies has had a stronghold on the jersey in the under-23 time trial championship for the last four years consecutively, and this year steps up to compete in the elite men’s competition. Having recently being promoted to the Great Britain Cycling Team Podium Programme, Ethan Hayter will be looking to impress alongside his 100% ME team mates Matthew Bostock and Joe Holt. Gabriel Cullaigh (Team Wiggins) winner of this year’s Rutland - Melton Cicle Classic is another one to watch alongside team mate and one of cyclists most promising talents, Thomas Pidcock. Start list The women and under-23 men will complete two laps of the course, while the elite men will race three. This year’s event will both start and finish at the 17th-century historic country mansion and Grade II-listed Kirkley Hall, near Ponteland. The men and women will ride the same P-shaped, course, with the senior men completing three laps and the women and under-23 men completing two. The course starts in the grounds of Kirkley Hall before heading north past Kirkley Cycles, Shilvington and up to the Gubeon where it turns right towards Tranwell. It then heads south over Saltwick Hill and down to Twizzell to complete the lap.

The 2018 women’s road race will be contested by a number of household names and on-form elite riders, including Dani Rowe, Dame Sarah Storey and Elinor Barker to name a few. Dani Rowe has been in fine form this season, finishing third in the Commonwealth Games road race and following up that performance with an overall third place in the OVO Energy Women’s Tour. Fellow Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker will ride for Wiggle High5 in Northumberland this weekend. Storey comes into the National Championships having recently tasted victory in the North East after winning stage one of the Tour of the Reservoir this past weekend. Storey will race both the TT and the road race for Storey Racing in a packed weekend of competition. Also competing in both events will be 2016 national champion Hannah Barnes (CANYON // SRAM RACING), who will be one of the favourites for this year’s title. She edged out her sister Alice in 2016, also racing this year and looking to improve on two runner-up finishes. Whatever the outcome of this year’s women’s road race, a new national champion will be crowned - with the 2017 champion Lizzie Deignan absent due to the upcoming birth of her first child. Another notable absentee is Olympic and world gold medallist Katie Archibald, who is injured and unable to race. Rider List The finale of the National Road Championships sees two-time champion Steve Cummings attempt to defend his title in a star-studded men’s road race. Cummings will have to fend off a host of challenges, not least from previous winners Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Adam Blythe – whom have all triumphed at National Road Championships in recent years. Other high-profile contenders include Team Sky star Geraint Thomas and the previous national champion and sprint ace Mark Cavendish. Thomas will be riding high on the back of his victory in the 2018 Critérium du Dauphiné and the Welshman will lead a strong Sky cohort into the weekends action. Cavendish was recently in action in the Tour de Yorkshire after a lengthy injury lay-off, but the Team Dimension Data rider is a perennial contender at the Nationals, with one victory and two second place finishes to his name already. One of cycling’s most exciting prospects, Tom Pidcock, who secured a win in the second round of the Spring Cup Series, leads an exclusively under-23 line-up for Team Wiggins. Elsewhere in the under-23 category, Team Wiggins’ Gabriel Cullaigh and Charlie Tanfield of Canyon Eisberg are tipped to be ones to watch. Rider List The road races will both start and finish in the picturesque village of Stamfordham, situated around 20km west of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The women’s race will be in the morning over 106km – consisting of three laps of the long route (see map above), with the hotly contested men’s race due to place over a total distance of 185km in the afternoon – consisting of two short loops and four long loops. Spectators are invited to watch the action unfold in what promises to be a spectacular weekend of cycling and festival fun. Admission is free for spectators and there’s something for everyone to enjoy thanks to an eclectic mix of food and drink (cash only), music, amusement rides, HSBC UK Go-Ride and a bicycle stunt team. Arriving by car? A £3 car parking fee will be payable on arrival (cash only) in both the main car park in Stamfordham and the Ryals climb. Cash machines are not available. Sunday 1 July 8:45am – Women’s road race starts 1:00pm – Men’s road race starts The championships will take place from Thursday June 27 until Sunday June 30. The OVO Energy Women's Tour will also increase from five days to six, and will move to a new, weekday-focused position.

1028440,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"June 26, 2018 Colby College has been awarded a $600,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the Colby Museum’s Lunder Institute for American Art and its inaugural programming. The award will add depth to the institute’s programs, which have already made an impact on Colby students and faculty, Waterville school children, and visiting artists. In 2014 the Mellon Foundation generously supported the Colby Museum’s academic programming, and this new grant will further expand opportunities for student and faculty research and scholarship in all disciplines. “As Colby continues to build on its strengths in the arts and humanities, we are grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s enduring commitment to these disciplines, said President David A. Greene. “We have already begun to see the ways in which the Lunder Institute is becoming the premier place for the study of American art, and this grant will be critical to the next phase of the institute’s development.” The Mellon grant will support four key areas: advancing American art scholarship and artistic practice through multidisciplinary, multi-genre residencies and convenings; engaging students and faculty by creating teaching and research opportunities with visiting artists and scholars that reach across the curriculum; sharing and archiving scholarly and artistic projects through exhibitions and publications; and increasing local and global collaborative opportunities that engage with the artistic and scholarly initiatives of the Lunder Institute in partnership with Colby students and faculty. In its first full academic year, the institute played host to two renowned artists who worked closely with Colby students, faculty, and members of the local community. In the fall semester, Theaster Gates worked with Colby students in an American studies class on urban renewal projects and met with community partners and residents. Richard Blanco, inaugural poet for President Obama’s second inauguration, spent the spring semester on campus, most notably teaching a course titled “Teach This Poem” in which Colby students learned to be poetry ambassadors for local school children. Blanco also conducted workshops for area schoolteachers. The future holds even more, says Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “As we continue to launch the Lunder Institute, this grant will significantly expand our ability to bring artists and scholars to Colby while making the programs of the Lunder Institute accessible to Colby students and faculty and our broader communities,” she said. “We are honored and grateful for the Mellon Foundation’s support.” The institute recently named four outstanding individuals to key leadership positions. Lee Glazer will serve as founding director of the institute, bringing experience as curator of American art for the Smithsonian Institution’s Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery and expertise in the art of James McNeill Whistler, Romare Bearden, and others. Joining Glazer are Gates, the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives, and Tanya Sheehan, the distinguished scholar and director of research. Sheehan is currently Colby’s William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art. Most recently, the institute has brought on Daisy Desrosiers, an arts leader from Montréal, as program director. “The Mellon Foundation grant signals the importance of arts programming and will support the work of the institute’s creative and intellectual individuals,” said Glazer, who arrives at Colby in September. “This grant will enhance all of our work, from our cross-disciplinary collaborations to our scholarly symposiums to our community projects.” About the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Founded in 1969, The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation endeavors to strengthen, promote, and, where necessary, defend the contributions of the humanities and the arts to human flourishing and to the well-being of diverse and democratic societies by supporting exemplary institutions of higher education and culture as they renew and provide access to an invaluable heritage of ambitious, path-breaking work. Additional information is available at mellon.org. Lunder Institute for American Art Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the museum’s program, the Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby museum and partner institutions around the world.

(Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) Officials from the Minnesota Department of Transportation’s Mankato office said Monday the Highway 99 bridge at St. Peter remained opened but may have to close later in the week due to the rising river. (Photos by Dana Melius/St. Peter Herald) The Minnesota River is rising, has forced the closure of three valley roadways. Minnesota Department of Transportation officials closed Hwy. 19 east of Henderson Saturday evening, then on Sunday issued the closure of Hwy. 93 south of Henderson, which celebrated its annual Sauerkraut Days over the weekend. Late Monday night, MnDOT Public Affairs Cooordinator Anne Wolff issued an email announcing the closing of Highway 93 from U.S. Highway 169 to Le Sueur due to flooding and the rising Minnesota River. Wolff had reported Monday morning that while Hwy. 93 from U.S. Hwy. 169 to Le Sueur remained open, its “closure (is) anticipated later today or early tomorrow (Tuesday).” And it did. Wolff also said department maintenance engineers continue to monitor “the potential closure near St. Peter” of Hwy. 99 east. Heavy rains in south central Minnesota on Sunday and Monday resulted in another one-foot increase in projected crest levels, according to MnDOT officials and “extended the expected duration of high water on the Minnesota River,” according to Wolff. The Minnesota River remains the District 7 MnDOT office’s “primary area of current impact,” Wolff reported. But it’s not the only southern Minnesota area recently impacted by heavy rains and rising waters. In the city of Blue Earth, MnDOT officials closed U.S. Hwy. 169 on Sunday afternoon after three to six inches of rain fell in about a one-hour period. That roadway, Wolff reported, later reopened after waters receded. MnDOT officials also had reduced lanes due to flooding on Hwy. 30 east of Mapleton and on Hwy. 4 by Sherburn on Friday. The Sherburn roadway closed on Saturday morning; approximately six inches of water remains on the highway on Monday, with water still rising, “and it could be awhile until water recedes,” Wolff said. MnDOT officials were monitoring the Minnesota River late last week and were suggesting that Hwys. 19 and 93 near Henderson were the most likely to close due to anticipated flooding. Originally, MnDOT said the rising river was expected to close Hwy. 93 into Le Sueur on Sunday. That closure occurred late Monday night. The eastern portion of Seven Mile Creek Park on Hwy. 169 in Nicollet County is also closed. Log jams carried and caused by the swift-moving current still potentially may cause problems at bridges in St. Peter, Le Sueur and Henderson, according to MnDOT officials. Visitors to Henderson’s Sauerkraut Days were as early as Friday were being encouraged to enter the community from the west on Hwy. 19. Regular travelers were also able to access the city from the north on Sibley County Road 6, commonly referred to as the Scenic Byway Road. Henderson chamber representatives suggested that the news of potential road closures might have held down attendance a bit, but it was the steady rains which more likely kept some away.

1108635,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"Scientists may now be able to predict whether carrying a specific genetic variant increases a person's risk for disease using gene editing and stem cell technologies, according to new research in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation. For the first time, the study demonstrates the unique potential of combining stem cell-based disease modeling (induced pluripotent stem cells) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology as a personalized risk-assessment platform for determining the disease-causing ability of a yet undescribed genetic variant, known as a variant of uncertain significance, or VUS. Numerous genetic variations are identified as related to a medical condition, but it is uncertain if they actually lead to disease, Joseph C. Wu, director of the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute and Simon Stertzer, professor in the Department of Medicine, Cardiology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, said. ""Random genetic testing will create a lot of stress for a healthy individual who may be getting echocardiograms, MRIs or medications that they may not need,"" Wu said. ""Results from this study will help improve the interpretation and diagnostic accuracy of gene variants, especially in the era of personalized medicine and precision health. The goal is to optimize the decision making of clinicians in their choices of therapy by providing a much clearer result for the variant of uncertain significance carriers."" Researchers studied genetic variants associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle thickens. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and young athletes. The reseachers harvested DNA from 54 healthy or symptom-free individuals without heart disease, then they sequenced their DNA using a custom DNA panel of 135 cardiomyopathy and congenital heart disease genes associated with sudden cardiac death. The sequence results uncovered 592 unique genetic variants, with 78 percent of genetic variants being classified as benign, likely benign, or a variant of uncertain significance. However, 17 genetic variants were annotated as likely pathogenic or disease-causing. One individual who had multigenerational family members carrying a variation in gene MYL3, which is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was chosen in this study. After collecting the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the cells were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs and genome edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to engineer cells with the same genetics such as isogenic iPSC lines. Comprehensive analysis was next performed on the engineered cell lines to determine the MYL3 variant could lead to disease. Traditionally, treating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy depends on whether a patient has symptoms and the severity of those symptoms. People who have silent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without symptoms are not treated. For those with symptoms, physicians may recommend lifestyle changes such as adopting a heart-healthy diet, reducing stress and incorporating exercise while treating underlying illnesses that can make the condition worse. They may also prescribe medications for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, typically reserving surgery for more severe cases. ""Given the diversity of the human genome, no one of us is identical to another. It is difficult to determine whether a genetic variant is meaningful or not. As a result, we risk treating patients with medications or more for a variant that, in the end, is benign,"" Joseph Hill, chief of cardiology at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said. ""This study combined two new powerful technologies, induced pluripotent stem cells and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, to model a patient's heart in a dish and to test whether those heart cells manifested signs of disease. This approach heralds a new era of in vitro disease modeling and drug testing as pivotal elements of precision medicine."" View the discussion thread.

1008941,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Overseer in the News,"Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art Lee Glazer wrestled with the decision to leave her home in Washington, D.C., and the security of a curatorial job with the Smithsonian Institution to move to Waterville and become the founding director of the Lunder Institute for American Art at Colby. Glazer grew up in Washington, raised her family there, and made her mark as a Whistler specialist and curator of American art at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. Taking the Lunder Institute job—launching a research center for American art at an undergraduate liberal arts college in northern New England—is in some ways a bold move. Typically these centers are nestled in big research universities with large populations of graduate students. Ultimately, Glazer decided to trade her life in the nation’s capital for Mayflower Hill because she shares President David A. Greene’s vision for the institute and his commitment to the arts. “It’s so encouraging and unusual that David Greene is putting the arts and creative endeavors at the heart of his vision for Colby,” Glazer said. “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, his investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” As they discussed the institute, Greene told Glazer to think of it as a mash-up between the experimental mid-century North Carolina arts school Black Mountain College and the Aspen Institute, a contemporary humanities-driven think tank, where new ideas are nurtured by cutting-edge scholarship. Established with a gift by Paula and Peter Lunder ’56, the institute is designed for scholarship, creativity, dialogue, and mentorship among the College’s many communities. Glazer will set the Lunder Institute’s scholarly and creative direction, working with artists, faculty, and students, as well as the curatorial and educational teams of the Colby College Museum of Art. She also will collaborate with the institute’s first director of artist initiatives, Theaster Gates, recently appointed to a three-year term. “I love Theaster’s work, and I am excited to see what this relationship is going to look like.” “This is a time in history when people are questioning the value of a liberal arts education and thinking in material terms about the role of higher education. To me, [David Greene’s] investment in the arts is not to be overlooked.” —Lee Glazer, founding director, Lunder Institute for American Art The institute will actively participate in Colby’s ongoing revitalization of Waterville, an aspect of the job that particularly excites Glazer. “We see the institute as one of the many institutions driving the creative revitalization of Waterville and the region generally, and doing so in a way that does not disrespect the history of the community and the people who live there and have roots in the community,” she said. Glazer’s background includes some history in Maine. For about 15 years, she and her family have spent a summer week or two at a cabin on Attean Pond near Jackman. They usually stay at a hotel in Waterville the night before heading into camp, and their trips have often included stops at Colby. “We have this abiding affection for the great beauty of the state of Maine,” she said. Glazer has worked at Freer|Sackler 11 years and curated almost 20 exhibitions. A Whistler scholar, she was drawn to the Lunder position in part by the Colby museum’s deep Whistler collection. The Lunder Collection of James McNeill Whistler includes more than 300 etchings and lithographs, as well as oils, watercolors, and pastels and more than 150 books, journals, and photographs. Glazer is eager to explore exhibitions that compare changes in Whistler’s London to changes in Waterville today—and perhaps the changes experienced on the south side of Chicago, where Gates makes community-based work. “Whistler witnessed an incredible transformation and gentrification of certain parts of London in the late 19th century,” she said. “Maybe we can bring in scholars to research the changes in Victorian London and draw parallels to the south side of Chicago and the changes happening in Waterville today. As I started thinking about those possibilities, that’s what catalyzed for me, in concrete terms, the kinds of things the institute can do and the ways in which we can bridge the gaps of time and place.” Integrated into the academic mission of the College and the Museum’s program, The Lunder Institute is a research center for American art established by Peter and Paula Lunder. The institute creates a unique space for scholarship, creative works, dialogue, and mentorship among visiting scholars and artists, Colby faculty and students, and the central Maine community; facilitates institutional exchange in the United States and internationally; and trains future leaders in the field of American art through the Colby Museum and partner institutions around the world.

Pictured is Joe Evans, who was the D Flight winner in the Laidback Gold tournament. There were 22 golfers who competed in the Laidback Golf Tours sixth tournament of its 2018 season today at Plantation Golf Club. Even though they found the greens very slow due to recent rainfall amounts seven players turned in rounds in the seventies while carding twenty-six birdies. In their 2017 outing held here there were only three scores in the seventies and twenty-one birdies made. As in previous years the tournament was followed by a super meal furnished by Annette Mink of Plantation Golf Club. While there were no repeat winners from last year’s event here; Steve Williams made it two tournaments in a row with his win in A Flight today. Williams who won last week at Stoney Creek in a playoff used five birdies to hold off last years winner Steve Cummings by a single stroke. Williams claimed his second win in three starts this season with a daily low gross score of 72. Cummings won here last year with his score of 73 but claimed second today. Phyllis Parrent kept her season going in the right direction as she claimed her third win in four starts in the B Flight. Parrent carded two birdies on her way to finish at 74 for the top spot. Bob Foyle had one birdie but once again came up just a little short as he finished with a 78. Foyle was tied for first last tournament only to lose b a stroke on the playoff. Warner Dyke from Forest has only made two appearances this season but captured his first Tour victory with a score of 82 in the C Flight. Neither Dyke nor second place finisher Jimmy Watlington were able to card any birdies. They started the day with Dyke recording a bogey while Watlington started his round with a double bogey. Watlington finished with an 84. The D Flight used net scores to determine their winner, but Joe Evans would have got his first win in two season starts even if it had been determined by gross score. Evans carded a birdie on his way to his best finish of the season at 89 or net 61. Kenny Powell had two birdies and finished with a score of 92; but Dan Curtin claimed the flight’s second place spot with a score of 94 or net 68. The Tours next outing will be the first MAJOR of the season. Double points are awarded at Majors toward the Season Points Championship. It is scheduled for a 10 a.m. shotgun start Tuesday June 26 at Olde Mill Golf Resort in Laurel Fork, VA (Groundhog Mountain). Entry fee is $70 with registration request by June 19th with entry cutoff at noon June 23. Entry can be made at golftripman@yahoo.com or by calling Kenny Powell 434-792-3728.

1106452,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Published: June 12, 2018 2:32 p.m. ET By Earlier this year, Kai-Fu Lee, founder of VC giant Sinovation Ventures, said that the rise of the machines will lead to widening inequality as lower-level jobs get swallowed up in numbers well beyond the grimmest of forecasts. Don’t look to the banking industry for a counterpoint. In a series of interviews marking the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis, the Financial Times took the pulse of execs from several leading banks and found many of them are girding for imminent — and substantial — job losses. Jamie Forese, president of Citigroup’s C, -0.67% institutional clients group, said 10,000 of the bank’s 20,000 tech and operational roles are “most fertile for machine processing.” He suggested they could be gone within five years. What kind of jobs are at risk exactly? Barclays investment boss Tim Throsby put it another way when asked about what the future will look like: Throsby explained that machines will take over “lower-value tasks” and a smaller number of employees will be making more money. Forese’s comments are reminiscent of those from Deutsche Bank’s DB, -0.31% John Cryan, who previously said half the German bank’s workers could be replaced by robots. The FT calculated that if those numbers were true for the broader banking industry, the potential job losses would outpace the ones we saw from 2007 to 2017, when almost 60,000 jobs were cut from eight of the world’s top 10 investment banks.

1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"MIAMI, June 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OPKO Health, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPK) today announced it has completed enrollment of 110 subjects in a Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. OPK88003 is a once weekly injectable oxyntomodulin medicine with GLP-1 and glucagon dual agonist activity. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction of HbA1c levels over a 30-week period; weight loss and improvement of blood lipid profiles are secondary endpoints. Based on preclinical and Phase 2 data, the use of the dual agonist, OPK88003, once-weekly with an optimized dosing regimen, could more effectively improve glucose control, increase weight loss and improve the lipid profile in type 2 diabetics compared with the currently available GLP-1 medicines. ""We are pleased to announce complete enrollment in the Phase 2b dose escalation trial of OPK88003 two months after we initiated the study. Our confidence in this compound is supported by the earlier Phase 2 data, and it is our hope that the outcome of the current study along with our existing body of data will prepare us for a pivotal Phase 3 program,” stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. “We believe the dual agonist activity of OPK88003 may better control glucose and improve long term cardiovascular outcomes in the growing population of type 2 diabetics worldwide."" According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), approximately 30 million people in the U.S. have type 2 diabetes and 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed each year. The ADA estimates the annual cost of care for diabetic patients to be $327 billion, including direct medical costs and reduced productivity1. _________________________ 1 http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/?loc=superfooter About OPK88003OPK88003 was previously evaluated in a blinded Phase 2 clinical trial of 420 patients with type 2 diabetes for 12 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for an additional 12 weeks. The study showed that OPK88003 reduced HbA1c levels by approximately 1.4% and resulted in statistically superior weight loss compared with the comparator, a weekly exenatide. Further, OPK88003 treatment resulted in a favorable decrease in triglycerides and cholesterol versus the weekly exenatide. About OPKO Health, Inc.

1106452,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The former head of the Nice judicial police, Michel Neyret, has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for corruption. The sentence was delivered by the appeals court in Paris. After a 32 year career including 20 years at the head of the anti-gang brigade of Lyon, Neyret was a legend at the time of his fall. He was accused of having provided confidential information to members of the Lyon community in exchange for benefits, gifts and cash. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment, including 18 months suspended, as well as a permanent ban from the police force. The prosecutor general may still decide to appeal the sentence. About 12,000 electricity customers in Valbonne experienced cuts to their power supplies this morning. The disruptions to the supply were the result of a demonstration being staged by employees of energy company Enedis at an electricity sub-station. The protest was against changes in salary levels, terms of employment and proposed redundancies. Latest figures show that 19 people have been killed on the roads of the Alpes Maritimes since the beginning of the year. Of those, eleven were riding a motorbike or scooter. Strike action by France’s rail network the SNCF is continuing today with 1 out of 2 regional trains operating and 3 out of 5 TGV’s running. Unions have called for a “massive” participation ahead of the government’s plans to implement the reforms on Thursday. Eric Ciotti, MP for the Alpes Maritimes, has said that France should not take in the 629 migrants who are currently adrift in the Mediterranean on the boat Aquarius. Speaking on French television this morning, M. Ciotti said that no French port should accept the boat and that it should return to the Libyan coast. The Spanish government announced yesterday that it would accept the boat to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, a decision M. Ciotti described as a mistake. Meanwhile, President Emmanuel Macron has today accused the Italian government of ""cynicism and irresponsibility"" for refusing to let the ship dock in Italy. A doctor from Menton has been appointed head of the non-governmental organization Médecins du Monde. Philippe de Botton has been involved with the organization since 1989. BUSINESS In the UK, there’s been a larger than expected rise in the number of people in work. There were 32.39 million people in work in the February-to-April period.

The US Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index increased 0.2%. In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 2.8%, the biggest advance since February 2012. The head of Citigroup's investment bank has suggested that the bank could dispense with up to half of its 20,000 technology and operations staff in the next five years due to automation. In an interview with the Financial Times, James Forese said that the 20,000 posts at Citi were ""most fertile for machine processing"". SPORT FOOTBALL…Real Madrid have appointed Spain manager Julen Lopetegui as their new head coach on a three-year deal. He previously managed Porto for two years, before taking over at the Spanish national team in July 2016. Former England boss Sam Allardyce says he is ""jealous"" of Gareth Southgate and believes it should be him leading the national team at the World Cup.

1106452,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Succession of cost-cutting plans has made investment banks leaner, mergers & acquisitions boom boosted fee income When Lehman Brothers imploded almost 10 years ago, few Wall Street banks were worse placed to withstand the fallout than Citigroup. While most of its rivals had delivered bumper profits in 2007, Citi had already seen its earnings collapse to $3.6 billion (€3 billion) from $21.5 billion (€18.2 billion) after its subprime bets went badly wrong. Yet, a decade on from the crisis that threatened such devastation, Citi’s investment bank chief James Forese can say without irony: ""I don’t think there is much question that we’ve been a winner since the crisis. Even from the [high] of the 2005/06 period to today . . . our franchise is much stronger today than it was back then."" Already have an account? Sign in here.

1096862,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The ongoing evolution of fixed income markets has shaken up the desired skill set of the fixed income trader. Key themes discussed over the past couple days at the WBR Fixed Income Leaders Summit include automation, data, and artificial intelligence. Much has changed over the past several years, and more change is ahead, so traders cannot be set in their ways. Supurna VedBrat, BlackRock “It is important that today’s traders have the mindset that can change easily,” said Supurna VedBrat, Global Head of Trading at BlackRock, at a Friday morning keynote interview. “Agility is important. Forward thinking is important. Innovative DNA. And having the savvy to be able to use technology to advance business processes.” VedBrat cited working well with others as a requirement, as fixed income trading is increasingly a collaborative endeavour, both in terms of working with portfolio managers internally, and interfacing with multiple external constituencies to source liquidity. In a market where data has proliferated and trading desks have yet to get their arms fully around another key skill for a trader is the ability to “understand the story of what the data is telling us,” VedBrat said. Regarding automated execution, VedBrat said the framework is to leverage data to make decisions on where to route a trade, based on acceptable price parameters. “We want to allow data to simplify and make executon more efficient,” she said. “Automation is not replacing human intelligence — it is making human decision-making smarter and faster.” BlackRock is open to using more all-to-all, or open, trading if that’s where the other side of the trade can be found. “We need to be able to reach liquidity regardless of where it is,” said VedBrat, who added that the distinction between buy side and sell side is not as important in this context, as any market participant can provide liquidity. With all all-to-all trading, “we have seen success in couple different markets” she said. “Assets are sitting with the buy side, so the buy side is in a pretty good position to be able to provide liquidity. The buy side provides liquidity as a price maker when ready to declare a price at which they’re willing to exchange risk.” In introductory remarks for the keynote interview, MarketAxess CEO Rick McVey cited four major trends the platform operator is seeing: (1) a proliferation of data, (2) substantial technology investment to automate processes, (3) a transformation of the odd-lot market, and (4) increasing adoption of all-to-all trading.

The Federal Statistical Office figures alarmed economists, who hoped for a 0.8 per cent rise. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics said: ‘This makes for a horrible start to the second quarter.’ OIL SLOWDOWN Oil production in Venezuela is 25m barrels behind schedule as the country teeters on the edge of collapse. State firm PDVSA said it may be forced to declare it cannot meet obligations, as 80 tankers float unfilled in ports. PENSION WORRY Half of workers due to retire this year are expected to carry on working past state pension age instead, according to research by Prudential. More than a quarter of those planning to stay on hope to go part-time. Around 8 per cent cannot afford to quit. PAYMENT DEAL Payments firm Paysafe has struck a deal for its cards to be used in Google’s online shop. The Isle of Man business’s prepaid cards, designed for people who do not want to use online banking or buy with credit, can be used at the Google Play store. AFRICA PROFIT An investment firm founded by disgraced ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond has seen profit rise. Atlas Mara, which takes stakes in African banks, made £19.4million profit in the first three months of 2018, which is up from £7million a year earlier. SAVINGS SURGE Savers pumped £931million into the stock market in April as the Isa deadline loomed. The total cash pile looked after rose 3 per cent to £1.2trillion, according to The Investment Association. There is typically a stampede to shelter cash from the taxman in Isa accounts in early April, before the new tax year. CHINA TIE-UP Global miner Rio Tinto has set up a joint venture with Chinese firm Minmetals to look for minerals in China. Rio said: ‘Our complementary strengths in exploration put us in the best possible position to find metals and minerals essential to human progress.’ CONTRACT WIN Oil services firm Petrofac has won a £48million two-year contract extension to maintain Eni UK’s development in north Wales.

It was the highest fundraising total ever for the event. The Breakfast, held at the iconic Cipriani 42nd Street in New York, honored Leon G. Cooperman, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, Inc., and Damon Runyon Board of Directors member, for his longstanding commitment to investing in new generations of researchers. ""Our Annual Breakfast is always a special time for us at Damon Runyon, as we honor and recognize those who continue to fuel the success of our organization from both a research and business advisory standpoint,"" said Lorraine Egan, President and CEO of Damon Runyon. ""Not only was this year's event record-breaking in terms of fundraising, it also gave us an opportunity to recognize an individual who is integral to supporting our mission of finding and funding exceptional scientists who will be the driving force to end all suffering from cancer."" Since joining the Damon Runyon board in 1996, Cooperman – known as Lee – has managed the Foundation's Investments Committee, helping to grow its endowment by 500 percent, to over $100 million. In 2014, he and fellow board member Michael Gordon pledged to jointly fund Damon Runyon's Physician-Scientist Training Award program for its first three years. The program supports and encourages outstanding recent medical school graduates to pursue cancer research careers by providing them with the opportunity for a protected research-training experience under the mentorship of a qualified and gifted mentor. In addition, the Foundation will retire up to $100,000 in medical school debt still owed by an award recipient. Cooperman spoke with great fondness about his 26-year relationship with the organization, noting how the Foundation continues to evolve year-over-year in providing grants to the most brilliant, early career scientists. ""Winston Churchill said it best, 'We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give.' My goal has always been to improve the world and leave it a better place than when I came into it, which is why I initially got involved with Damon Runyon over 20 years ago. They fuel the vision of researchers across the country, by providing the funding and support they urgently need to discover radical ways to prevent, diagnose and cure all forms of cancer,"" said Cooperman. Kenneth G. Langone, Founder and CEO of Invemed Associates LLC, introduced Cooperman, his longtime friend. Also attending the event were Nobel laureate Harold Varmus, MD, Shelly Lazarus, former CEO of Ogilvy, and Mario Gabelli, Founder of GAMCO. At this year's event, guests heard research updates from Melody Smith, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who is focused on improving outcomes for bone marrow transplants, and Kristopher R. Bosse, MD, a Damon Runyon Physician-Scientist from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who is pursuing a new targeted therapy for pediatric neuroblastoma. ""As a physician-scientist myself, I can truly appreciate everything this foundation does for these scientists, especially physician-scientists, who are a dying breed,"" said William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD, Professor of Medicine at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Damon Runyon Board Member and Vice Chair of the Foundation's Scientific Programs, and keynote speaker. Egan also announced that the Foundation has named John Ferrarone, MD, of Weill Cornell Medicine, the ""Lee Cooperman Physician-Scientist of the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"" in Cooperman's honor. Dr. Ferrarone works under the mentorship of Dr. Varmus. His research focuses on developing new, more effective targeted therapies for lung cancers.

Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Brian. Thanks to all of you for joining us today to review our first-quarter results. MongoDB began fiscal 2019 with strong financial and operational performance, which reflects our market momentum and all the drivers behind our growth. To quickly summarize the first-quarter results, we generate revenue $48.2 million, a 49% year-over-year increase, which is above the high end of our guidance. We grew subscription revenue 53% year over year. We ended the quarter with over 6,600 customers, up 83% compared to a year ago. We saw strong growth across all major regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia. And Atlas is now 14% of revenue. Our position as the leading modern general-purpose data platform get stronger each quarter with customers, partners, and the larger ecosystem, putting us in great position to continue generating strong top-line growth. Digital transformation has become one of the most important IT initiatives for all companies in all industries. While these digital initiatives hold the promise of a more nimble enterprise that can respond quickly to changing market conditions and provide a better experience for its customers, executing on these initiatives is far easier said than done. In my meetings with senior executives around the world, it's clear that companies are highly motivated to use modern technologies to transform their businesses to create a competitive advantage. In the first quarter alone, I had more than 20 meetings with the C-level executives at large global organizations across many industries to discuss how MongoDB can be a partner in their transformation process. The scope and frequency of these senior-level conversations are far different than the types of conversations we had even 18 months ago. Previously, there were typically exploratory conversations to learn more about the company and the technology and what projects they could start with MongoDB. Now these conversations are focused on how to use MongoDB for some of the most important digital initiatives that their businesses are undertaking. Moreover, many of these executives rarely meet with any vendors at all, reflecting one, the importance of what we do and the impact we can have on their business; and two, our credibility as a strategic partner. Turning to our first-quarter results in more detail. We saw a healthy mix of new logo wins and strong upsell activity, both of which include the customers' migrating workloads from legacy databases to MongoDB. Our performance in the first quarter exemplified the power of our land, expand and expand model and our multiple vectors of growth. During the first quarter, we grew our six-figure customer count by 47% compared to the same period a year ago and added a number of new enterprise customers, including Anadarko Petroleum, AppDirect, Extraordinary Systems, Hawaiian Airlines, and New Balance Athletics. We also expanded our relationship with customers such as Guidewire Software, Highspot, Mediaocean, NeoReach, PEMCO, state of New York, and Urban Outfitters. These customers are just the tip of the iceberg for us. Our opportunity is massive and global. We're closing deals in every corner of the world with highly sophisticated businesses, in some cases, in areas where we have no or only limited sales coverage today. This truly speaks to the size of our market opportunity and the broad appeal of our platform. It also demonstrates the attractive returns we are generating on our investments and underscores the number of additional high ROI opportunities we see ahead of us to invest across product, sales and marketing. Examples of our wins include a large European online electronics retailer, which built a single-view application of MongoDB Atlas to improve its customer experience, quickly identify fraudulent activities and comply with GDPR privacy regulations. Multiple wins in China, including Volkswagen China, which built a new energy vehicle management platform on MongoDB; and a leading airline that's using MongoDB to support a block-chain-based application for its revamped rewards program; one of Italy's largest energy companies, Eni gas e luce, which chose MongoDB to modernize its content management platform; wins with two of the largest financial institutions in Australia building important applications for online payments as Australia pushes aggressively toward a cashless society; a large deal with a Latin American bank that chose MongoDB for over a dozen applications, including a loyalty application, a customer service application, offloading and mission-critical application from the mainframe and other use cases across different business units; and a deal with one of the largest media companies in the Middle East, which is modernizing its legacy infrastructure and building a highly sophisticated platform to share exclusive content with its customers. While we monetize existing demand of our platform with these customers, we also continue to plant seeds around the world to further drive adoption. One way we do this is by hosting a worldwide tour of customer events. For example, we hosted seven of our top local events with thousands of developers in Bangalore, Munich, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Sydney and Tel Aviv. We also hosted joint events with our cloud partners in London, Milan, Mumbai, San Francisco, Seoul, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney and Tel Aviv. At all these events, we were able to get in front of tens of thousands of developers, database administrators and executives to increase awareness of MongoDB and showcase the power of our platform. In addition to seeing strong global demand for our platform, we're also seeing customers adopt MongoDB for a wide variety of cutting-edge use cases. A great example is Koinex, a cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform based in India. Koinex provides real-time trading of a rapidly growing number of cryptocurrencies. They're using MongoDB Atlas to focus on scaling the trading capacity by 50 times while minimizing the use of DevOps ops personnel. Another important win was with a large automotive manufacturing company that is working on object detection for autonomous cars. The company created a machine learning application to ingest and process large amounts of unstructured data. They chose MongoDB because of our abilities to easily support a large variety of data from cameras and sensors and to scale out the dataset as it rapidly grows. Third, we expanded our relationship with U.K.'s biggest public service department, the Department for Works and Pensions or DWP, which is similar to the Social Security Administration in the United States. A number of new services are being built on MongoDB from benefit delivery platforms to a service that helps people obtain the status of their pension payments. DWP is essentially using MongoDB to better serve the citizens of the United Kingdom. We also had an exciting win with New Balance, who's using MongoDB for real-time analytics related to managing their raw materials, specifically around costing, planning and procurement decisions. We also see -- we also continue to see tremendous customer interest in Atlas. In the first quarter, Atlas represented 14% of revenue, versus 4% a year ago and 11% last quarter. A fast-growing percentage of this business is coming through our direct-sales efforts, though self-serve is still the majority of Atlas sales. Atlas is a key part of our run anywhere strategy, and its success among enterprise customers makes it clear that Atlas is not only great for small- and medium-sized businesses but is also compelling solution for the largest organizations in the world. We anticipate field sales of Atlas will continue to increase as we introduce Enterprise Advanced features and more into Atlas starting later this year. We also continue to see growth of our Atlas business with partners. Two of our largest Atlas deals in Q1 closed through the AWS Marketplace. The ability for customers to buy Atlas through their preferred cloud partner makes it easy to do business with us, reduces sales cycle times and accelerates the growth of our business. Speaking of partners, our strong momentum is driving partners to further incorporate our platform into their technologies and go-to-market initiatives. In fact, our new business sourced from partners has more than doubled over the past year. Furthermore, we signed an exciting new ISV relationship with IBM as part of its private cloud initiative. With this deal, IBM will activate thousands of global sales reps who will be incentivized to resell MongoDB as part of IBM's ICP or IBM Cloud Private and Analytics Platform for enterprises. This deepens our partnership with IBM and will greatly expand our reach into new markets and opportunities where IBM has an influential presence. Innovation is the core to our DNA and to our success. We're continuing to invest in our platform and have a robust product road map that will make it even easier for customers to work with their data. In three weeks, we'll be hosting our annual user conference, MongoDB World, in New York City. The highlight of MongoDB World will be the formal introduction of MongoDB 4.0, including multi-document ACID transactions. While ACID is not required for many applications, its announcement has already led many companies to evaluate MongoDB, including those organizations who haven't looked at MongoDB recently and those who have never used MongoDB before. Initial customer reaction to MongoDB 4.0 has been very positive. The features in this new release are helping our sales team land meetings with customers and playing an important part in elevating our strategic importance among prospects. We plan to make a number of other exciting product announcements in MongoDB World that we believe will energize the customers and further expand the adoption of MongoDB in the developer community. We welcome all of you listening to the call to attend MongoDB World right here in New York City on June 27. So in summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year. We're executing across the business and believe our strengthened product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities position us well to continue driving best-in-class revenue growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to review the financials Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we're very pleased with our first-quarter performance. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first-quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Total revenue in the quarter was $48.2 million, up 49% year over year. The strong performance of the business was broad-based during the quarter with healthy new logo and upsell activity among enterprise customers as well as continued rapid adoption of Atlas. Atlas represented 14% of revenue during the quarter, up 4% in the first year -- first quarter last year. We continue to see strong global demand for our offerings. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 900 customers, bringing our total customer count to over 6,600, which is up from over 3,600 in the year-ago period and over 5,700 at the end of last quarter. Of our total customer count, over 1,550 are direct customers, which compares to over 1,450 at the end of the prior quarter and over 1,300 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven, in large part, by Atlas, which had over 4,400 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 3,400 at the end of the fourth quarter. The growth in total customers includes growth in our Enterprise Advanced customers as well as new Atlas customers. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects both new customers to MongoDB as well as existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. We also continue to see healthy expansion from existing customers. Our net AR expansion rate in the first quarter again remained above 120%. We ended the quarter with 394 customers with at least $100,000 in annual recurring revenue and annualized MRR, which is up from 354 in the fourth quarter and 268 in the year-ago period. Driving expanded adoption and spend among existing customers is a key component of our growth strategy and has been a consistent area of success. Even among our largest customers today, we believe MongoDB represents a small fraction of their total database spend, which represents a large and attractive growth opportunity for us over time. Moving down the P&L. I will be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $35.0 million, representing a gross margin of 72.6% and consistent with the year-ago period. We are pleased with the gross margin performance in the quarter, particularly in light of Atlas' growth. Atlas includes the underlying infrastructure, and our success in reducing the infrastructure costs related to Atlas has resulted in improved Atlas gross margins. We still anticipate Atlas will be a modest headwind to gross margin overall, but we are tracking well relative to our original expectations. Our operating loss was $21.7 million, or a negative 45% operating margin for the first quarter, comparing to a negative 47% margin in the year-ago period. Net loss in the first quarter was $21.6 million, or $0.43 per share based on 50.4 million weighted average shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $271.5 million in cash, cash-equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was negative $8 million. After taking into consideration approximately $400,000 in capital expenditures, free cash flow was negative $8.4 million in the quarter. As a reminder, the second quarter is typically the low point in the year for cash flow due to seasonally lower collections, and the second quarter is usually our heaviest investment in marketing investments like MongoDB World. In addition, we expect to see increased capital expenditures starting this quarter related to our New York City office move. Short-term deferred revenue was $119.9 million, up 45% year over year, while total deferred revenue of $141.8 million was up 47% year over year. We believe longer-term trends in deferred revenue are directionally correlated to the underlying momentum of our business. That said, as Atlas continues to become a larger portion of our business, it is important to appreciate that it is a usage-based model and does not generate meaningfully deferred revenue. Also, as a reminder, Atlas is often billed monthly in arrears versus the annual and advanced billing terms we see with our Enterprise Advanced customers. Lastly, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of deferred revenue can also have some level of variability due to the timing of events that may occur. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2019. Beginning with the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $51 million to $52 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $23.5 million to $23 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.45 per share based on 51.1 million weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2019, we are raising our revenue outlook to $217 million to $220 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be in the range of $84 million to $82 million and non-GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of $1.66 to $1.62 per share based on 51.6 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our increased revenue guidance reflects strong underlying trends in the business and given the high ROI investment landscape we see, we have maintained our full-year outlook for non-GAAP loss from operations. In closing, we got off to a strong start in fiscal 2019, and we're excited for what's to come in the rest of the year. We're executing well on our strategic priorities and are well-positioned to drive strong growth and improving profitability over the long term. With that, we'd like to open up to your questions. Operator? Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Dev, congrats on a great start to the year. And, Dev, first question on the IBM deal. Can you give us a little bit more insight here? Like, historically, we have seen smaller software companies do deals with these large vendors. And on the one hand, on paper, they look good. Often, there is not that in reality coming through. Can you talk what's the incentive structure? How does it work for you guys? Why is it exciting for the two of you? Thank you. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes.Thanks, Raimo. What I think IBM have seen, and they're the ones who actually first approached us, was that they're seeing, frankly, MongoDB being adopted everywhere in their customer base, and they're seeing specific demand from their customers to -- for MongoDB. And they wanted to use MongoDB for their private cloud initiative and use some of the proprietary features. What's interesting about this transaction is that their salespeople actually are incentivized through quota relief to sell MongoDB. So this is not just one of those Barney announcements. There's real motivation by IBM to activate the 7,000-plus salespeople around the world to resell MongoDB, and they see a big opportunity in front of them. Why it's attractive to us is that even though we're a fast-growing company, we only have a certain amount of reach, and we're very attracted by the opportunity to expand our reach through their presence in these markets and accounts and where they have a lot of influence, where they can embed MongoDB more quickly than, say, we would try to do ourselves. So we're very excited about this relationship, and we think it will pay dividends in the future. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. And then another follow-up. On Atlas, obviously the growth, in our calculations, I think is like 400%, so that's really, really healthy. Can you talk a little bit about how you see that evolving in terms of direct [Audio skip] commented on some direct [Inaudible] deals [Inaudible]? How do you see that evolving over time, and then once the enterprise features you kind of talked about, how will that change, then, the dynamic in the second half of the year? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Right. So if you remember, we launched Atlas a little less than two years ago, and it's only about this time last year that we really started getting our sales teams really focused on selling Atlas directly. And I think we're seeing the returns in that investment starting to pay off. Obviously, as part of our run anywhere strategy, we're giving customers choice about not only where they want to run MongoDB but how they want to consume MongoDB. And we're starting to see a lot of large customers want and like the optionality of basically procuring MongoDB as a service through Atlas. And that's definitely driving a big part of the growth. We're really excited about the traction we're seeing not just here in North America but frankly, all around the world and not just with small customers, with some of the largest companies and frankly, some very arguably industries that are probably more -- have reputation to be more slow moving who are aggressively moving to the cloud and see Atlas as a very attractive alternative. It also speaks to the fact that when people use MongoDB, in some ways, they future-proof their applications because they can start on-premise, go to the cloud, manage it themselves or consume it as a service and have it delivered on AWS, on Azure or on GCP. So it gives them real optionality. I would tell you that Atlas is the only Database-as-a-Service offering that's available in 54 regions around the world by virtue of us being able to run Atlas across the three largest cloud providers in the world. No other provider can say that. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst OK, perfect. And maybe if I can squeeze in one more question for Michael. Like, if I look -- like, at the moment, your revenue is kind of running faster than we had modeled, but you kind of also keep investing. Like, how flexible -- like, as you said, on the call, you kind of are kind of playing -- being very dynamic with the investments given the high ROI. But like, how does it work for you? Like how does the planning work for you, whether cost allocation or the investment decisions? How does it work for you that you can kind of react so quickly? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So in general, given the market opportunity that we're going after, there are shorter lead time investments and longer lead time investments that we can make. And so obviously, in the planning process, it's a mix of doing both of those. We obviously saw very first -- very strong first-quarter performance, and we've been able to invest. Well, the two main areas that we will invest as we see incremental opportunities will be on the sales and marketing side and the R&D side. Both of those obviously have somewhat ramp times but the engineering ramp time for return to value is longer given product cycles. But those are really the two main areas that we look to and we look to reinvest in with continued strength of the business. And as long as we see high rates of return for both of those, we will continue to do that within the context of showing the continuing operating leverage that we're showing overall as a company. Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thank you. Well done. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We'll move next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent, guys. Very nice quarter and thank you for taking the question. I think after Raimo asked seven questions, we should all get at least three. I think that's only fair. Furthering on sort of the Atlas conversation. Could you talk to us a little bit on how you're seeing kind of those use cases develop? What kind of use cases are you seeing going toward Atlas versus what traditionally would be on the EA -- like an EA customer would be doing? And in the cases where you have sort of an existing EA customer expand to Atlas, maybe talk to us a little about sort of the use case that drives that as well because it seems like there's been a significant overlap, at least 100 customers, that went from EA to Atlas as well. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So great question, Keith. I mean, I would say you should think about -- again, we launched Atlas less than two years ago, so you can see -- as you can imagine, a lot of the early customers were doing a lot of dev test workloads, doing a lot of early prototyping work on Atlas. It's easy to get started with. They didn't have to procure any hardware. They didn't have to worry about getting their internal teams to support the infrastructure. As the comfort with Atlas has grown, you're starting to see people move to -- move more production and mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And we've seen that -- we saw that in our inside sales channel earlier, but now we're even seeing that in our direct sales force. And we're seeing a number of large deals move to Atlas. And so it speaks to, one, their comfort and familiarity with Atlas. Two, we've continued to expand the envelope of Atlas coverage. As I mentioned, we're now in 54 regions around the world. Three, we've added more and more features. We've made it easier. We built tools and content to make it easy for people to quickly migrate their on-prem installation to Atlas with minimal kind of effort. And so all those things are really helping customers to move workloads to Atlas. We've also introduced or plan to introduce a bunch of, what I call, enterprise features, things around LDAP, security, auditing and so forth, that will continue to encourage customers to be more comfortable in moving mission-critical workloads to Atlas. And to your point, about EA customers moving to Atlas, you should think about the fact that they might be different workloads. It might be that there -- have certain set of workloads on-premise but other workloads, they think, are a better fit or they're more -- they want to move more quickly to Atlas. In fact, you've seen many situations where sometimes a large enterprise may see some unexpected demand in a particular product or service offering and the internal teams can't keep up with that demand, and then they'll quickly choose to move to Atlas because of the elastic nature of that service. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Got it. And perhaps just my one follow-up for Michael. With sort of the increase in Atlas and sort of the conversation you're talking about, how a lot of that is billed in arrears or sort of billed on a consumption basis. The rebound that we saw in current subscription billings from last quarter and into this quarter, they're probably more predicated on sort of EA strength versus Atlas. The Atlas strength that we saw in the quarter was sort of just more so just at the income statement. Is that the correct way to view it? Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. I think, in general, I mean, we saw strength across the board. There are different cash flow and deferred revenue aspects to each of them, which is correct. And just for everyone -- so everyone's on the same page, the self-serve Atlas is the majority of Atlas today as opposed to Atlas sold through the sales force. Self-serve Atlas bills monthly in arrears, and so it is a very different dynamic. But we benefit, obviously, from the incremental cash flow of that as well, so that's sort of additive to the story. But we've got multiple engines of growth both on the Enterprise Advanced side as well as on the Atlas side. Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Excellent. Great quarter. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Keith. Operator We'll move next to Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Dev, Atlas revenue per customer has continued to expand at a really healthy clip here sequentially over the last few quarters. And given your commentary just before to Keith around the enterprise features for being additive going forward, should we assume that most of that growth thus far has been existing customers expanding implementations, and then, over time, there's opportunity for even more lift as they add these enterprise features? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer No. Actually, Brad, I would say it's actually both. We're seeing, obviously, strong expansion of existing customers, but we're also seeing newer customers start bigger on Atlas. And so I think that's again a function of the fact that those tend to be more mission-critical workloads versus dev test or early prototypes. And people now are starting to view Atlas as a very, very viable platform to run mission-critical applications. And the one thing I should also point out is that one of MongoDB's strength is the distributed nature of our database platform. And a lot of those features and those distributed capabilities are actually even better exposed in Atlas in terms of placing workloads closer to users, working around GDPR or other privacy regulations in particular countries. That really shows the power of MongoDB. And so we're actually seeing customers realize that with Atlas, they actually do more things on MongoDB than they could in their own data centers. Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Brad, maybe just from like a math or sort of breaking down like the piece parts, the simplest way, I think, to think about it is the self-serve customers are exhibiting very strong underlying cohort behavior, so there's very good expansion in the self-serve customer base. But also, we're seeing an increasing percentage of the Atlas customers are sales sold, and those customers have a higher price point or a higher ASP. So the combination of those two things lead to generally increasing average revenue per Atlas customer if that helps. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Sure, sure. And then one real quick follow-up on that last point. The two big deals you talked about being sold on the AWS Marketplace, were those sold by the AWS sales force or by you guys or by self-service, we'll say? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer It was definitely sold by us, Brad, but I would tell you that the AWS sales team really worked with us to make sure those transactions happened. Obviously, it's early days, but it was a really great sign of partnering in the field. And we're really excited about what the future may hold there. Brad Reback -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst Great. Thanks very much. Operator Next, we'll move to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much. I had a couple questions. I wanted to start out first with just the kind of comments from you, Dev, on kind of about the competitive environment. In particular, Satya Nadella on their conference call commented about Cosmos and how quickly that's gone from zero to $100 million in annualized revenue. I'm just wondering if you could share with us kind of how you see them in the market, where there might be overlap. Or are you complementary? And then I had two quick follow-ups. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Sure. So we basically -- one, I would say that we feel very comfortable about our competitive positioning. We have talked to customers who tried Cosmos, and frankly, the feedback we've heard has not been that positive. They're trying to do some sophisticated things, and many customers have said that -- they have said like they tried to make Cosmos work because they were already on Azure and have realized that just couldn't meet their needs, so they came to MongoDB. We've had some large ISV relationships who have strategic partnerships with Microsoft, who had every incentive to try to make Cosmos work, and it didn't work for them. Now there's no question being a cloud provider and just being in the flip screen of all the deals going -- or all the workloads moving to the cloud that they are definitely getting business, but when it comes to head to head, we're feeling very comfortable about our positioning. And we feel very excited about the future. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK, great. And are there any areas where you could be complementary to what they're doing or not really? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I think, no. With a database -- I mean, typically, a database is pretty much an architectural decision, so I think where we see the complementary nature is less about the database and more around the ancillary infrastructure, where we can help customers consume more kind of compute and storage services and other services that the cloud prior may offer. And so we're seeing that not only with Microsoft, but we're seeing that with the other partners as well, which is why they're very motivated to work with us. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Great. And then just two quick follow-ups. You had really strong international results this quarter. I was wondering if you could share what drove the strength there. And then just a follow-up. I think Raimo might have asked earlier a little bit about the -- if you could give us an idea of the EA features in Atlas in better driving adoption and what customers are asking for in particular for EA in Atlas, that would be great. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, sure. So the international growth is really driven by the fact that we've been investing with teams in EMEA and Asia for the last couple of years, and we're really starting to see the results of that -- those investments, both in terms of just the size of deals we're doing, the strategic nature of those deals and the relationship that we're building. So we're very excited about the opportunity there. And I would tell you that we're still -- we still have wide swaths of EMEA and Asia that we don't have a lot of people in. So there's lots of opportunity to continue to expand our reach. But it's really a function of putting people in market, having good leaders in place who can directly manage them and bring a real focus to that market, and we see good things happening. Candidly, one of the -- the question that was asked earlier with Michael -- for Michael about investments, we constantly get asked, hey, should we put people in the Middle East, should we expand more quickly into Latin Americas. And so it's just a function of how large this market is. And obviously, we want to be disciplined about how we run the business, but there's -- we are not market constrained. There's a massive market out there. And then in terms of EA features, we've introduced and we'll continue to introduce a bunch of commercial features in Atlas around security, auditing, the ability to use our BI connector, which allows people to run reports right off of Atlas. Those are all proprietary features that are now available on Atlas, and you'll see that the number of those kind of features grow over time. So that's just, again, expanding and offering more capabilities on Atlas that gets people comfortable at putting mission-critical workloads on that platform. Heather Bellini -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Thank you so much. Operator We'll move next to Richard Davis with Canaccord. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thanks. So maybe we'll do some product questions. So you guys have -- my understanding is you have a really good kind of aggregation framework, which is, as we all know, kind of the dirty little secret in data. What's -- the hard part is kind of getting everything lined up, so you can actually query it, stuff like that. Can you kind of talk about how this differentiates Mongo from other firms? And then the ancillary question is -- and I think, the answer is 99% chance is no. But is there any overlap with you kind of aggregation framework and things that are offered by companies like Alteryx and Talend? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. So just for everyone else's benefit, what an aggregation framework is, is in layman terms, is just the ability to process and analyze data inside the database. And most NoSQL databases do not have this capability. It's one of the things that really distinguishes MongoDB from other more modern databases. Relational databases have this capability, but relational databases suffer from the problem of being an architecture that was built 40 years ago. And so they have trouble scaling and having resiliency in their platform. So what MongoDB does is gives you all the benefits of relational database with the power to scale, the performance and the flexibility of a modern database, which is why it makes such an attractive platform for developers. And so that's essentially what the aggregation framework does, and it's a very attractive part of our value proposition to our -- to those developers and customers who are using MongoDB. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Got it. And then you already got 85 questions on Atlas, but I'll ask one anyway. So I think I saw that you lowered the price, is that MongoDB Atlas cost center is I think deployed on AWS Mumbai. Is that right by like 10% to 15%? Is that right? And so can you maybe talk about the logic and expected payoff from that decision? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. And so what we've seen is actually a little bit of a price war going on between AWS and Google in that marketplace. And so as a beneficiary of being a basically a customer of AWS and as they started reducing prices in that market, we were able to pass on those savings to those customers. We think, obviously, that market is also more price sensitive than, say, other markets just because of the cost of labor is it that much cheaper. And we feel like India is a massive market for us. It's one of the highest download sites of any region in the world. And we're very excited about the opportunity there, and we believe that those price decreases will pay off in a big way. Richard Davis -- Canaccord Genuity -- Analyst Thank you very much. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator And next, we have Jack Andrews with Needham. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the catalyst that enabled you to have the 20-plus conversations with C-level executives. I mean, is that related to the fact that we keep hearing some of these digital transformations are not going so well? Or just how did you really get an opportunity to have those types of conversations? Was it through direct sales? Partners? If you could shed some light on that, would be helpful. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, absolutely. So I would say a couple things. I would say that with regards to a lot of these digital transformation efforts, obviously, everyone has been talking about digital transformation for a while, but what people find is that it's far easier said than done. In fact, one of the blockers to basically getting to where people want to go is the fact that they have trouble using their data. The data is either trapped in silos. It's hard to use. There's a lot of duplicative data and so forth. And so people are realizing that they don't have a way to really manage their data. Their ability to be successful is going to be limited. Second, I would say is that we, as a company, have fundamentally changed a lot over the last few years. Obviously, we went public last October. That was a real signal to customers that we are now a really viable and strategic partner to companies. The maturity of the product has increased dramatically, especially now with the announcement of ACID transaction support. That perked up a lot of people's ears about the fact that, wow, they could use MongoDB for virtually any use case. And I would also say the maturity and the efficacy of our go-to-market efforts, these meetings didn't just happen by themselves because our sales teams are now being much more strategic on how they engage with customers. We're trying to go higher earlier in the sales cycle, and that's yielding these kinds of meetings. And so I would tell you that these -- the quality of these meetings have been outstanding, and it's really a sign of, one, how important this is to all these customers; and two, our credibility as a potential partner to them in their efforts. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst And then just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned that people are in the evaluation process of MongoDB 4.0 right now. Could you just talk about maybe just qualitatively the level of interest you're seeing for this particular release of your product versus maybe some other releases? And how optimistic are you of a potential uplift, if you will, from this product? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say the interest has been extremely high. It's probably been the most requested feature for a number of years. So when we announced it in February, there was a huge amount of receptivity, positive receptivity to that announcement. That also generated a bunch of new engagements with the customers and prospects, and frankly, it's allowing us to be more strategic. The beta version of the software is available for people to use and test. The feedback has been very positive, and we expect to GA it in the near future. Jack Andrews -- Needham & Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. Operator [Operator instructions] We move next to Brian White with Monness, Crespi. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Yes. On the IBM relationship, how should we think about that ramping in fiscal '19? And IBM has their own cloud, so I'm wondering if you're going to have a partnership with their cloud as well. And will they be selling Atlas? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer I would say that we are quite optimistic about the IBM relationship. We feel like it's a real relationship. It's not, again, one of these Barney announcements. And as I said -- and the way it's real is that their salespeople are now incentivized to sell Atlas to their customers. We're already seeing interest in -- I'm sorry, MongoDB -- we're already seeing interest in the field, and there's already a bunch of engagements happening in a bunch of different regions. And so I'll defer to Michael in terms of how we think we want to -- how we think it will show up in -- Michael Gordon -- Chief Financial Officer Look, I think it'll take time. The agreement has some time horizon for them to work through the commitment, so it won't be an immediate impact and will take time for them to ramp the global sales force. But we should see the benefit of it over time. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst And just as a follow-up, 5G commercial network starting to come online this year. And so I'm wondering, what does 5G mean to MongoDB? Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, I think one of the things about -- one of the trends that we see very clearly is the rise of mobile applications. And MongoDB has been well suited for a long time for people to build mobile apps. One, it's a very -- mobile apps tend to have a very high rate of change because people are constantly adding new features, fixing bugs, and so they need a platform that can enable them to have high developer productivity. Obviously, with certain apps, you can have thousands, if not, millions of users, and so you want a platform that could scale. And with the distributed capabilities, you also want to have fast or low latency as we provide access. And so MongoDB is well designed for those kind of use cases. And as the pipes get bigger, it's 5G today, it could be something else in the future, that only plays to our strength because it will encourage people to build higher performance, more content rich, more streaming content, video and so forth that has more -- requires more bandwidth, and that plays well to MongoDB as people think about building those kinds of applications. Brian White -- Monness, Crespi, Hardt -- Analyst Great. Thank you. Operator And everyone, that concludes our question-and-answer session at this time. For closing remarks, I'd like to turn it back over to Dev Ittycharia. Dev Ittycheria -- President and Chief Executive Officer Well, we're really pleased about the quarter. I think we're thrilled about the fact that MongoDB is increasingly being viewed as a strategic vendor by customers everywhere. There's clearly strong demand for MongoDB all around the world, and the breadth of use case continues to grow. We're really excited about the partner ecosystem growing as evidenced by the IBM relationship and the fact that our partner business is really healthy. And obviously, Atlas continues to grow very, very quickly. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have our MongoDB World Conference on June 27, and so we encourage all of you to visit us here in New York City. Thank you.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"TSB branch in London: Paul Pester appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken and where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts. Photograph: Neil Hall Has the embattled chief executive of TSB found time to attend an emergency media-training course since his disastrous appearance at Westminster last month? We’ll find out on Wednesday when Paul Pester is grilled by MPs for the second time in just over a month on the calamitous IT failure at the challenger bank earlier this year. Pester’s first appearance at the treasury select committee on May 2nd is widely regarded as a master class in how not to handle questions from angry parliamentarians. Indeed, many observers deemed his performance even worse than that of former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, when he informed astonished committee members back in 2011 that the time for “remorse and apology” for bankers was over. The main problem with the TSB boss was that he appeared to inhabit some alternative reality where the bank’s systems weren’t really broken, where more than one million customers were not locked out of their accounts and where nobody had missed out on house, holiday or car purchases because they could not access their cash. But the committee had examples of all the above and gave a graphic real-time demonstration of the scale of the chaos when two staff members attempted – unsuccessfully – to access their TBS accounts even as Pester sat there claiming things were running smoothly. His response: “It’s nice to see we’ve got so many TSB customers in the room. Thanks for banking with us” has to go down as one of the most ill-judged attempts at humour from a boss whose job is clearly on the line. Media training or not, there will be little opportunity for levity at Wednesday’s session. Last time, Pester was unable to say when the problems would be fixed, nor was he able to give any guidance on how many businesses had been affected, or how large the bank’s compensation bill might be. He’s not going to get away with that. More than six weeks on, many TSB customers say they are still locked out of their accounts and report long waits to get through to helplines. Customers logging in to the bank’s website are still being greeted with the message “We’re working to put things right” along with a helpline number – and a warning that lines are busier than usual. Fraudsters are using the cover of the chaos to target TSB account holders, with numerous incidences of bogus texts, emails and telephone calls. Stressed TSB employees are feeling the impact too, with reports of a large number of defections to other banks. There’s been no information yet about how many customers have closed their accounts. Pester will clearly be anticipating a rough ride but he was given a taste of just how tough his grilling will be in the form of an exchange of letters between Nicky Morgan and the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority. In the letters, released on Wednesday morning, FCA head Andrew Bailey – who will also be attending the session – takes the unusual step of publicly criticising the TSB boss for his over-optimistic spin on the botched IT job. He also suggests that Pester had more detail on the extent of the systems failure that he could, and should, have shared with the committee in May. Morgan, meanwhile, has piled on the pressure by saying she remains “deeply concerned” about the “quality and accuracy” of the evidence provided to the committee by Pester. The TSB boss may have taken some comfort on Tuesday when Tesco Bank was hit by its own IT glitch, leaving customers unable to access their accounts online or via mobile phone. They were still able to use their cards, however, and normal service was restored within five hours. A systems failure at Visa last Friday also caused widespread disruption in the UK – where it processes a third of all spending – and across Europe as customers were unable to use their cards to pay for transactions. Morgan has written to Visa Europe boss Charlotte Hogg, demanding to know when the company first became aware of the failure, how many cards were affected, and whether customers will be compensated. If she’s not satisfied with the answers, Morgan says she’ll be calling Hogg, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, to appear before the committee too. The credit card company has said the meltdown was triggered by a hardware failure but has given no detail. The joke doing the rounds in the City is that Visa made the mistake of calling in Mr Pester to advise on IT. Fiona Walsh is business editor of theguardian.com Subscribe.
