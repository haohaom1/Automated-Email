Revenue at the Miami-based company’s five IBDs grew 5% year over year in the third quarter, to $300 million, while pretax income surged 120% to $18.5 million, Financial Planning reports. That growth stems from record client assets of $175.5 billion, higher interest rates and rising product sales, according to the publication. Noteworthy: The IBD revenue accounted for more than 85% of the company’s total of $348.9 million. Advisor headcount also surged, in a sign the company’s recruiting efforts over the past couple of years are paying off. The total is now 4,300, up 17% year over year, increasing compensation expenses by $3.9 million. The company’s third-quarter results were its first since the SEC charged former Chairman Phillip Frost with involvement in a pump-and-dump scheme, Financial Planning noted. But its earnings filing with the SEC didn’t disclose any new information about Frost, who remains Ladenburg Thalmann’s largest shareholder. --Ross Snel The numbers are looking good at Ladenburg Thalmann’s independent broker-dealers.
