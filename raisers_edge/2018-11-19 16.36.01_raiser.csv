Private Equity By Jon Shazar (MLB Shop) April was not a good month for Mark Walter. His Los Angeles Dodgers, which came oh so close to giving him his first World Series title in November, sputtered out of the gate with a record even worse than that of their hated rivals in San Francisco. (Things have not gotten much better since.) The SEC’s probe into Guggenheim Partners’ relationship with Bob Diamond grew into a look at Walter’s home-buying practices, including an $85 million pad in Malibu he personally co-owns and a house in Pacific Palisades that his lady friend—who is not his special lady, according to Guggenheim—has been living in. And to top it all off, said lady friend, on-leave Guggenheim global head of internal distribution Alexandra Court, has left to do her own thing. Ms. Court, who went on sabbatical in June 2017, departed in April, according to her LinkedIn profile…. Ms. Court’s personal website said she is “now focused on her own entrepreneurial and social impact interests, as well as advising businesses on growth strategies and implementation plans….” She also had a personal relationship with Guggenheim Chief Executive Mark Walter, according to people familiar with the matter. Guggenheim’s board reviewed the relationship and took no action, these people said. “If there were a relationship, the prospect of a nonbusiness relationship would have been fully and promptly disclosed to the appropriate parties at Guggenheim in accordance with established processes and procedures, which then would have been fully implemented, to avoid improper influence or favor,” a Guggenheim spokesman said last year.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Barclays would be delighted to get access to Standard Chartered's $56 billion in Asian deposits.(AFP) Is a major banking deal brewing in the City of London? The grapevine contends that Barclays chairman John McFarlane is under pressure from activist shareholder Edward Bramson's Sherborne fund, which has accumulated a 5.4 per cent stake in the 3-century old former Quaker High Street bank that Bob Diamond morphed in the early 2000s into Britain's only bulge bracket global investment bank Bramson wants Barclays to shrink or even sell Barclays Capital, its investment banking crown jewel, to release $40 billion in dedicated capital to the unit. This is anathema to Jes Staley, the bank's American, ex J.P. Morgan Master of the Universe CEO. McFarlane and Staley would prefer to blunt Bramson's activist thrust by making a takeover bid for Standard Chartered, a bank that never recovered from disastrous lending spree to Indian steel oligarchs and colossal mismanagement by its senior executives in London, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Gulf under former CEO Peter Sands, ultimately ousted by pressure from Temasek, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund that is its largest shareholder. StanChart has not really recovered since Sands's ouster. Revenues have fallen 20 per cent since 2014 while overhead is still bloated. CEO Bill Winters, another J.P. Morgan alumnus has been unable to boost the bank's return on equity above its cost of capital or deliver a credible growth strategy. Barclays would be delighted to get access to StanChart's $56 billion in Asian deposits and its franchises in some of the hottest banking markets in the Pacific Rim. Yet a $90 billion merger would necessitate a stock swap that might not be palatable to Temasek or other StanChart shareholders since Barclays shares trade well below tangible book value due to its pathetic ROE, multiple legal swords of Damocles and history of boardroom palace coups and CEO regicide. StanChart's culture is unique in UK finance and there is no real regional overlap with Barclays, now that it has decided to exit Africa and the Middle East to focus on Anglo-American corporate and investment banking. Barclays shareholders would be hugely diluted by an offer for StanChart at a time when they desperately want management to boost dividends and profits, not engage in self-serving deal making. It is also doubtful if a takeover bid from a bank that faces US Justice Department and FCA charges over the 2008 emergency capital raising scheme, whose four former top executives face criminal charges in the case, whose celebrity CEO Bob Diamond was grilled in the House of Commons and fired by the Bank of England's diktat after the LIBOR manipulation scandal would send Stan Chart shareholders into paroxysms of delight. Zero plus zero still equals zero. A failed bid for StanChart would mean the axe for McFarlane, Staley and possibly the corporate and investment banking franchises. This is an irony since Staley survived the whistleblower scandal with a mere £640,000 fine from regulators and settled the US mortgage misselling scandal for $2 billion, not the feared $5 billion with Justice. The Crown Court also dropped the Serious Fraud Office (SFO's) criminal case against Barclays, removing a threat to its UK banking license, though Justice, SEC and FCA probes into the 2008 fund raising in the Gulf remain live. None of this makes me sanguine about the odds of a Barclays cash and share bid for Standard Chartered Bank. Size matters in global banking, yet a ""Godzilla strategy"" alone will not solve the myriad problems faced by Britain's two historic but troubled money center banks. I do not believe these banks will merge in the proximate future. There is no evidence that either bank has engaged advisors, lawyers, white knights or political allies or creditor syndicates for an imminent deal. Yet Edward Bramson's Sherborne can well goose Barclays share price once it unveils its restructuring (shrinking?) blueprint. Standard Chartered remains they juiciest takeover bait in international banking, a Cinderella waiting from a kiss from a fairy tale prince names Jamie, not Jes. A blowout May payroll number and the formation of a new Italian government in Rome means the bear market in US Treasury debt resumes with a vengeance. A 3.8 per cent unemployment rate and 0.3 per cent average hourly earnings means the Powell Fed has reached the limits of its dual mandate. This means a certain interest rate hike at the June FOMC, the September FOMC and possibly even the December FOMC.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Ruth Sunderland for the Mail on Sunday Published: 16:26 EST, 26 May 2018 | Updated: 06:30 EST, 27 May 2018 10 View comments Do we really need a big British investment bank? I ask the question because Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, apparently believes we do – and he thinks that the City regulators are of the same mind. One of the many battles Staley has been fighting is against activist investor Edward Bramson, who wants Barclays to scale back its investment banking arm. Staley, a Wall Streeter imported to Canary Wharf from JP Morgan, is determined to hold on to it. Not only that, but he is also said to believe the regulators will back him, on the basis it would be bad for the country to lose our only remaining home-grown investment bank. Ruth Sunderland says generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank Since the Big Bang opened up the Square Mile to overseas players in 1986, the investment banking scene has been dominated by the big boys from the US: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley et al. It’s rather like Wimbledon –lovely when the top players happen to be British, but not essential. The main thing is that Britain plays host, not the nationality of the participants. There is a respectable argument that the UK needs an investment bank of its own to look after its interest when underwriting Government debt issues. But generations of bosses of Barclays have agonised over whether or not to split the retail bank, which provides straightforward banking services to individuals and firms, from the much riskier ‘casino’ investment bank. The bank has suffered almost from a split-personality, with the workaday UK operation on one side and the casino on the other. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays The conflict between the two is reflected in the way the bank has swung to-and-fro in the selection of its chief executives: investment banker Staley follows Antony Jenkins from the retail side, who in turn came as an antidote to Bob Diamond. But there is a larger point at stake. The financial crisis revealed how taxpayers could end up having to foot the bill for the antics of casino banks. For much of the 20th Century, this was not an issue because of post-Depression era rules brought in during the 1930s that meant investment banking and the humdrum high street variety had to be kept separate. That legislation was repealed in the late 1990s, and many observers see it as a major factor in the crisis. As a consequence, we now have ‘ring-fencing’ where large operators such as Barclays are allowed to own investment and retail banks but have to quarantine them off from one another. The history of ‘ring-fences’ and ‘Chinese Walls’, however, is that they are not fool-proof and can erode over time. Barclays has been struggling for years to overcome a toxic culture where it historically, and recently, has been at odds with regulators. Relations came close to breaking down totally in the Bob Diamond era and Staley had his own run-in, when he was recently censured for attempting to expose a whistleblower. The bank has been dogged by a crisis era loan of $3 billion it made to Qatari investors, when it carried out an £11.8 billion emergency fund-raising in 2008 to avoid a UK Government bail-out. Charges by the Serious Fraud Office related to that loan have been thrown out by a court but former senior managers are still on the hook. Staley’s view on the investment bank has been at odds with the previously expressed opinion of the chairman, who has said he thought it best to shrink it. In any event, the notion that Barclays wants to save its investment bank for the good of the nation, rather than its own highly bonused employees, invites scepticism. The City has oodles of investment banking expertise, which is great for larger companies. Small and medium firms, however, have far too often been exploited and maltreated by their lenders. It may not be as exciting, or as lucrative, but what we really do need is a properly functioning business bank.

SANTA FE, N.M. — In 1921, the New York Times named Taos the “Provincetown of the Desert,” comparing the small, high desert town in New Mexico to a long-established art colony on Cape Cod, Mass. The Times report was recognition of Taos’ own up-and-coming status in the art world, spurred by the Taos Society of Artists. The 12-person collective, which included painters who had moved in from the Midwest and East Coast, like Joseph Henry Sharp, Ernest Blumenschein and E.I. Couse, existed from 1915 to 1927. Most of the members became famous for their paintings of New Mexico landscapes, and the Pueblo people who lived in and around Taos. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “It preserved a record of a time and of the peoples in that time, principally in northern New Mexico,” said Carl Jones, president of the Couse Foundation, an organization named after the art society’s first president that operates the Couse-Sharp Historic Site in downtown Taos. The society “helped preserve customs, traditions, on canvas, that would’ve been lost a long time ago,” Jones said. The existing site includes studios of both Couse and Sharp. For the past several years, the foundation has been in talks about a central location for archival and research materials about all the Taos collective’s members. A recent grant of $600,000 has pushed the plan closer toward its goal of a 2021 opening. The Lunder Foundation, a Portland, Maine, organization started by Dexter Shoe Co. founder Peter Lunder and his wife, Paula, awarded the grant earlier this month. Jones wouldn’t say how much the total project will cost, but noted that a public fundraising campaign is on the horizon. The facility will be named The Lunder Research Center. “This is an opportunity to do something significant for the first time with Western art,” said Kevin Gillis, the Lunder Foundation’s president. He said most of the organization’s grants are given on the East Coast, despite the Lunder couple’s affinity for Western art. ADVERTISEMENTSkip “Peter and Paula think what Couse is doing is very worthwhile,” Gillis said. The Couse Foundation in Taos, which is planning an archival and research facility for materials related to the Taos Society of Artists, recently received a $600,000 grant to further the project. (SOURCE: The Couse Foundation) The grant, Jones said, will go toward repurposing a building next to the existing historic site. With 4,800 square feet of usable space, the research center will have a storage room for items like original documents; a smaller storage space for Native American artifacts collected by the Taos artists; a research library with literature on the society and the histories of New Mexico, Taos, and native peoples; a conservation space dedicated to the preservation of decades-old materials, and administrative offices for the Couse Foundation. Jones said he expects the facility to attract Western art professors, authors, graduate students and other scholars specifically studying the Taos Society artists and their work. The research center building has housed the Mission Gallery, whose owner is retiring. Parts of the Mission building are remnants of Sharp’s home, according to Jones. The center’s collection will include documents, articles, photos, artifacts and artworks relating to or previously belonging to almost all 12 society members, including Couse, Sharp, Blumenschein, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins, Julius Rolshoven, E. Martin Hennings and W. Herbert Dunton. Jones said that as the center establishes itself, he hopes to attract items specifically relating to other society members who didn’t leave as much behind. For Couse alone, the collection includes 10,000 photographic negatives and 5,000 photo prints, all relating to his artwork. Also in the center will be more than 30 Couse sketchbooks, paintings, personal letters and records of who purchased his paintings, and about 30 pairs of moccasins and other pieces of Native American clothing he collected. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Notre Dame connection “It’s going to be the most extensive, highly specialized archive on any group of artists,” said Dean Porter, a Taos Society scholar and retired director of the University of Notre Dame’s Snite Museum of Art. The main gallery and reception area of the research center will be named after Porter. He and several Taos Society experts from across the county have donated or promised the project various items. Porter is the author of several articles and books about Ufer and Higgins, whose work he discovered in the 1970s as part of Norte Dame’s museum collection. He also studied and wrote about the entire society as a co-author of the 1999 book “Taos Artists and their Patrons: 1898-1950.” He’s promised the center an estimated 20 boxes of materials, including interviews he conducted with close acquaintances and relatives of the Taos artists, like Oscar Berninghaus’ daughter and Higgins’ caretaker, as well as books, research papers and news articles. “Every article ever written on the Taos Society of Artists I have copies of,” Porter said during a recent phone interview from his home in Granger, Ind. He wishes something like the research center had existed when he started his work on the society more than 40 years ago. There’s a new generation of Taos Society scholars coming up nationwide who will benefit from access to the center collection, he said. Personal items like letters and notes will provide an inside look at the artists’ lives and thoughts. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Porter recalled a time when there wasn’t much focus on documents and papers relating to the Taos Society artists. He recalled a trip to New Mexico in 1975 when he visited Higgins’ first wife, Sara Parsons, during which time she handed him five paper grocery bags full of his letters, notes and receipts. “That was the archives,” he said with a laugh. The project is designed to bring materials like that back home, said Jones. He said there’s a risk they could end up donated and scattered among colleges and universities across the country where they might never see the light of day. “It would’ve been a real loss to the state of New Mexico or the town,” he said. “This is where they were created and this is where they came from.” Advertisement Copyright © 2018 Albuquerque Journal | Albuquerque, N.M. $10/mo Subscribe Other Offers Already a subscriber?

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"by Beecher Tuttle 25 May 2018 Following a lengthy restructuring process, Barclays is still under a great deal of pressure – as is the bank’s chief executive, Jes Staley. Meanwhile, the man who once held Staley’s post, controversial former CEO Bob Diamond, is quietly thriving. Barclays’ struggling investment banking division hasn’t reversed course as quickly as many had hoped, despite an aggressive growth strategy championed by Staley. The slow progress led activist investor Edward Bramson last week to call on Barclays to take a knife to the investment bank, stripping it of virtually all trading functions. Now, Barclays is said to be mulling a merger with fellow British bank Standard Chartered as a potential attempt to thwart Bramson’s demands. While the details of the rumor are murky, what’s clear is that Staley has his hands full. Diamond, who resigned amid the Libor controversy in 2012, appears to be enjoying more success while tangentially dipping his toes back into investment banking. London stockbroker Panmure Gordon, owned by Diamond’s Atlas Merchant Capital, is building an advisory and equity capital markets business, according to Financial News. The firm plans to double its headcount in London in the “medium term” after bringing on an M&A head back in January. Future hires will include managing director-level bankers as well as juniors. While Diamond doesn’t personally run Panmure Gordon, his fingerprints were likely all over the move. At the time of the takeover, Panmure’s then-CEO Patric Johnson said the firm would not become ""Barclays 2.0. It is not Bob Diamond coming back in and saying he is going to be chief executive.” Just one month later, Diamond’s firm replaced Johnson with a familiar face: former Barclays executive Ian Axe, who hinted at expanding the investment bank at the time of his hire. No matter how direct Dimon’s role, the former investment banker has to be smiling just a bit. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank just got kicked when it was already down. Literally hours after announcing plans to cut at least 7,000 jobs globally, Deutsche Bank acknowledged a Bloomberg report that it mistakenly transferred nearly $25 billion to Macquarie back in 2014 due to a human error. The blunder wouldn’t be as newsworthy if Deutsche Bank didn’t do something similar in March of this year, when it transferred 28 billion euros to its own Eurex account when it meant to transfer 28 billion yen. That’s a difference of $32.7 billion. When it rains, it pours. Meanwhile: Former Goldman Sachs CEO and New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine isn’t exactly crushing it with his new hedge fund. He’s raised just around $20 million so far. (Fox Business) President Trump has signed a bill that will roll back some Dodd-Frank mandates that put restrictions on smaller community banks with less than $250 billion in assets. The bigger news may be that the bill won’t offer any exemptions for bulge-bracket banks. (Reuters) Bank of England Governor Mark Carney believes the mechanisms are now in place to remove and punish “rolling bad apples” within banking. Carney is in the camp that believes individual bankers should face similar punishments aimed at banks. (Bloomberg) Merrill Lynch brokers are reportedly up-in-arms over a new compensation program that punishes advisors who don’t meet certain cross-selling targets. Some claim the plan is being implemented retroactively, equating to a clawback. (WSJ) Credit Suisse has poached UBS veteran Ryan Nelson to take over its newly-created role of global head of prime financing.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe, reports that Zambian multi-millionaire entrepreneur Rajan Mahtani has lost ownership of Zambezi Portland Cement, a leading cement manufacturer in the southern African country, as the High Court of Zambia awarded full ownership of the company to the Ventriglia family of Italy on Monday. The resolution follows a 10-year court battle between the Ventriglia family and Rajan Mahtani, a Zambian businessman of Indian origin. Mahtani had always claimed that he owned a 58% controlling stake in the business as payment for organizing financing for the Ventriglia family years ago, but the Ventriglia family insisted that he had no claim to the stake, asserting full ownership of the company. The Ventriglia family is one of the wealthiest and most powerful business families in Zambia today. In 1957, the patriarch of the family, Antonio Ventriglia along with his wife and children arrived Zambia from Italy. They established a Terazzo company, Ital Terazzo, which eventually became very successful. In an effort to diversify their investments in Zambia, the family decided to venture into cement manufacturing, establishing the Zambezi Portland Cement Company. The family approached Rajan Mahtani, a popular financier and business mogul who was a family friend to the Ventriglias, and asked him to help arrange financing for the new cement company. Mahtani, who was the Chairman and controlling shareholder of Finance Bank, Zambia, used his influence to syndicate a $100 million loan from the European Development Fund and the Kenya’s PTA Bank. In return, the Ventriglia family orally agreed to sell a 49% stake in the cement company to Rajan Mahtani’s investment vehicle, Finsbury Investments, for a discounted price of $60 million – an amount Mahtani never paid. The Ventriglia family soon needed additional financing in order to increase the cement plant’s capacity and Mahtani was on hand to help arrange an additional loan, in return for an additional 9% stake in the company for a discounted price. Even though Mahtani never paid for the shares he orally agreed to buy, he allegedly fraudulently procured his company secretaries to alter the register of Members and filed with Zambia’s Registrar of Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA) a fake photocopy of share transfer certificates indicating that he was a member and shareholder in Zambezi Portland Cement. The Ventriglia family has insisted that they never transferred the shares to Mahtani’s company. On Monday, the court ruled that Mahtani had indeed falsified share transfer certificates in the company, and as such did not own any shares in Zambezi Portland Cement. “Mahtani has been unable to produce the original signed copies of the share transfer certificates because they simply do not exist and he never paid for the shares. As such, complete ownership of the company firmly rests with the Antonio Ventriglia family,” a spokesperson of Zambezi Portland Cement confirmed to this reporter via email. Rajan Mahtani, 70, is one of Zambia’s most successful, yet controversial businessmen. He was previously the controlling shareholder and chairman of Zambia’s Finance Bank before it was acquired by Bob Diamond’s Atlas Mara in 2015. In Zambian businessman Chisanga Puta-Chekwe’s acclaimed book, Cobra In The Boat: Michael Sata’s Zambia, he claims that Mahtani brokered a controversial deal whereby the Zambian Government sold off the state-owned Konkola Copper Mines Plc, one of Africa’s largest integrated copper producers (and a company easily worth hundreds of millions of dollars), to Vedanta resources controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, for only $25 million, a tiny fraction of its real value. Rajan Mahtani did not respond to an email requesting for comment at the time of publishing this story. Source:Forbes This story is older than three days, the judgement has even been appealed against. The news now is about the appeal. Poor chap. Instead of enjoying his retirement, he is always being stressed by court issues. This man has been a crook all along period! This is how these crooks like Mahtani used to grab businesses…you go to his bank for assistance he sees an opportunity takeover your business.. alot of people have not been so lucky. Only in Zambia can a vile crook like Mahtani can still walk the streets freely. You are the one who is behind the case is over, no such thing as appeal, Rajan has been a shade character for a long time. An Indian wants to do an Italian job on Italians Mahtani is not a poor chap. He is a crook. Stole from Late Puta’s family (Mr. Puta was a shareholder and director of Finance Bank) Stole from Late Wadood’s family (Mr. Wadood was Managing Director of Finance Bank) Stole from Mr. Savior Konie (Mr. Konie was Managing Director of Professional Insurance) Stole from Mr. Fearon (Mr. Fearon was Managing Director of Finance Building Society). As for Zambezi Portland Cement, Money Launderer Mahtani’s partner in crime, Mr. Barkat Ali issued a fake letter that Rajan had brought in 5 million US dollars as capital and got a loan approved on that basis from his corrupt friend Michael Gondwe (then President of PTA Bank). Rajan is a money launderer. He steals tax from the UK, Canada, Zambia through his sister Schultz and girl friend Craven… Mathani is a gazetted crook. This Mahtani guy is greedy. People are blaming HH for having sold KCM for 25m. But it appears this guy was all behind the undervaluation. Because he was Ba Satas friend kaili so the PF spin doctors will always prefer HH mentioned in the sale of mines. It is good when such revelations happen hopefully some people see that selling a mine was not like vending imbalala by the roadside…..But the whole idea is so easy to sale to the gullible and simple minds of most voters that HH sold all the mines. Unfortunately it is a “Good” political strategy from the PF though. It is up to the UPND and HH to “unspin” it. But i dont expect supposedly educated people to believe this …please leave it to the uneducated gullible HH was not involved in the later sale of KCM. I don’t like HH but I wouldn’t allow people to falsely accuse him. HH was involved with Anglo-American the first buyers of the company. It’s if anything Levy Mwanawasa who should take the blame. KCM Plc saga was: The late Levy Patrick Mwanawasa msrip-HH-Rajah Mahtan. This thug sold KCM in exchange for $50,000,000 commission for himself and another $25,000,000 for Maureen Mwanawasa. Typical Indian this Mahtani. They want to own things without spending anything. How many times is he going to ‘lose’ ownership? Next story please Justice has been served. Mahtani’s list of controversies go back when he swindled the Zambian people through that Carrington maize deal and used Nawakwi and M’membe to divert the blame on FTJ. Who can forget writing off a $4m loan for Mutembo Nchito in exchange for a Nolle Prosequi after a court had bonafide evidence that he forge a judge’s signature?? Mahtani is a hardcore white collar crook whose luck has run out after manipulating previous presidencies to his advantage. Waloba ilyauma. Justice for the Ventrigllias and congrats!! The chap should spend his retirement in a Zambian Jail. That’s what he been sowing all these years. Mahtani’s crookedness goes back to the time he swindled the late Humphrey Mulemba who had entrusted him with ill-gotten wealth from the late Tiny Rowland. Sounds like good history. Would you like to share more on this story @Duda And when he is in trouble he jumped on a plane to UK …using his British passport. The man is vile and evil…there is nothing inspirational about his richies he is a sick petty little crook..am surprised he is still alive after so people he has crossed. Well, thief stealing from thief is not theft. Tiny Rowland? That name is familar what business did he own?? @8.4 jay jay he owned Lonhro group of companies. A crook. I think he even wrote a book about how he stole wealth from Africans. You can google the man. Thanks …I have just read about him on Wikipedia…apparently in 1996 President Nelson Mandela awarded Rowland the Order of Good Hope, the highest South African honour..really laughable. He stole from late Nyambe, the then Vice Chairman of Finance Bank. Cement is too expensive in Zambia. It’s not easy to build in Zambia. Zambian are so useless and lazy that even news happening under their noses they have to read without shame in Forbes, through its contributor, Mfonobong Nsehe. This Mahtani is a big crook …there he is taking things to court based on oral agreement…these are the people involved in selling KCM for a song to his Indian friend Anil. *Zambian media…. The perennial doomsayer …Come see what your friends are doing here in Zed…i was there dude…always berating Zambia from the diaspora…when i cam back home, was shocked to see how young people were moving forward with businesses, savings, property etc… Dont be led on by social media sir…. Who’s berating who? Have you read what I have written ..always the same fooools posting comments and changing their silly names? So it was a Zambian of Indian origin who crooked the people of Zambia to sell the mine to his fellow Indian for a song and not the Tonga man from bweengwa.No wonder Some one said lies have no legs to stand on. In addition, it was Mathani who took J&W investment to State House in February 2004 and took Baluba Mine away from First Quantum. That move shaped the future of Luanshya town! Zambians must apologise to HH for falsely accusing him of the sale of KCM to Indians for a song. HH, I Chitapankwa Allepo Trump do tender in an apology for falsely accusing you on the deal. On behalf of all those who did not read, I say I am sorry. The only issue I have got with UPND now is the adoption of Charmaine. If he is found to have forged docs, let him be caged or deported to Kashmir. We are tired of chinese, Lebanese & Indian crooks hiding behind legal technicalities while abating rampant corruption When he is about to be caged he jumps on a plane to UK…its from the likes of this guy I first heard of the term dual citizenship…then bribes top leaders in Zambia whilst there; as he can not stand UK he longs staying in Zambia where he is treated like a God. Falsified legal documents? How about some jail time? He would never see the inside of a jail…he has too many secrets; this crook used to fund a lot of political campaigns!! The KCM sale was another of LPM’s frauds, apart from the Zesco deals. Rajan won’t let go without a fight. If both parties weren’t greedy, there wasn’t going to be all this, what’s wrong with these ba Zimandola? Those Italian mafia are supposed to be Mahtani’s employees because without him there wasn’t going to be Zambezi Portland nor Ital Terrazzo. KK is too old to reconcile them, maybe Tom Mtine, he’s another Zimandola Ayatalloh Terrazzo started off as a small company when no one sold tiles especially marble tiles or roofing tiles in Zambia give credit where its due…Rajan was using his bank to find out weakness in your business and using that against you …this *****t has breached every banking law there is and he is still around because he is connected like a gun merchant. …before the Chinese money arrived Rajan was the go to guy for laundering money!! KK gave up on Mahtani a long time ago. If it wasn’t for Rajan ‘s Mum, KK would have jailed him for a good number of years and deported him to the UK. The relationship between the Ventriglia family and Mahtani family is a business relationship. It centers on Zambezi Portland Cement Company. It is unlikely that the Mahtani family deserves to go away empty handed. Leave company shares alone. Focus on the loan facilitation process. Estimate the value of the facilitation process. What are the service charges for the loan? What is the average level of service charges in the financial sector? The Mahtani family needed to work with reliable lawyers when dealing with huge sums of money. But fees here seem a reasonable proposition for the Mahtani family to be paid to them by the Ventriglia family. The Itanian family owes Mahtani, $8.7Bn in facilitation and interests, a claim reads in part. But, how can facilitation fee be 8000% more than actual loan obtained??? Serves him right. First the Guptas are chased with their tails between their tun Nchafu. Now Mathani is about to face the new Africa. Kikiki I am loving this. No connections in the current govt. That’s what happens. Ati Banker. Worse than the neighbourhood shylock who appeared like owning the gleamy cars parked in yard. Now the mojo is gone. The Venitians just want their blood. Mahtani should do with palty return on his flesh sold to Bob and Co. Comments are closed. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"It might be little more than a month since the founder’s defenestration at media giant WPP but Sir Martin Sorrell was prominent last night on the main “boulevard” at the Chelsea Flower Show’s exclusive gala for the titans of corporate Britain. Was the diminutive multimillionaire, last spotted at the Royal Wedding, hunting clients for a new venture? “I don’t have to hunt for clients,” laughed the adman, who apparently has “many things” planned for the future. Sorrell was earlier spotted deep in a huddle with Goldman Sachs chieftain Richard Gnodde. Spy doubts they were discussing the dahlias. Talk of financing his new venture perhaps? Don’t be misled by the brainiac reputation of Adair Turner, former Financial Services Authority chairman and serial think-tanker. He was the only bigwig brave enough to take the plunge down the showpiece 40ft treehouse slide, to hearty cheers from all. Spy wondered if he’d be leaping for the top job at the Bank of England when Mark Carney’s term ends next year. He went for it last time, but alas, not now. “I don’t think they’d give it to me,” he admits. Turner was mingling by the well-populated stand of sponsors M&G Investments where City luminaries such as BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and Korn Ferry headhunting supremo Oliver Pawle also lurked, as former PM David Cameron and wife Samantha wandered by. The City’s finest have clearly been hitting the gym in the past year. Keen gardener Stephen Hester, chief executive of RSA, had shed a few pounds. He said he was still “emotionally attached” to his old shop RBS, and will be soon be lunching with his successor there, Ross McEwan. Ryvita only, by the looks of it. Sainsbury high-up John Rogers, still Spy’s favourite to be chief executive Mike Coupe’s successor, was also a shadow of his former self — in weight terms at least. The once-portly grocer was barely unrecognisable in his svelte new guise, all helped by spending several days a week in a flat above a Sainsbury’s in Argos’ home town of Milton Keynes where, let’s face it, there’s not much else to do but go to the gym. Coupe was sprightly as ever, fresh from news of his £14 billion pop at Asda. Mrs C was clearly keen on examining the gardens but Mike — who kept his singing voice to himself for a change — said he was confident of success: “You have to have a degree of confidence or you wouldn’t be doing it,” he says. Spy also spotted him in conversation with Marks & Spencer boss Steve Rowe. After Argos as well, surely he couldn’t make it a hat trick? Another grocery goliath, Tesco’s Dave Lewis, was looking Teutonic in five o’clock shadow and white-framed square specs. He and wife Helena were hunting accoutrements for their small garden in west London. Spy wondered if he was much of a crooner like Coupe. Lewis sympathised with his arch-rival: “As someone who does very similar things before TV interviews, I feel for him,” he sighed. Lewis said the Booker takeover’s blooming marvellous, but poured weedkiller on talk that the cash and carry group’s boss Charlie Wilson was angling for his job. “He’ll have to put up with me for a while yet.” More shy of the rowing machine was a stout Digby Jones, whose beloved Aston Villa are in with a chance of promotion back to the big time. But Jones seemed more preoccupied by the concern over Jeremy Corbyn getting into Downing Street. Another gym-dodger is Serco chief executive Rupert Soames. Unlike brother Nicholas, Rupert was not at the Royal Wedding. But he was ebullient as ever, delighted that the fabled “shitometer” gauge on his desk has not gone off for a while due to the lack of crises at the once-accident prone services giant. Wife Milly was pleased about that, too, but not as delighted as she was to show off Rupert’s proud wearing of the Serco logo embroidered on the breast of his shirt, somewhat like a security guard. “I’m jolly proud of it,” said the stout boss, “but not of the man-boob underneath.” Elsewhere Spy ran into another busy dealmaker in GVC boss Kenny Alexander, up to his neck in getting to grips with Ladbrokes Coral following a £3.2 billion takeover. Both Alexander — a Scot who spent last Saturday’s wedding watching the racing and the rugby instead — and William Hill boss Philip Bowcock were breathless after a “rollercoaster” week for the sector which saw the US betting market opened up but FOBT stakes slashed. Bowcock, a proud Stoke fan, had the misfortune of seeing his team relegated but the only consolation was that the Potters have been the biggest winners for the bookie this season due to unfortunate punters betting on an upturn in form. Felicity Kendall has been causing sap to rise since Spy was a seedling. And the fragrant Good Life star still works her magic in her seventies. Guy Hands was left grinning ear to ear after she helped out at his Terra Firma-sponsored Prince’s Trust garden by Charles Williams, a chum of Hands from Oxford. “She spent a good hour and a half there with us, and looked absolutely marvellous!” he beamed. Lloyds chief Antonio Horta-Osorio was strolling with wife Ana looking for inspiration for their garden in Lisbon. AHO recalled: “I came here for my first time in 2008, one year into the financial crisis, and our host gave a speech I’ll never forget. It went: ‘Last year, we had many bankers at our party here at Chelsea. This year it is marvellous to see so many of you back again as gardeners.’” Enterprise Inns boss Simon Townsend — strong as an oak — was dishing out bone-crushing handshakes with gusto. Well he might: trading at pubs over the weekend was rather excellent by all accounts. “They came in for the wedding in the morning, then stayed all day for the FA Cup in the evening. Marvellous!” he guffawed. Bob Diamond was adding some American glitz to the affair, chatting to anyone who could handle the dazzle effect of his supernaturally white gnashers. It takes more than a few boring lawyers to kill off dealmaker Amanda Staveley’s cheer. She and partner Mehrdad Ghodoussi had just heard the news that the courts had thrown out the Serious Fraud Office’s charges against Barclays over its emergency fundraising from Qatar in the 2008 financial crisis. Staveley is suing the bank for fees she claims her PCP Capital Partners is owed for brokering the deal. Yesterday’s decision was irrelevant, she beamed: “I look forward to my day in court.” The couple still say they’re looking at football club deals despite reports that talks with Mike Ashley to buy Newcastle United appear to have faded. “We’re not talking about Magpies,” she said, cryptically. Back at the nosebag tent of Spy’s hosts Standard Aberdeen, trencher-man Martin Gilbert was in fine form, holding forth with chums Lynton Crosby, Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross and Rory Bremner among others. It was old pal Andrew Neil’s birthday, and a giant cake was produced for the shy, retiring, broadcasting tiger. “I’d like to thank Chelsea for putting this wonderful show on for my birthday,” said the great man. And with that, he blew out the candles on another Chelsea power show. You can find our Community Guidelines in full here. Are you sure you want to submit this vote?

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"80,000,000 ERC-20 tokens will be made available through token sale offering (TSO). Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) Will McDonough, CEO and Founder (Photo: Business Wire) HAMILTON, Bermuda--(BUSINESS WIRE)--iCash has launched its Proof of Trust (‘PoT’) protocol and initial token sale offering (TSO). The PoT protocol creates the ability to add an assurance and validation layer to blockchain transactions and is designed to increase trust and confidence in the system, paving the way for institutional adoption. The attraction of blockchain is that information is stored in an immutable ledger, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. However, there have been very few solutions to the challenge of validating the trustworthiness of data entered onto the blockchain. iCash’s solution is a PoT protocol that allows for processes to assure and insure the validity of smart contract inputs and outcomes. Commenting on the launch, CEO and Founder Will McDonough, said “Industries are being transformed as they conduct business on the blockchain via smart contracts. Developing checks and balances for validation of those transactions has been a problem for blockchain users and large corporations, until now.” “While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of Proof of Trust provides distributed trust and assurance for data input to the blockchain. The future belongs to innovators, and iCash’s underlying technology aims to institutionalize the blockchain, and protect those who transact from being victims of incorrect or nefarious data inputs on the blockchain.” PoT can be applied to any live verifiable event involving a smart contract in sectors such as: trading in commodities, currencies, cryptocurrencies, sports and wider asset management activities. iCash, through its protocol, enables the filtration and appeal of smart contract outcomes at scale and across ledgers. Fast, incorruptible appeal and settlement are achieved via a community of delegates, which validates and audits the trustworthiness of data inputs and outcomes. iCash uses a reputational algorithm designed to track and rank the trustworthiness of its delegates over time and only the most trustworthy delegates are able to validate data inputs, and thus earn iCash. PoT increases the scalability of smart contract input verification and execution on the blockchain. The iCash technology team is currently focused on the Ethereum, EOS, and NEO blockchains, but are also developing the platform to work across all blockchains. The opportunity set for iCash’s implementation is global, and the firm has to date secured 70 patents in 100 countries. iCash’s management team has a successful record of building businesses in emerging technology and institutional finance. Its leadership includes CEO Will McDonough, who previously led the $825 million IPO for Atlas Mara on the London Stock Exchange with co-founder and former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond, as well as CIO Magnus Sigurdsson, who developed asset allocation strategies for a $7 billion portfolio at TIFF, the not-for-profit organisation, and global macro at 55 Institutional. The Company’s President Jonathan Malveaux is a JD/MBA with 25 years of experience in Asia working internationally for Panasonic, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. The Company’s Chief Operating Officer and Chief Compliance Officer previously served as Risk Management Officer at the $75 billion State of Massachusetts Pensions Reserve Investment Board (MA PRIM). iCash’s Chief Economist Max Fraad-Wolff was also among the first Wall Street analysts to value LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and AliBaba. NOTES TO EDITORS About iCash iCash is a revolutionary company dedicated to bringing trust to the blockchain. iCash’s Proof of Trust protocol assures the validity of Smart Contract settlements. Blockchain ensures that information is immutably stored without a central authority, but not enough attention is paid to the negative impact when an input to the blockchain is not trustworthy. iCash introduces the Proof of Trust (PoT) protocol as a multi-platform protocol that enables real-world inputs to be validated by decentralized participants in settling Smart Contracts. While Proof of Work and Proof of Stake provide distributed trust for data storage, the introduction of PoT provides distributed trust for data input. PoT uses a reputational algorithm and known participants to provide real-world validation without sacrificing technical efficiency. With this, interactions and events can be trusted & verified before being entered into the blockchain. iCash is made up of executives, academics and entrepreneurs with hundreds of years of experience in public and private companies—with hundreds of billions in market cap including: BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Electronic Arts, General Electric, State of Massachusetts Pension Fund, Uber, and more. The world-class leadership team with over 70 patents and trademarks across 100 countries position iCash to be a truly global token protocol. The company’s team is led by founder and CEO, Will McDonough who has built and scaled multiple public and private companies, managed the private capital of the Partners of Goldman Sachs, and later co-founded London Stock Exchange listed Atlas Mara, alongside former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond. McDonough is also a founding member of the Blockchain Commission for Sustainable Development, an organization that supports the United Nations’ ability to integrate blockchain technologies in meeting Sustainable Development Goals.

Ahead of her wedding to photographer Francesco Carrozzini, son of the late Vogue Italia editor Franca Sozzani, she and pals including Glee star Dianna Agron and former Barclays boss Bob Diamond’s daughter, Nell, headed for Mexico. As well as going fishing and watching the Royal Wedding, they were given matching Juicy Couture tracksuits — though as this snap shows, Bee, who works in theatre production, seemed happier in a bikini.

After more than 20 years of working with Arnold, Ocean Spray is looking to shake up its agency roster. SelectResources International is running the review. Arnold—which Ocean Spray credited five years ago with keeping its cranberry grower-owner advertisements ""fresh""—is not believed to be defending the account. ""We are extremely proud of our 20-plus-year relationship with Arnold and all the work we have done together to build the Ocean Spray brand,"" a spokeswoman wrote in an email to Ad Age. ""As we work to expand our portfolio and cause disruption in the food and beverage space, we feel it is important for us to look at our business differently, both internally, as well as how we work with agency partners. We look forward to expanding our roster of agencies to help fuel the next chapter of the brand's success."" In February, the Lakeville-Middleboro, Massachusetts-based company announced President and CEO Randy Papadellis would be leaving after 18 years at the company. At the time, Ocean Spray named Bobby Chacko, who had been serving as a senior vp and chief growth officer since 2017, as president and chief operating officer. A month later, the company said its board of directors had unanimously elected Chacko as its CEO. He also still holds the president role. Arnold has seen some changes itself recently. In late April, Ad Age reported, the agency's CEO Pam Hamlin and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Scott Feyler were planning to depart the agency. Ocean Spray has been on a mission to prove the health benefits of its products. It announced last year it would invest more than $10 million the following five years to research the antimicrobial benefits of cranberries, and the role any benefits might play in combating antimicrobial resistance. Its Ocean Spray Cranberry Health Institute was set to launch this year. Ocean Spray Cranberries also petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to be able to use health claim language pertaining to the ""consumption of cranberry products and reduced risk of recurrent urinary tract infection in healthy women"" in September. But outside researchers have questioned those claims. Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. spent $21.8 million in measured media in the U.S. in 2017, according to Kantar Media.

1015016,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Edit your personal details Change your password Activist investor Edward Bramson is reportedly agitating for British bank Barclays PLC (LON:BARC) to jettison large chunks of its investment bank business. According to the Reuters news agency, Bramson, who took a 5% stake in Barclays in February via his Sherborne Investors investment vehicle, has been pressing for Barclays’ management to slim down the investment banking arm to those parts that directly serve corporate clients. According to Reuters’ sources, that would mean the culling of the cash equities, currency and fixed income trading desks. Barclays has struggled to rebuild its reputation since its most prominent scandal in 2012, when it paid a £290mln fine to the US and UK authorities for rigging Libor, which measures the rate at which banks can borrow from one another. More recently, chief executive Jes Staley somehow managed to keep his job despite being fined £642,430 for trying to identify a whistle-blower at the bank. Staley joined Barclays from US hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management, so he will be no stranger to the tactics of activist investors. He replaced Antony Jenkins, a veteran of the retail banking arm of Barclays, who was appointed to clear up the reputational damage sustained during the wheeling & dealing tenure of his predecessor, Bob Diamond. Here's the detail on activist investor Ed Bramson's plan to shake-up Barclays https://t.co/PmqIfJYERV Staley has generally shifted the emphasis back towards investment banking and it is thought that he would be resistant to Bramson’s proposals. Some shareholders told Reuters they believed Bramson might be underestimating the challenge of stripping out the investment bank’s underperforming units without hurting stronger parts. “I am pretty sure returns in Cash Equities are fairly rubbish but it’s very hard to do ECM (equity capital markets business) and some M&A activities without it,” one of Sherborne’s own major investors told the news agency. “I think the Markets bit of Barclays CIB is more profitable than he thinks it is, if anything it is the Commercial Bank that is the laggard,” he added. Shares in Barclays were down 0.3% at 208.4p in a flat market. Barclays is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail and commercial banking, credit cards, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services, with an extensive international presence in Europe, the USA, Africa and Asia....

1053951,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Returns as of 11/19/2018 Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. Returns as of 11/19/2018 If you're looking for stocks that have made tremendous comebacks in 2018, Opko Health (NASDAQ:OPK) and Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN) definitely fit the bill. Opko stock was down nearly 20% this year before roaring back. Myriad Genetics saw its share price plunge close to 40% earlier in 2018, but a strong rebound has the stock price close to where it began the year. Which of these two comeback stories is the better choice for investors now? Here's how Opko Health and Myriad Genetics stack up. Image source: Getty Images. Opko Health's Q1 results are a great place to start in determining why investors might want to consider the stock. After a painfully slow launch, secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) drug Rayaldee began to enjoy some decent momentum. Total prescriptions for Rayaldee soared 730% year over year and jumped 38% higher than 2017 Q4. Some analysts think that Rayaldee could reach peak annual sales in the ballpark of $700 million. There's a long way to go to hit that mark, but for the first time in quite a while, there's reason for some optimism about the drug. The biggest source of revenue for Opko, though, is BioReference Labs (BRL). BRL is the third-largest clinical laboratory in the U.S. It focuses on genetic testing. In addition, BRL's sales team markets Opko's 4Kscore prostate cancer test. The business hasn't performed all that well in recent quarters. However, Opko put a new management team in place and thinks that BRL's revenue will improve in 2018. Opko could have several new products on the way. The company hopes to get a green light soon from the FDA for marketing the Claros point-of-care prostate cancer test. A phase 3 clinical study is in progress evaluating human growth hormone product hGH-CTP in treating growth hormone-deficient children. The company also has several phase 2 pipeline candidates, including an experimental drug targeting treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, as well as type 2 diabetes and obesity drug OPK88003. One other reason many investors like Opko is the company's CEO, Phillip Frost. Frost is a billionaire with a long track record of success in the pharmaceutical industry. He has remained enthusiastic about Opko's prospects despite challenges through the years and has invested heavily in the company. Looking at Myriad Genetics' latest quarterly results also highlights the key arguments for the stock. Myriad topped expectations in fiscal Q3 thanks to surprisingly strong volume for its hereditary cancer testing. But the molecular diagnostics company has expanded into additional higher-growth areas, especially personalized medicine. Myriad's most promising personalized medicine product is GeneSight, a genetic test that helps determine which antidepressant is best-suited for a particular patient. Myriad thinks that the global market size for this diagnostic test could be close to $10 billion. The company recently reported results from a large study that showed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) were 50% more likely to achieve remission and 30% more likely to respond to treatment when GeneSight was used to determine the appropriate medication. The company also won FDA approval earlier this year for BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic for Lynparza in breast cancer patients. AstraZeneca and Merck co-market Lynparza for treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. BRACAnalysis CDx could be a significant source of growth for Myriad. Lynparza could eventually win approval for treating prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other indications. If AstraZeneca and Merck pick up more approved indications for the drug, Myriad stands to benefit. Don't write off Myriad's hereditary cancer business, either. The company launched a new product last year that could help gain market share. RiskScore helps predict the risk that a woman will develop breast cancer. The test uses clinical risk factors and genetic markers. Both Opko Health and Myriad Genetics are enjoying nice rebounds and could have room to grow. I think, though, that Myriad is the better pick. In my view, the decision comes down to financial health. Opko continues to lose money, while Myriad is profitable. But while I think Myriad is the better choice, I don't see either of these stocks as great ones to buy right now. Myriad's shares currently trade at 26 times expected earnings. That steep valuation might be warranted if the company delivers on its potential. My preference, however, is to stay on the sidelines until there's more evidence that Myriad will be able to do so.

1016437,11/19/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The Yukon government aims to undercut the illegal marijuana market in the territory, setting the price for pot at $8 a gram, which officials say is cheaper than marijuana sold illegally. ""Our plan is to try to compete [with] or eliminate the illicit market, so the $8 a gram puts a value option in there,"" said Steve Cummings, the director of operations for the Yukon Liquor Corporation. The average price per gram for non-medical marijuana is $9.52 in Yukon, about $2 higher than the national average of $7.43, Statistics Canada reports. The store will temporarily be on Industrial Road in a building currently under a Yukon government lease. Cummings said the exact opening date of the store is still unknown, but the liquor corporation is looking at Sept. 1 as a tentative date. The federal law hasn't been passed by Parliament yet, but it's expected to happen this summer. Cummings said the store over time will add higher-priced premium pot. ""There should be a wide selection whereas perhaps on your corner dealer right now is not as good a selection,"" he said. He said another advantage over buying black market pot is that the product in the government store will be tested for unsafe additives. Cummings said the goal is to eventually close the store when regulations are in place to let the private sector take over retail sales. ""We are opening up as a kind of a primary showcase store, to kind of show what the private sector should look like,"" he said. The store will sell cannabis and oils. Cummings said edibles won't be available until they're legalized by the federal government. That won't happen until next year at the earliest. He said the liquor corporation still hasn't decided whether to sell accessories like bud grinders and pipes. Cummings said the store also has a duty to educate the public about the potential health and other risks associated with marijuana use. ""Yes, we're opening up the retail operations, but with our dual mandate, we're not promoting the sale of cannabis, we are facilitating it,"" he said The liquor corporation has looked at the experience of other jurisdictions where pot is sold in retail stores including Vancouver and Skagway, Alaska, said Cummings. But there's still a sense of history being made in Yukon. ""It is all brand new, we don't know what's going to happen here, and I mean it is such a huge change. ""It's a brand new product out there, you don't have a lot of new product introductions like this as monumental as what we're seeing here,"" he said. The $8 per gram does not include taxes. An example provide by the federal finance department says an $8 gram would cost $9 plus GST. The liquor corporation says an adult can buy up to 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent, per transaction. Equivalents are 150 grams fresh cannabis or 30 cannabis plant seeds. The most that can be possessed in public is 30 grams of dried cannabis, or equivalent. A police officer can issue a ticket or lay a criminal charge if a person is caught with more than that. The corporation says there is no limit on how much cannabis can be kept at home, but there can be no more than 4 plants in a home. It says adults are responsible for keeping children safe from the plants and their products. The liquor corporation also announced Thursday that it made a deal with Ottawa-based Canopy Growth Corporation to supply marijuana to the store, its second agreement with a supplier. It will purchase product from local growers, once any are licensed by the federal government. There aren't any licensed producers in Yukon yet. The corporation says it can sign on as many suppliers as it wants depending on demand. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

(Photo by Bennett Raglin/Getty Images for Room To Read) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Room to Read, a global non-profit that believes World Change Starts with Educated Children®, held its annual New York Gala last night at SECOND with honorees Samantha Barry, Editor-in-Chief of Glamour, and Jamie Forese, President of Citigroup. Grammy Award winner Ashanti was in attendance as well as performed. The evening brought New York’s elite business and philanthropic communities together with the media industry to raise $3 million, which will support 60,000 children on Room to Read’s programs in literacy and girls’ education, it was announced last night by Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read’s CEO. The emcee for the evening was Sara Eisen, CNBC anchor, and event chairs were Scott Kapnick, Sabine and Richard Chalmers, and Marc Seidner. Other notable guests included Dilshad Vadsaria, actress and Room to Read ambassador, and Kimberly Vandenberg, Olympic medalist and Room to Read ambassador. Barry, on behalf of Glamour and The Girl Project, was presented with the Superhero Award for Glamour’s commitment to world change through empowering women and girls. Glamour’s philanthropic initiative, The Girl Project, aims to unleash the vast economic and social power of girls through education. Through a $200,000 grant from The Caterpillar Foundation, The Girl Project is supporting Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. Barry joined Glamour in January 2018 to oversee all content development, production and consumer experiences for Glamour’s digital, social, video and print platforms. “I am so honored to receive the Superhero Award and to have the opportunity to continue Glamour’s legacy of enabling progress via the education of young women,” said Barry. “Our mission aligns with Room to Read’s efforts to promote change, and it is truly a privilege to be working alongside them in helping to educate youth and create a better world.” Forese, on behalf of Citi, was presented with the Champion Award for Citi’s transformational impact on literacy and girls’ education. Citi’s e for Education campaign, a global initiative which has raised over $22 million for education-focused non-profits, has invested $3.1 million in Room to Read’s programs since 2013. Forese is President of Citigroup and Chief Executive Officer of the Institutional Clients Group. “We are incredibly proud of our partnership with Room to Read,” said Forese. “Together, we share in the goal of enabling progress and helping to eliminate generational poverty. We are grateful for their tireless work and commitment in helping to ensure that children have access to quality education.” Speakers at the event included Neema Mwita, a young woman from Tanzania who, through her personal story, demonstrated the change that is possible through education. Mwita was one of only two girls in her village primary school class, out of 100 students, who continued to secondary school. She pursued her education and obtained a university degree in law, defying barriers such as early marriage and pregnancy that exist for women in communities where Room to Read implements its programs. Mwita is now employed by Room to Read as a social mobilizer, mentoring and advocating for a cohort of girls enrolled in Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program in Tanzania. “Room to Read is changing the game for children around the world, and tonight we recognize Citi and Glamour for their meaningful and impactful contributions to further our vision of a world in which all children can pursue a quality education and reach their full potential,” said Dr. Geetha Murali, Room to Read CEO. Red carpet photos are available here. Photos from inside the event are available here. About Room to Read Founded in 2000 on the belief that World Change Starts with Educated Children®, Room to Read’s innovative model focuses on deep, systemic transformation within schools in low-income countries during two time periods that are most critical in a child’s schooling: early primary school for literacy acquisition and secondary school for girls’ education. We work in collaboration with local communities, partner organizations and governments to develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school children and ensure girls can complete secondary school with the skills necessary to negotiate key life decisions.
