Updated: August 16, 2018 @ 11:07 pm McDowell Titans senior linebacker Andrew Davis crushes an East Henderson ballcarrier during a scrimmage game at Titan Stadium last wednesday. Davis led the team in tackles last season and will spearhead the defense again this year. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titans senior linebacker Andrew Davis crushes an East Henderson ballcarrier during a scrimmage game at Titan Stadium last wednesday. Davis led the team in tackles last season and will spearhead the defense again this year. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com With a new season about to begin, the McDowell Titans will feature one of their more experienced groups in recent history on the defensive side of the football. This year’s version will likely have as many as eight seniors in the starting lineup on opening night, seven of those with two or more seasons of varsity experience already under their belts. With that amount of experience built through the rigors of playing on defense and a few new pieces being added to the mix, there is an optimistic feel that the fruits of their labor may begin to blossom in 2018. So far in the first two weeks of the preseason, defensive coordinator Keith Styles has been pleased with the production put forth not only physically but mentally for a defensive unit who is wanting to change the course this season. “We have made some changes since last year in getting our defensive lineup ready and these kids have really worked hard in preparing for what we want to do this season,” said Styles. “Attitude is something that we stressed going all the way back to the spring and the seniors are doing a good job in showing leadership skills, which is important to being successful as a team. There are areas in which we don’t have a lot of depth, but of the 38 or so kids we have I think a good number of them will be able to contribute in some way and that will mean a lot to our success on defense.” One of the areas in which Coach Styles has seen the most improvement in the preseason has been with his secondary and the ability to defend and to tackle. “I think having the addition of a couple guys in the secondary has been a positive for us and it will make us better,” he said. “Tackling the runner, especially from our secondary, is one area last season where we didn’t get the results that we wanted and I think it will be a big key in how improved a defense we can be this season.” Statistically, the team will return three of the top five tacklers from a year ago, including All-Northwestern 3A/4A Conference middle linebacker Andrew Davis, who recorded 100 tackles as a junior. While the numbers in some of the other defensive stat categories didn’t really stand out, there is reason to believe that lineup changes will help produce overall better results as a whole. Improving greatly on last year’s averages of 35 points and 439 total yards surrendered per game will be crucial to McDowell’s success. Defensive backs look strong, athletic The McDowell Titans secondary will have a different look this season as the team looks to provide a bit more of an athletic feel in that final tier of the defense. While not fielding a deep unit of players, defensive backs coach Turner Kincaid does see a group with some flexibility. Multiple starters will return, but a handful of new faces for the 2018 campaign will slide in and help provide the Titans with a more athletic lineup to help improve the defense as a whole. “Our biggest challenge for us is that a big number of the defensive backs will also have to continue on offense but with the experience we have I think they will be able to adjust to that role,” said Kincaid. “I do think we have an athletic group of kids at corner and safety and they are flexible which is important depending on the kind of offenses we will see throughout the season.” The middle of the defensive backfield will feature at least one new face. Senior Brycen Seymore (6-1, 202) joined the team over the summer and has impressed the coaches going back through summer workouts with his quick ability to learn the game. Seymore will start the season at strong safety and is noted by the staff as one of the strongest guys on the roster. “Brycen is probably the strongest guy we have in the program right now, literally,” said Kincaid. “And so far he has shown that he likes to play physical and is quick. He has shown the ability to either go up in the box or play in space which is something that we need from him in that spot.” Sophomore Dequan Boyce (5-11, 175) will slide into the free safety spot. Boyce, who played prominently on the junior varsity team as a freshman, did get some reps on the varsity team late in the 2017 season, recording seven tackles in three games played. Obviously, Boyce is expected to play a bigger role as a sophomore. Senior Adam Randolph (11 games, 37 tackles, 1 INT) returns and is the most experienced player of the group. As a four-year varsity player, Randolph has often been on the defensive side of the football but with the emergence of Seymore and with Boyce now on the varsity squad, hopefully Randolph can focus more on the offensive side of the football. “Adam plays a big part to our team’s success on the other side of the ball but his experience at safety will be a significant for us,” said Kincaid. “Adam can play either free or strong. There are times in which we will have to rely on him, but hopefully, with the emergence of our other players, we can hopefully reduce his workload some.” Flexibility also comes into play at the cornerback position as well for Coach Kincaid. Stephen Webb, after getting significant playing time as a junior, was penciled in as one of the corners, but a fractured clavicle back during the early portion of the summer workout schedule will keep him on the sidelines for the first couple weeks of the regular season. One of the big surprises of the preseason is with transfer student Andrew Green, who arrived from out of state – and before that, from Erwin High – and has emerged as a candidate for significant playing time at the corner, especially early on. Green, who moved in from the state of Georgia, has been a pleasant surprise in the early going. “We have been pleased with some things that we have seen from Andrew in the early going,” said Kincaid. “He’s quick and can move really well. He’s having to learn a lot quickly about the coverages, but we like what we see in him and he will have an opportunity for playing time early on. We’ll see what he does for us.” Senior J.C. Olivo will be looked upon to take a corner spot as well, even with his primary role as a tailback offensively. That still hasn’t deterred Olivo from being a leader on the defensive side of the ball. “One of the things we love about J.C. is that he gets out there and shows the leadership qualities that he possesses on both sides of the ball,” Kincaid said. “That’s really an invaluable thing to have. We know that J.C. commits a lot to playing the tailback position but he’s 100 percent when on the defensive side as well.” Providing depth at corners will be three-year varsity players Andruw Randolph and Dakota Effler along with junior Kurtis Padgett. Davis spearheads defense from linebacker spot By far the most experience for the McDowell Titans defensively going into Friday’s season opener is at the linebacker position. Only one starter from the 2017 season opener, DeAndre Collins, is no longer with the squad and that in itself is merely a technicality, as other linebackers gradually saw an increased work load throughout last season, which helped lead to eventual lineup changes for this year, giving the Titans a solid returning core of linebackers. The one spot most importantly that didn’t change in McDowell’s 3-4 defensive scheme was at the middle linebacker position, as the team’s leading tackler Andrew Davis (69 solo tackles, 31 assists, three caused fumbles, two fumble recoveries, two sacks) returns for his senior campaign. Davis, an All-Northwestern 3A-4A Conference performer in 2017, has continued to improve each season and now in his third varsity season looks poised to be a big part of McDowell’s success defensively. “One of the things we have worked with inside linebackers on is with the different reads,” said head coach Andy Morgan, who also coaches linebackers. “Andrew (6-0, 235) has looked good so far in the preseason, has lost about 10 pounds or so in weight and is moving around a lot better. He’s a returning 100-tackle guy and has the capability of doing that again this year and better.” Sophomore Harley Allison (6-1, 185), along with senior Tice Edwards (6-1, 215) and junior Braedon Allison (6-2, 185) will also be viable options to provide depth for Davis in the middle along with the ability to play on the outside as well. Morgan and Styles have noted Harley Allison’s improvement in both size and strength since last year when he was a standout on the junior varsity team. Allison could be looked upon to have an increased role as the season progresses. Titans hoping for big plays out of OLBs The outside linebacker position also returns some experienced players from a year ago. Cedric Biddle (5-9, 185) and Johan Ayala (5-11, 190) will man the outside this year. The two seniors combined for 76 tackles a year ago. Biddle recorded five fumble recoveries and 3 ½ sacks in 2017, which was second best on last year’s squad. He also returned two blocked punts and a fumble for touchdowns. For Ayala, it will be somewhat a change of scenery as he spent most of his time a year ago as middle linebacker, so he is learning quickly the nuisances of moving outside. “Cedric spent a lot of last year playing the bandit position being in open space and he seemed to produce the most big plays from that spot with the sacks and fumble recoveries,” said outside linebackers coach Bill Taylor. “We hope to see more of that from him this year. The biggest thing we have noticed so far in preseason is that he is a more disciplined player which is important in that area. Johan is moving to the outside to play the Sam position. That will be a bit of an adjustment, but his strength will be an asset to him moving out there to that spot.” Additional outside linebackers in the group include seniors Evan Cable and Mack Branch. Cable, who is capable of playing on either side and is a solid player in open space, could see increased time on the field, especially against more offenses who like to spread the field. Juniors Luke Bright and Richard Handy will also provide depth on the roster, Bright will likely play a bigger role offensively and Handy is the team’s second quarterback on the depth chart. Defensive front unproven The most numbers on the defensive side of the football will lie up front with the defensive linemen and defensive ends, however this area also has the most inexperience of any position on the defense in 2018. Defensive line coach Keith Styles also will be faced with the challenge of relying on several players who will also play prominent roles on the offensive line. Regardless of the situation, there are pieces to work with in the trenches. “We have got more depth at defensive line than any other position on this side of the ball, however there’s not a lot of experience,” said Styles. “Several of these guys are also going to play a role offensively, so it’s going to be a balancing act with some of these guys going both ways. That said, I think they’re all working hard and over the course of the year will work into a role on either side of the ball.” Defensive lineman Ricky Amador (43 tackles, fumble recovery, one sack) along with defensive end Trey Beverly (55 tackles, four sacks), McDowell’s third leading tackler and sacks leader in 2017, are both gone and leave a significant void in the defensive front. The one returning player who looks to fill the void and anchor the defensive line this season will be junior defensive tackle Nick Ivy (6-1, 265). As a sophomore, Ivy slid in and played significant minutes up front, showing flashes of the kind of talent he possesses. As a junior, he will be looked upon this season to be a more consistent person up front. Junior Levi Lister (6-0, 230), along with senior Bryce Allison (6-1, 195) will line up on opposite ends. “Nick played a lot of for us last year and did some good things, and we look for him to continue getting better anchoring down the line,” said Styles. “Levi is a kid that is a smart football player. He works hard and does a lot of good things for us. He will likely be snapping the ball on offense so we’ll have to watch him carefully. Bryce is another kid who is an intelligent football player and has gotten better with each year. He is a kid that as a senior is going to provide some leadership for us up front. He can play a 4-technique up front or can move and play outside linebacker.” Walker Hughes (5-11, 225) returns to the program after not playing as a junior and can also provide the defensive line with another option. Other potential two-way players that may help defensively include sophomore Bradley Biddix and seniors Nathaniel McEntire, Cameron Griffth and Jeremiah Davis. Rounding out the defensive linemen group are juniors Jacob Rich, Troy Harris, Johnathan Kelley, Caleb Craeton and Jake Patton."
