""Additionally, at the request of The Lunder Foundation and with the unanimous support of The Couse Foundation’s board of directors, the main gallery and reception room in The Lunder Research Center will be named in honor of Dean A. Porter. Mr. Porter is the former Director of the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame and is a nationally known scholar and author who has devoted much of his career to scholarship relating to the Taos Society of Artists. Mr. Porter serves as an Advisory Director for The Couse Foundation.”The Lunder Foundation is a philanthropic organization that has provided major support to Colby College in Waterville, Maine, including the Colby College Museum of Art and The Lunder Institute of American Art, among other beneficiaries.“This grant from The Lunder Foundation is by far the largest single gift in the history of The Couse Foundation,” Carl Jones, President of The Couse Foundation, said in a prepared statement. “It is a significant endorsement of our vision and will ensure the realization of our goal to create a research center of national importance at the Couse-Sharp Historic Site.""Peter and Paula Lunder, principals of The Lunder Foundation, have stated, “We are very pleased to be able to support this project, which we feel is an important addition to the resources available for the study and appreciation of American art.”The Lunder Research Center will be the repository for documents and art created, and artifacts collected, by the 12 members of the Taos Society of Artists and scholarly materials relating to the group.

The group grew to include 12 active members and several more associate and honorary members.The Couse-Sharp Historic Site reflects the original goals of these artists and continues to promote their mission, according to information about the site. It site includes the home and studio of Eanger Irving Couse, the garden designed by his wife Virginia, the workshops of his son Kibbey, and the two studios of his neighbor and fellow artist, Joseph Henry Sharp.

Sharp’s later studio, built in 1915, was completely restored in early 2017 and now contains a permanent rotating exhibition of his artwork, personal effects, and Native art he collected and used in his paintings. His earlier studio, converted from an 1835 chapel, hosts changing exhibitions of artwork and contextual material related to the TSA.All public areas of the site can be toured by appointment, which can be made on its website (couse-sharp.org) or by calling the site office at (575) 751-0369. .

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"By Siobhan Morrissey Special to the Miami Herald May 13, 2018 07:00 AM They warned her she would be ruined if she breathed a word about what they had done to her. When she refused their demands and denounced the two old men for attacking her in her own bathroom, she was the one sentenced to death for adultery. While the incident reportedly happened in Babylon in sixth century B.C. and is recorded in the Old Testament Book of Daniel, Baroque painter Sisto Badalocchio’s depiction of events is just as timely today. One need look no further than the rampant allegations of abuse recently reported by women the world over via #MeToo. In Badalocchio’s ""Susannah and the Elders,"" the victim is seen cowering and clutching a sheet to her naked breast while two fully clothed men hover over her. One holds a finger to his mouth in an effort to make her complicit through her silence, while the other appears ready to carry her off. (Spoiler alert: young Daniel witnessed what happened and after he spoke up, Susannah avoided execution. ) For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The painting, which is on loan from Sarasota's John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, is part of the ""Dangerous Women"" exhibition on view through May 20 at the Frost Art Museum. “It’s very timely,” says Frost Museum Director Jordana Pomeroy. “I actually thought of date rape, since we’re on a campus. This whole idea of she seduced me, she wanted it — this is an age-old story between men and women.” Pomeroy says the idea for the exhibition grew out of a desire to bring Old Masters paintings to Miami. “I can’t afford to borrow works from Europe or The Met (in New York),” she said. So, she called The Ringling. Circus impresario and art collector John Ringling, at the time of his death in 1936, had amassed an art collection then worth $20 million – and was believed to have assembled the finest collection in the world of paintings by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens. Fortunately for the Frost, the curator at The Ringling had the germ of an idea for the exhibition and the artwork became available when the museum underwent renovations. The collection – and exhibition – includes sexually suggestive art, where women often are portrayed as the temptress who overpowers men with sexuality, intellect and beauty. “It’s an old story about sometimes uncomfortable relationships between men and women and sexuality and how it’s played a part in stories told about women in the Bible and in classical antiquity,” Pomeroy says. Throughout history, men have claimed to be overwhelmed by women, blaming their own bad behavior on their attraction to women, further victimizing and stigmatizing women in the process. Often, physical beauty is the least compelling component of the relationship, says Pomeroy. “It's not just that she’s beautiful. She’s powerful. She’s manipulative. Her feminine wiles, which might or might not include beauty, (are alluded to in the artwork on display). She’s distracting me. She got me drunk."" It’s no coincidence that all but two of the paintings and prints featured in the exhibitions were created by male artists. The women artists – Fede Galizia of 16th century Italy and Mickalene Thomas, a contemporary American artist – opted to show their female subjects in control. While the other works portray women with alabaster skin as the sole source of dissonance between the sexes, Thomas’s 2010 ""Portrait of Mama Bush I,"" dispels that notion. The painting is a tribute to her mother, Sandra “Mama” Bush, a former fashion model who battled drug addiction and sickle-cell anemia. Thomas presents her mother as a sensual odalisque, lounging provocatively in a chaise, with her breasts exposed and her right hand languorously propping up her head. It is the only woman of color in the show. Galizia, on the other hand, shows how a man can literally lose his head when smitten by a beautiful woman. Her oil painting from 1596 titled ""Judith with the Head of Holofernes,"" recalls how the Assyrian general Holofernes became besotted with Judith. Holofernes needed to work on his seduction technique, however. He was a little drunk when he invited Judith to his tent. Judith and her maidservant seized the opportunity to decapitate him with his own sword. According to the Old Testament, Judith not only avoided a night of sloppy sex, but also liberated her people in the process. Two other versions of the headless Holofernes appear in the show. Francesco Cairo’s oil painting shows Judith looking straight at the viewer while her right hand rests on the sword that is plunged through the general’s throat. Vincenzo Damini has his Judith looking heavenward while holding the head aloft and exposing a neck gushing with blood. John the Baptist’s severed head also makes three appearances in the show. As the Old Testament story goes, Salome bewitched King Herod with her sinuous and seductive dancing. As a reward, the king, who was also her stepfather, granted Salome one wish. She chose John’s head as her prize. In Bartolomeo Coriolano’s 1631 woodcut depiction, Salome and her mother pose behind a platter where the head rests as if it were an exotic entrée. Palma Vecchio puts Salome’s mother, Herodias, in the forefront of his painting and keeps the young dancer in the shadows, portraying John's death as payback for his criticism of Herodias' marriage to King Harod. Guido Reni, on the other hand, puts Salome front and center, with her right hand firmly grasping John’s hair while a page boy offers up the head on a gold platter. American artist Robert Henri erases any pretext as to naivete on the part of Salome. Henri shows Salome with a bare mid-drift and sheer black maxi skirt, in full stride with the arrogance and elegance of youth. A tribute to Richard Strauss’s opera ""Salome,"" which was based on Oscar Wilde’s play and banned after one show, Henri's 1909 painting highlights Salome's sexuality and cruel indifference. Although unable to see the solo performance, Henri invited the star of the show, Mademoiselle Voclezca, to reenact the Dance of the Seven Veils while he painted her portrait in his studio. While ""Dangerous Women"" on the second floor is the headliner exhibit at the Frost, any visitor would be well served to take in the remaining two shows on the first and third floors. ""Outsider Artists from Havana""on the first floor is a delightful show featuring two Cuban artists recognized for their excellence in outsider art: Misleidys Castillo and Jorge Alberto Hernández Cadi. Art critic Roger Cardinal coined the term “outsider art” in 1972 to reflect those works created outside the mainstream art world, typically by untrained individuals. The artists in this instance is akin to an aeolian harp that seemingly channels creativity from a universal source. “With these two artists, they’re actually fairly well-known both in Havana and elsewhere,” Pomeroy says. In fact, Castillo has shown at NADA during Art Basel. “When you look at it, if you didn’t read the text, it looks like a lot of contemporary art. It doesn’t scream ‘outsider’ or self-taught,” Pomeroy says. Castillo is reportedly deaf, mute and autistic. Hernández, who is known as El Buzo – which, depending on the translation, can mean diver, frogman, scavenger or boiler suit – was reportedly diagnosed as bipolar and schizophrenic. Their show, which runs through June 3, was produced in conjunction with the National Art Exhibitions of the Mentally Ill Foundation, the Frost Art Museum and FIU the psychiatry department. Castillo creates cartoonish figural renderings in bright, cheerful colors. They are instantly recognizable in that often depict body-builders in briefs and the artist uses numerous strips of tan tape to hold the images in place. Hernández, on the other hand, meticulously cuts out heads and eyes from black-and-white photographs. He creates curio boxes that include these pasted images on the covers or tucked away inside. Sometimes he stitches thread around these images or draws a companion image, such as a shadow, devil horns or forked tongues. This show will blow you away. Not only is it the artist’s swan song – she died on April 25 in a California nursing home – but also it is a poignant retrospective spanning some three decades. A fifth-generation Chicana, Aguilar also exhibited at the Venice Biennale, the Smithsonian Institution and the International Center of Photography. She was 58. Large, lesbian and Latina, Aguilar captured the essence of isolation in her stark black-and-white portraits, both of herself and others in the LGBTQ community. But as with all great art, her images transcend those portrayed and touch on the universal theme of the need to be connected to others in life. This is a show for anyone who has ever felt remotely alienated in this world. At one time or another, that’s just about all of us. ""Laura Aguilar: Show and Tell"" heart-breakingly showcases people who once felt less than worthy because of the color of their skin, their nationality, their body shape or size, their gender, their sexuality. Included in the more than 100 black-and-white photographs produced over three decades is a video in which Aguilar speaks so openly of the psychic pain caused by the simple yearning for human touch. One is reminded of the elderly or shut-ins that no one visits, the refrain from ""Eleanor Rigby"" regarding all the lonely people or Hank Williams warbling ""I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry."" Aguilar was morbidly obese, and one gets the sense that she believed she lost all value as a person in a society obsessed with outer beauty. Worse, she seemed to have internalized that lack of value. And yet, when Aguilar immersed her naked self into nature, her beauty became unmistakable. As she huddled into the fetal position, her body mimicked surrounding desert boulders. She was one with the earth.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"(Adds company’s explanation of forgivable loan costs in 10th and 11th paragraphs.) Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, the parent of five independent broker-dealer firms with about 4,300 advisors, has made a significant change in its revenue-recognition policies that gives a more accurate picture of its profitability. The Miami-based company said on Wednesday that its advisory fees in the first three months of 2018 fell 10% from a year earlier to $114.3 million, despite a 15.2% jump in client assets under administration. The reason: Ladenburg on January 1 adopted a required new Financial Accounting Standards Board policy that no longer lets it report fee income from advisors who do not use it as their primary registered investment advisory firm. It also began recognizing the money it collects from these so-called hybrid advisors for providing technology, custody and administrative services on a net basis, reporting that revenue only after deducting what it pays the advisors. It previously reported the advisory and service fees on a gross basis. “Accordingly, our reported advisory revenue and the independent financial advisors’ compensation in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment is materially lower in 2018 as compared to the prior-year periods, and reported advisory revenue growth may lag behind the overall growth rate of advisory assets,” Ladenburg said in earnings statements released on Wednesday. Ladenburg nevertheless reported a 13.5% jump in total revenue from the first quarter of 2017 to $329.3 million, largely because of insurance commissions that jumped 25.6% from a year earlier to $163.3 million. The firm said that the new accounting interpretation allows it to count all commissions collected from insurance carriers on a gross basis, whereas it previously recognized such revenue on a net basis determined by the insurance companies’ method of payment. The company’s total first-quarter expenses rose 9.1% to $321.7 million, driven by a 5.7% jump in fees and commissions to its independent brokers to $231.3 million. Although Ladenburg’s first-quarter operating profit soared to $5.5 million following a $3.7 million loss a year earlier, it reported a net loss after payment of preferred dividends of $3.0 million, an improvement over its $11.6 million after-dividend loss in the year-earlier quarter. The publicly traded firm is controlled by its chairman, Dr. Phillip Frost. Ladenburg more than doubled its brokerage sales force seven years ago when it bought the 2,500-advisor independent broker-dealer Securities America. It also owns Triad Advisors, Investacorp, KMS Financial Services, Securities Service Network and Premier Trust. “The continued growth in our nationwide network of independent financial advisors to over 4,300 reflects our success in recruiting talented advisors over the past two years,” Ladenburg Chief Executive said in a prepared statement. The company has added about 300 net new advisors across the five firms in the past 12 months, but net recruiting results were flat in this year’s first quarter, according to a Ladenburg spokesperson. Ladenburg, nevertheless spent about $13 million on forgivable loans in the quarter, the spokesperson said. The forgivable recruitment and retention loan notes that Ladenburg amortized from its balance sheet plummeted in the first three months of the year to $76,000 from $1.59 million in the year-earlier first quarter and will go to zero in the future because of the new accounting rule. That is because the company is now capitalizing forgivable loans—its highest recruiting expense—on a new balance sheet line called “contract acquisition costs” that amortizes them over the average life of a broker at each of its brokerage firms. The time periods are significantly longer than the historical 3-to-5 year loan forgiveness period to each recruit, according to Ladenburg. Ladenburg, whose Securities America unit agreed to a $5.8 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April for selling over-priced mutual fund share classes, set aside $2.6 million in the first quarter for pending legal and regulatory charges, up from $143,000 in the year-earlier quarter, bringing its total “accrued liability” reserve to $8.8 million. The company, whose brokers focus on ”underserved” retail investors with as little as $100,000 of investible assets, according to a shareholder letter Frost sent last month, is reviewing its mutual-fund disclosures to clients to determine whether to self-report to the SEC other sales violations related to payments of 12b-1 fees from mutual fund companies, it said in its earnings release. The regulator in February announced a Share Class Selection Disclosure Initiative that it said will likely result in “favorable” settlement terms to investment firms that self-report by June 12.

1012769,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Left Image: Michael Cohen. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images). Right Image by Alex Cook A close confidant of a powerful political figure invites representatives of a Fortune 500 company over to his office. The company has business the political figure could help with—legislation they desire, regulatory matters they’d like to see resolved. So its reps approached the confidant, ostensibly to gather information about how to navigate the political scene. But really, in effect, the company is there to pay cash tribute—six or seven figures worth—hoping that, down the road, the confidant will remember the bounty and use his clout to help fix the company’s problems. I could be talking about any banana republic around the world. But I could also be talking about Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s ambulance chaser of a lawyer who took just these types of meetings with telecom giant AT&T and pharmaceutical firm Novartis before pocketing as much as $1.8 million into the same shell company coffers out of which he paid off a porn star to keep quiet about an alleged affair with the president. But I could also be talking about ""strategic affairs"" groups inside Washington law firms, where former lawmakers or staffers set up shop to debrief corporate clients about government activities. Here’s one at Perkins Coie, featuring former Obama chief of staff and ""101st Senator"" Pete Rouse. Or this one at McGuire Woods, led by former Congressman Lewis Payne. Or this one at Squire Patton Boggs, led by former Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott. In fact, Squire Patton Boggs had help securing clients last year from none other than Michael Cohen. It’s true that the Trumpworld version of this old, old Washington tradition reflects influence peddling at its most flagrantly corrupt. Cohen, a fixer who has reportedly bragged about Russian mob ties, doesn’t have deep understanding of US health care or telecom policy. Seeking ""insight into Trump’s thinking,"" as a source close to AT&T has claimed they were doing, is known to be a futile enterprise to anyone with a Twitter account. Novartis, meanwhile, admitted realizing Cohen was essentially conning them after just one meeting, but ended up paying out a 12-month, $1.2 million contract anyway, reportedly because they were afraid to anger Trump. So the game Cohen played was just that: a con, an exchange of cash for the hope of access and favorable treatment, which AT&T, now in an antitrust lawsuit over its proposed purchase of Time Warner, didn't even get. Cohen wasn't shy in his pitch, either: CNN reported he told companies, ""I don't know who's been representing you, but you should fire them all. I'm the guy you should hire. I'm closest to the President. I'm his personal lawyer."" If these aren’t solicitations for bribes, we might as well retire the bribery statute in America. But because Cohen appears to have lied about his clout—because he may even have defrauded those who paid for access or insights or whatever they want to call it—he might have gotten away with it. The only problem was the cash got intermingled with Russian oligarch funds and hush money payments. (The fact that Cohen was a deputy finance chairman for the Republican National Committee should also draw law enforcement questions. Did the party get a piece of this action?) Cohen’s grift was not unusual among Trump hangers-on who didn’t enter the White House. But it also existed long before that rogue’s gallery ever hit Washington. As one lobbyist explained to CNN, the reason Cohen’s aggressive pay-to-play scheme could work was that corporations ""had all of these Hillary (Clinton) consultants lined up and realized when Trump won, they had nobody."" This consulting, this lobbying that isn’t technically lobbying, is legal under current ethics statutes. It exists off the books of lobbyist disclosures. It includes public relations firms and law firms and trade associations and what look like ""independent"" policy organizations paid out of corporate coffers. Lee Fang explained this shadow lobbying best in 2014 in the Nation, citing an estimate that more than twice as much is spent on influencing government as is being officially reported. ""The growth of the influence industry has created a new generation of millionaires while reshaping the region in its wake,"" Fang wrote about Washington. There’s an entire other industry known as political intelligence, where Wall Street firms and other corporate clients pay for snatches of information they can use to make trading bets or change their business strategies. None of that is public either, but the middlemen who thrive off it can make millions leaking tips. Political intelligence firms were poised to face registration requirements under the law banning members of Congress and their staffs from insider trading back in 2012, but that provision got yanked at the last minute. What makes Cohen’s scheme feel sleazier—and the corporations' casual admission of the would-be bribes as well—is that it's just a louder, more explicit version of what happens daily in virtually every office tower in DC. Most people in politics wait to cash in after they complete their tenure in public service; Cohen didn’t even wait until his pal Donald Trump was inaugurated to turn on the money spigot. Obviously, that should be investigated, and if necessary, prosecuted. But the more subtle, more technically legal forms of this game pose a serious problem of their own. As a recent report from the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute on political corruption indicated, the only time the government seems to crack down on it comes in a time of huge scandal. Fortunately, we’re in that moment right now. Hopefully, policymakers won't narrow their focus to the obvious corruption served up by Michael Cohen, but the entire influence industry, which rewards the highest bidders and subverts democracy.

1096862,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Kenneth Travis Posted: Wednesday, May 9, 2018 2:51 pm $36.5 million school bond approved By ADAM POWELL Caswell Messenger Editor caswellmessenger.com During Monday morning’s Caswell County Commissioners meeting, the elected officials approved in a series of contested votes the terms of the county’s proposed bond referendum that will go on the November ballot for renovations to Bartlett Yancey High School and security improvements systemwide. The Commissioners agreed to submit an application for a bond resolution not to exceed $36.5 million. Five of the six Commissioners present at the meeting voted in favor of a bond not exceeding $36.5 million, with Kenneth Travis providing the only dissenting vote. “The figure that we discussed in the previous workshop was $36.5 million, which includes $1.5 million for security for the other schools in addition to Bartlett Yancey,” Commissioner Sterling Carter said. “That is the figure that we concluded by consensus (would be needed).” There was considerable debate over whether to make the bond a 30-year or a 40-year loan. The Commissioners have been debating for several weeks on whether to issue a longer-term loan, which will create shorter payments in the near term, but will make larger payments decades down the line. “I’m not in favor of this 40-year loan. I understand they’re trying to make it easier on the taxpayers (in the short term). But also understand you’re paying $8 million more in interest when you do a 40-year loan. That money is gone,” Commissioner Rick McVey said at last week’s joint work session with the Board of Education. “I know we’ve talked about paying it off early - and I hope we can do that,” McVey continued. “But I want you all to understand that will be $8 million out the window if you do a 40-year loan. You’re cutting your interest down so much when you do a lesser amount of time. I hope we pay it off early. I hope someone has the principle to do that.” During Monday’s session, Commissioners David Owen and Jeremiah Jefferies debated the terms. Owen agrees with McVey that 30 years is the way to go, while Jefferies supported a 40-year bond length. “Just for your information, we need to realize that this is going to cost Caswell County an additional $8 million. At least, at minimum, an additional $8 million over that ten extra years,” Owen said. “That’s if we use the ten years,” Jefferies responded. “We can pay off a 30-year loan early and save (as well). This county has never paid off anything that I know of,” Owen said. “I just want the public to be aware $8 million additional dollars, this county is gonna spend. I would rather that $8 million be spent on infrastructure, or something here in the county. We have enough of our own issues. But I just want everyone to be aware - $8 million dollars.” “You don’t have to use 40 years to get the money. We might pay it off early,” Jefferies said. “Mr. Jefferies was the only one that voted against the 30 year (loan term when a vote was initially held),” Sterling Carter stated. “I was bringing that back up for consideration, because based on previous workshops, and last week in particular (the joint session between the Commissioners and the Board of Education), we have some Commissioners that now want 40 years. And I’m adding my name to that list of Commissioners that will request the 40-year term.” Carter motioned to make the referendum 40 years, which Jefferies seconded. The vote on the proposed 40-year term was split, with three Commissioners - Sterling Carter, William Carter, and Jefferies - in favor of the 40 years. Three others - Owen, McVey, and Travis - voted against the measure. With a 3-3 split - Board Chair Nathaniel Hall was not in attendance - the motion could not move forward. William Carter proposed using approximately $3 million in county funds earmarked to help pay down the total $36.5 million debt for immediate security concerns across Caswell County Schools. “I know security is of utmost importance to our schools. There’s nearly $3 million for security in all the schools. That could be something we could have, and get it going right away,” Carter said. “To use the $3 million as a down payment, I just feel that should go to security for the schools. That money is best suited for the security of the schools instead of a down payment on the financing. I just want you to realize that $3 million could be put for the security of the schools.” Although Carter had the support of fellow Commissioner Kenneth Travis, his motion to earmark the $3 million for immediate security concerns was beaten by a 4-2 vote. The $3 million will instead go towards debt service against the total $36.5 million bond. Moments later, Jefferies proposed the 40-year loan as a motion for a second time. But William Carter, who had been in support of the 40-year term previously, switched back in favor of a 30-year term after losing the vote on addressing immediate security needs in Caswell County Schools. With Carter’s vote, there was a 4-2 majority rejecting the 40 year term, effectively ensuring the term would be 30 years. Owen successfully motioned to make the terms of the bond 30 years, which was approved by a 4-2 vote. Commissioners Jefferies and Sterling Carter voted against the 30-year bond length. In total, the bond will issue $33.5 million to Caswell County for the school repairs ($36.5 million minus the $3 million debt service payment), with an eventual tax increase of 7.75 cents per 100 dollars of assessed value. That tax increase will begin in approximately five years. With the Commissioners’ vote, Caswell County officials will formally apply the Notice of Intent for the bond referendum to the LGC (Local Government Commission) for processing.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Highlights: MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE American: LTS, LTS PrA, LTSL) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman of Ladenburg, said, “We are very encouraged by our first quarter 2018 results which exhibited robust growth in revenues, profitability and client assets. Favorable market conditions and an increasing interest rate environment, coupled with solid execution by our management team, contributed to our strong performance. We remain laser-focused on creating value and, as appropriate, returning capital to our shareholders. If our business continues to perform as we anticipate, the Board will consider increasing the cash dividend on our common stock and accelerating our share repurchase program.” Richard Lampen, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ladenburg, said, “All of Ladenburg’s businesses performed well in the first quarter, with revenues of $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from the prior year period, and a 169.2% increase in adjusted EBITDA, to $20.2 million. The continued growth in our nationwide network of independent financial advisors to over 4,300 reflects our success in recruiting talented advisors over the past two years. Total client assets grew to a record $166.2 billion and advisory assets under management increased to a record $73.6 billion, up 15.2% and 22.1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. We will continue to focus on increasing shared services, growing recurring revenues and managing our operations more efficiently to drive further margin and profitability improvements across the enterprise.” Adoption of New ASC 606 Accounting Standard On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments (""ASC 606""). The Company believes it is important to include a presentation of its financial results on the most comparable basis practical. The Company's adoption of the new revenue standard has an impact on the timing of when revenues and related costs are recognized and impacts the gross vs. net reporting presentation of advisory and commissions revenues. The Company has adopted this standard under the modified retrospective method, which does not require a restatement of prior period results. In order to make the presentation of these financial results more comparable, the Company has included an adjustment to the results of 2018 to exclude the impact of the adoption of the new revenue standard so that such results are presented on the same revenue recognition methodology used by the Company prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard (see Table 3). For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the impact of the new revenue standard was a decrease in total revenues of $31.1 million, a decrease in total expenses of $34.4 million, an increase in net income attributable to the Company of $1.7 million, and no change to diluted loss per common share of $0.02. First Quarter 2018 First quarter 2018 revenues were $329.4 million, a 13.5% increase from revenues of $290.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Commissions revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 25.6% to $163.3 million from $130.1 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to increased sales of variable annuity and mutual fund products and due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Advisory fee revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased by 9.9% to $114.4 million from $127.0 million for the comparable period in 2017, primarily due to the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. Investment banking revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 154.1% to $16.5 million from $6.5 million for the comparable period in 2017, due to improved market conditions. Also, service fees revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 34.2% to $24.9 million from $18.6 million, due to increased revenues from our cash sweep programs. Net income attributable to the Company for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.5 million, as compared to net loss attributable to the Company of $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss available to common shareholders, after payment of preferred dividends, was $3.0 million or ($0.02) per basic and diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to net loss available to common shareholders of $11.6 million or ($0.06) per basic and diluted common share in the comparable 2017 period. The first quarter 2018 results included $2.2 million of income tax expense, $7.3 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $0.1 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans, $2.2 million of amortization of contract acquisition costs and $1.9 million of interest expense. The first quarter 2017 results included $0.8 million of income tax benefit, $8.9 million of non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization and compensation, $1.6 million of amortization of retention and forgivable loans and $0.5 million of interest expense. Recurring Revenues For the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2018, recurring revenues, which consist of advisory fees, trailing commissions, cash sweep revenues and certain other fees, represented approximately 79.4% of revenues from the Company’s independent advisory and brokerage services segment. EBITDA, as adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was $20.2 million, an increase of 169.2% from $7.5 million in the comparable 2017 period. Attached hereto as Table 2 is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to the Company as reported (see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below) to EBITDA, as adjusted. The increase in EBITDA, as adjusted, for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily attributable to increases in our independent advisory and brokerage services segment as a result of increased revenue from our cash sweep programs and increased commissions revenue. Also, our Ladenburg segment EBITDA, as adjusted, was higher as a result of increased investment banking revenues. Client Assets At March 31, 2018, total client assets under administration were $166.2 billion, a 15.2% increase from $144.3 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, client assets included cash balances of approximately $4.6 billion, including approximately $4.2 billion participating in our cash sweep programs. Stock Repurchases During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 534,697 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $1.7 million, including 285,400 shares repurchased under its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $3.23. Since the inception of its stock repurchase program in March 2007, the Company has repurchased over 27.1 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $58.1 million, including purchases outside its stock repurchase program, representing an average price per share of $2.14. As of March 31, 2018, the Company has the authority to repurchase an additional 7,864,385 shares under its current repurchase plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted for acquisition-related expense, amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs, change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, non-cash compensation expense, financial advisor recruiting expense and other expense, which includes loss on write-off of receivable from subtenant, excise and franchise tax expense, severance costs and compensation expense that may be paid in stock, is a key metric the Company uses in evaluating its financial performance. EBITDA, as adjusted, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by Regulation G promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company considers EBITDA, as adjusted, important in evaluating its financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-cash and non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables the Company’s Board of Directors and management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not indicative of its core operating performance, such as amortization of retention and forgivable loans, amortization of contract acquisition costs and financial advisor recruiting expenses, or do not involve a cash outlay, such as stock-related compensation, which is expected to remain a key element in our long-term incentive compensation program. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, income (loss) before income taxes, net income (loss) and cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities.

NCLR Executive Director Kate Kendell said, in part, ""Soni was a fierce advocate whose life exemplified the power of visionary courage, freedom, and feminist solidarity. We've been immeasurably enriched by knowing her, and next month at Pride, we'll see Soni's legacy live on."" The National Center for Lesbian Rights ( NCLR ) and the Brooke Oliver Law Group represented Dykes on Bikes in an action to register its name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Supervisors in San Francisco have unanimously approved a resolution authorizing a gay and leather cultural district in the city's South of Market neighborhood, The Washington Post reported. Supervisor Jane Kim said before the May 1 vote that legislation to designate a cultural district has been more than a decade in the making. The neighborhood remains home to gay and kink bars and the popular Folsom Street Fair, which draws thousands of people every year to celebrate ""leather sexuality."" Lesbian couple Ashley and LaNisha Davis of Purvis, Mississippi, were set to pick up their foster child from Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg on March 3but the legal system stopped them from doing so, the Clarion Ledger reported. ( The biological mother had signed away her parental rights, Ashley said, and the Davis' caseworker told them they could start the adoption process immediately. ) The problem for the couple is that Forrest County Youth Court Judge Mike McPhail wanted the baby to stay in Forrest Countybut LaNisha is active-duty military, and the couple planned to move to New Mexico in May. A gay man who marched in heels in his city's Veterans Day parade last year was elected mayor of his town, LGBTQ Nation noted. Bruno ""Ralphy"" Lozano, 35, is a U.S. Air Force veteran and is now the mayor-elect of Del Rio, a town in southwestern Texas along the border with Mexico. Del Rio has a population of 41,000, and the unofficial election results show that about 3,500 people voted in the electionwith about 65 percent of the vote going to Lozano over incumbent Robert Garza. NMAC has announced that legendary HIV activist/writer Larry Kramer will speak at the United States Conference on AIDS ( USCA ) on Sept. 7, , in Orlando, a press release noted. ( USCA will run Sept. 6-9, according to NMAC's website. ) Since 1987, NMAC has advanced its mission through a variety of programs and services, including: a public policy education program, national and regional training conferences, a treatment and research program, numerous electronic and print materials, and a website: NMAC.org . Following some comments he made about Vice President Mike Pence, Pulse shooting survivor Brandon Wolf found himself on the receiving end of intense online attacks from right-wing activists, including threats on his life, NewNowNext.com noted. During a recent segment of Tucker Carlson's show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, the right-wing TV host centered on comments that Wolf has made against Pence. On the show, Wolf discussed the vice president, saying that he would put LGBT people in ""concentration camps hoping to pray the gay away"" if Pence became president. ( Wolf later tweeted that he meant ""conversion"" instead of ""concentration."" ) The state of California is suing an El Cajon gym over allegations that it denied a transgender woman access to the women's locker room there for almost a year, the San Diego Union Tribune reported. The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which enforces state civil rights laws, sued Crunch Fitness on Jamacha Road in mid-April, alleging intentional discrimination against Christynne Wood ""on the basis of her sex, specifically her gender identity and gender expression."" Among other things, the suit asks that the gym be required to provide appropriate training to all managers and employees on obligations under the Unruh Act, with special emphasis on gender identity and the prevention of harassment, according to an ACLU press release. The complaint is at https://www.aclusocal.org/sites/default/files/aclu_socal_wood_20180502_complaint.pdf.� Failed Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama filed a new lawsuit against some of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, claiming they were part of a ""political conspiracy"" to derail his 2017 campaign, Time.com noted.

She also said that his accusers, and others, hoped to see him lose the Dec. 12 ballot. Ex-LGBTQ activists held a rally this weekend in Washington, D.C., that a grand total of 36 people attended, LGBTQ Nation noted. The ""Freedom March,"" organized by Voice of the Voiceless, was held at the National Sylvan Theater. ( Voice of the Voiceless is an ex-LGBTQ group that has advocated for conversion therapy on college campuses. ) The rally had several speakers, including ex-transgender activist Jeffrey McCall, Pulse shooting survivor Luis Ruiz and ""Activist Mommy"" Elizabeth Johnston. Iowa's predominantly Republican legislature passed a bill that would prohibit abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detecteda significant step toward enacting one of the most restrictive laws of its kind in the United States, The Washington Post reported. The ""heartbeat"" bill, which would ban abortions as early as six weeksaround the time women generally feel early signs of pregnancy and before many even realize they are pregnantpassed through the Iowa House by a vote of 51-46 on May 1. The state Senate passed the bill 29-17 on May 2, sending it to Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has said abortion is ""equivalent to murder."" A Brooklyn teacher was arrested following allegations that he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old male student, ABC News reported. Andre Braddyan eighth-grade math teacher at PS 235 in East Flatbushallegedly had multiple sexual encounters with a student in a school bathroom. Braddy, 34, faces charges of sex abuse, engaging in a criminal sex act and committing an act in a manner injurious to a child. Openly gay student Adam Bell, 18, voted prom king at South Carolina's Powdersville High School, has taken social media by stormbecause this king wore a dress, LGBTQ Nation reported. To win the honor, Bell received 49 percent of his classmates' votes in the school of 840 studentsa strong statement in the northwest South Carolina community. The prom outfit was a white top from Victoria's Secret and a green velvet skirt from House of CB, he told Teen Vogue. At its annual developers conference, F8, Facebook announced a new dating feature, CNNMoney reported.

John McCain have told the White House that the ailing Arizona Republican does not want President Donald Trump to attend his funeral and would like Vice President Mike Pence to come instead, NBC News reported. McCain, 81, has been battling an aggressive form of brain cancer for nearly a year, and is back home in Arizona after he underwent surgery last month for an intestinal infection. Former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush plan to be eulogists at McCain's funeral service, which is to be held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Navy has halted its practice of announcing the names of commanders relieved for poor performance or misconduct, USA Today noted. It's a move that comes in the wake of one of the worst bribery scandals in Pentagon history. U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier of California, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel, criticized the Navy's change in practice. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his resignation just hours after four women accused him of physically abusing them, New York Magazine reported. In a report from The New Yorker's Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow the four womenthree of whom had romantic relationships with Schneiderman, and a fourth who rebuffed his advancesaccused him of choking and slapping them, and engaging in other controlling, demeaning and threatening behavior. Schneiderman had positioned himself as a champion of the #MeToo movement, as he filed a civil rights suit against Harvey Weinstein and his company. The embattled chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives has won his job back just hours after sending a scalding letter to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan that accused a top Ryan aide of telling him ""something like 'maybe it's time that we had a chaplain that wasn't a Catholic,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, forced the Rev. Pat Conroy to tender his resignation last month, sparking a firestorm. Ryan has said he was dissatisfied with Conroy's pastoral care to lawmakers. An additional 27 women have accused journalist Charlie Rose of a wide array of sexual misconduct, TheWrap reported, citing a Washington Post article. Fourteen women who worked with Rose at CBS accused him of misconduct, while and additional 13 said they were harassed at other companies. In a statement to the Post, CBS said, ""Since we terminated Charlie Rose, we've worked to strengthen existing systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work.""

1106452,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) has announced plans to seek a full banking license in Saudi Arabia. The move comes in the wake of several western banks that are eying the kingdom. Recently HSBC Holdings plc (ADR) (NYSE:HSBC) announced that it had secured a number of mandates for several acquisitions in the country. Several other western banks are currently operating in the country. Many have been attracted by the country’s economic reforms that are aimed at shifting Saudi Arabia from over depending on oil revenue. Citi moved out of Saudi Arabia in 2004 after the sale of its 20% holding in Samba Financial after a five-decade presence in the country. However, the company in 2015 secured a licensing allowing it to directly invest in the country’s local stock market. Early this year, the company got approval to start investing in the country’s banking sector. In a statement, James Forese, the president and CEO of the bank’s institutional clients said they are exploring the investment chances in the country. He was speaking after attending a conference in Riyadh. Apart from Citi, other banks that are seeking license in the kingdom are Goldman Sachs, which has been cleared to trade equities and Credit Suisse. The banks are anticipating to have a say in Saudi Aramco’s awaited public offering. The offering will float around 5% of the company, a move that could make one of the largest in the world by market capitalization. Citi has been an active player in Saudi Arabia’s financial sector, having recently helped the country raise $11 billion in a secured bond last month. The country has launched plans to privatize several state corporations in a move aimed at generating around $10.7 billion in oil revenues by 2020. The privatization is also expected to add 12,000 jobs to the market. Saudi Arabia’s privatization plan HSBC has secured approvals to run several privatizations, which it says will be launched in the near future. This was announced by Samir Assaf, the chief executive of global banking and markets of HSBC during the conference. He added that the company is playing a very big plan in the privatization plan.

If you’ve ever been to Crater Lake in southern Oregon, you know all about its grandeur. The United States’ deepest lake, its brilliant, pure waters are often obscured by clouds. But when it peeks out from beneath the fog, the lake’s unforgettably blue waters are a reminder of nature’s most potent wonders. Now those marvels have been captured in song by composer Michael Gordon, whose symphony “Natural History” was inspired by and performed next to Crater Lake. It took Gordon a year to compose the work, which evokes the lake’s unique majesty and tumultuous story. Crater Lake was formed about 7,700 years ago when Mount Mazama, a volcano, collapsed into a massive circular crater. Then, rain and snowfall filled the bowl with water, creating a kind of scientific curiosity. Because Crater Lake has no inlets or outlets, it’s nearly pristine. That makes it an incredible lab for scientists who use it to study its diverse plants, its unique geological features and the endangered species that make it their home. Gordon drew on that natural heritage when writing a symphony designed to bring out the lake’s natural sounds. In 2016, his work was conducted by Teddy Abrams and performed on the lake’s edge by more than 130 classical musicians. Joining them were drummers from the Klamath people, who have long celebrated the lake as a spiritual place. The work was commissioned by the Britt Music & Arts Festival to celebrate the centennial of the National Park Service. “Symphony for Nature: The Britt Orchestra at Crater Lake,” a documentary that tracks Gordon’s composition and shows the concert, is airing on select PBS stations. It’s also available through PBS Passport, which provides on-demand access to public television programs. The film offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how history, science and culture come together in a musical piece that manages the seemingly impossible: giving voice to a body of water.

1028440,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"May 4, 2018 Tanya Sheehan WATERVILLE, Maine—Colby College has named Tanya Sheehan the distinguished scholar and director of research at the Lunder Institute for American Art. A leading scholar in the field, Sheehan is currently the William R. Kenan Jr. Associate Professor of Art and chair of the Department of Art at Colby. In her role at the Lunder Institute, Sheehan will forge links between the American art curriculum at Colby and scholarship in the field of American art. In addition to teaching courses that support the mission of the Lunder Institute, she will create a variety of innovative research opportunities for Colby students that may include visits to institutional peers, participation in symposia and publications, and engagement with visiting scholars and artists. She will also support the scholarly program of the Lunder Institute by engaging in research collaborations with artists and scholars in residence and by mentoring the institute’s junior fellows; contribute expertise to the institute’s scholarly programs, including symposia and a summer program; and pursue partnerships with major institutions that support scholarship in the field. “Tanya Sheehan is uniquely qualified to play this essential role at the College,” said Margaret McFadden, provost and dean of faculty at Colby. “She is both a superb teacher and a field-changing scholar whose work is widely admired around the world. Our students and faculty will benefit enormously from the opportunities that she will create, and the vibrant scholarly discourses that she will help to foster, both on campus and in the wider field of American art.” “We are building a dream team for the Lunder Institute, and I am thrilled to have Professor Sheehan on board,” said Carolyn J. Muzzy Director and Chief Curator Sharon Corwin. “Her commitment to American art as a researcher and teacher is unparalleled. She will be a force in advancing the scholarly ambitions of the institute.” On the Colby faculty since 2013, Sheehan teaches the history of American art, race and representation, and art and science. She is the author of Doctored: The Medicine of Photography in Nineteenth-Century America (2011) and Study in Black and White: Photography, Race, Humor (2018). Her edited books include Photography, History, Difference (2014), Photography and Its Origins (co-edited with Andres Zervigon, 2015), Grove Art Guide to Photography (2017), and Photography and Migration (2018). She has recently contributed essays to The Image of the Black in Western Art series, A Companion to American Art, and the journal American Art. Since 2015 she has served as editor of the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art Journal. Sheehan earned her Ph.D. and M.A. in art history from Brown University. “I am thrilled to be working with Lee Glazer, Theaster Gates, and the museum’s team in establishing Colby College as a center for research on American art,” said Sheehan. “We have at Colby a unique opportunity to cultivate innovative scholarship in the field and connect it to undergraduate teaching and learning. I look forward to expanding our network of partners and collaborating with an international community of scholars.” This marks the third leadership appointment for the Lunder Institute, which was established by a remarkable gift from Life Trustee Paula Crane Lunder, D.F.A. ’98 and Life Overseer Peter Lunder ’56, D.F.A. ’98 in 2017. Last month Colby announced that renowned artist Theaster Gates will be the first distinguished visiting artist and director of artist initiatives at the Lunder Institute, followed by Smithsonian curator Lee Glazer’s appointment as the founding director.

1015016,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"520 Park Avenue and Ronn Torossian Ronn Torossian, the controversial public relations executive who has represented the who’s who of the real estate world, is the latest buyer at Zeckendorf Development’s 520 Park Avenue. Torossian, the founder of 5WPR, is in contract to buy a full-floor unit in the Robert A.M. Stern-designed building, the New York Post reported. It’s not clear what Torossian paid for his new digs, but StreetEasy currently lists only two full-floor units with asking prices of $20.5 million and $31.65 million. The PR man is now perhaps best known for his dealings with those in President Trump’s orbit. Last month, Torossian penned an op-ed announcing that he testified before a Washington grand jury convened by special prosecutor Robert Mueller about his involvement with Paul Manafort. His firm also represented Sinclair Broadcasting, the largest television station operator in the U.S. that has recently been in the spotlight for requiring its anchors to read pro-Trump scripts. Politico recently ran a profile of Torossian, which detailed his association with former Bayrock Group CEO Felix Sater and Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen. In 2011, he was accused of extorting Kabbalah rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto by threatening to leak damaging financial information to the press if he wasn’t put on retainer, though he was never charged with a crime and denied the claims. In 2015, an Israeli court convicted Pinto on bribery charges, and he served a year in prison. Torossian has also represented a number of other real estate figures, including Michael Shvo and Elie Hirschfeld. And for a time, he represented The Real Deal. Other residents at 520 Park include billionaire Frank Fertitta, former owner of Ultimate Fighting Championship; former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and Dyson company founder James Dyson. In March, Zeckendorf landed a $175 million refinancing package for the building. The projected sellout for the tower is more than $1 billion.

1053951,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"In the two minutes it took University of Miami biomedical engineer Ashutosh Agarwal to explain his organs-on-a-chip research to a reporter, five people in the United States had suffered a heart attack. By the time UM organic chemist Jean-Hubert Oliver had concluded his five-minute presentation on new methods to capture energy from the sun and other sources, millions of batteries had found their way into landfills across the nation. But heart disease, environmental waste, and other challenges need not be the bane of the world. Scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical advances that only a few years ago were regarded as the stuff of science fiction are now making such seemingly intractable problems solvable. Thursday, on an occasion described as “the dawn of a bold new era” for UM, the University took a giant step forward in advancing such research, breaking ground on its new Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building, an iconic structure that will house an intertwined network of institutes aimed at boosting STEM across its campuses. “Today, we ignite the spark that will ensure that the light of discovery and innovation will shine at the U far into the future,” said Jeffrey Duerk, executive vice president for academic affairs and provost. Both the facility, which UM President Julio Frenk said will “put science on display,” and the network of institutes, which are known as the Frost Institutes of Science and Engineering, are made possible by a landmark $100 million gift from the namesake UM benefactors whose legacy at the University is well known in the form of a gift that named the Frost School of Music. Noting that the future Frost Science and Engineering Building links the Colleges of Arts and Sciences and Engineering, Duerk said it is fitting that the Frost Institute of Chemistry and Molecular Science, established last year, is the first of the individual institutes to be created. “Chemistry is the central science—everything in the physical, life, and applied sciences intersects with chemistry,” he said. “It touches on everything from biology to engineering, and from medicine and health sciences to oceanography.” UM, he said, needs to act boldly if it is to be a leader in interdisciplinary STEM research and education. “The Frosts’ gift makes that possible, and the impact will be felt not only at the U but also throughout the greater South Florida community and beyond,” he explained. The groundbreaking ceremony, held on a green space that is envisioned as a scientific quad on the Coral Gables campus and complete with an exploding mound of dirt that spewed orange and green foam, comes almost a year to the day that the Frost Museum of Science opened in downtown Miami. In a move to enhance an existing relationship between the University and the museum (the coral reef research of UM marine biologist Andrew Baker has been featured at the museum), the University and the downtown facility will collaborate on a range of STEM education- and research-focused programs and activities, Frenk announced at the ceremony. “We want to cultivate an interest in science in the museum’s youngest visitors and, we hope, inspire many of them to pursue their educations in the STEM disciplines at UM,” he said. The University of Miami took a giant step forward in advancing STEM research at the U, breaking ground on its new Phillip and Patricia Frost Science and Engineering Building. Enjoy a this recap of the groundbreaking. Those disciplines are already thriving at UM, and Thursday about 300 invited guests got an up-close look at what’s taking place in UM’s cutting-edge labs. This includes the work of Agarwal, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, whose organs-on-a-chip research simulates the activities, mechanics, and physiological response of entire organs and organ systems, leading to a less time-consuming and more effective way to test new drugs. And the work of assistant professor of Chemistry Oliver, whose research in capturing energy from sources other than batteries, could lead to clothes that charge your smartphone as you walk. Graduate and undergraduate students are responsible for a good portion of STEM research at UM, as well. Rachel Besser, a research assistant in biomedical engineering who works in Agarwal’s lab, is collaborating with a Miller School clinician in an investigation of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, using organs-on-a-chip technology to create an out-of-body platform to study the cells of patients who have the neurological disorder. Crystal Nattoo, a junior majoring in electrical engineering, is helping to create sensors that can detect different concentrations of oxygen and differentiate solvents—work that has major implications for the medical field, she said. “For future institutes, we will continue to galvanize our scientists, researchers, and students to delve into the big problems that matter, be they in neuro-engineering, smart cities, data science, or any of the other disciplines that will shape the future of our planet and our society,” said Duerk. Indeed, of the Frosts’ $100 million gift, $30 million is designated to the creation of at least 13 chairs in STEM fields, with $3 million set aside for graduate student support. The creation of the Frost Institutes, patterned after the National Institutes of Health, is the backbone of STEM@UM, one of the nine transformational initiatives to propel the University toward its greatest aspirations by its centennial in 2025, allowing for STEM growth, a stimulation of interdisciplinary research collaboration, and engagement with greater Miami as a hemispheric innovation hub. Richard Fain, chair of UM’s Board of Trustees, praised the Frosts for their gift. “The Frosts could support whatever causes they want,” said Fain. “But for them to support Miami and the University of Miami is truly amazing, and we’re lucky to have them.” But Phillip Frost, a UM trustee for 35 years, deflected Fain’s praise, saying “we are all emissaries and are all visionaries.” Said Frost, “It’s up to us to either give what we can or convince other people to get involved in good causes.” Copyright: 2018 University of Miami.

More than a dozen foreign banks have licences to operate in Saudi Arabia, battling for business resulting from the kingdom’s efforts to wean itself off reliance on oil revenues. US bank Citi ended a five-decade presence in Saudi Arabia in 2004 with the sale of its 20% stake in Samba Financial, but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and in January 2018 gained approval to launch investment banking operations in the state. “We’re looking at whether or not we should expand our activities here into a full banking licence,” James Forese, the president and CE of the bank’s institutional clients group, said at a business conference in Riyadh. Other banks seeking a Saudi licence include Credit Suisse, while Goldman Sachs plans to expand its services in the kingdom after being cleared to trade equities there. The banks are vying for a role in Saudi Aramco’s planned initial public offering, which could float up to 5% of the state oil group and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation. Citi has played an active role in Saudi Arabian finance and was one of the banks that helped to arrange the government’s $11bn bond issue in April. The kingdom is now working on a privatisation pipeline aimed at generating up to about 40-billion riyals ($135.5bn) in nonoil revenue by 2020 and creating up to 12,000 jobs, according to an official document published in April. HSBC had been mandated for several of the planned privatisations and would announce them soon, Samir Assaf, HSBC’s CE of global banking and markets, said on Wednesday.

Forese said there had been a normalisation of interest rate policies but the global market was still accommodative to companies seeking to raise funds. Speaking at a business conference in Riyadh, he added that Citigroup was considering expanding its activities in Saudi Arabia into a full banking licence.

1106452,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"3 Min Read RIYADH (Reuters) - Citigroup (C.N) is considering seeking a full banking license in Saudi Arabia as Western banks aim to capitalize on Saudi economic reforms, with rival HSBC (HSBA.L) announcing it has won mandates for several privatizations in the kingdom More than a dozen foreign banks have licenses to operate branches in Saudi Arabia, battling for business resulting from the kingdom’s efforts to itself off reliance on oil revenues. U.S. bank Citi ended a five-decade presence in Saudi Arabia in 2004 with the sale of its 20 percent stake in Samba Financial but in 2015 won permission to invest directly in the local stock market and in January this year gained approval to begin investment banking operations in the kingdom. “We’re looking at whether or not we should expand our activities here into a full banking license,” James Forese, the president and chief executive of the bank’s institutional clients group, said at a business conference in Riyadh. Other banks seeking a Saudi license include Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), while Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to expand its services in the kingdom after being cleared to trade equities there. The banks are vying for a role in Saudi Aramco’s IPO-ARMO.SE planned initial public offering, which could float up to 5 percent of the state oil giant and make it the world’s biggest oil company by market capitalization. Citi has already played an active role in Saudi Arabian finance and was one of the banks that helped to arrange the government’s $11 billion U.S. dollar bond issue last month. The kingdom is now working on a pipeline of privatizations aimed at generating up to 40 billion riyals ($10.7 billion) in non-oil revenues by 2020 and creating up to 12,000 jobs, according to an official document published last month. HSBC (HSBA.L) has been mandated for several of the planned privatizations and will announce them very soon, Samir Assaf, HSBC’s chief executive of global banking and markets, said at Wednesday’s conference. The bank is “very much contributing to the privatization program”, he said. HSBC Saudi Arabia is already acting as an adviser on the sale process for the kingdom’s flour milling sector and the Saudi Stock Exchange’s planned flotation. It also has an advisory role on the proposed Aramco listing. ($1 = 3.7502 riyals) Editing by David Goodman All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

1107374,12/04/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"photo: Paul Brady Photography/shutterstock With the American higher education system besieged by rising costs, escalating tuition, and a metastasizing student loan crisis, many experts are arguing for more affordable and accessible approaches to post-secondary education. Alternatives to four years of quad life include faster competency-based credentialing and models that stress online learning. At least a few donors are on board, like Chicago financier Larry Gies and his wife Beth. The couple recently gave $150 million to the University of Illinois to ""use technology to democratize"" education, among other things. By exploring how online courses can lower costs and remove barriers to entry, the Gieses are among the few mega-donors addressing the root causes of the student loan crisis. More typical are donors who have fond memories of their campus years and are determined that future generations be able to enjoy the same kind of experience—or better. Recent news out of Tennessee reminds us that many donors remain committed to the immersive benefits of a residential college experience. Vanderbilt University board of trust chairman Bruce R. Evans and his wife Bridgitt committed $20 million to support university initiatives focused on the ""undergraduate living-learning experience."" The gift also includes support for leadership positions in the School of Engineering and an unrestricted bequest for future use. While many colleges are giving online courses a second look, Vanderbilt is doubling down on its residential model. In January, the school announced a $600 million capital project that calls for replacing aging residence halls with ""innovative residential colleges"" over the next five years. ""Four-year residential college systems exist at only a handful of American universities, most notably at Harvard and Yale,"" the press release read. ""Vanderbilt is the only American university undertaking a project of this scale and scope today."" Support from Reliable Education Funders Bridgitt Evans is the co-founder and president of VIA Art Fund, a national nonprofit supporting the contemporary visual arts. (You can check out my 2016 interview with her on the state of arts funding here.) Before founding VIA, she worked as a real estate investor and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School and a B.S. from Miami University. Bruce, meanwhile, earned his MBA from Harvard Business School, and is a former managing director and current chairman of the board of Summit Partners, a Boston-based investment firm that is currently managing $14 billion in capital. The couple established the Evans Family Foundation in 2000 with a focus on the arts and education. Previous grantees include Bowdoin College, Boston College, and Roxbury Latin School. They've also created an endowed scholarship fund at their respective undergrad alma maters to help students attend Harvard Business School. Additional support to Vanderbilt includes undergraduate scholarships and leadership positions in the Vanderbilt Career Center and the university’s innovation hub, the Wond’ry. Commenting on their most recent gift, Bridgitt said, ""We are deeply committed to investing in a residential college experience where future leaders can harness the unique, collaborative spirit on this campus to solve problems and drive innovation."" Understanding the ""Undergraduate Living-Learning Experience"" While the school's press release didn't articulate how the Evans gift will specifically support its ""living-learning communities,"" a read of its Undergraduate Residential Experience website and previous gifts to the school provide some clues. ""We believe proximity matters—science, arts, medicine, the humanities, engineering, and more exist within steps of one another on our campus,"" the site reads. Vanderbilt alumnus and board of trust vice chair-elect Jeffrey Rothschild and his wife Marieke are believers as well. In 2016, the couple made a $20 million gift for the development of the College Halls, a living-learning initiative designed to ""build community, support student success, and extend educational opportunities beyond the classroom."" ""The College Halls program enables dialogue among a diverse mix of students—along with faculty involvement, which is important,"" Marieke Rothschild said at the time. ""You need to have that cross-pollination among students. And it's not just about gender or race, it goes for majors as well. The College Halls bring engineers together with history majors with artists to live side by side."" A year later, the College Halls received a $10 million gift from an anonymous donor. While Vanderbilt may be somewhat of an outlier in terms of the scale of its residential college model, the idea itself has attracted donor support elsewhere. A couple of years ago, University of Southern California (USC) trustee David C. Bohnett made a $15 million pledge to endow and name the David C. Bohnett Residential College, which will focus on the principles of ""social justice and community service"" and form part of a student community that ""integrates living and learning"" for up to 320 students as well as faculty-in-residence and student support staff. ""It’s my hope and aspiration that the Bohnett Residential College will afford USC students with a richly immersive college experience and help prepare them to be actively engaged members of the community throughout their lives,"" Bohnett said in making the gift. A year later, USC Trustee Shelly Nemirovsky and her husband Ofer made a gift of $15 million to endow and name another residential college at USC. ""Knowing that all USC students will now have the opportunity to continue conversations beyond the classroom, in the spirit of collaboration, is thrilling for me, and I believe that I am privileged to witness this seminal moment,"" Shelly said. An Enduring Appeal The line of thinking espoused by the Evanses, Rothschilds, Bohnett, and the Nemirovskys explains why donors remain bullish on the integrative residential college experience. College, by definition, should be integrative, collaborative and communal, especially given the growing body of research suggesting that the liberal arts can complement STEM education. E-learning cannot replicate this kind of cross-disciplinary learning environment. Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos made that point in announcing Vanderbilt's ambitious capital campaign earlier this year. ""In a time when long-distance learning and online courses make getting a degree quicker and easier, Vanderbilt is choosing to invest deeply and broadly in an intensive, in-person experience,"" he said. The campaign's $600 million price tag is hefty, but demand is strong for Vanderbilt's ""intensive, in-person experience."" As of 2016, its acceptance rate was 10.7 percent. The total cost of attendance at Vanderbilt last year was $67,392. The school's endowment, meanwhile, stands at $4.1 billion. Contrast this picture with the University of Illinois. Wracked by ongoing budget cuts, enrollment at many of Illinois' public universities dropped in 2017. University officials have had no choice but to embrace technology to reduce costs. Fortunately, the school found an ally in the Gieses. In a way, this is another tale of two Americas. In some flush universities, where times are good, the ideal of the immersive residential experience remains strong and finds the support of deep-pocketed donors. Maybe that model is, indeed, unsustainable over the long term, but you wouldn't know it by watching the flow of donor dollars. As we've so often noted, plenty of campus patrons are eager enablers of a gold-plated higher ed model that entails sky-high tuition costs and, for many grads, decades of student debt. In theory, campus donors concerned about the student debt crisis could help end it by using the power of their purse to impose more discipline on higher ed institutions or to bankroll new experimentation with leaner models. In practice, they're often the best friends that free spending universities have—after private lenders and the federal government. Want to get inside funders' heads? Sign up for our email updates.

The Israeli drugmaker’s slate of directors, which has changed extensively in recent years at activist investor urging, will shrink by two spots after the company’s annual meeting in June, according to a regulatory filing. Galia Maor, Gabrielle Sulzberger and Dan Suesskind have decided not to stand for reelection, the generics giant said. Tel Aviv University professor Ronit Satchi-Fainaro, who leads the university’s Cancer Research and Nanomedicine Laboratory, is Teva’s only new nominee, which means the board will contract to 11 members from its current 13. “We sincerely thank them for their contribution, leadership and critical efforts on behalf of Teva throughout their respective terms of service. The Board will miss their insight and perspective in its deliberations and hope they will remain close to Teva for years to come,” a spokeswoman said of Maor, Sulzberger and Suesskind in an emailed statement. Teva’s board has all but turned over within the last few years. Other than Maor, who is on her way out, there’s only one director left in the boardroom who was around before activist investor Benny Landa rallied in 2014 for a smaller board with more experience in global pharma. That’s Amir Elstein, who at one time looked primed to succeed departed chairman Phillip Frost—that is, before Landa decried the potential pick. RELATED: Teva rebel investor Landa's gearing up for a proxy fight—and he can win, he says After Elstein, Teva’s longest-tenured director is Jean-Michel Halfon, a Pfizer veteran Frost brought in circa 2014 in response to Landa’s campaign. “We continue to evaluate the size and composition of our board of directors to ensure it maintains dynamic, exceptionally qualified members and that the mix of talent and experience on the board reflects all the challenges that the company faces,” Teva told Reuters in a statement. RELATED: Teva overhauling boardroom as top-level revamp continues Last year also saw a slew of board arrivals and departures as part of an exodus of Teva’s old guard. Under the watch of Celgene veteran and chairman Sol Barer, Teva added former Regeneron CFO Murray Goldberg; former GlaxoSmithKline R&D official Perry Nisen; Roberto Mignone, a managing partner at healthcare-specializing hedge fund Bridger Management; and Chemi Peres, a managing partner of Pitango Venture Capital, which has invested in healthcare. The newbie on the roster? Kåre Schultz, the company’s CEO, who joined the company last fall and has since ensured that Teva’s board isn’t the only part of the company seeing major change. To pare down a crushing debt-load, he initiated 14,000 layoffs last year, a move that sparked labor protests around Teva’s home country but earned praise from analysts. © 2018 Questex LLC.

Updated: December 4, 2018 @ 11:36 am Partners in Chesterfield County-based Virginia Asset are Chris Williams (from left), Mike White, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Tripp Leonard. The financial planning and services firm helps businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. Partners in Chesterfield County-based Virginia Asset are Chris Williams (from left), Mike White, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Tripp Leonard. The financial planning and services firm helps businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. The top executive at the Children’s Museum of Richmond needed guidance regarding benefit options. Shannon Venable approached financial services firm Virginia Asset Management for assistance. “They were really good at understanding what we were trying to do,” said Venable, the museum’s president and CEO. “They came in person to meet with our leadership team, and that was invaluable. They were very knowledgeable.” Virginia Asset Management has a variety of offerings, including individual financial planning for business owners, investments, retirement plans and employee benefits design and planning as well as insurance products. The company also helps business owners value their businesses and develop succession plans. The Chesterfield County-based financial planning and services firm works with businesses that have one to 1,000 employees. “Our sweet spot is one to 500 employees,” said Mike White, the firm’s president and CEO. “We do all the planning businesses need. We include their legal and tax advisers in the process.” The company’s customers are spread out across the country, but the majority are in the Mid-Atlantic. Affiliated Dermatologists of Virginia is one of the firm’s clients. “We did things in baby steps,” said Anne Wolff, Affiliated Dermatologists’ administrator, who called Virginia Asset Management when she was looking for financial advice for the medical practice. “We had a year to see if Virginia Asset Management was going to follow through with what they said. They were consistent and did follow through. They gave us some great advice,” Wolff said. Virginia Asset is widening its services and territory through mergers with similar financial businesses. The company, for instance, has merged with five small financial firms over the years, which includes its latest merger in February with Henrico County-based Chancery Advisory Concepts. “We have been talking to Chancery for about a year. They took a hard look at whether our firm had the expertise they were looking for to add additional services to their clients,” said White, who owns Virginia Asset with Tripp Leonard, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth and Chris Williams. White founded the company in 1986 with two partners, Buddy Whitlow, who is still at the firm, and the late Betsy Woolfolk. “We did mostly insurance products back then,” White said. “Now, we are a robust fee financing firm that specializes in working with closely held business owners. We have extensive expertise in working with 401(k) plans for business owners.” Virginia Asset continues to expand its services and expertise. “The future for us is to focus on being the premium planning firm for business owners,” White said. The company also puts on workshops in colleges and universities for business owners through its Business U program. It has conducted workshops at Virginia Commonwealth University, North Carolina State University, James Madison University and John Tyler Community College, to name a few. “We do the same thing for CPA and law firms and their clients and community banks and their customers,” White said. “We educate businesses on all the things they need to be thinking about in building, running and selling a business.” In addition to its offices in Chesterfield, Virginia Asset Management has offices elsewhere in Virginia — in Norfolk, Fairfax and South Hill. It also has offices in Raleigh and Pinehurst, N.C.; and in Pittsburgh; Philadelphia; and Minneapolis. The company’s revenue grew 10.5 percent each year from 2015 to 2017. Bobby Fulcher, owner of Aeration Plus in Powhatan, has been working with Virginia Asset for about seven years. “They are very easy to work with. They have everything under one roof. You don’t have to go to other companies to get what you need,” he said. “It’s the best company we have ever worked with in their industry.” Lynn Gabay, practice administrator for Advanced Wellness Centre in Richmond, finds Virginia Asset Management provides quick answers to all her questions. “When I email them a question, I have an answer usually in less than an hour,” she said. “Insurance is tricky. I appreciate their guidance and expertise. They have guided us through lots of insurance and benefits situations. They tirelessly search each year to get the best level of insurance for us.” What is it?: Financial planning and services to individuals and business owners Headquarters: 130 Wylderose Drive in Chesterfield County Employees: 110, including owners Owners: Mike White, Tripp Leonard, Michael Sanson, Keith Muth, Chris Williams Contact: (804) 330-0711 or www.vamllc.com Your comment has been submitted.
