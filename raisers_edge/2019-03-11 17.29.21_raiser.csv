The candidates are former Selectman Jack Spanbauer and Heath Cummings, who formerly worked as the school police officer at Pioneer Valley Regional School. The term is three years. The contested seat has been held by Julia Blyth for the last three years. She did not seek nomination this time, explaining that she wanted to prioritize her time differently. Jack Spanbauer has served on the Selectboard for about 16 years since 2000, having taken a few years off at times for different reasons, he said. Most recently he was on the board until May 2018, but did not run for re-election last year for health reasons and because of disagreements with the town administration policy at the time, he said. Spanbauer is now on the Business Park Committee. Previously he was on the Finance Committee and several special purpose committees, including the Master Plan Committee, he said. “I thought I’d offer my experience to serve the town again,” Spanbauer said. He did not cite a more particular reason for his interest in the position, saying that he has “no concerns or complaints” about the current Selectboard. Heath Cummings has lived in Northfield for seven years, he said. Starting in September 2017, he worked for the Northfield Police Department as the resource officer at Pioneer Valley Regional School. He resigned in October 2018, and now works for the Gill-Montague Regional School District as the facilities and energy director. Cummings grew up in Erving, and worked for the Erving Police Department for 17 years before joining the Northfield department in 2017. “I saw how the town works from the inside out,” Cummings said of his time with the Northfield Police Department. “I saw a lot of room for improvement, and how my skills can be used for those improvements.” Specifically, he cited “turmoil” in Town Hall, and said that his professional experience as a team-builder could bring more cohesion to the town’s government. The other 15 positions on the ballot are uncontested. All terms are for three years, except for the Planning Board term, which is five years. ■One assessor — Robert MacEwan ■Two Board of Health members — Philip Baker, FloreSadri ■Two library trustees — Margot Fleck, Deborah Potee ■One Planning Board member — Richard Fitzgerald ■Two Recreation Commission members — Theresa Quinn-Tsipenyuk, Joseph Stacy ■Four constables — David Brassor, Fredd Fuller, Albert Stone, John Ware ■One Sewer Commission member — Dan Gray ■One Veterans Memorial trustee (veteran) — Francis Froment ■One Veterans Memorial trustee (non-veteran) — Raymond Zukowski. New candidates can also be nominated by petition. Nomination papers are available at the Town Clerk’s Office, and must be returned to the Town Clerk’s Office by 5 p.m. on Friday. A petition requires 20 signatures of Northfield voters. Town Clerk Dan Campbell recommends more than 20, in case any signatures cannot be verified.

Diamond, a senior investment banker at the time, wanted to raise money privately to keep it afloat. He was thought to be concerned about his future and that of chief executive John Varley if Barclays fund-raised publicly. Diamond reportedly told a meeting: 'This is about saving jobs – mine and John's.' Richard Boath, a former Barclays executive on trial for fraud alongside Varley, claimed Diamond was against public fundraising efforts because it would have hurt his credibility. Boath, Varley and former colleagues Tom Kalaris and Roger Jenkins are accused of fraud over payments to Qatari investors. They deny the charges. Diamond is not accused of any wrongdoing.

1015016,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"2 Min Read MILAN, March 6 (Reuters) - Italian challenger bank Illimity trimmed its 2023 profit forecast on Wednesday to take into account regulatory changes which will force it to increase provisions against loan losses. The bank cited increased volatility on Italian government bonds since a Eurosceptic coalition came to power in June. Illimity said it expects net profit of 280 million euros ($316.60 million) in 2023 compared with a 300 million euro target under a business plan announced in July. However, it aims to reach a profit of 55-70 million euros in 2020, up from a previous target of 40-45 million euros. It will start paying a dividend from 2022. Illimity specialises in managing bad loans and lending to small businesses, targeting higher-margin borrowers who are considered too risky by traditional banks. It was founded last year by veteran banker Corrado Passera and had former Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond as its main sponsor. Illimity reported on Wednesday a net loss of 23.5 million euros for 2018 hit by extraordinary start-up costs as well as a decision to cut its government bond portfolio. The bank confirmed its capital targets with a CET1 ratio of more than 15 percent throughout the plan period. Shares in Illimity started trading on Monday on the Milan stock exchange. They rose 1 percent by 0815 GMT against a 0.1 percent increase in Italy’s banking index.

Mr Diamond reportedly told a meeting ""This is all about saving jobs - mine and John's"", referring to then chief executive John Varley. The quote was recalled by former Barclays executive Richard Boath, currently on trial at Southwark Crown Court together with Mr Varley. In an interview with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) played to the court, Mr Boath related Mr Diamond's statement in June 2008. Mr Boath told the SFO Mr Diamond was concerned he might have to leave his job if the bank raised funds publicly, for example through a ""rights issue"". In a rights issue, existing shareholders, many of them large City institutions, are offered the right to buy new shares in exchange for handing over new funds. But, Mr Boath told the SFO, Bob Diamond was opposed to going to institutions. In that event brokers would be required to check the bank's marking of its trading positions [the value of its holdings of shares and bonds]. ""There was a meeting… In that meeting Bob said - this is all about saving jobs - it's mine and John's. ""What he meant was Bob had consistently said - 'no, we don't need capital'. ""The gossip in the market was that we hadn't marked our positions as conservatively as other people and that if we couldn't raise capital in this process the only alternative would be a rights issue…and the brokers would come in and do their due diligence - a ""drains-up"" - and we'd have to defend our position. ""What Bob said about saving jobs was that in those circumstances they [Bob Diamond and John Varley] would have to go,"" Mr Boath told the SFO in 2016. A recording of Mr Boath's interview was played at the trial of John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Richard Boath and Tom Kolaris. They are accused of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. They deny the charges. The charges relate to two fund-raising efforts in June 2008 and October 2008, when the bank raised £12bn, mostly from private investors including Qatar Holdings, a company owned by the state of Qatar. The Serious Fraud Office alleges that defendants misled shareholders by paying Qatari companies £322m in secret fees for ""Advisory Services Agreements"" that were not properly disclosed. The SFO has alleged that the agreements were in fact ""a disguised mechanism for providing extra fees to the Qataris in a way in which defendants knew and intended would not be disclosed"". Today the court heard how Mr Boath told the SFO: ""The pressure to get the deal done was intense from the very beginning."" Bankers senior to Mr Boath were communicating about the deal, he said, including Mr Diamond and Mr Varley. The bank's most senior lawyers, Mark Harding and Judith Shepherd, repeatedly advised that the bank could pay fees for services if it received sufficient value for those services, he told the SFO. Mr Boath described in his SFO interview how he was asked in the first capital raising in June by his senior colleague Roger Jenkins to calculate the size of an additional fee. The Qataris had demanded a commission 1.75% higher than what was paid to other investors. This amount - £42m - was to secure the Qataris' participation in the capital raising, Mr Boath told the SFO. When this was discussed the services to be paid for had not yet been determined. Mr Boath described how he sought ""air cover"" - the reassurance of knowing lawyers and people senior to him knew the issues and had discussed them. ""What I was concerned about was, one - is this legal? And two - how are we going to deal with this if other investors discover this? ""Firstly why don't we tell them [the Qataris] to get stuffed? And two - do the senior - does Varley and Bob and Mark - have they all read this undertaking in the subscription agreement that everyone is getting the same… from where I sat that's a fairly brave thing to say - cos I wouldn't be thanked for it. ""The conversation that then ensued was whether that was something the bank could do - could reasonably do - could legally do - and in that conversation Mark Harding repeatedly said that the bank was able to enter an arrangement like that provided it got value for services,"" Mr Boath told the SFO. ""It was clear for what I recollect that the request had come from the Qataris for a higher fee. The mechanism - the ASA was a mechanism to pay an additional fee and satisfy their demand for an additional fee. That was blindingly obvious from the call and everybody on that call understood that."" There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Qatar. The trial continues.

1011876,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"The San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet/Kronos Performing Arts Association(KPAA) is pleased to present Kronos Festival 2019, Kronos' fifth annual, three-day music festival, at SFJAZZ Center on May 30-June 1. Kronos Festival 2019 will highlight the voices of singers, storytellers, and activists over three evening concerts, a Saturday morning family concert and Kronos Labs, free public events that are new this year. Kronos has long collaborated with vocal artists, including in its recent Grammy Award­-winning album Landfall (Nonesuch Records) with Laurie Anderson and its new album Placeless (Kirkelig Kulturverksted) with Iranian singers Mahsa and Marjan Vahdat. During the festival, a wide range of artists will join Kronos on stage. Experimental duo CocoRosie, Malian griot singer Hawa Kassé Mady Diabaté (of Trio Da Kali), and the San Francisco Girls Chorus are all returning from last year's festival. In addition, folk musicians Sam Amidon and Lee Knight, composer and guitarist Jherek Bischoff, writer Rebecca Solnit, and filmmaker Sam Green will perform. Highlighting Kronos' legacy of mentorship, students from the Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts once again take center stage during the festival. Kronos is honored that Valérie Sainte-Agathe, artistic director of the San Francisco Girls Chorus and frequent Kronos collaborator, will be Kronos Festival 2019's Artist-in-Residence. Additional guests will be announced. Each festival presents Kronos with an opportunity to unveil new work. The ensemble will debut the first part of a project, commissioned by the FreshGrass Foundation, that will commemorate the life and legacy of folk icon and activist Pete Seeger, who would have turned 100 years old this May. Kronos will also perform the Bay Area premiere of Glorious Mahalia, a work by Chicago-based composer Stacy Garrop that celebrates legendary singer Mahalia Jackson through the words and spirit of oral historian and activist Studs Terkel. Kronos also premieres two pieces written for 50 for the Future: The Kronos Learning Repertoire. One is by Stanford University composer Mark Applebaum, whose works frequently consist of both gestural movements and sound, and another by Diabaté, whose work is inspired by the tegere tulon-a tradition of handclapping songs and dances created spontaneously by girls in country villages of southern Mali. Kronos' 50 for the Futureis a string quartet commissioning, performance, education and legacy project that is creating a library of 50 works-composed by 25 women and 25 men-designed to guide young amateur and early-career professional string quartets in developing and honing the skills required for the performance of 21st-century repertoire. During Kronos Festival 2019, scores and parts, recordings, and other pedagogical materials for five new works will be made publicly available on Kronos' website, bringing the total number of available works to 30. This year, the festival also debuts Kronos Labs, an admission-free series, on Saturday afternoon. ""Big Five of Bayview"" is a free talk and performance led by Sainte-Agathe that will highlight the legacy of the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood activists and include a protest music sing-along featuring music popularized by Pete Seeger. ""Pete Seeger: 'The World that Music Lives In'"" is a free talk by American Folklife Center, Library of Congress curator Todd Harvey that will illustrate Seeger's career and efforts for peace and social justice. Additional program highlights include Solnit and others reading selected testimonies as part of the national Voices of a People's History project, inspired by the scholarship of historian Howard Zinn on Thursday night; Green enlisting Kronos in Por Vida!, a live documentary short about San Francisco's legacy business Casa Sanchez on Friday night; and ethnomusicologist Dr. Lucy Durán giving a pre-show talk about the tegere tulonon Saturday night. ""I feel so honored to be the Kronos Festival Artist-in-Residence this year,"" says Sainte-Agathe. ""It is, for me, a wonderful opportunity to join artistic forces and give hope and energy for the future to our community. Music is a powerful tool. I am grateful to be able to keep fighting together to advocate for more diversity and to move forward without ignoring the past. I am thrilled to have the San Francisco Girls Chorus be part of this adventure. Making sure women's voices are heard, believed and respected, even at a very young age, is such a priority."" ""Kronos Festival 2019 will celebrate music, activism, stunning voices, San Francisco, and the promise of youth,"" says David Harrington, Kronos' artistic director, founder and violinst. ""You will hear Mahalia Jackson, Studs Terkel, Rebecca Solnit, Sam Amidon, Hawa Kassé Mady Diabaté, CocoRosie and the San Francisco Girls Chorus with Valérie Sainte-Agathe, Kronos Festival 2019 Artist-in-Residence. Filmmaker Sam Green will tell a Mission District story. Long time Kronos collaborator Jacob Garchik has a new piece celebrating the 100th year of singer, banjoist and all-around activist force in American culture Pete Seeger. The penetrating words of Howard Zinn will unite music with energized action, and young musicians from Asawa SOTA will inspire hope. Kronos Festival 2019 charts new directions for the work of Kronos.

1015016,03/11/2019,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Callum Burroughs, provided by Reuters A senior Barclays executive claimed he wouldn't sacrifice himself to save the jobs of then CEO John Varley and former president Bob Diamond if capital-raising negotiations at the height of the financial crisis fell apart, a London jury heard today. ""Well fuck that, I’m not taking a hit to save John and Bob’s jobs. Fuck that,"" the court heard that Roger Jenkins said. The quote from the former executive chairman of investment management in the Middle East and North Africa came in written testimony to the Serious Fraud Office by former Barclays Capital executive Richard Boath, in 2o14. The implication is that Jenkins was afraid the deal might be toxic enough to generate legal consequences that would land on his doorstep. The executives believed, during the darkest part of the global financial crisis, that if they failed to persuade a set of Qatari investors to give them £4 billion then Barclays might collapse. Other banks — Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Northern Rock — had gone to the wall at the time. The SFO alleges that Varley and other executives — Boath, Thomas Kalaris, and Roger Jenkins — misled investors in the deal by using ""advisory services agreements"" (ASAs). The SFO alleges that the side-deals paid Qatari companies £322 million ($423 million) — a 3.25% commission — in fees during the capital raisings, which were fraudulently not disclosed to other investors. The defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges. Bob Diamond is not accused of any wrongdoing. Jenkins received a £25 million bonus for his role in the fundraising, given his close relationship with the Qatari investors. During a conversation between Jenkins and Boath in 2008, the two executives discussed the viability of paying Qatari investors additional fees, adding up to a larger sum than other investors received, the court heard. Boath said: ""We can’t do a capital markets transaction where we give one set of fees to the market or to one set of investors, and ... have a different set of economics for another set of investors because if they found out they’ll go completely nuts. You can’t do that."" The interview with the SFO indicates that there were numerous discussions about the way in which the Qataris could be paid, with Boath at one point getting frustrated by the prospect of an ASA being used. ""Tell them to get stuffed. Let’s do something else,"" the jury heard. Read more: See all our coverage of the Barclays Qatar trial here. Previously, the court heard that Thomas Kalaris, formerly head of Barclays Wealth Management said, ""None of us wants to go to jail here."" He was referring to a draft of the agreement. Boath responded, ""it ain't worth it and apparently the food sucks."" Kalaris then added: ""No the food sucks and the sex is worse."" In his interview with the SFO, Boath made it clear that there ""wasn’t a genuine concern about going to jail at all,"" and that his conversation with Kalaris was simply ""a joke."" He also claimed that his anxiety about the ASA deal ""disappeared"" after he learned that senior bank executives had consulted external legal advice about the agreements and the services provided. ""How could senior people at the top of their profession at a global bank like Barclays have agreed to this without some verification of the services?"" Boath said. The trial at Southwark Crown court is ongoing.
