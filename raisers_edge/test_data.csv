08/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The donation is for a contemporary art gallery in the arts center planned for downtown Waterville. WATERVILLE — A longtime Colby College supporter is donating $2 million for a contemporary art gallery in a downtown arts center planned by Colby and Waterville Creates! at 93 Main St., college officials announced. The donor is Colby Trustee Emeritus Paul J. Schupf, who received an honorary degree from the college in 2006. Schupf has given several significant contributions to Colby in the past, making possible the Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz, and the Paul J. Schupf Sculpture Court at the Colby College Museum of Art; the Paul J. Schupf Scientific Computing Center; the Anthony-Mitchell-Schupf residence hall; and the Colby College-Memorial Sloan Kettering Summer Internship. Schupf, a collector, has also donated numerous works of art, including pieces by Katz and a gift of more than 150 works on paper by Richard Serra. Colby and Waterville Creates! are trying to raise $18 million to $20 million to transform The Center at 93 Main St. into a thriving art and film center, including the contemporary art gallery on the first floor and a relocated Railroad Square Cinema with new equipment and seating on the second. The gallery, to be named after Schupf, allows the Colby art museum to expand into downtown Waterville, Colby officials said in a statement. As part of the downtown arts complex, the Schupf gallery will feature a rotating program of contemporary art exhibitions. Regularly scheduled gallery events will be held in the space. “The Schupf gallery will be a vital part of the new center for contemporary art and film, which has been conceived to create a hub of activity on Main Street and cement Waterville’s place as a destination for the arts,” Colby President David A. Greene said in the statement. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond.” Schupf is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s board of governors and served as a college trustee for many years. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” Schupf said in the statement. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped on board immediately. The donation of the Paul J. Schupf gallery for contemporary art in downtown Waterville is just another manifestation of my admiration for the college and its museum.” On March 5, Colby and Waterville Creates! announced plans to transform the downtown building to help make Waterville a singular destination for the arts in Maine. The project will feature new and renovated space to support leading programs in visual arts, theater, film and arts education. The larger complex will include the Waterville Opera House, Common Street Arts, the Maine Film Center and the cinema. It is expected to attract even more visitors to Main Street, anchored by a hotel Colby plans to build a block from Castonguay Square and Colby’s Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, which is expected to house 200 Colby students, faculty and staff at 150 Main St. Colby also bought and renovated 173 Main St. across the street from the Commons. The former Waterville Savings Bank building houses software consultant CGI Group, Colby employees and a student business incubator.

08/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Alumna/us in the News,"The late Richard “Dick” Perles ’62 will impact generations of faculty at William & Mary through a $1 million gift made in his memory to fund a government professorship at the university. Perles’ wife, Janice Griffith, created the endowment to honor her husband’s lifelong commitment to public service. Perles, who passed away in 2005, was an accomplished lawyer who was known for his community involvement, sharp sense of humor and quick wit. “I wanted to honor Dick for his extraordinary life and his civic participation,” Griffith said. “He always expressed a great interest in William & Mary and enjoyed his education there so I thought it would be especially appropriate to honor his memory with this gift.” By providing salary, research and teaching support, the Richard S. Perles Professorship in Government will ensure that dedicated and talented faculty continue to enrich the academic enterprise. “We are enormously grateful to be able to honor distinguished faculty members in government with this named professorship,” said Dean of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences Kate Conley. “The gift will help us recruit and retain top-notch faculty as well as recognize their outstanding work. It will also let our faculty know how valued they are by alumni, and I think that sends a very powerful message.” Perles, a government major, loved being surrounded by history as he pursued his undergraduate degree on William & Mary’s storied campus. He was especially interested in American history, governance and contemporary politics while he was a student. After graduating from William & Mary, Perles earned his law degree from Fordham University School of Law. He and Griffith met in New York City and forged a bond that spanned 30 years of marriage. Perles, whose legal work included real estate transactions and commercial and tort litigation, worked at New York City law firms before opening his own law practice in New York and Connecticut. The couple relocated to Atlanta in 1996 upon the appointment of Griffith, a law professor, as the dean of Georgia State University’s College of Law. Perles again set up a general practice law office. Now a law professor at Suffolk University in Boston, Griffith teaches State and Local Government Law. “Dick was the consummate lawyer. He was adept at both counseling and advocacy. In addition, he possessed sound judgment that made him a natural leader as well as an outstanding lawyer,” Griffith said. “He helped his clients plan for the future, even in areas of the law unmarked by settled boundary lines. He met the ideals of the lawyer-statesman by providing leadership in his community with exceptional wisdom and skill. Dick believed that a lawyer’s professional duties should include civic participation. ” Dick served on local government boards, often providing the leadership needed to effectuate new initiatives, Griffith said. He also provided pro bono legal services to community groups in need of a strong advocate for their causes. Griffith said her husband had a passion for protecting our natural resources. He served on the Stratford, Connecticut Waterfront Harbor Management Commission and was a forceful advocate for the protection of Stratford’s Great Meadows Marsh when its existence was threatened by potential development. In Atlanta, his leadership in the late 1990s led to the creation of a Grant Park Conservancy with a mission to restore and preserve Atlanta’s oldest park, Griffith said.
