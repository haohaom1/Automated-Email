I’ve just suggested to him that if he’d fired Bob Diamond two decades ago the whole history of the global financial crisis might have been different. After a microsecond of thought, Taylor breaks into a smile. “I like to think the financial system didn’t hang on a binary choice of mine in 1998 – that would really be solipsism in the highest degree!” he chuckles. Fair enough. But the Apprentice-style fire-or-not-fire decision scenario was real enough. Taylor himself described it in an article for the Financial Times a few years ago. Taylor was the chief executive of the Quaker-founded British bank Barclays. And Bob Diamond’s investment banking division had blown up due to an unexpected sovereign default in Russia, forcing the group to register a large loss. What made it worse was that tight trading limits for Russian debt set by the bank’s board had been deliberately bypassed by Diamond’s traders. The ambitious American banker, humbled, was offering his resignation. Taylor turned it down believing that Diamond was too important to lose. Diamond, of course, went on to drive Barclays into the very heart of the global credit storm that unleashed disaster on the world and the UK economy in 2008. And he became one of the public villains of the crisis thanks to his spectacularly ill-judged suggestion before the Treasury Select Committee in 2011 that the “period of remorse” from bankers “needs to be over”. “Looking back on it I think I made the wrong call,” Taylor tells me, sitting in his rather spartan office on the upper floors of the Bank of England’s City of London headquarters. “But it was more about Barclays than the financial world as a whole.” Tieless, glasses nestling in his blazer pocket, wearing comfortable slacks, 66-year-old Taylor resembles a country solicitor more than a former City titan or the influential regulator he is now, as an external member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The only hint of financial services about him is a faint pinstripe on that dark blue blazer. I’d wanted to interview Taylor for some time, and not only for his juicy insider knowledge on Barclays. He’s also been at the heart of some of the major post-financial crisis reforms and institutions. He served on the Independent Commission on Banking (better known as the Vickers Commission, after its chair, Sir John Vickers) which was set up by George Osborne to decide whether or not to split up investment and retail banking in the wake of the crash. And since 2013 he has been a member of the FPC, which is charged with sniffing out financial crises, like a Bloodhound, before they happen and orders the inflation of banks’ capital buffers when they seem to be getting too relaxed about risk. Taylor’s time with the commission is drawing to an end. He has informed the Treasury he will step down no later than June 2019. So it seems a reasonable time for him to reflect a little in public, not just on his time on the FPC but on the decade since the crisis. The first question is, how much has really changed in our financial system over the last 10 years? Taylor’s answer is unequivocal, trenchant even. “I don’t know whether to laugh or be irritated by it but one of the things I’ve found about a lot of the writing about the tenth anniversary of the crisis is that lots of them basically said ‘nothing’s changed’. But actually almost everything has changed,” he says. “The industry has changed profoundly. The relationship of regulatory supervisors to industry has changed profoundly. The incentives have changed. The rules on pay have changed. The rules about liquidity in banking have changed. I think there’s been an extraordinary policy response. And I think there’s been some cultural change. Those who wrote it’s all the same, I don’t know where they’re looking. They don’t see the world that I see.” I decide this is not a good time to divulge that I myself recently wrote an essay lamenting the timidity of the reform effort. We move on. Lots of banks have been fined huge sums by regulators over various scandals, from interest rate rigging to insurance mis-selling. Plenty of bosses have departed under a black cloud. But virtually none of the top bankers during the crisis whose institutions foundered and incubated gross misconduct – not even Fred Goodwin of the Royal Bank of Scotland – have been struck off from the Financial Conduct Authority’s “approved persons” list. Inclusion on it is needed to work in the industry. Doesn’t that, I suggest, represent a gross failure of nerve by regulators, a blow to genuine accountability? Taylor’s not having it. “I think on the whole that the people at the top of institutions that went wrong in the financial crisis, they lost their jobs, they lost a lot of money, they lost their reputations. I think the idea that they didn’t suffer is a strange one. Imagine what it’s like to be in their shoes – it’s not great actually,” he says. “I don’t think having the FCA write something on your tombstone is necessarily the be all and end all.” A new book on Barclays’ roller coaster history by the writer Philip Augar relates that when Taylor was in charge he wanted to split off the troublesome investment banking division. Indeed, he resigned after failing to win the support of the board for his radical restructuring plans. The Vickers Commission was asked to look into that very question, not just for Barclays but the entire UK banking sector. Yet Vickers stopped short of recommending a clean break and proposed a somewhat complicated “ringfence” of banks’ retail arms instead. Why didn’t Vickers go the whole hog? Wasn’t this a missed opportunity, especially from Taylor’s perspective? “I’ve done lots of work for government. If you’re on one of those committees, the ideal space to get to is somewhere where there’s an overhang on a Venn diagram and where what you think is a proper solution is something that government and parliament is going to accept,” explains Taylor. So did he think that a full split proposal might not be welcomed by the government and risked being rejected? “I was certainly conscious of it,” he says. “Finding a resolution to something does just mean recommending something. Recommending an ideal solution which government then does not enact is useless. Equally, finding an inadequate solution the government enacts is useless too.” But he’s adamant that ringfencing, finally due to come in next year, is an acceptable solution to the problem of banks funding their casino trading habits with ordinary depositors’ savings. “I remember when we reported it in September 2011 and said we wanted these things to be done by the beginning of 2019, a lot of people laughed and said, ‘This is for the long grass and it’s never going to happen’. And you know what? It’s three months away and it’s happened,” he says. Born 8 June 1952 in Burnley, Lancashire 1965-1969: Eton College 1970-1974: Balliol College Oxford, reading Oriental Studies (Chinese) 1974-1982: Reuters and Financial Times 1982-1993: Courtaulds (textiles company) 1994‐1998: Barclays chief executive 2000‐present: non‐executive director of RTL Group 2010‐11: member of Independent Commission on Banking 2013-present: external member of Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee 2015-present: director at CiBO Technologies Yet, on the subject of Vickers, there’s been an unusually public disagreement between the Bank of England and Sir John on the question of banks’ capital requirements. The FPC has mandated UK banks to have a capital buffer [shareholders’ equity to absorb potential losses] of at least 4 per cent of total assets. But Sir John, essentially, thinks that’s too low – and a floor beneath what the Vickers Committee itself proposed. What does Taylor think of the concerns of his old chair? “John has been vocal about the systemic risk buffer. I’m comfortable that where we’ve got to, we’ve got a system with about as much equity as Vickers proposed, and arrived at in a slightly different way, and with an awful lot more debt that is convertible into equity,” he says. “Would I prefer in an ideal world for some of that debt to be equity? Yes I would. But I think we’re in the right place.” I point out that even Mervyn King, who was the Bank’s Governor when Taylor joined the FPC in 2013, is now saying that banks should have substantially more capital than the regulatory minimum. “Mervyn’s a friend and I’ve known him a very long time. He was Governor of the Bank for 10 years and deputy governor for five and chief economist before that and he didn’t actually do it in those 20 years,” says Taylor, slightly mischievously. “If you’re a macroprudential regulator your default setting is to fall asleep worrying about the banking system and to think a little bit more capital would be nice. And the next time you think maybe a little more. We don’t want more capital to make supervisors sleep better – we want more capital to have the appropriate amount of resilience in the system.” Often central bankers and regulators are surprisingly gregarious in person but automatons when they write anything down. With Taylor it’s almost the other way around. As an interviewee he’s rather hesitant, diffident even. Our talk is punctuated by long pauses for thought. At a couple of points he asks, almost plaintively, “Don’t you think?” Rather disappointingly, he refuses to talk at any length about Barclays, where activist investor Edward Bramson is now pressing the bank to get out of investment banking, just as he urged all those years ago. Yet a supremely self-confident intelligence shines out of Taylor’s speeches for the FPC, which are crowded with erudite and witty historical references to imperial China and the French revolution. Their substance is usually the magisterial brushing aside of the latest anti-regulation fallacy propagated by the financial lobby. And there have been some Exocet newspaper articles. Along with the one that lifted the lid on the history of Bob Diamond at Barclays was a particularly memorable broadside in 2009 which castigated his former banking colleagues for paying massive bonuses to staff out of illusory paper profits during the bubble. His mordant conclusion: “The system was brought down not because risk management was deficient (though it was), nor because greed was rampant (though it was), but because bankers could not count.” Perhaps that unusual self-confidence with the pen reflects his origins in journalism, and his editing of the Lex investment column for the Financial Times in the early 1980s. Before I leave, I suggest to Taylor that it’s inconceivable that anyone today could progress from journalism to senior banker to regulator in the way that he did. “It was inconceivable then!” he laughs. “I had a very strange career. But I think people ought to change sector. One of the problems I found towards the end of my business career was I was dealing with people who knew everything about a rather narrow area. You want people like that – [but] you don’t want everyone to be like that. Because otherwise it’s quite hard to see where connections are made.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

1015016,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Ye Jianming is a 41-year-old Chinese oil tycoon who went on a spending spree, picking up some of the spendiest real estate in New York City. He spent $83 million and had plans to buy $80 million more but he disappeared in early 2018. Ye had ties to the intelligence unit of the People's Liberation Army according to sources close to him. The properties he bought or expressed interest in included a penthouse he purchased from a top Wall Street banker, and a townhouse that formerly belonged to a billionaire friend of Donald Trump. In May 2017, Ye spent $50.55 million to buy former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond's penthouse at 15 Central Park West. The 5,278 square foot apartment has four bedrooms, a library, and an eat in kitchen. In June 2017, he dropped nearly $33 million on a 4,028 square foot apartment on the 86th floor at 432 Park Avenue. The unit was then put up for rent for $80,000 a month. ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images Ye paid cash for both of these properties. Last December, Ye entered into a contract to buy an $80 million townhouse owned by the NHL's Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola at 12 East 69thStreet. Viola was briefly the nominee for Secretary of the Army. The 20,000 square foot townhouse has its own movie theater. The deal would have set the record for the most expensive townhouse ever sold in New York City at the time, but the deal fell apart in early 2018 at about the same time as Ye went missing. Ye is not the first high profile, wealthy, Chinese person to go missing. Actress Fan Bingbing has been missing since last summer. Casino tycoon Yang Zhuhui went missing in August. Zhou Chengjian, a Chinese billionaire with a net worth of $1.4 billion, went missing on January 6, 2016. Club Med owner Guo Guangchang went missing on December 10, 2015. Ye is reportedly under investigation in China. Ye is the chairman of Shanghai based CEFC China Energy, which has been expanding abroad aggressively in the past several years. It acquired $9 billion worth of shares in Russia's Rosneft energy giant, more than $1 billion in investments in energy companies in the Czech Republic, and more deals in Abu Dhabi, Romania, and Singapore. Ye's company has also purchased pricey real estate in Shanghai. With Ye's whereabouts unknown, his empire is under threat. CEFC has been selling off assets and canceling deals. In November 2017, a former Hong Kong official named Patrick Ho, who was one of Ye's top contacts in the Chinese government was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on allegations of bribing African leaders through a charity that was funded by Ye's CEFC. Ye wasn't named in the indictment. Ho is challenging the charges against him. On news of his disappearance, shares in companies tied to CEFC China Energy plunged on the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen stock exchanges and wiped out $630 million in market value in one hour. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved"

LBG returns to Bryan Park 0 comments The Laidback Golf Tour returned to the Rees Jones designed layout at Bryan Park Players Course today to compete in their final Major of the season. Last year their outing here was marred by cold misty rain and 40 degree temperatures. On Tuesday, Oct. 30, the weather was much better with sunshine and near 70 degree temperature. However, the scores were nearly the same. Last season the course gave up only one round in the 70’s and 16 birdies to the field of 23; while this time the yield was two rounds in the 70s with 13 birdies and one eagle. The course which has hosted the U.S. Amateur in the past is quite a challenge especially the high fluffy rough which devours stray shots. It’s beauty, condition, and hospitable staff make it the perfect venue for a Major event. Fran Hensley continued her solid play as she captured her fifth win of the season and second in a row with a birdie free round of 78. Mike Reynolds who lost to Hensley in their last outing in a play-off trailed by three strokes with two holes to go today. Reynolds beat Hensley by a stroke on each of the last two holes to pull within one at 79 for second place. It was Hensley’s second of the five wins coming without having to go to a play-off to determine the winner. A brand new member Tony Santoro claimed the A Flights third place prize with his round of 80. Tom Simmons who lost in a play-off here last season came out on top of the B Flight today with his 87 finish. It was Simmons second win of the season. Last season’s winner Jim White came up a stroke short today as he tied for second place with David Wilson at 88. White claimed the prize money by a match of back nine totals. Mike Pritchett, playing in only his second tournament of the season led the C Flight with his score of 88. It was Pritchett’s first win as he finished third in his previous outing. The Tours current points leader Randy McCann finished second with a 91. Glenn Hudson walked away from the field today in the D Flight as he picked up his second win of the season with a solid round of 89. Hudson had missed the last eight tournaments due to back and leg pain and shot 108 in his last outing. His solid play and wise decision making came back for him today as he avoided the usual high number holes. Curtis Smith finished second for the fifth time this season with his 98 finish. The Tour will next play at Danville Golf Club Monday Nov. 12 in their last event of the season in which they earn points toward season championship. The tournament will shotgun start at 10am. Entry fee for Tour members is $65 with registration request by Nov. 5 or no later than noon Saturday Nov. 10.

Clearly, it was much more, but to the uninitiated, it was a head-scratching buy. And while big money is busy being exchanged at the actual Art Basel Miami Beach exhibition inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, that doesn't mean this whole Basel-dazzle is reserved solely for the 1%. In fact, Riviera South Beach reports, it is one of the best times for bargain hunters to find not only affordable artwork by someone who may, indeed, become the next Basquiat, but for free events and priceless people watching. The real underground, hipster action takes place where the energy is more electric than the expense account flush, at boutique hotels where burgeoning street artists, sculpturists, performance artists and those who fancy themselves as an amalgam of all of them convene to cocktail, network and show off their talents. Among those hotels is the Riviera South Beach, a contemporary, multi-building, chic stay with modern, colorful rooms - some with truly over the top, must-see decor, rooftop and courtyard pools, Insta-worthy art walls, and buzzy cocktail and Cuban cuisine canteen, Mas Cuba, an oft-Instagrammed artsy outpost of funky, re-purposed art and fab fare. Nearby is the Catalina Hotel, a high energy South Beach landmark with a distinctly retro-mod vibe - think Austin Powers meets South Beach, with two pools, two restaurants, three bars, and ultra-modern rooms. The adjacent Maxine's Bistro & Bar is open 24-hours serving farm fresh food, potent cocktails, and a perfect perch from which to people-watch. Some may consider the Tradewinds, an off the beaten path apartment hotel with full kitchen and stunning, sunny courtyard pool. An ideal address for Art Basel, Tradewinds is uber close to the Convention Center. There are several free must-sees during Art Basel. The first is a live performance piece by Mexican conceptual artist Abraham Cruzvillegas, whose debut performance piece, ""Autoreconstruccion: To insist, to Insist, to Insist,"" will take place twice a day in the Miami Beach Convention Center's brand-new ballroom and features dancer and choreographer Barbara Foulkes attached by a strap to the artist's scrap metal assemblage while musicians do their thing. Another must-see freebie is The Faena Festival running December 3 - 9 at the 3000 block of Collins Avenue, with a slew of public art, performance artists, exhibitions and all sorts of social-media-worthy opportunities to enlighten the masses. This year's theme is ""This is not America,"" which, according to Zoe Luke, curator of Faena Art, ""Addresses America as a concept more than a place, a contested and powerful idea that is greater than the waters and borders that frame it."" The fair has spread beyond Miami Beach thanks to the emergence of Wynwood as the arts district. Here, the streets (and walls) are plastered with art by renowned graffiti artists. An absolute to-do is the free Basel House at the old RC Cola Plant, 550 NW 24th St., where a collection of culture is housed all in one space, from music and vendors to new age art installations, late night DJs, mural tours, live painting, food trucks, and pretty much anything else, running December 7 - 9. Delving a little deeper, but not into people's pockets, is the free exhibition at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum featuring artist Hank Willis Thomas and his nonprofit For Freedoms project, and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collecting handwritten and typed messages from the incarcerated. Further exploration will undoubtedly turn up a slew of other opportunities to be immersed in the arts. Miami Beach circa Art Basel is a dazzling, dizzying, fascinating experience that can be enjoyed by people of all levels of appreciations of art, and most importantly, of all budgets. As the locals like to say, Basel Tov!

1028440,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"November 2, 2018 Torkwase Dyson, a painter whose explorations of visibility, environment, science, and migration have particular resonance at this moment in history, is the fall 2018 visiting artist at the Lunder Institute for American Art. She is also showing a new body of site-specific work in the exhibition Nautical Dusk, on view through Jan. 6, 2019, at the Colby College Museum of Art. During her Lunder Institute tenure, Dyson will lead a series of dialogues, performances, and lectures, including a public convening on Nov. 7 that will highlight her collaborations with Colby students and faculty. The artist Torkwase Dyson with installation Nautical Dusk, 2018. Photo by Gabe Souza courtesy of the Colby Museum of Art. “We are so fortunate to welcome Torkwase Dyson to campus and to benefit from her thoroughly interdisciplinary, inquisitive approach to her work,” said Lee Glazer, director of the Lunder Institute. “She has developed a distinctive language of geometric abstraction through a wide-ranging investigation of space, architecture, history, and scientific discourse, and we are looking forward to the many interactions she will have with our community.” At the invitation of the Museum, the New Jersey-based artist consulted archival materials related to Samuel Osborne (c. 1833–1904) in Colby’s Miller Library. Osborne was born into slavery and migrated from Virginia to Maine in 1865. He worked for the College for more than 30 years, and in 2017 Colby President David A. Greene renamed the presidential residence “Osborne House.” “A notable aspect of Dyson’s practice is embedded in the many ways of considering mobility, space, and geographic conditions through the language of abstraction,” said Daisy Desrosiers, director of programs at the Lunder Institute. “The possibilities of encounters through the institute have provided, for the artist, a space to question how we position ourselves in regards to archival material and how we respond to it as part of an ongoing process of observation.” As a Lunder Institute visiting artist, Dyson is investigating materials in Miller Library’s Special Collections, engaging with Colby faculty and students, and developing new collaborative projects. “I extrapolate from those things to ask phenomenological questions around geography, proximity, transference, clarity, seeing, belonging,” said Dyson. This hybrid platform, which combines research with ongoing reflection and conversation, provides time for the artist to explore intersections with scholars from multiple disciplines. Dyson is on campus from Oct. 31 through Nov. 7, when she will record a series of dialogues with Colby faculty from several different departments, including astronomy and creative writing. A suite of programs in the Museum lobby from 1:30 to 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, organized by the Lunder Institute, will include poetry by Colby students and performances by invited guests, including Dyson’s collaborator, artist Zachary Fabri, and visually scored by Andres L. Hernandez. Dyson, Fabri, and Hernandez comprise the performance collective F/H/D. The afternoon will conclude with an open conversation with the artist, in which Dyson will reflect on Nautical Dusk and the subsequent encounters and discoveries it has generated. In Nautical Dusk, Dyson’s geometric forms are infused with metaphorical associations found in obituaries of Osborne. Written by unnamed white authors, these texts raise questions about authorship, transmission, and self-determination. Curated by Diana Tuite, Katz Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Nautical Dusk features sculptures and paintings that explore these subjects. Dusk, a monumental ramp that visitors are welcome to engage with in a variety of ways, occupies half of the gallery. In 2017-18, its inaugural year, the Lunder Institute hosted artist Theaster Gates and poet Richard Blanco as its first visiting artists. About Torkwase Dyson Torkwase Dyson was born in Chicago, Ill., and spent her developmental years between North Carolina and Mississippi. Traversing these regions helped develop a fundamental dialectic of architecture/infrastructure, geography, and Black spatial liberation. During her years at Tougaloo College, where she majored in sociology and double minored in social work and fine art, she began to examine the poetics of Black history and environmental justice. Over the next 10 years, Dyson traveled to locally and globally strategize with communities of color on ways to attain resource equality. During this time she earned her bachelor’s in fine arts in painting from Virginia Commonwealth University and her master’s in fine arts in painting from Yale School of Art. In 2016 Dyson designed and built Studio South Zero (SSZ), a solar-powered mobile studio where the context of nomadicity became the framework for learning and making art about the environment. It was traveling with SSZ that inspired her experimental project the Wynter-Wells Drawing School for Environmental Liberation, where she explores contemporary theorizations of form, space, architecture, and the infrastructure of extraction economies. Though working through multiple mediums, Dyson describes herself as a painter who uses distilled geometric abstraction to create an idiosyncratic language that is both diagrammatic and expressive. The works are deconstructions of natural and built environments that consider how individuals negotiate and negate various types of systems and spatial order. Dyson’s work has been exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Drawing Center, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran College of Art and Design, Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education, and the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Dyson has been awarded the Nancy Graves Grant for Visual Artists, Visiting Artist grant to the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, the Culture Push Fellowship for Utopian Practices, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center Fellowship, and the FSP/Jerome Fellowship. Dyson’s work has also been supported by Lower Manhattan Cultural Center, the Laundromat Projects, the Green Festival of New York, the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, the Mural Arts Program of Philadelphia, The Kitchen, and the Rebuild Foundation. In 2016 Dyson was elected to the board of the Architecture League of New York as vice president of visual arts and is currently visiting critic at Yale School of Art. She is represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago and Davidson Contemporary in New York. About the Lunder Institute for American Art The Lunder Institute for American Art, established in 2017 through the generosity of Peter and Paula Lunder, supports innovative research, critical inquiry, and creative production aimed at expanding the boundaries of American art and its interpretive communities. Uniquely positioned within an academic museum on a liberal arts campus in Central Maine, the Lunder Institute offers opportunities for visiting artists and scholars to reflect, convene, and work with the Colby community across disciplinary boundaries to ask challenging questions, test new ideas, and produce work that is original, illuminating, and generative."

MUFG said Wednesday that it has hired Christopher Higgins for the role. Higgins will report to Steve Cummings, president and CEO, and serve on the company’s executive committee. He starts on Dec. 10. Higgins most recently served as chief information officer at U.S. Bancorp, where he was in charge of enterprise architecture, application development and testing, among other responsibilities. He joined the $464.6 billion-asset Minneapolis company in 2012 from Bank of America, where he worked for 18 years in information management. In a press release, Cummings praised Higgins as “an ideal fit” for MUFG Americas, the U.S. division of the global banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Tokyo. “His technical expertise and proven track record in leading forward-looking technology and operations initiatives that are customer-focused will be an enormous asset to our team as we evolve our business model,” Cummings said. In his new role, Higgins will replace Chris Perretta, who plans to leave the company by the end of 2018, according to a spokesman. Perretta joined MUFG in April 2016. The announcement comes as MUFG looks to embark on a U.S. expansion, at a time when its parent company is facing a stagnant economy at home. MUFG Union Bank, its $123.8 billion-asset banking unit, has just over 350 branches, mostly along the West Coast, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp."
1015016,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 | Updated: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 1 View comments Patisserie Valerie chairman Luke Johnson's has a noted aversion to the press Patisserie Valerie wasn't allowing journalists to attend today's emergency meeting until a U-turn late yesterday evening. This was the result of a 'misunderstanding', we are assured, rather than chairman Luke Johnson's noted aversion to the press. Journalists in the embattled entrepreneur's company are about as welcome as Sir Philip Green at a #MeToo gathering, which is odd. Until recently, Johnson penned a jaunty newspaper column which took frequent pot-shots at other businesses. Several of his close family, including father Paul and brother Daniel, are also prominent proponents of our trade. Theresa May is right not to back knee-jerk demands for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood. David Cameron came to regret bowing to the mob over ex-Royal Bank of Scotland chief Fred Goodwin's defrocking. Green's ill-deserved gong, awarded by Tony Blair needless to say, serves as a future reminder of how impressionable prime ministers can become spellbound by flashy billionaires. It's best left in place pour encourager les autres. Bob Diamond is to be welcomed as keynote speaker at the Financial Times's US banking forum in New York next week. Since being ousted from Barclays six years ago, Bob, 67, refuses to hide his light under a bushel. His African investment vehicle Atlas Mara is showing steady growth, while last year's acquisition of brokers Panmure Gordon gives him a foothold once more in London. 'There are no second acts in American lives,' F Scott Fitzgerald opined. But then he never met beaming Bob Diamond. Former investment banker Ian Blackford, now the SNP's ample Westminster chief, humbly referred to himself as a 'simple crofter' in the Commons while attacking Philip Hammond's budget. The Conservatives' Greg Hands retorted: 'I had a career in the City and I don't recall him being a simple crofter at that time. 'Maybe that was his codename on his Bloomberg terminal as he was buying and selling financial assets.' Blackford squirmed like a constipated Dowager. The enduring success of British noodle chain Wagamama, which is being bought by The Restaurant Group for £559million, continues to baffle the Japanese. Out east, Wagamama translates as 'spoiled brat'. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

1053951,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"We may be a month away from Art Basel Miami Beach, the contemporary-art mess of tented art fairs and celebrity-studded parties, but big events are already beckoning from every pocket of Greater Miami. So if you’re booking travel plans for December or — more impressive — you’re making a day-by-day schedule, you’re in luck: We have the early word on Art Basel week’s five buzziest gatherings. But first, the obvious: The granddaddy art fair Art Basel Miami Beach returns Dec. 6-9 to the Miami Beach Convention Center (1901 Convention Center Drive) with 268 galleries from 34 countries. Some 20-odd satellite art fairs will also be competing for your Basel bucks. Last year, a Kanye West bounce house visited Wynwood. A pop-up Museum of Ice Cream with environmentally unfriendly sprinkles lured South Florida’s candy fiends, including this reporter. But this year belongs to British street-art rascal Banksy and interactive art tech. Here are the Art Basel events vying to become your new favorite Instagram obsessions. Opens Nov. 15 at 736 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; $17-$24; Artechouse.com Billing itself as a “digital art immersion” exhibit, Artechouse (pronounced “art-tech-house”) is like a holodeck from “Star Trek.” Visitors can touch, draw on and move around art elements inside 10 interactive rooms covered in dancing digital projections. This 15,000-square-foot permanent art space will open to the public Nov. 15, two weeks ahead of Art Basel, with the exhibit “XYZT Abstract Landscapes” by French digital artists Adrien M and Claire B. Their installations include “Kinetic Sand,” in which users push grains of sand on a touchscreen; and “Field of Vectors,” digital “grass” that visitors can manipulate with their feet. Through Dec. 9 at Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; free; Frost.FIU.edu Here’s the most glaring statistic buried amid the many incarceration letters, poems, essays and notes wallpapering the Frost’s art gallery: 2.2 million people sit in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500 percent increase since the late 1970s, according to the nonprofit advocacy center the Sentencing Project. The letters come from artist Hank Willis Thomas (and his nonprofit For Freedoms project) and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collected hundreds of inmates’ handwritten and typed messages on display. Opens Dec. 1 at Magic City Studios, 6301 NE Fourth Ave., Miami; $35.99-$49.99; BanksyExhibit.com Loyal followers of Banksy’s shenanigans will remember his stance on charging fans to see his art. (He flat out refuses, which is why his stenciled-graffiti works are all on public walls.) So it should come as no surprise that this touring show of 80 Banksy paintings, sculptures, screen prints and early-career photographs wasn’t exactly authorized by the British icon. The globetrotting exhibit instead comes from Steve Lazarides, the elusive street artist’s former agent, who tapped private collectors to loan out their Banksy originals. Miss it during Art Basel week? You’ll have time: The show will close Feb. 28. Dec. 5-9 at Art Miami, 1 Miami Herald Plaza, NE 14th St., Miami; $35-$275; 305-517-7977 or ArtMiami.com Forget leaping into pools full of multicolored plastic sprinkles at the Museum of Ice Cream: Artist Peter Anton has been building towering odes to chocolate and candy for years. During Art Basel 2012, Anton debuted “Sugar and Gomorrah,” a theme park-style attraction allowing visitors to ride a roller coaster through a maze of sugary sculptures, nude models and the faux ruins of a destroyed city. Anton’s newest palate-teasing monument to sweets is “Choco Tower,” a 10-foot-tall stack of five chocolate bonbons, with two chocolates half eaten. The 1,000-pound sculpture will appear in the Galerie von Braunbehrens’ booth at Art Miami. 8 p.m. Dec. 7-8 at Adrienne Arsht Center, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; $42.52-$213.72; 305-949-6722 or ArshtCenter.org A ballet starring prima ballerina Diana Vishneva that will premiere during Art Basel week, “Sleeping Beauty Dreams” is a dance-meets-art twist on the classic fairy tale. The production will feature ballet dancers onstage performing alongside digital avatars to a soundtrack from Dutch electronica composers Noisia. pvalys@southflorida.com or 954-356-4364"

1020357,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Become a supportervia PressPatron Lake Hayes is a small lake in the Wakatipu Basin in Central Otago, in New Zealand's South Island. It is located close to the towns of Arrowtown and Queenstown. Photo: Bernard Spragg David Williams is Newsroom's South Island correspondent and investigative writer. environment Otago’s regional council stands accused of rubberstamping non-notified water consents for a new hotel planned near Queenstown without adequately considering the effects on a nearby scenic lake. David Williams reports. After years of being lobbied to increase its efforts in Queenstown, last year the Otago Regional Council got the message. It stood accused of dragging its feet on multiple issues, including public transport, wilding pine control and water monitoring, while squirrelling money away for a new Dunedin headquarters. There was fighting talk about creating a unitary authority. The pressure told and the floodgates of ratepayer money opened. The council agreed to re-open a council office in Queenstown and subsidise public transport in the Wakatipu Basin. Cash was splashed on water, too, with $100,000 for research on lake snow and a promise to work with communities on lake restoration work, including Lake Hayes, near Arrowtown, one of the country’s most photographed lakes. This year, the council announced a decade-long plan to spend millions more on water monitoring, including installing a buoy at Lake Hayes. That delighted the Friends of Lake Hayes Society, a group that has been pushing for a buoy for years. But problems persist. Over the previous year, algal blooms caused the lake to be closed to swimmers and elevated E.coli levels were discovered. In June last year, dead trout were found in Mill Creek, Lake Hayes’ main tributary. In August, the Otago Regional Council’s technical committee discussed three possible ways – flushing, capping and destratification, according to the Otago Daily Times – to improve Lake Hayes. Now, there’s concern the momentum towards an environmental clean-up will be lost, or reversed, because of a large hotel planned on the banks of Mill Creek. Quiet consideration As regional councillors were publicly discussing ways to clean up the lake, the council’s staff were quietly considering consents for a proposed 380-room hotel, next to Arrowtown’s Millbrook Resort, in an area known as Waterfall Park. Developer Winton Group – through subsidiary Waterfall Park Developments Ltd – dubs Waterfall Park a forgotten treasure, home to a 30-metre waterfall that’s out of public view. The company wants to build a four-plus-star hotel on the site in four blocks. The complex will also feature two restaurants, a bar, conference centre, wedding chapel and wellness centre. Heritage buildings at the adjacent Ayrburn Farm, settled by Scotsman William Paterson in 1862, will be restored and repurposed. (Waterfall Park Development Ltd has asked the council to re-zone a parcel of land next to the planned hotel so it can build up to 200 houses. Other Winton Group projects in Queenstown include Bridesdale Farm, a subdivision fast-tracked by the local council, and the high-end Lake’s Edge subdivision, adjoining the Hilton Queenstown Resort & Spa complex.) Last month, the regional council approved various work to be done on Mill Creek. The consents weren’t publicly notified because the council assessed the effects of the work as minor. Council chief executive Sarah Gardner is quick to point out that the Department of Conservation (DOC) – which has statutory responsibilities for native aquatic species – gave written, unconditional approval to the consents. (This reliance on DOC as an environmental backstop mirrors another controversial consent approval, for the extension of a Queenstown skifield, that is now subject to a judicial review.) Fish and Game and iwi demanded conditions, including undertaking the work outside of fish spawning. The work approved at Waterfall Park includes widening, deepening and re-shaping the creek, creating ponds through a series of boulder weirs. Flood-protection walls will be built, as well as building seven bridges and two culverts. Winton Group, a company associated with Chris and Michaela Meehan, plans sediment and erosion controls and will temporarily divert the creek during widening work. Revegetation and ecological work is also planned. (Winton Group couldn’t be reached for comment.) The regional council’s own analysis shows Mill Creek and Lake Hayes already exceed some limits or targets for water quality, such as phosphate, turbidity and total nitrogen. For other contaminants, such as nitrate and E.coli, there’s little or no headroom for the water bodies to take more. If Lake Hayes’ poor state is to be reversed, contaminants from within its catchment, which starts on the slopes of Coronet Peak, need to be reduced. The main culprit for adding nitrates and phosphorus to the lake is Mill Creek. Increasing development, population growth and land-use intensification won’t help – especially as stormwater from Waterfall Park’s hotel complex will flow into the creek and, eventually, Lake Hayes. “We believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” – Andrew Davis Friends of Lake Hayes Society committee member Andrew Davis, who works for a global investment management firm, accuses the regional council of being cavalier by granting non-notified consents in a sensitive environment. Speaking personally and not on behalf of the committee, he says: “Lake Hayes is one the region’s most precious resources, we need our regulators to start affording the lake the protection it rightly deserves.” Davis points to problems earlier this year with stormwater runoff at Wanaka subdivisions Northlake (another Winton Group development) and Hikuwai as a sign that new developments are struggling to prevent sediment run-off. The district’s chief engineer, Ulrich Glasner, told the Otago Daily Times in May the performance of some stormwater infrastructure, particularly in new developments, did not meet the council’s expectations. Davis tells Newsroom: “With the current Waterfall Park development we believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” Council boss Gardner says the effects of the Waterfall Park proposal were assessed as minimal. “It is correct that if sediment enters Mill Creek, the receiving water body will be Lake Hayes.” Public notification of consents isn’t mandatory, she says, and the effects on the Friends of Lake Hayes “from the specific activities considered” were assessed to be less than minor. As the effects of the applications were considered “minimal”, Gardner says further assessment of the impact on Lake Hayes wasn’t required. She adds: “We have not assessed the effects of all activities that may be undertaken in the development.” Increased pollution in Lake Hayes could lead to more frequent closures for recreational activities and increase the cost of restoration efforts, which already seem likely to run into the millions of dollars. Inevitably, the clean-up costs will largely fall on the local community. Friends of Lake Hayes has made a submission to Queenstown’s district council, which is considering Winton Group’s resource consent for the hotel development. Regional councils deal with environmental-based consents, such as those affecting air and water, while district councils manage land-based subdivisions and developments. Waterfall Park Developments originally lodged consents jointly to both councils, asking them to be publicly notified and heard together. The regional council (ORC) “staff recommending report”, written on August 30, notes, however: “On advice from the original job manager, the two consent processes were unbundled as it was considered that the ORC consents could be processed on a non-notified basis.” To the district council, the society challenges the developer’s claims that the in-stream work, stretching for hundreds of metres of Mill Creek, will have a less than minor effect on the immediate environment and downstream. (The actual channel works extend for about 135m.) During construction, the submission says, there’ll be increased sediment and nutrient discharges into Lake Hayes. “We are of the view that in spite of all the assurances provided by the applicant there is a significant risk that designs and structures may not perform to design when tested by the very powerful and unpredictable natural forces that are applied during high-intensity rainfall events.” (An ecological peer review, by 4Sight Consulting, says with appropriate controls, and if best practice is followed, sediment discharges from construction work “can be expected to be minimised”.) Vulnerable fish Some of those most affected by the Mill Creek works are native galaxiid fish, koaro, that live in Lake Hayes but spawn in Mill Creek. Slowing the water flow and creating pleasing-looking pools will help trout – something Fish and Game endorses. But the koaro, classified as “at-risk, declining”, prefers fast-flowing riffles. The developer’s ecological expert said the potential effects on native fish are considered to be minor. DOC’s Wakatipu operations manager Geoff Owen tells Newsroom the department’s approval was given on the basis that the works would improve the outlook for koaro in the long term. That would be done through native riparian plantings, culverts allowing for fish passage, weed control and a condition to avoid works in the stream during the koaro spawning period. “DOC believes the application as it stands would result in habitat that would be better for native fish,” Owen says. However, an ecological peer review of the hotel proposal provided to regional and district councils seems to contradict that view. The 4Sight Consulting report, completed in August, says while the works are unlikely to have a significant effect on koaro, the loss of preferred habitats “have not been adequately considered by the application”. “The installation of three of the six proposed aesthetic weirs will ... result in the loss of areas of preferred instream habitat for the ‘at risk’ koaro and may impact potential spawning habitats. The weirs will result in additional habitat for brown trout, a predator of koaro.” To offset the habitat loss, the 4Sight report says a riparian planting plan should consider enhancing the remaining habitats preferred by the fish. (Regional council boss Gardner says the “localised impacts” of habitat loss will be mitigated and monitored by consent conditions. Some koaro habitat will be enhanced and protected through activities like riparian planting.) Newsroom asked the department to comment on this apparent contradiction but no reply was received by publication deadline. In August, Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage introduced an amendment bill to Parliament aimed at better protecting indigenous freshwater fish, most of which are found nowhere else in the world. Acknowledged problems with protecting threatened, endangered and vulnerable fish species include water management by regional councils and council enforcement over habitat destruction.

Numerous scientific studies conclude that keys to healthy aging include keeping one’s mind active, social engagement and feeling useful. Osher made those three attributes a requirement for financial support to create Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes across the entire United States. OLLI at Granite State College has been a part of healthy aging for thousands of New Hampshire seniors since its inception in 2004 thanks, in large part to Bernard Osher. Osher, born and raised in Biddeford, Maine, founded the Bernard Osher Foundation in 1977 to support four particular interests – post-secondary scholarships, integrative medicine programs, arts and educational organizations and lifelong learning institutes for “seasoned adults.” Offering grants to colleges and universities to support creation of Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the Osher Foundation’s guidelines outline 17 topic areas for the courses offered. This guarantees mental stimulation and assures there will be something of interest for all adult learners. Guidelines also call for significant volunteer support from the membership. While this does keep costs reasonable, the primary motivation for this requirement is to engage the senior population which may suffer from post-retirement “what am I going to do with my life now?” syndrome. Volunteers are responsible for the curriculum, for planning and executing all events, for teaching classes and for supporting the administration of the program overall. The importance of their work is easy to define: no volunteers means no OLLI. Social engagement is evident at any OLLI class or function as strangers come together to pursue a common interest and find the joy of interacting with like-minded peers. What does that mean – are all OLLI members of the same faith ... or political persuasion ... or economic background? Oh my, no! The shared experiences of OLLI members come from: ■being raised in the ’40s and ’50s with Lassie, the Beaver, the Andersons and Howdy Doody; ■living through the ’60s, perhaps as a full-fledged hippie, a member of the armed services or a civil rights activist; ■raising families and building careers through the ’70s and ’80s, and ultimately; ■retiring or planning for it in the new millennium. And the wide variety of personal experiences while navigating those common periods contribute to the richness of the dialog as OLLI members share where they’ve come from and how they live this next chapter of their lives. In OLLI, social engagement is not synonymous with party-going. It is all about that sharing – sometimes it’s the quiet collegial activity of planning a program or editing a catalog, sometimes it’s a small group getting together for coffee and talking about the most interesting souvenir they collected while traveling. Sometimes it’s meeting face to face over a Scrabble board instead of the more impersonal Words with Friends computer game. And for the party animals, well, yes, there are also parties! OLLI will be represented at the upcoming Active Aging program sponsored by the Concord Monitor and Monadnock Transcript-Ledger on Tuesday at the Bektash Shrine Center.

1015016,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 17:00 EST, 24 October 2018 | Updated: 17:01 EST, 24 October 2018 1 View comments When Vittorio Colao stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was treated like an all-conquering hero. But investors keeping an eye on the vanishing Vodafone share price and shrinking stock market value might be asking different questions of his successor Nick Read. In recent days, the shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1 billion, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100. n recent days, Vodafone's shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1bn, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100 It is hard to remember that Vodafone was Britain's flagship tech group and a pioneer in the fast-growing telecoms and data markets in the Japan and the United States. Both stakes have been discarded. The shareholding in Verizon Wireless was sold for a phenomenal £100 billion. In effect, the empire built by the excellent Sir Chris Gent was dismembered, leaving behind a group which is a shadow of its former self. A strategy of expanding into emerging markets, such as India, has proved disappointing because of intense competition. It is hard to think that digging deeper into low-growth Europe, by acquiring Liberty Global's networks, can ever pay off. Getting a good deal from America's 'cable cowboy' John Malone was never going to happen. Colao and his predecessor Arun Sarin were under constant pressure from shareholders to de-clutter and release value from the Verizon Wireless stakes. But assets were relinquished in advanced Western economies just at the moment that the smartphone and data revolution took off. Alex Brummer says when Vittorio Colao (pictured) stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was 'treated like an all-conquering hero' In 2006, Vodafone sold its Japanese offshoot to tech investor Softbank for £8.9 billion. A decade on and Softbank is on the verge of sponsoring Japan's biggest ever initial public offering in a deal for the former Vodafone unit expected to raise up to £20billion. Being a minority holder in Verizon Wireless was never a comfortable place to be. Sarin did well to avoid a quick sale and create the value which Colao cashed in. But it was a latecomer to data. The value which might have been created by hanging on or maintaining a smaller stake in Verizon was sacrificed for immediate cash. Shareholders (including this writer) received a cash bonus. But there are serious questions to be asked as to how a high-growth entity allowed itself to become a sub-performing utility. Staley resistance The Vodafone experience suggests that Jes Staley is right to resist the attentions of corporate vampire Edward Bramson's assault on Barclays' investment banking. It is easy to show that the returns on its credit cards is far superior to that from M&A. But it is a meaningless comparison. Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era. Brummer says: 'Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era' Lingering costs of the past are still there, the latest being a £1.4 billion fine from the US Department of Justice for the mis-selling of mortgage securities. It seems only yesterday that a very senior Barclays executive was explaining to me that its portfolio of sub-prime mortgages were a higher grade than those of other banks. Barclays deserves credit for defending the performance of the investment bank rather than giving in to bullies. A much better performance in equity trading drove the investment bank performance in the third quarter when Barclays was the third-biggest player in global debt markets and involved in major M&A such as the high-profile Michael Kors acquisition of Versace. As the UK heads towards Brexit the importance of Britain maintaining a strong presence in American-dominated investment banking is enormously important. Bramson is better at taking on the weak. Hidden treasure Should there be any doubt about the importance of Barclays and financial services to the UK economy, it is worth looking at new data today from the industry's advocacy group CityUK. It shows the UK to be the world's leading exporter of financial services in 2017 with a surplus of £68 billionn – that's equal to the next three contenders combined. Small wonder that French president Emmanuel Macron wants a share of the after-Brexit business. Best of luck with that. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

1022024,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"October 24, 2018 Programs supported by gift will create pipeline for the next generation of scientific leaders Colby College has received a major contribution to support programs that will prepare the next generation of innovators in the sciences through funded experiences at renowned partner institutions on the leading edge of discovery. The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Cresci Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. Rick McVey Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products, and continued robust Open Trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth, and reached a record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million, was up 6% compared to Q3 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million, and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12%, including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson yards. We expect to move in to our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes both saw rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatilities fell, and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads, and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions has been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong, and position the company well for future growth. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter, and was up 58% to a year record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion, also up 58%. Open Trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price-makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through Open Trading, and over 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transactions costs through Open Trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our product and geographic diversification. Our U.S. high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior, leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year, and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam, and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are underway to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22%, with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on the system, representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Tony DeLise Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year. A slight increase in estimated market share accounts for the uplift in trading volume as U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated U.S. high-grade market share is up one percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets, and U.S. high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains was the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volume, 27% growth in high-yield volume, and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. The 11% increase in trading volume resulted in 5% uplift in commissions. New data contracts accounted for the $800,000 increase in information services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and we customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter, and 21.6% year-to-date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range, and now expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years of maturity and higher yields caused a reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, U.S. high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially, and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade size bucket. Our Other Credit category's fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. So percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter, and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and tradeshow spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses was 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. Our full-year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30th were $446 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $15 million, and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $178 million. Based on these results, our Board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Rick McVey Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth in estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum; including high-yield, emerging markets, and Open Trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months provided a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Hey, good morning, guys. Rick McVey Good morning, Patrick. Tony DeLise Morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market forum was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps from the efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Rick McVey Sure. I think this is a continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead Axess in the system and identity offsetting interest in that trade, they could do so with any trade size and have the opportunity to work up trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols in newly issued bonds that would introduce faster means of execution for highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trade sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking to add around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period-end employee count, and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter-to-quarter, so should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual give what the volume environment looked like during the quarter? Tony DeLise Yes, so Patrick, two things in there on the headcount, and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefit. On the headcount, we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have start days [ph] in the fourth quarter, so we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit we don't know what will happen with attrition, but we are sitting on 15 additional add. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was just a slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits. It was around a $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower. The cash bonus accrual is formulaic; it is tied to operating performance. And quarter-to-quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you should see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes Q2 to Q3, you saw pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Rich Repetto Yes, good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony. Rick McVey Good morning, Rich. Rich Repetto And congrats on the uptick in the Open Trading percentage, I guess the first question is on Open Trading. And it seems like quarter-to-quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in there, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield. The others went up by like a percent or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter, from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove that big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in Open Trading? Rick McVey Yes, a couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of Open Trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that Open Trading is providing the highest value in less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield, that we've just seen better take-up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way and reduce transactions costs and in a less liquid market, like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Rich Repetto Thanks, Rick. A follow-up on Open Trading is, I would assume the ETFs -- well, just some comments on auto ex [ph] as well, just the trend there. If Open Trading pick up I assume the auto ex and the drivers -- one of the drives is ETFs, that you would see auto ex also increasing? Rick McVey Yes, I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right at auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you all know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on, to low-touch, and now even moving into no-touch, where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they're able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfection willing to auto-execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade. It's really about do the price responses come back to meet the clients' preset expectations. And if they do they're willing to auto-execute those trades. Rich Repetto Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q, and I think these are from your comments that July and August were a different story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think, even more volatility in October. And you may have covered this, but if you did I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October. But can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility, like September, October. Rick McVey Well, October, if you look at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield, very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months. And September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall. But we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October, and the product mix will drive the fee capture. Rich Repetto Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick McVey Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto ex, but maybe more so on the Composite+ product, really just want to updated thoughts on the future of Composite+ and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facility some of these auto ex functionalities being built into the buy side, but are there also other revenue generating opportunities for Composite+ as well? Rick McVey Sure, happy to take that one. No, we're really pleased to see both dealer, investor, clients embracing Composite Price Plus, which is a real-time mid-market now in about 20,000 global securities. So, incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products; it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that, and the client take-up around Composite Price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto-execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients the more they can use auto execution, so it does tie in to the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking streaming price protocols, and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices or RFQ as we are looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Rick McVey Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices, and so the technology here. It's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And to date, institutional investors have stuck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up, I do think it's possible that streaming prices especially to more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency. And when the market is ready to go in that direction then we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler Hey, guys. Good morning. Rick McVey Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler I want to go back to a question earlier on high yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high yield open trading has really accelerated in the last couple of quarters. I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters; previously, it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETF, I just want to understand is are the ETF market makers what has driven the vast majority that acceleration or there are other factors? Rick McVey There are other factors as a key ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high yield trading overall and open trading adoptions specifically from one only investment managers. And a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high yield trading environment which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in funds flow. So I think it's a combination of adoption by not only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler Okay, yes, make sense, Rick. And then on the some of the discussions around new functionality trend that you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process, when should we expect to actually see you roll out that functionality and talk about kind of the discussions the consulting you are doing with the buy side trading desks as you work on those developments? Tony DeLise Yes, there is no set timetable like anything that we do. We are out talking to both dealer and investor clients to see if we could add value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we are at mid-stream on those conversations. And depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around a faster, more active protocol for new issue trading, we will be ready to roll it out. So there is no set timetable, but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open. Chris Allen Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we have been seeing lately in September, October, I'm wondering if there is any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets in Eurobonds? Obviously, Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in periods and you know, it's has been a little bit flatter. And looking at September to the summer period, so any commentary there would be helpful? Rick McVey So Chris, you are looking for some comments on October or for the third quarter? Chris Shutler Yes, just in terms of I mean you kind of noted that things picked up in the back-half of September continuing into October, something like more of those comments are more focused on high grade and high yield. So just wondering how the other buckets are trending as well? Rick McVey You saw from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets in Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think that one thing that points to -- this is more particularly for the emerging market than Eurobonds right now, market volumes are still struggling. So even we gave some commentary that October market volumes for U.S. investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one it's while healthier than the third quarter, you are not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Tony DeLise On the last one, Chris, euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from tracks and others sources, euros look to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for U.S. high grade and U.S. yield. Chris Allen Got it, and just from an overall perspective you are seeing changes in client behavior at all? Or it's just the environment has got a little bit better and trading activities are kind of picking up? Just trying to think about this could be treated like we saw on the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming and participating maybe a little bit quieter in these periods? Rick McVey I would separate the two but the clearly the broad based gains that we are seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products this is shaping up to be one of our strongest years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual for fact it's being driven more by EM, high yield and euros this year than it is in high grade, but even high grade up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively, the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we have ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trading behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment. And we obviously can't control that. It ebbs and flows with various factors. And it hit the trough for the year in July and August and then September and October we are seeing it rebound. It looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So, I would separate those two factors. Tony DeLise Hey, you know, jumping again on this particular point, but look these are longer term trends across all the products where we have more client engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading at the bigger piece across all of our core products. Open trading is the bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products. That's up hundred clients just in the past year. So it's just the network and the engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen Makes sense. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell Hey, thanks. So we have kind of stable pricing in high grade. And Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So appreciate the update here on October volumes, but are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten? And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightened duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter or next year? Tony DeLise Yes. So, Jeremy, it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We have been -- and the thing that we look at more is around years of maturity and where absolute yields are. But we are not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just be investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four product is very consistent with the third quarter. And as Rick, pointed before that you may see a mix of multiple products. So one product rolling faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture, but the individual product level notes no change. Jeremy Campbell Got it, thanks, and then just setting back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted about 150 bips of year-over-year expansion on -- in high-grade market share. I guess kind of going forward, you know, what types of shares gains should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the outside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Tony DeLise You know, it's a little bit of both, I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility that would be helpful to our share gains and as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where when new issues are extremely active there is a slice of trace that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of. So the new issue market has that impact, but we're playing a long game. We take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be five or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit and these are very large markets. We have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell Got it. And then one quick one; and I apologize if I missed this, but Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year is going to be 21 to 22, any sense of what we should expect into '19? Tony DeLise Yes, sure Jeremy, so we hadn't completed the budget process yet for 2019, so we're not prepared at least today to give you definitive range, but that said I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you look to 2018, and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate would be right around 24%. That's really the jumping off point for 2019. But the difficult part is -- it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this that sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefits there would be around $2 million. So jumping off point -- and again, budget's not complete, jumping off point 24%, rolling some excess tax benefits. So, to be something less than 24%, but when we get to this January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that -- I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses. You talked about some headcount that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we looked at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months. Tony DeLise Sure, Daniel, I study on the expenses, I mean, this is -- we are still investing for the future. We are -- you know, we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There's some regulatory related spend as well -- and just on the tax rate, you know, we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January, but you know, again thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9% and then if you look longer term the past five years, the compound annual growth rate has also been about 9% and we're going to continue -- we had plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion in our infrastructure. I suggest taking history into account and at least -- from modeling out sort of early models on 2019, will give more color in January, but that 9% that's where we've been and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Dan Fannon Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million and I appreciate the commentary on October and you know, the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here in -- for the last several quarters, but I guess, as we think about a higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Tony DeLise Dan, if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate node activity matters, but if you take those all aside and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yes, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture and I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every one percentage point, change in yield across the yield curve -- you know, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So again if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture, but there are -- there's so many things that influence fee capture around, years of maturity, trade size, dealer mix. There's just a lot that goes into the mix on U.S. high-grade. Dan Fannon Got it, thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Rich Repetto Yes, thanks, guys, my question has been asked and answered, thank you. Tony DeLise Thank you. Operator Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I'd like to turn the call over back to Mr. Rick McVey. End of Q&A Rick McVey Thank you very much for joining us this morning and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This does conclude today's program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
1096862,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Third Quarter Financial Highlights* *All comparisons versus third quarter 2017. NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. ""Strong market share gains across our core products and increased Open Trading activity led to a solid increase in trading volume in the third quarter in spite of quiet credit trading conditions,"" said Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. ""Product diversification is evident in the results with a record 9.2% estimated high-yield market share, 22% year-on-year increase in emerging market trading volume and a 28% increase in Eurobond volumes. We are encouraged by the improvement in market conditions for credit trading that we started to see in September."" Third Quarter Results Total revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased 6.1% to $101.4 million, compared to $95.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Operating income was $46.4 million, compared to $46.6 million for the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of 0.5%. Operating margin was 45.8%, compared to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $38.6 million, or $1.02 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $34.1 million, or $0.90 per share, for the third quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the third quarter of 2018 increased 4.9% to $90.5 million, compared to $86.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees were $66.0 million on total trading volume of $385.5 billion for the third quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $65.9 million on total trading volume of $346.8 billion for the third quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.5% for the third quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.2% for the third quarter of 2017. All other revenue increased 17.4% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, principally due to higher information services revenue of $0.8 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.8 million. Total expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased 12.4% to $55.0 million, compared to $48.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $1.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.6 million, marketing and advertising expenses of $0.9 million, technology and communication costs of $0.8 million and employee compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, mainly due to an increase in headcount. Occupancy costs in the third quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.9 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.04. Other income increased to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 due to a $0.7 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 19.3%, compared to 27.7% for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $0.4 million reduction to the provisional tax charge recorded in 2017 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The third quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $3.8 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on November 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,500 shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.1 million. Balance Sheet Data As of September 30, 2018, total assets were $646.1 million and included $446.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2018 was $578.6 million. Guidance for 2018 The Company is updating its full year 2018 overall effective tax rate guidance to a range of 21.0% to 22.0%, down from the previous guidance of 23.0% to 25.0%. The reduction is primarily due to excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that were exercised during 2018. The Company expects that full year 2018 expenses will be near the low-end of the $220.0 million to $232.0 million guidance range. The expense guidance includes duplicate occupancy costs of approximately $7.0 million for the Company’s new corporate offices in New York during the build-out phase. The Company also expects that full year 2018 capital expenditures will be near the high-end of the $43.0 million to $50.0 million guidance range. The capital expenditure guidance includes approximately $26.0 million of buildout costs for the new corporate offices.

MarketAxess Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MKTX)Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOct. 24, 2018, 10:00 a.m. ET Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. David Cresci -- Investor Relations Manager Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2018 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products and continued robust open trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3, 2017. Our estimated US high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth and reached the record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million was up 6% compared to Q3, 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12% including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson Yards. We expect to move into our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes, both saw a rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatility fell and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall, trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions have been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong and position the company well for future growth . Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter and was up 58% to a near record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion also up 58%. Open trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 open trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through open trading and over a 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transaction costs for open trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a US high-grade transaction through open trading protocols. Importantly, open trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our products and geographic diversification. Our US high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are under way to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22% with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on this system representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rick . Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. US high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, a slight increase in estimated market share accounted for the uplift in trading volume as US high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated US high-grade market share is up 1 percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes or other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets in US high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains were the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volumes, 27% growth in high yield volume and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated US high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated US high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. A 11% increase in trading volume resulted in a 5% uplift in commissions. New data contract accounted for the $800,000 increase in Information Services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and new customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter and 21.6% year to date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range and now expect the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years to maturity and higher yields caused the reduction in our US high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, US high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in these trade size bucket. Our other credit category fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. The percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and trade show spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses were 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure. Our full year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30 were $446 million compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we had a quarterly cash dividend of $16 million and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-months free cash flow was a record $178 million. Based on these results, our board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth and estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum, including high yield, emerging markets and open trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months, provides a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Hey, good morning guys. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Patrick. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market form was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps, some the -- efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I think this is the continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead access in the system and identify offsetting interest in that trade. They can do so with any trade size and have the opportunity work on trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols, in newly issued bonds that we would introduce faster means of execution for a highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trades sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking at around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period end employee count and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter to quarter. So, should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual given what the volume might look like during the quarter? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Patrick, two things in there on the headcount and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefits. And the headcount we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of -- at the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have to start take in the fourth quarter. So we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit, we don't know what's going to -- what will happen with the attrition but we are sitting on 15 additional adds. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was as the slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits, it was around $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower, the cash bonus accrual is the formula getting tied to operating performance and quarter to quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you can see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes, Q2 to Q3, you saw a pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at the -- look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Yeah, good morning, Rick, good morning, Tony. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Rich. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And congrats on the uptick in the open trading percentage. I guess the first question is on open trading and it seems like quarter to quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in here, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield, the others very -- went up by like a 1% or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in open trading? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of open trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that open trading is providing the highest value and less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield that we've just seen better take up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way to reduce transaction costs in a less liquid market like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is, we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in the high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading, you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And just a fallow up here, thanks, Rick. A follow up open trading is, I would assume the ETFs just some comments on auto-ex as well, just the trend there. If open tradings pickup, I assume the auto-ex and the drivers, one of the drivers of ETFs that you would see auto-ex also increasing? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right about auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you well know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on to low-touch and now even moving into no-touch. Where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they are able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfectly willing to auto execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy-side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade, it's really about do the price responses comeback to meet the clients' preset expectations and as they do, they're willing to auto execute those trades. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q and I think these are from your comments that the July and August were a different tale story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think even more volatility in October, and you may have covered this, but if you did, I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October, but can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility like September, October? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, well, October if you looked at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield look very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months and September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall, but we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October and the product mix will really drive the fee capture. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto-ex, but maybe more so on the composite plus product. Really just want to get updated thoughts on the future of composite plus and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facilitate some of these auto-ex functionalities been built into the buy-side. But are there also other revenue generating opportunities for composite plus as well? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Happy to take that one. We're really pleased to see both dealer and investor clients embracing composite price plus, which is a real-time mid market now on about 20,000 global credit securities. So incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products, it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that. And the client take up around composite price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients, the more they can use auto execution. So, it does tie into the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking about streaming price protocols and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and your views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices versus RFQ as you're looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices. So the technology series, it's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And today institutional investors have struck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up. I do think it's possible that streaming prices, especially at the more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency when the market is ready to go in that direction and we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Hey guys, good morning. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst I wanted to go back to a question earlier on high-yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high-yield open trading is really accelerated in last couple of quarters, I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters, previously it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETFs, so I just want to understand is -- are the ETF market makers, what has driven the vast majority of that acceleration or are there other factors? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There are other factors, I think ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy-side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high-yield trading overall and open trading adoption specifically from long-only investment managers. And, a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high-yield trading environment, which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high-yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in fund flows. So I think it's a combination of adoption by long-only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay, it makes sense, Rick. And then on the -- assume the discussion around new functionality agenda, you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process. When should we expect to actually see you rollout that functionality? And just talk about kind of the discussions, the consulting you're doing with the buy-side trading desks as you work on those developments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, there is no set timetable like anything that we do, we're out talking to both dealer, investor clients to see if we could add more value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we're in midstream on those conversations and depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around faster, more active protocol for newly issued training, we'll be ready to roll it out. So there's no set timetable but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open . Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Morning guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we've been seeing lately on September-October. Just (ph) any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets and Eurobonds, obviously Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in recent periods and EM has been a little bit flatter looking at September to the summer period. So any commentary there would be helpful. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Chris, you're looking for some comments on October or what's the third quarter? Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Yeah, just in terms of when you kind of noted the things picked up in the back half of September, continuing to October, but it sounds like more of those comments are more focused on high-grade and invest in -- high yield. Just wondering how the other buckets are trading as well. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You saw it from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets and Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down, we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think the one thing that I would point to and this is more particular from emerging markets and Eurobonds right now. Market volumes are still struggling. So even -- we gave some commentary that October market volumes for US investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one while it's healthier than the third quarter, you're not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Actually, on the last one, Chris, Euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from traction other sources Euros looked to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for US high-grade and US high-yield. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Got it. I guess just from an overall perspective, you're seeing changes in client behavior or it's just the environments got a little bit better and trade activities kind of picking up. I'm just trying to think about this could be a period like we saw in the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming in, new participants have maybe have been little bit quieter on these periods? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd separate the two, but clearly the broad based gains that we're seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products, this is shaping up to be one of our strongest year ever -- years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual of the fact that it's being driven more by EM, high-yield and Euros this year than it is in high-grade, but even high-grade is up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we've ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trade behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment that we obviously can't control that, it ebbs and flows with various factors. And if it hits the trough for the year in July and August, and September, and October, we would see a rebound, it looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So I would separate those two factors. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer I hate to keep on jump again on this particular point. But -- look, these are longer-term trends across all the products where we have more clients engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading, the bigger piece across all of our core products, open trading to bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients, and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products, that's up the 100 clients just in the past year. So just see the network and engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Thanks guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks. So we've kind of stable pricing in high-grade, and Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So, appreciate the update here on October volumes. But are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten. And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightening duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter and next year? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jeremy, you know it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We've been -- and the thing that we look at more as around years to maturity and what absolute yields are, we're not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just the investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four products is very consistent with the third quarter. And Rick pointed out before that you may see a mix among the products or one product growing faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture but the individual product level, no change. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it, thanks. Let me just stepping back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted at about 150 bps of year-over-year expansion in high-grade market share. I guess on a go-forward, what types of share gains, would we -- should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the upside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's a little bit above, which I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility, that would be helpful to our share gains. And as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where new issues are extremely active. There is a slice of TRACE that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of, so the new issued market has that impact. But you know we're playing the long game, we take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be in 5 or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit. And these are very large markets, we have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. And then just one quick one, and apologies if I missed this. But Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year going to be 21% to 22%. Any sense of what we should expect into '19? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Jeremy. We haven't completed the budget process yet for 2019. So we're not prepared at least today to give you a definitive range. But that said, I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you looked at 2018 and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate will be right around 24%. So that's really been jumping-off point for 2019. But the difficult part is it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this, sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefit, there would be around $2 million. So jumping-off point, and again, but it's not complete jumping-off point 24% roll into an excess tax benefit. So it would be something less than 24%. But when we get to the January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that, I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you can give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses, you talked about some head count that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we look at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure, Daniel. I'll tell you on the expense, I mean, this is, we are still investing for the future. We are -- we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There is some regulatory related spend as well. And as I just said on the tax rate that we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January. But again, thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9%. And then if you look longer-term, the past five years, the compound annual growth rates also been about 9%. And we're going to continue. We have plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion, in our infrastructure. I'd suggest taking history into account at least for modeling out sort of early models on 2019, we'll give you more color in January. But that 9%, that's where we've been, and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million, and I appreciate the commentary on October. And the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here for the last several quarters. But I guess, as we think about higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration of having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Dan, if we were just -- if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate note activity matters. But, if you take those all side and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yeah, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture. I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every 1 percentage point change in yield across the yield curve, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So you again, if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture. But there are -- that is costing us so many things and influence fee capture around years to maturity, trade size, dealer mix, there's just a lot that goes into the mix on US high-grade. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from a Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Yeah, thanks guys. My question has been asked and answered. Thank you. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Richard.

1022025,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Alumna/us in the News,"October 24, 2018 Programs supported by gift will create pipeline for the next generation of scientific leaders Colby College has received a major contribution to support programs that will prepare the next generation of innovators in the sciences through funded experiences at renowned partner institutions on the leading edge of discovery. The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad."

You can't tell from the temperature outside, but October is finally here, and we could all use a beer (or ten) to cool down courtesy of Grovetoberfest. The Coconut Grove beer fest is back this year with plenty of sudsy options from local breweries. If you're into liquor, the Craft Spirits Fest will also be in the neighborhood with your drink of choice this weekend. And if you're looking to immerse yourself in the diverse and vibrant culture of the Magic City, hit up HistoryMiami's CultureFest 305 this Saturday, or head west to the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum for a survey of 21st-century Caribbean art and culture. Here's a look at some of the best events happening in Miami over the next few days. Friday You remember Eddie Izzard's face from the hit TV show The Riches and flicks such as Ocean's Twelve, Mystery Men, and Across the Universe. Now it's time to see the English comedian on the big stage. He's bringing his Believe Me tour, named after his memoir that hit shelves last year, to the Magic City. His live show hilariously reflects on his unique adventures, covering everything from his time rising through the ranks in London to performing at Madison Square Garden. 8 p.m. Friday, October 12, at Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; arshtcenter.org. Tickets cost $35 to $196. Miami's original zombie prom is back, and it's billed as ""deader than ever."" That means you need to head to Zombie Prom Resurrección in your most magical zombie garb and be ready to own it. In addition to hosting a number of beastly South Floridians, the event will deliver live tunes from Otto von Schirach & the Bermuda Triangle Family, Galactic Effect, Lamebot, MadSavvy, and Lipstick Alley. 9 p.m. Friday, October 12, at 1306 Miami, 1306 N. Miami Ave., Miami; facebook.com. Tickets cost $10 to $20. Throughout the year, the Craft Spirits Fest stages a number of events, including happy hours, seminars, and dinners. They all culminate with a grand tasting of more than 100 spirits and cocktails to sample. The latest grand tasting will happen Friday at the Cruz Building. Last year's edition included participants such as Wondermint Liqueur to Prescribed Spirits, so prepare to whet that palate. 6:30 p.m. Friday, October 12, at the Cruz Building, 3157 Commodore Plaza, Coconut Grove; craftspiritsfest.com. Tickets cost $50 to $75. Saturday A false Miami narrative has become frustratingly pervasive with the advent of the boutique art explosion in neighborhoods such as Wynwood in recent years. Cultural carpetbaggers claim Miami ""lacked culture"" before the galleries came along, but true Miamians know that this city has always been the melting-est of melting pots, with music and flavors from the Caribbean, Latin America, and many other places blending to create our own, unique culture. It's the duty of institutions such as HistoryMiami to reassert this narrative. To that end, CultureFest 305, the museum's free day festival of music, dance, food, and art, will include performances by the Delou Africa Dance Ensemble, reggae band Jahfe, a martial arts presentation by Master Xiaoming Lu, and much more. 2 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at HistoryMiami Museum, 101 W. Flagler St., Miami; historymiami.org. Admission is free with RSVP. Caribbean art is a gold mine of underappreciated greatness. That's why it's crucial to see places such as the Little Haiti Cultural Complex and events like the Third Horizon Film Festival shining the rightful spotlight on our neighbors to the south and tropical transplants to the States. This week, it's the Frost Art Museum's turn. The museum is opening ""Relational Undercurrents: Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago,"" a major survey of 21st-century Caribbean art with a focus on the inclusivity and connectivity of Caribbean cultures. 4 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum, FIU, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; frost.fiu.edu. Admission is free. More than 500 craft beers are waiting to be tasted. What are you waiting for? Grovetoberfest is back. In addition to boasting ungodly amounts of delicious brews from local faves such as J. Wakefield and LauderAle to national/international suds like Imperial and Harpoon, the fest will offer live tunes, delicious bites, and a retro 8-bit game area. Prepare to geek out and drink on at this one. 2 to 7 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Peacock Park, 2820 McFarlane Rd., Coconut Grove; grovetoberfest.com. Tickets cost $44 to $89. The star of The Jim Jefferies Show is set to hit Hollywood. If you're easily offended, this show might not be the best one for you. But if you like to laugh at anything and everything, the Australian comic never disappoints. A good primer for a Jefferies show would be his hit Comedy Central show or his latest comedy special, This Is Me Now, which was released in January. 8 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Hard Rock Live, 1 Seminole Way, Hollywood; ticketmaster.com. Tickets cost $35 to $75. The Bass is previewing two big exhibitions this week, and you're invited. Italian artist Paola Pivi, who won the 1999 Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale and is based in Alaska, is presenting ""Art With a View."" The exhibition offers the artist's signature anthropomorphic, feather-covered polar bears, a massive inflatable ladder, and other Instagrammable works straight out of a dream. Texas-born, L.A.-based artist Aaron Curry is opening ""Tune Yer Head."" His work reveals the artists who influenced him, from Picasso to cartoonists, as well as BMX and skate culture. Celebrate these two very different but equally thoughtful shows with a crowd. 5 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at the Bass, 2100 Collins Ave., Miami; thebass.org. Admission costs $10. Each year, Miami's art elite clamor to attend the fundraiser Smash and Grab. Held in support of the long-running and respected art space Locust Projects, it offers a raffle of donated artwork by local and international talents. It's a pretty awesome way to see work by Miami creatives on the rise. It's also one big party, featuring sounds curated by the Rhythm Foundation, this year with DJs Par, Benton, and Ricardo; food by Shake Shack, Harry's Pizzeria, and 222 Taco; and booze by Bacardi. It's the quintessential Miami benefit that turns art lovers into collectors. 6:30 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Locust Projects, 3852 N. Miami Ave., Miami; locustprojects.org. Admission costs $50.

Ween, the enigmatic alt-rock band that shape-shifted its way through genres in the '90s and early '00s, has a cult following for good reason. It's not only because members Gene and Dean Ween were ""sprouted from the demon-god Boognish,"" but also because they produced a song or album for every taste. The two childhood pals formed their act in 1984 and recorded nine studio albums with expanded membership. Though Gene Ween left the group to deal with his substance-use disorder, the duo recently reunited in 2015 and is on tour. You can catch one hell of an evil live Ween show at the Fillmore this week. 8 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Fillmore Miami Beach, 1700 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; fillmoremb.com. Tickets cost $49. Sunday It's always been crucial for locals to support the Miami Symphony Orchestra — a world-class group of musicians that helps elevate this city to an international hub of musical prestige. Check out the grand opening of the orchestra's 2018-19 season with conductor Eduardo Marturet, pianist Mary Anne Huntsman, and other stellar musicians. The program will include a world premiere of Tindle's Orbits, as well as Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F Major and Holst's The Planets, Op. 56. 6 p.m. Sunday, October 14, at Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; arshtcenter.org. Tickets start at $35. The world has about 12 years to cut carbon emissions, correlated monster hurricanes are tearing our state apart, and the country is run by a pack of Bond villains. We could all use a little healing these days. Tierra Santa's ongoing wellness events are taking self-care to a whole new level, teaching participants calming techniques utilizing essential oils, meditation, and yoga. Tierra Santa Spa Director Agustina Caminos will guide this Sunday's Pranic Healing Conference, where she'll introduce no-touch techniques of energy healing for those interested in learning another way to calm the mind and body during fraught times. 3 p.m. Sunday, October 14, at Tierra Santa Studio, 3201 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; faena.com. Admission is free with RSVP via spamiami@faena.com or 786-655-5570.

In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost with a lawsuit accusing him of stock fraud. According to the SEC, Frost and his co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of stocks and then exited with millions, leaving other investors with virtually worthless shares. After the charges were announced in the national media, stock prices for Frost's company, Opko Health, plummeted. Now Frost is being sued by six Opko shareholders who lost money because of the alleged pump-and-dump scheme. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Florida, New Jersey, and New York, are brought by plaintiffs Charles Steinberg, Jason Kerznowski, Michael Brennan, Paul Camhi, Andy Yu, and a sports agency called Adsport that's run by CEO Gary Knudson. Frost, the namesake of Miami's Frost Museum of Science and Frost Art Museum, has not yet responded to the complaints in court. A spokesman for the octogenarian did not return a call from New Times Wednesday, but in an earlier statement, Frost denied the SEC's allegations. ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity... I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name,"" wrote Frost, who has not been criminally charged with any wrongdoing. In the six new lawsuits against Frost, shareholders accuse him of intentionally making false or misleading statements about the finances and operations of Opko. Attorneys for the shareholders argue that as CEO of Opko, Frost knew or should have known about the alleged activity spelled out in the SEC's claim. You have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in! Most of the suits contain similar language and allegations, but one of the cases filed last week in Miami federal court, by New York resident Andy Yu, goes into greater detail about the way Frost financially benefited from Opko. According to Yu's complaint, Frost rented his own office space to Opko for $81,000 per month beginning in January 2014 and then hiked it up to $86,000 per month in 2018. If the claim is true, Frost made about $4.45 million acting as landlord for his own company. The lawsuit also says Frost billed Opko a total of $659,000 for use of his private plane in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. ""As the company’s highest officer and as chairman of the board, he conducted little, if any, oversight of the company’s engagement in the scheme to make false and misleading statements, consciously disregarded his duties to monitor such controls over reporting and engagement in the scheme, and consciously disregarded his duties to protect corporate assets,"" the complaint alleges. Yu's attorney, Walter Mathews, did not return a call from New Times Wednesday. As of now, no court hearings have been scheduled.

To access this content, please disable your adblocker or pay for an access pass: 24 hours 1 month pass Venerable British stockbroker Panmure Gordon grew its profits in 2017 after being taken over last year by a consortium that included ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond. Panmure Gordon’s parent company, Panmure Gordon Group, made profits after tax of £2.3m in 2017, more than double the £1.1m 2016 profits of the pre-takeover group. The firm made net revenues of £14.9m in the year ending in December, according to its latest company accounts. Read more: Will fortune favour brave Bob Diamond's Panmure takeover? However, the bank’s figures were boosted by a £4.1m one-off accounting gain as the parent company took over Panmure’s old assets in what it deemed as ‘bargain purchase.’ Panmure made a statutory operating loss of £2.6m in 2017, compared to an operating profit of £1.6m in 2016, after absorbing £3.3m in acquisition fees and spending £1.2m in new investment. Underlying operating profit was £1.9m. Diamond, who lost his role as Barclays boss following the Libor rate-rigging scandal, banded together with the investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family to buy Panmure last year. The firm, which can trace its roots back to 1876, sustained heavy losses of £16.7m in 2015, prompting a wave of changes at the top and opening the way for the takeover. Ian Axe, Panmure chief executive, said 2017 performance was “stable”, but added the firm had “started to transform both our infrastructure and seed the growth of new businesses and diversification for the coming years”. The firm has expanded into mergers and acquisitions advisory and private capital, alongside more traditional broking activities. The firm’s headcount has risen to 130 people. The group’s UK subsidiary, Panmure Gordon (UK), reported a loss for the year in separate accounts, although this was accounted for mainly by one-off acquisition costs, such as legal and financial advisers, of £2.5m after the takeover. The group’s measure of underlying profit in the UK business after tax was £1.6m. Read more: You probably won't know of this adviser on the Panmure Gordon takeover deal The firm said it made “significant investment” during 2017, mainly in regard to adjusting to compliance and regulation changes brought under Mifid 2, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Mifid 2 roiled European stockbroking last year, with banks and brokers forced to comply with new rules forcing transparency on costs. * Terms and conditions"

1053951,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Barrington analyst Michael Petusky maintained a Buy rating on Opko Health (NASDAQ: OPK) today and set a price target of $7. The company’s shares opened today at $3.49. Petusky said: “We know that management received several questions regarding the recent news that the SEC has launched an investigation into the trading of certain low‐priced securities, and that CEO and Chairman Dr. Phil Frost and OPKO were among the investors whose activities are now under SEC review. The general thrust of the investigation seems to involve allegations of “pump and dump” stock trading. We simply do not have enough information to make any kind of high conviction call on the ultimate outcome of this investigation, but we can say that both Dr. Frost and OPKO have a long history of making investments in smaller companies. In the case of OPKO (and to the best of our knowledge), not a dollar of investment that the company has made in any of the trading activity being examined by the SEC has ever been monetized. Regarding Dr.” According to TipRanks.com, Petusky is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 14.2% and a 59.2% success rate. Petusky covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Anika Therapeutics Inc, Varian Medical Systems, and DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. The word on The Street in general, suggests a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating for Opko Health with a $10.50 average price target. See today’s analyst top recommended stocks >> Based on Opko Health’s latest earnings release for the quarter ending June 30, the company reported a quarterly GAAP net loss of $6.2 million.

TipRanks has tracked 36,000 company insiders and found that a few of them are better than others when it comes to timing their transactions.

Garrard, 79, also expressed regret for his largesse. Yet in the past few weeks he has given deputy leader Tom Watson's office £15,000. My Westminster source explains: 'There's no better way to irritate Jeremy Corbyn than by giving money to Watson.' Santander's incoming boss, suave Italiano Andrea Orcel, has been described as a determined alpha male who likes to get what he wants. Although the ex-UBS banker, 55, will hold the title of chief executive, overall in charge at the bank remains its redoubtable executive chairman Ana Botin, 58, whose family control Santander. Wonder how that's going to play out? An erstwhile colleague mischievously smirks: 'Pass the popcorn'. Competitors in this weekend's Alfred Dunhill Golf Championship at St Andrews include ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond, Richemont chairman Johann Rupert and Aberdeen Standard chief Martin Gilbert. Accomplished players all, who should more than hold their own in tackling the world's most famous golf course. Unlike my colleague Piers Morgan, who judging by some of his practice shots yesterday looks likely to be keeping the greenkeepers busy. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH's billionaire patriarch Bernard Arnault has appointed his cherubic son Frederic, 23, as digital director of watchmaker Tag Heuer. Father-of-five Monsieur Arnault's youngest son Jean, 19, now remains the only member of his offspring yet to enter the family business. Perhaps Bernard, 69, should send him to Celine to keep an eye on the fashion label's waifish creative chief, Hedi Slimane. His debut collection was universally panned this week. Fulham Football club's fabulously moustachioed owner Shahid Khan's has a floating gin palace Kismet, which was comfortably the biggest vessel on display at the recent Monaco Yacht Show. The 312-ft monster has eight bedrooms, a 28-man crew and is available for charter at £1million a week. Is anyone daft enough to pay that much?

1014074,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Michael Jordan, worth $1.7 billion, is one of more than 200 American billionaires to not make the Forbes 400.2017 Getty Images A billion dollars isn’t what it used to be. This year, a record 204 billionaires weren’t wealthy enough to crack the exclusive Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. The cutoff to the make the list was higher than ever: $2.1 billion, up $100 million from last year. The list of those not quite rich enough includes people who have appeared on The Forbes 400 in years past, like private-equity giants Bruce Karsh and Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital (now worth $2 billion each); Under Armour founder Kevin Plank ($1.9 billion) and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman ($1.8 billion), who Forbes recently learned has given away $1.5 billion. Others who fell short were new billionaires from a variety of industries, many of whom have the potential to rise in the ranks and make the cut in the coming years. GitHub’s cofounder Chris Wanstrath, worth $1.4 billion, sold out in exchange for the lucrative currency of Microsoft shares. In June, Microsoft announced it would purchase the software-development platform for $7.5 billion in stock, and Wanstrath, GitHub’s largest shareholder, received an estimated $1.4 billion. As part of the deal he stepped down as CEO of the company that he founded in 2008 to become a fellow at Microsoft. Even closer to the $2.1 billion minimum is Tim Sweeney, the founder of blockbuster video game Fortnite Battle Royale, who’s worth an estimated $1.8 billion. The game has attracted at least 125 million players and over $1 billion in estimated in-game sales (the game is free to play, but players can buy various extras and add-ons). Forbes calculates that Sweeney owns roughly 16% of Epic Games, the game developer he founded in 1991 while studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland. Jim Kavanaugh, a former pro soccer player who played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, went on to cofound IT provider World Wide Technology six years later at age 27. Back then, he found himself driving 500 PCs to Omaha just to fill an order. The grit paid off: He’s now worth $2 billion, based on his 38% stake in the $10.4 billion (sales) company. It’s not only the tech sector that produced billion-dollar Americans this year. Anastasia Soare, who emigrated from Romania in 1989, expanded her L.A. eyebrow salon—clients include Kim Kardashian and Cindy Crawford—into an international makeup phenomenon and a $1 billion fortune. Her Anastasia Beverly Hills brand is sold in more than 1,500 stores and had sales of $200 million last year. With nearly 18 million Instagram followers and a number of celebrities touting her products, Soare, 60, has built a low-cost marketing machine. Jimmy John Liautaud, worth $1.7 billion, made his fortune thanks to his eponymous sandwich chain, which he founded in 1983 at age 19. Although he sold a minority stake to private-equity investor Weston Presidio over a decade ago and Roark Capital bought a majority stake in 2017, Liautaud still owns an estimated 35% of the company and serves as its chairman. A poor student who graduated near the bottom of his high school class, he started the business using a $25,000 loan from his father, an Army veteran. Jimmy John’s now has nearly 3,000 locations. Former NBA star Michael Jordan may have stepped off the court, but he is still in the game of making money. Worth $1.7 billion, Jordan's playing salary during career totaled $90 million, but he has earned another $1.4 billion (pretax) from corporate partners including Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck. In 2010 he used some of those earnings to purchase a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets. The team is now worth $1.05 billion, and he owns 90%. Here is the complete list of the ten-figure net worth individuals who didn’t make The Forbes 400 list this year, as well as their source of wealth: $2 billion Jim Kavanaugh, IT provider $2 billion Valentin Gapontsev, lasers $2 billion Herbert Allen, investment banking $2 billion Paul Foster, oil refining $2 billion Manuel Moroun, transportation $2 billion Stanley Hubbard, DirecTV $2 billion Jeffrey Gundlach, investments $2 billion Charles Zegar, Bloomberg LP $2 billion Jennifer Pritzker, hotels and investments $2 billion Henry Laufer, hedge funds $2 billion Brian Sheth, investments $2 billion Lee Thomas, private equity $2 billion Bruce Karsh, private equity $2 billion Howard Marks, private equity $2 billion Robert Duggan, pharmaceuticals $2 billion Stewart Horejsi, Berkshire Hathaway $2 billion David Booth, mutual funds $2 billion Rodney Sacks, energy drinks $2 billion Amy Wyss, medical equipment $2 billion Julio Mario Santo Domingo, beer $2 billion Linda Pritzker, hotels and investments $2 billion David Murdock, Dole and real estate $2 billion John Tyson, food processing $2 billion Jeffrey Lorberbaum, flooring $1.9 billion William Stone, software $1.9 billion Kevin Plank, Under Armour $1.9 billion Catherine Lozick, valve manufacturing $1.9 billion Christopher Cline, coal $1.9 billion Aneel Bhusri, business software $1.9 billion Jim Justice, coal $1.8 billion Tor Peterson, online media $1.8 billion William Lauder, Estée Lauder $1.8 billion Tim Sweeney, video games $1.8 billion Ron Burkle, supermarkets and investments $1.8 billion David Lichtenstein, real estate $1.8 billion William Koch, oil and investments $1.8 billion Jonathan Nelson, private equity $1.8 billion Carol Jenkins Barnett, Publix supermarkets $1.8 billion Charles Munger, Berkshire Hathaway $1.8 billion Nicholas Berggruen, investments $1.8 billion Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn $1.8 billion William Berkley, insurance $1.8 billion Henry Swieca, hedge funds $1.8 billion Marc Lasry, hedge funds $1.8 billion Craig McCaw, telecom $1.8 billion Roger Penske, cars $1.8 billion Evan Williams, Twitter $1.8 billion Gary Michelson, medical patents $1.8 billion Bill Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Ted Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Susan Alfond, shoes $1.8 billion Bill Haslam, truck stops $1.8 billion James France, Nascar/racing $1.8 billion Brian Roberts, Comcast $1.7 billion Miguel McKelvey, WeWork $1.7 billion Mario Gabelli, money management $1.7 billion Jimmy Liautaud, sandwich chain $1.7 billion Michael Jordan, Charlotte Hornets and endorsements $1.7 billion Timothy Headington, oil & gas and investments $1.7 billion Anne Gittinger, Nordstrom department stores $1.6 James Hamilton, investments $1.6 billion Christopher Goldsbury, salsa $1.6 billion Stephen Winn, real estate services $1.6 billion Bharat Desai, IT consultants $1.6 billion Nelson Peltz, investments $1.6 billion Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook $1.6 billion George Joseph, insurance $1.6 billion Thomas Steyer, hedge funds $1.6 billion Kieu Hoang, medical products $1.6 billion Craig Newmark, Craigslist $1.6 billion Robert Fisher, Gap $1.6 billion Louis Bacon, hedge funds $1.6 billion Francis O.

1108635,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Parent (pure parent) in the News,"Interview with interventional cardiology pioneer Simon Stertzer, M.D. Simon Stertzer, M.D., is one of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s and 1980s. He performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States in 1978. One of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s was Simon Stertzer, M.D. In this article he shares his views on the current direction and next steps in cardiovascular biomedical technology. On March 1, 1978, Stertzer in New York, and Richard Myler, M.D., in San Francisco, each performed the first two coronary angioplasty balloon procedures in the United States.[1] This was just six months after the world's first angioplasty was performed by Andreas Gruntzig in Zurich, Switzerland. Gruntzig presented his first angioplasty cases at the American Heart Association (AHA) in Novemeber 1977, and found some enthusiasm among early American supporters for this new, non-surgical intervention. Stertzer pushed the limit of the early dilation balloons in his first case, treating a complex lesion in an older patient, which even Gruntzig shyed away from. His first cases, along with Gruntzig's and Myler's, were combined into the first-ever interventional cardiology multi-center study, which they presented at AHA in 1980. Stertzer was also involved in the first live case courses to teach early adopter cardiologists how to perform angioplasty procedures. Stertzer was director of the catheterization laboratory at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York from 1971 to 1983. He served as the director of medical research and director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the San Francisco Heart Institute in Daly City, Calif., from 1983 to 1993, working with the institute’s director, the late Myler. In 1993, Stertzer was recruited to Stanford University’s School of Medicine, as professor of medicine. In 1984, Stertzer was a founder of the interventional device company Arterial Vascular Engineering (AVE). It was purchased in 1998 by Medtronic to form its interventional division. He was also involved with Quanam Medical Corp., founded in 1994, which developed polymer-coated stents used for drug delivery in coronary angioplasty. That company was acquired by Boston Scientific in 2001. Today, Stertzer is professor emeritus at Stanford University School of Medicine and is a co-founder of BioCardia, which was created in 1999. He serves as chairman of the board. The clinical-stage regenerative biotechnology company is developing technology for the direct injection of stem cells and agents into the heart muscle, as well as personalized screenings to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intramyocardial injection of therapeutic agents. Its main focus is in treatments of heart failure. Question: Just how big of a problem is heart disease in the U.S.? Answer: According to American Heart Association statistics, cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is listed as the underlying cause of death in about 836,546 deaths in the United States. This breaks down to about 2,300 Americans dying of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of one death every 38 seconds. Currently, about 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke.[2] Question: Based on your career treating patients with cardiovascular disease, what are the biggest risk factors that contribute to the development of heart disease? Answer: The biggest risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of physical activity, obesity, poor diet, and critically, genetic and family history. Question: The latest statistics show that heart failure is on the rise due to advances in healthcare innovation and people surviving prior heart attacks. How can both lifestyle changes and advanced new treatments prevent future heart failure in heart attack survivors?Answer: Meticulous attention to blood pressure, diet, physical activity, and blood lipid treatments can all delay or decrease the numbers of increasing heart failure in post-heart attack victims. Cell therapy may also hold promise for decreasing or ameliorating heart failure in this population. Question: You performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States. What have been some of the most successful innovations used to treat heart disease? Answer: After the initial introduction of coronary angioplasty into Europe and the U.S., in 1978, we have seen an explosion of subsequent technology such as: stents (including drug-eluting stents), improvements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, percutaneous valve replacements without open chest surgery, and now, the beginning of stem cell introduction directly into the heart muscle to affect the course and symptoms of heart failure. Question: There have been numerous examples of healthcare innovations enabling people to better monitor their health. A great example is the new Fitbit Charge 3 that tracks sleep apnea, which has been linked to heart disease. What are your thoughts on these types of devices as a means of tracking overall health and protecting against heart disease?Answer: The diagnosis of sleep apnea, a significant risk factor for heart disease and arrhythmia (like atrial fibrillation), has traditionally been by sleeping partner observation or by spending a night in a specialized hospital setting requiring an overnight stay. This is a costly and highly disruptive process to diagnose sleep apnea. Thus, to the extent that we can obviate an overnight stay and still make accurate diagnoses of sleep apnea, these out-of-hospital aids could be excellent. Question: When you look ahead to the future of medicine, where do you see the most innovation taking place? Answer: When it comes to the future of medicine, we will continue to see a combination of both devices and biopharmaceuticals paving the way for the improvements in disease treatment. Finding the keys to cellular metastatic behavior (the spread of cancer) will drastically change the outlook for cancer sufferers, and hopefully eradicate early death rates. Devices will continue to aid orthopedic and neurological conditions, while biochemistry and artificial intelligence will continue to alter the course of many other chronic and fatal diseases. Question: BioCardia is pioneering new advancements in the treatment of cardiovascular disease through the use of stem cells. How is BioCardia changing the way heart failure is treated? Answer: Up until the present era, common varieties of heart failure have been treated with a variety of medications, exercise and activity restrictions, salt restriction, diuretics and various hormonal therapies designed to improve cardiac function. Although these therapies relieve many of the symptoms of heart failure, they do not fundamentally improve the heart muscle itself. BioCardia is in a pivotal trial administering certain types of blood cells directly into the heart muscle from the outside of the body, using a specialized catheter system invented at the company laboratories in San Carlos, Calif. These cells are the first generation of a future line of cells, gene products and other biologicals, the administration of which will change the course of heart failure and other diseases in the near future, in my opinion. The future of this therapy will improve cardiac function and may even regenerate heart muscle in the coming years. Not only do we expect cell therapy to eventually regenerate diseased tissue, but we already are seeing replacements of heart valves using catheter procedures from the outside of the body, as well as improved pacemakers and implantable devices (in selected patients) designed to decrease the incidence of sudden death. Question: Tell us more about the recent Phase III trial for BioCardia’s CardiAMP heart failure treatment. What is CardiAMP, and what do the results show?Answer: The investigational CardiAMP therapy uses the patient's own (autologous) bone marrow cells to potentially stimulate the body's natural healing response through a minimally-invasive, catheter-based procedure. The results are highly promising. In a recent Viewpoint paper, the authors acknowledge that although the varying properties and potency of bone marrow-derived stem cells across patients are recognized, little focus has been put on the regenerative capacity of the patients themselves in determining outcomes.[3] They point out that the pivotal CardiAMP-HF Trial is the first to incorporate a cell potency analysis and score in the screening criteria. BioCardia was highlighted as an example of personalized medicine, with promising results from the first 10 or so-called roll-in cases.

1031786,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Colby Friend in the News,"Mainly cloudy. High 14F. Winds light and variable.. Partly cloudy skies. Low 1F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 8:44 am FAIRBANKS — The fall Guys Read program is in its 13th year, and “Leon: Protector of the Playground,” is one of the featured books. Leon Magnificent’s world has many watered-down super heroes and villains. Leon’s superpower, for instance, is common sense, though he gets to wear a cape. Gertrude Stein, who once commented that “everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense,” would have liked Leon. If you’re ripe enough, keeping the senses sharp is reason to join UAF’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Philanthropist Bernard Osher’s foundation supports university “programs targeted toward more mature students not necessarily well served by standard continuing education curricula,” according to OsherFoundation.org, because “the interest of many older adults, especially those who have retired, is learning for the joy of learning, without examinations or grades.” UAF’s one of 122 universities offering OLLI classes, but only elders 50 and older can participate. It’s inexpensive and stimulatingly fun. I’m a volunteer OLLI instructor. This fall’s class is about word histories, which is why recent columns have leaned that way. A lifelong interest in word origins has produced a personal library of relevant books, but I’m no expert. I’m boning up to have a fighting chance of not embarrassing myself, and that’s how I met Mrs. Byrne. Josefa Heifetz Byrne was a concert pianist and the daughter of “legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz,” who in 1958 married Robert Byrne, a civil engineer, leading expert on pool and billiards and author of important books on the latter subjects. In fact, Byrne coined an obscure term, “squirt” for a particular sort of misplayed shot wherein the cue ball “squirts” off to the side. He and Josefa divorced in 1976, two years after he edited and wrote the forward to “Mrs. Byrne’s Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words.” Claiming that “every entry in this book, even the most ludicrous, has been accepted as a formal or legitimate English word by at least one major dictionary,” Byrne added that his wife “managed to assemble the six thousand weirdest words in the English language. Nobody asked her to do it because nobody thought such a thing was possible. In fact I asked her not to do it. Completed, the book stands as one of the most peculiar feats of compulsive lexicography.” Examples include “quasihemidemisemiquaver” (a 128th note), “quadrigomist” (“someone with four husbands or four wives at the same time”), and “quop” (“to throb”). If there aren’t enough strange words already, now the Oxford English Dictionary has asked teens to tweet them their latest catchy slang expressions. “Inside the OED: Can the World’s Biggest Dictionary Survive the Internet?,” a NYTimes.com article by Andrew Dickson, is a fascinating look at the greatest English dictionary’s inner workings. It also provides a good thumbnail description of how “the mother of all English language dictionaries” evolved, and how it continues to thrive as internet hyper-connectivity and communication speeds is causing new words to sprout and spread exponentially. The Third Edition of the OED is underway, “a goliath project that involves overhauling every entry (many of which haven’t been touched since the late-Victorian era) and adding … missing words, as well as making the dictionary into a fully digital resource.” It’s a glacial process; 2000 was the original completion date, and presently they’re “about 48 percent” along. “Go,” for example, took about 12 months to fully update and revise, but then “the revised entry for ‘go’ traces 537 separate senses over 1,000 years.” “Well,” as Michael Proffitt, the current chief editor, put it, “we have to get things right.” “Bare” is one of the new crop of slang. It means “many or much; a lot of,” as in OED’s #YouthSlangAppeal: “We could do with some help. Bare help.” Then there’s “woke,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “Aware of the injustice of the social system in which one lives.” Perhaps youngsters will someday woke to the plight of elders being overwhelmed with new terms. Until then, we oldsters should employ common sense and circumvallate (“surround with or as if with a rampart”) ourselves with venerable, crusty expressions of yore, and show them a thing or three.

To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com. https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-lawyer-at-the-center-of-sec-pump-and-dump-case-1538675403 In a stock fraud suit filed last month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators allege that billionaire drug entrepreneur Phillip Frost and his company Opko Health participated in pump-and-dump schemes organized by investor Barry Honig. The complaint in Manhattan’s federal district court says that Honig and his associates bought stock in three small companies, controlled the firms’ managements, and planted promotional articles about them before unloading their shares. The schemers reaped more than $27 million, the SEC charges, before leaving public investors with virtually worthless stock. Unmentioned in the SEC’s case is how all three public companies in the alleged swindles used the same securities law firm and the same stock transfer agency. SEC filings over the past decade show that nearly two dozen public companies backed by Honig, or other defendants in last month’s SEC complaint, used securities lawyer Harvey Kesner, a 61-year old partner at the leading small-cap law firm Sichenzia Ross Ference, until he retired from the firm just before the SEC action. Those companies also happened to use Equity Stock Transfer, a New York outfit that SEC registrations show was financed and controlled by Kesner. A prominent Honig-backed firm that Kesner represented was Riot Blockchain (ticker: RIOT), whose shares rose tenfold in last year’s cryptocurrency surge, to $46, before falling back to a recent $3.40. Riot wasn’t named in the SEC’s case, but its chief executive, John O’Rourke, was. He has resigned and said he’ll fight the civil charges that he colluded in Honig’s alleged swindles. Following the SEC charges, Frost stepped down as chairman from the brokerage firm he controls, Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services (LTS). The 81-year-old Frost and Opko (OPK) deny the wrongdoings alleged in the SEC’s action. Honig has made no public statement. He did not respond to Barron’s requests for comment. One defendant, John H. Ford, quickly settled the SEC’s charges, without admitting or denying allegations that he took undisclosed payments to tout a couple of the stocks on the website SeekingAlpha.com. Securities lawyers and transfer agents are essential gatekeepers under federal regulations meant to protect the investing public. But one of the three companies featured in the SEC’s New York case, the tiny biotech firm MabVax Therapeutics Holdings (MBVX), says that Honig forced it to hire Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross firm as a condition of his financing, according to a little-noted malpractice case that MabVax filed in a San Diego state court after the SEC case became public. The MabVax suit contends that Kesner and his law firm advanced the interests of Honig at the expense of MabVax, deceiving the company and committing malpractice that led to its delisting from Nasdaq. Although MabVax had retained Kesner’s law firm “to keep the company safe,” says the biotech’s complaint, Kesner’s firm instead “put MabVax in harm’s way.” Neither Kesner nor Equity Stock Transfer responded to Barron’s requests for comment or in court filings. Kesner’s former firm strongly denies that it wronged its client MabVax. “There are very serious misstatements and misleading facts alleged in the complaint, as well as errors in law,” says Mark Anesh, a malpractice specialist from the firm Lewis Brisbois, who will represent Sichenzia Ross’ lawyers in the California case, but not Kesner. “The firm intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, and in the end we fully expect that the claims contained therein will be found to be completely and utterly without merit.” Kesner was a rainmaker at many of the firms where he worked. Before Sichenzia Ross Ference Kesner—as the New York firm was known until Kesner’s August departure—he’d been with the Dallas firm Haynes and Boone until the firm terminated him in 2009. In a lawsuit that was quickly settled, Kesner demanded $15 million from the Dallas firm and alleged that its partners defamed him by telling others “Harvey is dirty” and “had relationships with clients that the firm did not wish to associate with.” A Haynes and Boone spokesman said, “Mr. Kesner left the firm in March of 2009. We resolved our disputes at that time and have had no further contact with him.” After arriving at Sichenzia Ross in 2009, Kesner helped build the firm into one of the busiest securities law practices in America’s small-cap stock market. The firm’s website has been intermittently offline lately while it scrubs mentions of Kesner, but it had featured many tombstone announcements of deals that SEC filings show were bankrolled by Honig, Frost, and their investing associates. Sichenzia Ross’ website said that it “consistently ranked at the top of national league table rankings for issuer, investor and placement-agent legal counsel.” In MabVax’s California complaint against the law firm, the biotech says that Honig and his associates forced MabVax to hire Kesner as part of a 2015 financing. The complaint says that Kesner later said that he worked on at least five deals a year for Honig’s investment group. MabVax said it had found 22 other companies backed by Honig’s group where “Sichenzia and Kesner have been inserted as counsel.” MabVax claims that the advice it got from Kesner was secretly designed to serve clients such as Honig. In 2015, MabVax alleges that Kesner tipped Honig off to a potential legal issue that weakened his control over the company. Honig repaired his position and then forced MabVax to issue $10 million worth of securities—for free—to Honig and his investment associates, who secretly included Kesner. The company also says that Kesner’s law firm inserted legal language in Honig’s deals so that the investors could deny that they were acting as a controlling group. But doubts about the legitimacy of Kesner’s techniques have since forced MabVax to disclaim four years worth of its previous SEC filings, alleges the company, and caused its Nasdaq delisting. Sichenzia Ross’ outside counsel in the MabVax case, Anesh, would not comment on any details alleged by MabVax. As for MabVax, it declined to comment through its outside attorney, Joel Fleming of Block & Leviton. A key player in the world of small-cap finance is a company’s stock transfer agent, which can allow the sale of unregistered shares and convert warrants or preferred shares into common stock. In the SEC action against Honig and his associates, the agency says the group used “false attorney opinion letters” to get a transfer agent to remove restrictions from Honig’s share certificates, so that Honig could sell the unregistered stock. The transfer agent for the public companies involved in the SEC case—and more than another dozen funded by Honig—was Equity Stock Transfer. Equity Stock Transfer’s initial SEC registration in 2011 says that it was funded by one of Kesner’s limited-liability companies and managed by Avital Even-Shoshan, a partner who just left Sichenzia Ross and one of the defendants in MabVax’s case. Other SEC filings said that the transfer agency’s “control persons” included Kesner, his wife Renee, and an employee of Kesner’s law firms, Mohit Bhansali. In its March 2018 registration with the SEC, the transfer agency said that it still owed money to Kesner and that its ownership was divided between Bhansali and an Atlanta management consultant named Michael Beeghley. Both Bhansali and Beeghley have served as directors of Honig-backed companies, including Riot Blockchain and PolarityTE (PTE), a Salt Lake City biotech startup whose $18 shares value the unprofitable company at about $400 million. “Stock transfer agents are the gatekeepers of securities,” says Bhansali in an online video interview linked on the transfer agency’s website. “Security for securities, that’s what we do!” Neither Equity Stock Transfer, Bhansali, nor Beeghley responded to Barron’s questions about the transfer agency. Riot Blockchain’s interim Chief Executive Chris Ensey says his company no longer uses Kesner as its securities lawyer or Equity Stock Transfer as its transfer agent. PolarityTE still uses the transfer agent, but stopped using Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross law firm in the spring of 2018. Unlike MabVax, PolarityTE’s managers say they were satisfied with Kesner’s legal advice. “We were never forced to use Mr. Kesner,” says PolarityTE Chief Operating Officer Edward Swanson.

Just as in previous seasons the group of 24 golfers found the course to be in great condition and one of their favorite stops on their schedule. This time the challenging layout gave up two eagles and eighteen birdies to the field as four golfers turned in rounds in the 70s. Leading all scorers for the day was Mark Dill playing in the A Flight with his score of 74. Dill carded one eagle and one birdie in the round to allow him to claim his second win of the season in just four starts. It was also two in a row as he also won the Tours last event which was at Forest Oaks. Steve Cummings and Fran Hensley both turned in scores of 75 to tie for the second spot; but Cummings collected the prize money as he won a single hole play-off against Hensley. A play-off was also necessary to determine the B Flight as Tom Simmons and David Wilson both finished regulation play tied at 82. Simmons won the play-off as he two putted while Wilson took three putts. It was Simmons first win of the season. Wayne Ferrell claimed third place in the flight at 85. The C Flight also had a first-time winner for the season today as Debbie Thompson claimed the two-stroke victory with her round of 83. It was only Thompson’s second outing of the season. Lee Lemons also competing in his second event of the year took the flight’s second place with his round of 85. John Horton collected his second win of the season in D Flight with his round of 89. Meanwhile Curtis Smith and Tour Director Kenny Powell had to have a play-off to determine second place. After coming to the 18th hole tied; Smith forced the play-off as he putted in from off the green to tie Powell at 94. They went back to replay the 18th hole for the play-off only for Smith to once again putt in from off the backside of the green to win the second-place prize.

(Legal Newsline) – A clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Georgia is alleged to have deceived the investing public and engaged in a scheme to inflate the prices of securities. Anthony Pepe filed a complaint individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated on Sept. 20 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Cocrystal Pharma Inc., formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Director Phillip Frost; et al. alleging violation of federal securities laws. According to the complaint, the plaintiff is suing on behalf of class members who purchased Cocrystal and/or BioZone securities from Sept. 23, 2013, to Sept. 7, 2018. The suit states on Sept. 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a press release that announced Frost was named in a complaint over allegations of fraudulent schemes. The suit states after this announcement, Cocrystal shares fell more than 15.5 percent and damaged investors. The plaintiff holds Cocrystal Pharma Inc., et al. responsible because the defendants allegedly employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs request a trial by jury and seek judgment against defendants, damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, expert fees and other costs, and further relief as the court may deem just.

1020357,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee Emeriti in the News,"Four Bend City Council candidates sparred over growth, transportation and housing at a debate Monday. The Central Oregon Association of Realtors hosted a joint debate with Position 5 candidates Gena Goodman-Campbell and Andrew Davis and Position 6 candidates Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick. Victor Johnson, who’s running for Position 5, and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, who’s running for Position 6, did not attend the debate. Boozell is in jail through December for failing to pay child support; Johnson did not respond to an invitation, said Tyler Neese, the association’s government affairs director. The association’s political action committee has given $30,000 to Davis and $10,000 to McCormick, according to campaign finance records filed with the Oregon Secretary of State. Growth Davis and McCormick both said the city should focus on quickly annexing land in its urban growth boundary, the line around Bend that limits where it can grow. A land shortage means Bend can’t build homes or attract high-paying jobs quickly enough, said Davis, Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life. The city also needs to start planning for its next UGB expansion immediately, he said. “If we can build homes quickly enough, we can help costs from scaling out of control,” he said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, said she agreed Bend should be building more homes quickly to address the city’s housing crisis, but she said Bend should be careful about sprawling. The city’s last urban growth boundary expansions took two tries and several years to be approved because it tried to expand too far, she said. “I really don’t think we can afford more sprawl, especially when we have trouble maintaining the roads and infrastructure we have now,” she said. Smart growth includes focusing development in the center of the city, where roads and other infrastructure already exist, Goodman-Campbell said. Affordable housing Davis and Goodman-Campbell said they wanted to see developers in Bend building more varieties of housing, including duplexes and townhomes. The focus should be on homes for people making the median income of $64,000 or below, Goodman-Campbell said, because Bend has a shortage of thousands of homes for people making that amount but a surplus of homes for people with higher incomes. McCormick, a stay-at-home mother whose family owns the Pine Tavern, said the city should focus on annexing land in the UGB rather than trying city policies like rent control or inclusionary zoning, which requires affordable housing in developments. Developers work with fine margins and requiring them to construct affordable housing will mean they move to other cities, she said “There is a price to be paid for putting in low-income housing,” McCormick said. Bend and other cities have learned from past failures and now build subsidized housing so it fits in with neighborhoods, said Campbell, a current city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop in downtown Bend. She said she wished she could get all Bend residents who are concerned about affordable housing projects on a bus tour to look at the projects the city’s already completed. “I think most of our citizens would be surprised to find out they are already living near affordable housing,” she said. “We’ve done a remarkable job of making those types of housing fit into neighborhoods.” Transportation State law requires Bend to reduce how many miles vehicles travel, and there are several ways to do that, Goodman-Campbell said. One way is by making sure Bend residents have access to amenities like grocery stores in their neighborhoods, so they’re able to safely walk, bike or drive a short distance instead of driving across town, she said. “If their car breaks down, a lot of people don’t have ways to get around town,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell both talked about how advances in street-light technology can help traffic. Smart traffic signals and route-finding apps that advise drivers to take less congested routes help create capacity without widening streets, Campbell said. McCormick and Davis, meanwhile, said they supported a pilot program near Oregon State University-Cascades that will test subsidizing ride-hailing services in place of a bus route that was canceled this summer because of low ridership. Subsidizing ride-hailing rides is better for the city’s budget and the environment than operating buses, McCormick said, but she said Campbell would disagree because “she’s part of the protest with the bus union people.” Campbell, along with Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel, joined city bus drivers when they rallied for higher wages last month. “I’m really excited about having Uber subsidized in place of our bus system,” McCormick said. Campbell, who voted against the pilot program, said she doesn’t want the city to work with companies like Uber and Lyft because their rating system allows for discrimination. “Subsidizing Uber with tax money? No, thank you,” she said. Sewer Campbell and Goodman-Campbell agreed that the city as a whole and the hundreds of homeowners who will have to connect to Bend’s sewer lines should split the costs of connection. A current suggestion from a city committee made up mostly of people who live in a southeast Bend neighborhood near a new city sewer line would cap the connection costs for homeowners at $25,000, instead of the $100,000 or more some homeowners would have to pay without city intervention. The committee’s suggestion also would create financing options that would spread the cost over years and create a safety net for people who can’t afford to connect. A fee of $25,000 is still too much, Davis said. “To someone who is retired and drawing on Social Security, that number might as well be $1 million,” he said. He said the city should keep looking at financing options and make sure everyone contributes to the cost. McCormick, meanwhile, said its the city’s responsibility to take care of its residents and homeowners shouldn’t have to pay $25,000. “The city needs to get back to the drawing board,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin."

1053951,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"The SEC charges against Ladenburg Thalmann’s primary shareholder will not affect access to capital for its 4,300-advisor independent broker-dealer network, CEO Dick Lampen says. Phillip Frost retired from the Miami-based firm’s board on Sept. 20, two weeks after the SEC accused him of involvement with a $27 million pump-and-dump scheme. In addition to the network of five IBDs, Ladenburg’s subsidiaries also include its 139-year old investment bank, an asset management unit, an insurance brokerage and a trust division. The company’s various entities hold $250 million in cash with a book value above $390 million, Lampen noted in a statement. Ladenburg is “very pleased about how well-positioned our company is today for continued industry leadership,” he said, noting it also has $600 million “in permanent capital and long-term investment-grade notes” raised in the past five years. “With access to significant capital resources,” Lampen added, “Ladenburg will continue to explore opportunities for growth, including growth through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunities present themselves.” Frost controls about 35% of the company, according to Barrington Research Associates, the sole analysts currently listed as covering the stock. He owns about 3.1 million shares directly and 67.7 million shares indirectly through two entities where he’s the trustee, an SEC Form 4 filing shows. Frost exercised options to purchase nearly $1 million worth of Ladenburg’s stock on Sept. 24, according to the filing. In a separate transaction, he had forfeited 45,000 shares in connection with his retirement from his role as chairman. In the second transaction four days later, Frost exercised his options and held the stock rather than selling the 600,000 shares valued at $948,000, or $1.58 per share. The options, which the company granted him in 2008, would have expired on Oct. 30. The SEC charged one of the stock-owning entities in which Frost is a trustee, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, in the pump-and-dump case. The other, Frost Nevada Investments Trust, is an affiliate of Frost Gamma, according to the firm’s $40 million credit agreement with Frost Gamma. In a civil case filed earlier this month in the Southern District of New York, the regulator charged Frost, nine other people and 10 entities with selling penny stocks at artificially inflated prices. Retail investors wound up holding “virtually worthless” stock, the SEC says. The billionaire dermatologist’s fortune, which stems from his legendary career as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, helped Ladenburg acquire its five IBDs between 2007 and 2015. Frost has largely taken “a passive role” with the IBDs, though, says recruiter Jon Henschen. Henschen sees the SEC case against Frost as much different from the accounting scandal which plunged former Cetera Financial Group parent RCS Capital into bankruptcy protection in 2016. “It has nothing to do with Ladenburg,” Henschen says. “They’re basically putting up a Chinese wall to shield them, whatever does transpire there. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s not going to involve Ladenburg.” Barrington analyst Alexander Paris reiterated the research firm’s “outperform” rating for Ladenburg’s stock in a Sept. 21 note following the announcement of Frost’s retirement. Paris set a 12-month price target of $4.75 per share, or roughly an 95% increase over its current value of $2.44. Paris noted that Frost had expressed confidence in Ladenburg’s outlook even as he stepped down, which “suggests to us that he has no current plans to sell or reduce” his stake in the firm. The analysts “can attest to his long-term and successful approach to investing,” Paris wrote. The sell-off following word of the SEC charges against Frost left the value of Ladenburg's shares at 60% of its projected 2018 revenue, according to Paris, who describes the price of the firm’s stock as a discount on the ratio of 1.3-times-revenue for shares in its “closest proxy,” LPL Financial. “We expect continued growth going forward, as Ladenburg leverages its significant scale and capitalizes on further consolidation opportunities,” Paris wrote."

The case, Pepe v. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. f/k/a BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, No. 2:18-cv-14091 was filed on September 20, 2018. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the company and certain of its officers were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate Cocrystal's stock price; (2) this illicit scheme would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (3) the Company failed to abide by SEC disclosure regulations; and (4) as a result, the Company's statements about Cocrystal's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, on September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Phillip Frost, one of the Company's directors and shareholders, and others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, Phillip Frost allegedly participated in at least two unlawful pump-and-dump schemes involving various microcap companies. After the lawsuit was announced, Cocrystal's share price fell from $3.74 per share on September 6, 2018, to a closing price of $3.16 on September 11, 2018—a $0.58 or a 15.51% drop.

Sep 28, 2018 @ 2:10 pm By Bruce Kelly With the Securities and Exchange Commission cracking down on penny stocks, Merrill Lynch recently told its clients and financial advisers that it is putting restrictions on the purchase and sale of a large swath of low-priced securities. ""To ensure we are complying with SEC regulations and protecting the interests of our clients, we recently made changes to our policy regarding low-priced securities,"" a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, wrote in an email. As a result, certain transactions may be subject to restrictions, trading prohibitions or other limitations."" According to a source familiar with the moves, as of July, clients were no longer able to buy penny stocks through Merrill Lynch, and by the end of September, will no longer be able to sell them through the brokerage. The stocks will still be able to be transferred to a different account at another broker-dealer. After Merrill informed its clients it was not allowing the sale of the securities and gave advisers and clients to the end of the month to complete the trades, advisers raised concerns about closing down clients' positions, according to the source, who asked not to be named. The changes in Merrill Lynch's stance come as the SEC continues to warn investors about penny stock trading and the risks of market manipulation and higher volatility. The SEC on Friday said it had settled charges against clearing firm COR Clearing for failing to report suspicious sales of penny stock shares totaling millions of dollars. As part of the settlement, COR has agreed to exit a key penny stock clearing business by significantly limiting the sale of penny stocks deposited at COR, which was fined $800,000 and neither admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Earlier this month, Dr. Phillip Frost, the largest shareholder of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., was charged with fraud by the SEC for his involvement in a pump-and-dump, penny stock scheme. At the time, Dr. Frost was the non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann. He resigned from that position days after the SEC's filed its complaint. The new restrictions at Merrill do not affect securities listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, the source said, but apply only to those on the over-the-counter market, which is also known as the Pink Sheets. ""Other firms are saying we don't want these securities,"" the source said. Two years ago, UBS Financial Services created a similar policy regarding so-called high-risk stocks, including penny stocks. According to Merrill Lynch, a low-priced security is generally defined as having one or all of the following traits: securities that trade over-the-counter, or OTC, at or below $5 per share and have a market capitalization of less than or equal to $300 million; securities labeled as ""Caveat Emptor"" by the OTC Markets Group; and OTC securities that have limited or no financial disclosure information available. ""Caveat Emptor,"" Latin for ""let the buyer beware,"" is a designation generally used to inform investors that there may be reason to exercise additional care and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security, according to Merrill Lynch. After September 30, Merrill Lynch clients who want to sell existing positions will face additional compliance reviews that could slow down the transactions. Regulators have increasingly made their views of penny stocks known. The SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis published a white paper in 2016 highlighting the risks of investing in over-the-counter markets. The majority of investors lose money in the trades, and losses worsened for stocks that were the subject of promotional campaigns and those that had weaker disclosures, the SEC said. CNBC first reported the changes in penny stock policy at Merrill Friday morning.

1053951,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"What do you see when you look at this image? Tomás R. Guilarte asks his 8-year-old daughter Sofia this very question, curious about her young mind’s interpretation of this and several other pictures. They are all images of brain cells in culture he has brought home from work. Guilarte is dean of Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work and an expert in the fields of neuroscience and neurotoxicology. He is also a professor of environmental health sciences and cognitive neuroscience and imaging. Sofia tells him she sees a green octopus with bright blue eyes (upper left corner). He shows her a couple more, which Sofia says remind her of: 1) a galaxy, spreading itself infinitely 2) an orchid, due to its long curving stem, and 3) the roots of a tree, veining deep into the ground. 1) “A galaxy” 2) “An orchid” 3) “The roots of a tree.” Guilarte prepared the same activity for an attentive audience at “Beauty and the Brain: Connecting Art to Science,” as part of the Mixtape Mondays lecture series at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum. Mixtape Mondays features FIU faculty across disciplines, welcoming them to present their innovative research and studies in relation to art and the museum’s collection. Guilarte shared his research on the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants – such as heavy metals – on neurological and mental health. Presented with the colorful images of the cells, the room-filled audience gave similarly imaginative answers. Some said the “orchid” looked like a “chicken with a very long neck,” and the “roots” were reminiscent of the aerial view of a cityscape with its twinkling “lights,” which are actually synapses. Guilarte was excited to integrate art into the lecture, easing the understanding of these concepts by connecting notions that are seemingly unrelated. “I’m very visual. I see pictures, and just like the ones I showed, I begin to see shapes, animals and objects,” he said. “Providing an idea of the shapes and colors living within the organization and structure of the brain is a great way to communicate these ideas and connect art to science.” Tomás R. Guilarte This exercise, like any puzzle, is an excellent workout for the brain, one that Guilarte says promotes neuroplasticity (the creation of new neural connections) and neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells). And other studies also agree, proving that regularly practicing art enhances brain connectivity. But keeping our brains healthy is a difficult task when considering the cluster of harmful compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis. “We live in a soup of chemicals, we have to minimize our exposure and properly feed our brains,” said Guilarte. Because our brain’s susceptibility to injury from exposure to environmental pollutants is remarkably high, it is vital to prevent the loss of neurons and promote the growth of new ones. “As we age, neurons die, and many neurodegenerative diseases – like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s – are principally diseases of aging,” said Guilarte. “But we are beginning to understand how these pollutants can initiate and/or accelerate the disease.” Though the traditional route of adopting a balanced diet and exercise regimen along with not smoking is still highly recommended, Guilarte emphasized the somewhat unconventional yet impactful role of art – both its consumption and creation – in the birth of new neurons and their integration into brain circuits that can enhance learning and memory. “And though genetics matter, it appears art is exceptional for our minds and our longevity,” he said. So, the next time you stop by a museum, keep a few things in mind about art: it improves brain function, brain wave patterns, fine-motor skills, creativity, and our social and emotional development. It may now help us lead healthier lives too. Mixtape Mondays is hosted once a month at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum. For the museum’s event calendar, click here.

(NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) and Opko Health, were largely responsible for the declines in the Tel Aviv 35 Index in the past three sessions. Teva fell 4.5% today, making it a 10% drop in three days, and bringing the company's market cap down to NIS 85 billion. Opko Health fell 6.5% today, for a 17% drop over the three days. Its market cap is now at NIS 7.9 billion. Perrigo, the third largest pharma stock on the Tel Aviv 35 list, remained fairly flat over the same period. RELATED ARTICLES IBI sees annual sales of $1.6-2.4 billion for Teva migraine drug FDA approves Teva migraine drug Analysts see growth on Teva's horizon Still too soon to talk about Teva's recovery document.write(ad_handler.google_div(article_banner_object)) The falls in Teva are attributed to two possible causes. The leading factor is apparently the recommendation by a panel of the European Medicines Agency to approve Eli Lilly's migraine treatment. Eli Lilly's drug works in a similar way to Teva's migraine drug, which was recently approved for sale and which is considered one of the two great hopes for the future of the company's innovative business, alongside its drug for Tourette syndrome. The migraine prevention market has started to become very crowded, and the race to the top is close. The first drug in the category, from Novartis and Amgen, was approved in May, and was given a low market penetration price. Teva's product was approved for sale in the US two weeks ago, and not enough time has passed to assess the difference in the pace of market adoption of the two products. Eli Lilly's product should be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the next month or two, and the positive recommendation by the European panel raises the probability of it being approved in the US. A fourth product by a smaller company called Alder has passed a Phase III clinical trial but there is still no target date for a response by the FDA. Against the background of the approval of its migraine product two weeks ago, Teva's share price rose 12% within a few days, but it has now subsided to the level it was at before the approval. This is a frequent occurrence for pharma companies that receive a drug approval that was expected: the initial enthusiasm passes, anyone who was only waiting for the event exits the stock, while those looking to the longer term start to take into account not just the glad tidings of the approval but also the challenges of the marketplace, which in this particular case are considerable. A competitor to Copaxone? The second factor possibly contributing to the weakness in Teva is the report by a new contender in the multiple sclerosis treatment market, TG Therapeutics, of good results in a Phase II trial for its product. The results look very promising, although the trial was carried out on just 22 patients, and it will be some time before the product reaches the market, if at all. It may be that by that time Teva's dependence on multiple sclerosis (with its flagship original drug Copaxone) will substantially reduce, but still, TG Therapeutics looks like an interesting potential competitor. As for Opko, the company is still under the cloud of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe of Opko CEO Phillip Frost and of the company itself on suspicion of share price manipulation. The affair broke on September 7, and since then the company's market cap has dipped 35%. It recovered slightly on September 14 when Frost publicly rejected the accusations against him and spoke out against the SEC for not having requested his response before revealing the investigation.

1015016,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 18:26 EST, 25 September 2018 | Updated: 18:26 EST, 25 September 2018 View comments Office politics: Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein Ructions at Goldman Sachs where outgoing chief executive Lloyd Blankfein’s new office irritates some of the bank’s New York staff. It’s claimed the palatial berth, where bearded Lloyd will roost during his new advisory role, is costing upwards of £350,000. Goldman insists the figure is less than £75,000 but either way it’s at odds with a recent expenses crackdown. One banker moans he had a claim rejected for a piece of fruit. Not a desperately happy ship, by all accounts. Barclays boss Jes Staley met with the Duke of York this week at Buckingham Palace, an opportunity no doubt for Jes to garner Andrew’s extensive business insight. The pair have a mutual friend in former investment banker and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who lobbied unsuccessfully for Jes to be made Barclays’s chief back in 2012 after Bob Diamond got canned. The job instead went to Antony Jenkins, dismissed by Epstein, not entirely groundlessly, as ‘an internal dweeb’. In-the-pink hedgie Crispin Odey remains scornful of David Cameron’s premiership, telling Financial News: ‘Once you met David, you realised he was going to do absolutely nothing. He was so unbrave.’ Will Dave bother to retaliate in his long overdue memoirs? They’re now rivalling the 55-year wait for Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, albeit without the anticipation. Debenhams’s retail chief Steven Cook yesterday appeared alongside his new menswear head Andrew Lepp, who warned journalists to expect an improvement at the ailing department store’s shelves in the coming months. Cook interjected: ‘Months? Month! Or you’re fired.’ He was joking of course. Or least we must assume. Outré Mr Cook has a shaved head, a Rasputin beard and that menacing look of a man who delights in strangling poultry. Comcast boss Brian Roberts is rumoured to be dropping by Sky’s headquarters today following his £30billion acquisition of the broadcaster. Certain pinko outlets have claimed the sprawling, West London estate is known as ‘Skyberia’. Oddly, nobody I know ever calls it that. But making the Murdoch Empire sound cold and horrid is compulsory among the liberal media. Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

1053951,11/13/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Papa John’s International, Inc. (“OPKO” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: OPK) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, and index under 18-cv-23924, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons other than Defendants who purchased or otherwise acquired OPKO securities between September 26, 2013 and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are a shareholder who purchased OPKO securities between September 26, 2013, and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until November 13, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here to join this class action] OPKO purports to be a healthcare company that engages in the diagnostics and pharmaceuticals business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) OPKO and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Phillip Frost (“Frost”), were participants in a “pump-and-dump” scheme designed, in part, to artificially inflate the price of various stocks, allowing Defendant Frost, among others, to reap millions of dollars in unlawful profits; and (ii) as a result, OPKO’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On September 7, 2018, the SEC issued a press release entitled “SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes”. The press release stated, in part, that the SEC had “charged a group of 10 individuals and 10 associated entities for their participation in long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock.” The press release named both OPKO and Frost as defendants. Following this news, OPKO’s stock price fell $1.01 per share, or more than 18%, before NASDAQ halted the trading of OPKO stock on September 7, 2018, at 2:34 p.m. EDT at $4.58 per share. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Sep 21, 2018 @ 9:54 am By Bruce Kelly Dr. Phillip Frost, who was charged this month with fraud, said Thursday evening that he was retiring as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. Dr. Frost and nine other individuals were charged Sept. 7 in a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit with participating in ""long running schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock,"" according to the SEC's complaint. Dr. Frost is the largest shareholder in Ladenburg Thalman, controlling about 36% of the broker-dealer's shares Along with his role at Ladenburg Thalmann, Dr. Frost is a well-known biotech investor in South Florida. Since March 2007, he has served as chairman of the board and CEO of OPKO Health Inc., a multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company, according to Ladenburg Thalmann's annual proxy statement. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network, which are home to 4,300 independent contractor brokers and financial advisers. Richard Lampen, Ladenburg Thalmann's CEO and president, will replace Dr. Frost as chairman. Adam Malamed, the firm's executive vice president and chief operating officer, will join the firm's board of directors. ""I have decided to retire from the Ladenburg board and will concentrate my efforts on OPKO Health and my philanthropic interests,"" Dr. Frost said in a statement, making no mention of the SEC's fraud charges. ""As a long-term shareholder, I am confident in Ladenburg's outlook and look forward to its continued growth and success."" ""Ladenburg would not be where it is today without [Dr. Frost's] many contributions, and his presence in the boardroom will be sorely missed,"" Mr. Lampen said. Some had been calling for Dr. Frost to resign, saying that the reputational risk he created for Ladenburg would only increase the longer he stayed with the firm. The SEC's complaint describes in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off what the SEC called ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges.
