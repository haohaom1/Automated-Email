1096862,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"Photograph by Adam Powell A collection of fire trucks from throughout Caswell, Person, Orange, and Rockingham Counties convened at Prospect Hill Volunteer Fire Department this past weekend for ISO rating testing with the North Carolina Office of Fire Marshal. The ISO rating process is intended not only to help local rural fire districts improve their service, but also to potentially lower homeowner insurance rates in the community. Posted: Tuesday, August 28, 2018 6:27 pm Caswell County undergoes fire ISO inspection testing By Adam Powell Messenger Editor caswellmessenger.com On the morning of Saturday, August 25, a large collection of volunteer firefighters from throughout Caswell County and surrounding communities made their way to the Prospect Hill Fire Department for the first round of testing in the county’s ISO inspection process. Caswell County, despite being entirely made up of non-municipally funded volunteer fire districts, is undergoing the ISO inspection process in order to improve its service to the local community, while also potentially reducing the home insurance liability on local consumers. The ISO inspection process has been two years in the making, as local firefighters countywide have been undergoing specialized training in order to help maximize the ISO rating scores that were tested over the weekend. ISO representative Tom Ramp joined numerous state fire officials at Saturday’s testing. Also on hand were a pair of Caswell County Commissioners - Sterling Carter and Rick McVey - as well as County Manager Bryan Miller. It’s a unique thing to see rural volunteer firemen, without necessarily the pressure that larger municipally-funded fire districts have to maintain certain ISO rating, undergoing training and testing that typically only takes place within larger, more heavily-populated fire districts around the state. It seemed to inspire the state fire inspection officials on hand at Saturday’s testing. “It’s been a long time coming. I’ve got more training hours up here in Caswell County than I’ve got at my own fire department back home,” Vernon Ward, Senior Field Inspector for the North Carolina Office of State Fire Marshal said. “I’ve been up here the last two years, helping get this going. “We’d like to use you all as an example with other counties to do this. Because this really helps us out, and hopefully it helps you all out,” “I want to thank you all a whole lot for getting prepared and doing this as a whole. I think in a month or so, when we come back, I think we’re gonna see good fruit to bear,” Ward added. “Vernon has got a property tax assessment from the county office, but I took care of it for him,” Vernon Massengill of the Yanceyville Fire Department joked. “We do this from Murphy to Manteo,” added Derrick Clouston, Deputy Director of Fire and Rescue Training at OSFM. “And to see this type of dedication in what you’re doing for your community and your county, it’s unreal. On behalf of (N.C. Insurance) Commissioner (Mike) Causey, and the whole Office of the State Fire Marshal, we just want to say thank you for having our staff here. Thank you for the warmth you’ve shown us.” “We’re looking forward to seeing what kind of fruit this bears,” Clouston added. “Because I’m gonna tell you - this is unheard of, what you’re doing. You’re making history. And I want to congratulate you on being willing to step forward and do this is a community. We just want to thank you for all your help and all your hard work.” Fire districts across North Carolina are given insurance ratings from 1 to 9, with 1 being the best possible score. Some of the factors that go into Ratings Inspections includes Emergency Communications, Fire Departments, local water supplies, and community risk reduction. Scores of 1 typically only go to large urban fire districts. In North Carolina, the Charlotte Fire Department holds the only Class 1 ISO rating. Seven fire districts across the state hold a 2 ISO rating - almost all large, densely populated cities such as Raleigh, Durham, and Greensboro, among others. Numerous rural fire districts across the state have an ISO rating of 9 - the lowest possible score. Factors that typically result in a 9 ISO rating include long distances to make service calls, a lack of water supply, and districts only having one or two fire trucks to respond to calls. Although multiple Caswell County fire districts have a rating of 9, the ISO inspection process could move certain local districts up to an ISO rating of 7, which could save homeowners approximately $75 dollars per $100,000 of home value in home insurance premiums. “We’re doing just like we’ve been practicing for two years,” said Massengill to the assembled firemen. “Today’s the day we’ve been working for for a long time. You’ve practiced hard. You’ve done well. We just need to show these guys. Don’t be scared of these (state inspection) guys. I know most of these guys. Most of these guys have been in the position we’re in. They want to help us.” Some of the fire departments that were represented at the ISO inspection included Yanceyville, Prospect Hill, Providence, Roxboro, Yanceyville, Hurdle Mills, Boonsboro, Cherry Grove, Leasburg, Casville, Williamsburg, CEFFO Fire/Rescue, Semora, Pelham, Ruffin, and Milton. Caswell, Orange, Person, and Rockingham Counties were all represented. “I’d like to thank the out-of-county guys. I think we’ve got Williamsburg here. Ruffin is here. Hurdle Mills is here. Yanceyville Road and Roxboro, and CEFFO,” Massengill said. Testing field sites were located at Ridgefield Road, Baldwin Farm, Kimbro Road, and along Old Highway 62. The dump site was at Kimbro Road, while the fill site was along Old Highway 62. Tests included filling trucks, dumping trucks, driving the truck against a running clock, handling hoses, and dealing with suction, among other challenges. Drivers were timed in 200-foot increments, whether they were dumping items or filling up. At the fill site, the timing started when the trucks started moving, prompted by a whistle. When the truck was filled up, the drivers were able to leave. At the dump sites, inspection officials monitored how quickly - and how safely - the firefighters conducted their dumps. Upon leaving Ridgefield Road, there was a dump tank along the Painter Road extension. “We just need you to get rid of your water - most of it - before the next fill site,” Massengill explained. “The biggest thing is safety,” Ward said. “There’s a lot of trucks moving, a lot of stuff going on. So the priority of this whole exercise is safety. You want to get good times. You want to do things correctly. But we’ve got to do it safely.” Fire personnel handling hose and setting up drills during the field site setups were required to be in boots, bunker pants, helmets with chin straps fastened, and gloves. Observers were required to wear traffic vests. “We’ve got to record these times. Of course, the better the time, the better,” Ward continued. “But the biggest thing is being safe.” Massengill thanked the Prospect Hill Fire Department not only for helping set up the ISO inspection by getting everyone together and organizing the trucks, but by providing a meal for the firefighters and the state inspection officials. “I’d like to thank Prospect Hill Fire Department. These guys have been so good as to do this. They got all our trucks lined up,” Massengill said. In approximately a month, the ISO officials will be back in Caswell County to provide data from the testing session, and to let local fire officials know the areas in which they need to improve to get better ISO ratings in the future.

Diamond – once branded the unacceptable face of banking due to his sky-high pay packets – could be hit by a rebellion over his role as chairman at Atlas Mara’s annual meeting tomorrow. Disgraced: Bob Diamond was once branded the unacceptable face of banking due to his sky-high pay packets Shareholder advice groups Glass Lewis and ISS claim he is not independent enough for the job because he co-founded the firm. Glass Lewis has urged investors to vote against his reappointment, and ISS has told them to abstain. Diamond was forced to quit Barclays in 2012 over the Libor rate-rigging scandal. He founded Atlas Mara in 2013, but shares have since fallen by 80 per cent. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

1014074,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"August 27, 2018 The 100,000-square-foot complex is the first College-owned residence downtown since Colby’s move to Mayflower Hill in the mid-20th century Marking an important moment in the history of Colby College and the City of Waterville, the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, housing 200 students, faculty, and staff, opened this month in downtown Waterville. Part of a broader revitalization effort undertaken by the College, city leaders, and local businesspeople and community organizations, the complex is bringing energy to downtown and will ultimately deepen the connection between the Colby community and the broader Waterville community. Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons as night falls over Waterville.

Through their research, coursework, and service, students will participate in efforts of nonprofits and other organizations and contribute expertise and analysis to help the community better understand a range of issues and how to solve complex challenges. “The opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons marks a pivotal moment for Colby and the city it has proudly called home for two centuries,” said President David A. Greene. “This development is a critical step in physically reconnecting the city and the College and helping to support a vibrant Main Street for businesses, residents, and visitors.” Student lounges in the Alfond Commons allow for conversations and space to study. Photo: Copyright Trent Bell Photography Civic Engagement Re-envisioned With the opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, Colby is implementing a new and innovative program for civic engagement and community partnerships. Students residing in the complex are required to participate in civic engagement activity that will connect them to community organizations, enhancing their learning and contributing to the important work of these groups. “We are developing a set of experiences that support our local partners while at the same time preparing our students to be active participants who will create positive change in the communities,” said Dean of the College Karlene Burrell-McRae ’94, who oversees the efforts. “Our hope is that this program can become a national model for civic engagement.” Commitment to Downtown Increasing residential density on Main Street has been a central element of a broad strategy to make Waterville a lively, welcoming place for residents and visitors. In the past three years, Colby has renovated a historic bank building that now houses the global tech company CGI, as well as Portland Pie Co. on the retail level. Colby is currently developing plans for a hotel that will be located at the other end of Main Street and bring more visitors to downtown, and Colby has partnered with Waterville Creates! on a center for contemporary art and film, also on Main Street. “A primary goal of our downtown efforts has been to catalyze outside investment and commercial growth, bringing energy and a sustainable economic model to the city,” said Vice President of Planning Brian Clark. “We expect the opening to add to the incredible momentum we are seeing in Waterville, with new businesses opening, new jobs coming to the city, and overall growth in population and real estate activity.” The Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons is located on the site of a former parking lot, where buildings were demolished during urban renewal. It marks the first new construction on the downtown section of Main Street in more than 50 years. Supporting Community and Commerce The first level of the complex was designed to support community organizations as well as businesses that will complement the existing mix on Main Street and benefit from being located in brand-new retail spaces with up-to-date infrastructure. Camden National Bank will be moving into the southeast corner of the building this fall. Colby’s investments in downtown, which currently total $65 million, have begun to catalyze additional activity. In the past year the downtown area has seen more real estate transactions than in several previous years combined, which is resulting in both new jobs and an increased property tax base. Building Details The living room in one of the 52 student apartments in Alfond Commons. The Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons includes 52 student apartments and eight faculty/staff apartments. Student apartments either include four or six single-occupancy bedrooms and two bathrooms, a living area, and a kitchen to allow students to prepare their own meals. The complex includes academic and study spaces, including a classroom on the second floor and a reading room on the fifth floor, two two-story social lounges for students, two laundry rooms, a small fitness room, and a yoga/wellness studio. On the ground level, the Chace Community Forum provides a large meeting and event space that will be available to community partners at no charge. The Waterville City Council and planning board will also hold their meetings in the new space. Camden National Bank will move into the building this fall, and other retail tenants are currently being identified. A Colby-owned parking lot on Appleton Street will be the primary parking for students, and residents are encouraged to park on campus and use the continuously running shuttle to and from Mayflower Hill. Student residents of Alfond Commons are in their junior and senior years and were identified based on their commitment to civic engagement. The majority of students will move into the building Sept. 3 (Labor Day). A ribbon cutting will take place Sept. 6 at 10 a.m., followed by a reception and student-led tours.
