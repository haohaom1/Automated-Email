Lord Darling of Roulanish definitely has, mixing anecdotes from the dark days of October 2008 with considered criticism of the Conservative government’s austerity drive and its links to the Brexit vote. Gordon Brown, not so much, with his warning that we are “sleepwalking into a future crisis” coming across as untargeted doomsaying. And then there are the bankers. There’s been silence from those who run institutions that either blew up or survived only with the help of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.

But, according to the SEC’s rules, the commission was well within its rights to blindside the 81-year-old entrepreneur.

1053951,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Partner of Alum in the News,"Miami biotech billionaire and philanthropist Dr. Phillip Frost says he was stunned by the stock trading fraud charges filed against him earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Frost denies the allegations, saying in a statement, they ""are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts."" Frost declined WLRN's invitation for an interview. In an interview with WLRN, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton did not address the charges against Frost, citing ""a longstanding commission policy"" not to comment on enforcement actions. He also refused to discuss Frost's claim that the SEC ""departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” However, Clayton did address the type of stock trading his agency accuses Frost of conducting and the agency's investigative role. Frost made his fortune in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. He is a dermatologist by training and has bought, built and sold companies. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to groups throughout South Florida. He still runs OPKO Health, a publicly traded drug and diagnostic company headquartered in Miami. The SEC accuses Frost of participating in a scheme manipulating the price of low-cost, thinly traded stocks. Nine others are charged along with Frost. They’re accused of buying shares of three companies, touting their business prospects and then selling when the stock prices went up. It’s called a 'pump and dump' scheme. ""Pump and dump is a manipulation scheme that has been around about as long as markets have been around,"" says Clayton. Frost says he remains a long-term investor in both companies included the federal charges. The Securities and Exchange Commission claims Frost made at least $1 million in the trades. Together the scheme allegedly made $27 million dollars for those accused of taking part. Here is an edited excerpt of WLRN's interview with SEC Chairman Jay Clayton. WLRN: Explain where the illegal action happens in (a pump and dump trade). If an investor is successful they may want to brag about how successful they are. Is that considered a pump? Clayton: You're raising a very important issue, which is how do you differentiate between legitimate market activity and a scheme. And we try very hard to make sure that when we do bring actions as a commission, that we're not adversely affecting legitimate market activity. What are some of the hallmark signs of a pump and dump that the Securities and Exchange Commission uses as it reviews those kinds of transactions to decipher between what may be illegal activity and what could be legitimate market activity? I'll give you a stark example that the company actually doesn't do anything...or no meaningful business activity or no meaningful change in its business activity despite increasing in value by a substantial amount. What's the threat of these pump and dump schemes? People people use the word confidence a lot. Confidence is critical in our marketplace. To the extent people are doing things that would undermine confidence, it's important to deter them or stop them. I know you won't address the specific charges against Dr. Frost and others that were filed earlier this month by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company that Frost heads up, OPKO Health, released a statement saying, ""The SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to filing the complaint."" Again, I'm not asking you to address the specifics of the against Dr. Frost, but does the SEC usually tell targets about possible charges before they're filed? It's not appropriate for me to comment. Generally speaking, is there a practice that the commission has in engaging with a person of interest in these types of cases prior to charges being filed? We have a number of policies and procedures in place but I'm not going to comment on a specific one in this context. Would one of those procedures be discussing potential charges? Like I said, I'm not going to comment on specific procedures, but I can tell you that we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we do things in an appropriate manner. Would one of those policies and procedures be the process that OPKO Health describes? Like I said I'm not going to comment. (With) an enforcement action involvving a fairly well-known corporate executive, is that something that you would be made aware of prior to the action being taken? I'm not going to comment on our on our policies and procedures. We handle matters the same regardless of who's involved. That's that's the right way to approach these things."

1016437,11/14/2018,N/A,Publicly/Communictn,xfu21,Trustee in the News,"British rider 'starting afresh' after string of disappointments in 2018 It has been a season to forget for Steve Cummings. Or maybe not. The British rider has had a frustrating and winless campaign, but is determined now to use it as a force for change.Related ArticlesCummings: Best way to respond after Worlds snub was to carry onCummings waiting for his chance in Volta a CatalunyaCummings keeping calm in the eye of the stormCummings: I have to fight for my Tour de France spot10 riders who need to save their seasons “It’s good you know, sometimes you need a season like that,” he told Cyclingnews at the Vuelta a España, where he had his Grand Tour fill after missing out on selection for the Tour de France. “You rip everything you’ve been doing apart and it’s an opportunity to change some things and go forward. I think it’s just given me a chance to explore everything really, lots of new ideas. That’s how I see it, anyway.” Cummings had enjoyed a highly successful spell since joining Dimension Data in 2015, and seemed liberated and rejuvenated, even in his late 30’s. He won a stage of the Tour de France in his first year and then added another in a 2016 season that also included wins at Tirreno-Adriatico, Vuelta al Pais Vasco, Criterium du Dauphine, and the overall title at the Tour of Britain. In 2017 he claimed the road race and time trial double at the British national championships and then a stage of the Giro della Toscana later in the year. This year, however, he has no wins and has failed to finish half the races he has started. His programme was altered by the team, and the situation was only compounded by the long injury list at the team. For someone who describes himself as ‘goal-driven’, having to fill gaps at late notice was far from ideal. On top of the Tour de France snub, Cummings was informed last week that he hadn’t been selected for the British team for the upcoming World Championships. He has clashed with British Cycling over selection in the past but this time, though disappointed, he could see it coming. “You think about the Worlds when we won with Cav and that was what I was hoping for – that we could go and someone could win the Worlds and I could be part of that again. It wasn’t like I thought I could win the Worlds or anything like that. Of course, it’s disappointing but it’s the way it is, isn’t it, I just haven’t performed as well as I could have this year, for one reason or another,” Cummings said. “I think the course suits the Yates brothers, I’d say they were favourites and I think the team has to be what’s best to help them. It looks like a really good team. Personally of course it’s disappointing but to see how British cycling has grown and how many riders we have for different roles, that’s really cool. We have super talented riders coming through and everyone there deserves their place. I’m excited to watch and wish everyone well.” Cummings has made it to the end of the Vuelta. He was present in a couple of breakaways but has had a quiet three weeks and was mostly seen in his favoured position at the very rear of the peloton. Rather than trying to salvage something from his trying season in Spain – and at his upcoming outings in the autumn Italian Classics – he is already laying the foundations for the next one. “Doing this Vuelta is almost like starting afresh into next year. I’m looking at everything in my daily routine to try and get back to the level I had before. That’s the goal,” he said. “I think you have to remain open. As soon as you close off to new ideas and new thinking it’s not a good way, so you have to just have to try and remain open and look to improve all the time. Perhaps over time you find certain things that work well for you or did work well for you. Sometimes a bad experience can be a good one because it just forces you to go over everything you’re doing and make some positive changes.” There is no specific area of his regime that Cummings has identified needs changing. His is a global approach, drilling right down as deep as the meaning of why he gets on his bike every day. “I think I’m just in this mode now of just kind of exploring all the possibilities, the hows and whys. It’s difficult to explain… it’s nothing I haven’t done before, it’s just going over everything, like pulling everything apart, and asking, ‘Why? Why?’. “A lot of it is not really on the bike, it’s off the bike. If you plan like that off the bike, which is how work anyway – I’m very much goal driven – then going on the bike is just part of the process and it’s a lot easier for me to understand what I’m doing. “I’m looking for new ideas, new things, and new thinking. Maybe I don’t change anything or maybe I change small things that make a big difference. I think it’s going back to having a really good solid plan that we’ll deliver, and sort of the desire and commitment to believe in that plan, and then execute it.” 'It's almost like I get more respect from Italian people,' says British rider Dimension Data rider finding form at Spanish stage race Dimension Data rider looking to maximise his remaining time at the top © Immediate Media Company Ltd. 2017 The website is owned and published by Immediate Media Company Limited."

In a statement emailed to reporters Friday afternoon, Frost said he was “stunned” by the SEC’s civil complaint, filed a week ago. He said he believed the SEC had “departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action.” The SEC declined to comment. The agency alleges that Frost — along with nine other defendants and related companies including Frost’s OPKO Health Inc.—manipulated the share price of multiple small-cap drug and health companies by touting their potential on trading websites without disclosing their ownership positions. The SEC alleges Frost made more than $1 million from the purported scheme. As of Friday morning, Forbes listed Frost’s net worth at $2.4 billion. “The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,” Frost said in his statement. “I invested in two of the entities identified in the complaint. These investments were made because I understood the entities presented promising medical developments and a real opportunity to deliver value for shareholders. I remain a significant long-term shareholder in both companies.” No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. Though the SEC complaint did not name the companies involved, multiple media outlets have reported them as Cocrystal Pharma (formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.), and MabVax Theraputics Holdings. Each trades at less than $5 a share. Frost has been an active investor in small-cap companies for at least a decade, SEC filings show. In January, MabVax disclosed that it was under investigation by the SEC. Trading in Miami-based OPKO, which Frost runs, was halted Sept. 7 and reopened about 1 p.m. Friday. Shares closed down approximately 15 percent Friday, to $3.90. The company has also denied any wrongdoing. Frost remains on the board of directors at the University of Miami, the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum of Science and Coconut Grove Bancshares. “Nothing is more important to me than my integrity and I am deeply proud of the role I have played over many decades in developing medicines and diagnostic tools that have improved many lives,” Frost said in his statement Friday. “I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” View More Video Real-time updates and all local stories you want right in the palm of your hand."

""I was stunned by the SEC's lawsuit and deny the allegations it contains against me,"" Frost said. ""It was particularly disturbing that the SEC departed from its own longstanding practice of providing advance notice and a meaningful opportunity to address their questions in advance of filing an action."" According to the SEC, Frost and nine associates manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies during a five-year period from 2013 to 2018, generating over $27 million. Frost is accused of taking part in two of the three schemes led by Barry Honig. According to the SEC, the group acquired large amounts of stock at deep discounts, then illegally promoted and manipulated trading to boost the price. Once the market price was inflated, the SEC charges the group dumped its shares into the inflated market. The SEC claims Frost, the founder of pharmaceutical company OPKO, and the group reaped millions off unsuspecting investors. ""The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,"" Frost said.

I remain a significant long-term investor in both companies.” Citing reports by other media outlets, the Miami Herald reported Friday that Cocrystal Pharma and MabVAx Therapuetics Holdings are the two of the three unidentified companies in the SEC lawsuit. “The allegations against me are belied by common sense, my history of supporting promising scientific technology, and the facts,” Frost said in his statement. “Nothing is more important to me than my integrity … I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name.” – Mike Seemuth All rights reserved © 2018 The Real Deal is a registered Trademark of Korangy Publishing Inc."
