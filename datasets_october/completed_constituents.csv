White, first elected in 2014, added a couple thousand dollars to his war chest during the first couple weeks of the month, bringing his overall fundraising total to $187,261, with just shy of $100,000 of that money still left to spend seven weeks out from the Nov. 6 general election. White, whose District 4 seat includes much of south and western Hillsborough County, faces Democratic challenger Andrew Davis in the general election. To date, Davis has raised $7,879 for his campaign, though he only has about $850 left in the tank. Crist, the current District 2 commissioner, is running for the countywide District 5 seat held by Hagan. His new report showed a healthy $16,550 in receipts alongside less than $1,000 in spending, bringing his campaign’s overall total to $147,630 with just shy of $56,000 on hand last Friday. Crist’s overall fundraising beats the combined records of his two challengers, Democratic nominee Mariella Smith and unaffiliated candidate Joe Kotvas. Smith has raised just over $99,000 so far and has $44,000 in the bank, while Kotvas has raised $10,125 and has and has $575 left to spend. Hagan, who is looking to move from his countywide seat into Crist’s northern Hillsborough one, only showed $1,500 in new money collected during the two-week reporting period, though his overall fundraising efforts dwarf those of his lone challenger, Democratic nominee Angela Birdsong. Through Sept. 14, Hagan had raised more than $487,000 in hard money and had more than $350,000 of that cash ready to deploy. Birdsong, meanwhile, has raised $27,817 and has $6,260 on hand. The fourth seat on the 2018 ballot, the countywide District 7, won’t feature any incumbents. Todd Marks, who overcame a major fundraising gap to defeat Aakash Patel in the Republican primary election, currently leads in overall fundraising in the three-way race between him, Democratic nominee Kimberly Overman, and Green Party candidate Kim O’Connor. Marks, an attorney, received $16,575 in contributions in his new report, which accounts for most of his on-hand cash after the bruising primary battle. He’s now raised nearly $176,000 overall and has a little less than $18,000 in his campaign account. Overman, meanwhile, has raised $77,321 thus far and had $13,300 banked, while O’Connor is currently the cash leader with $26,000 raised and all but $50 of that money still in her campaign account. The District 2, 4, 5 and 7 seats will all be on the Nov. 6 general election ballot, alongside other county government seats including sheriff and four school board districts.

Janice,Griffith,['http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/wife-honors-late-husbands-legacy-with-1-million-gift.php'],b'1072',"['The late Richard “Dick” Perles ’62 will impact generations of faculty at William & Mary through a $1 million gift made in his memory to fund a government professorship at the university. Perles’ wife, Janice Griffith, created the endowment to honor her husband’s lifelong commitment to public service. Perles, who passed away in 2005, was an accomplished lawyer who was known for his community involvement, sharp sense of humor and quick wit. “I wanted to honor Dick for his extraordinary life and his civic participation,” Griffith said. “He always expressed a great interest in William & Mary and enjoyed his education there so I thought it would be especially appropriate to honor his memory with this gift.” By providing salary, research and teaching support, the Richard S. Perles Professorship in Government will ensure that dedicated and talented faculty continue to enrich the academic enterprise. “We are enormously grateful to be able to honor distinguished faculty members in government with this named professorship,” said Dean of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences Kate Conley. “The gift will help us recruit and retain top-notch faculty as well as recognize their outstanding work. It will also let our faculty know how valued they are by alumni, and I think that sends a very powerful message.” Perles, a government major, loved being surrounded by history as he pursued his undergraduate degree on William & Mary’s storied campus. He was especially interested in American history, governance and contemporary politics while he was a student. After graduating from William & Mary, Perles earned his law degree from Fordham University School of Law. He and Griffith met in New York City and forged a bond that spanned 30 years of marriage. Perles, whose legal work included real estate transactions and commercial and tort litigation, worked at New York City law firms before opening his own law practice in New York and Connecticut. The couple relocated to Atlanta in 1996 upon the appointment of Griffith, a law professor, as the dean of Georgia State University’s College of Law. Perles again set up a general practice law office. Now a law professor at Suffolk University in Boston, Griffith teaches State and Local Government Law. “Dick was the consummate lawyer. He was adept at both counseling and advocacy. In addition, he possessed sound judgment that made him a natural leader as well as an outstanding lawyer,” Griffith said. “He helped his clients plan for the future, even in areas of the law unmarked by settled boundary lines. He met the ideals of the lawyer-statesman by providing leadership in his community with exceptional wisdom and skill. Dick believed that a lawyer’s professional duties should include civic participation. ” Dick served on local government boards, often providing the leadership needed to effectuate new initiatives, Griffith said. He also provided pro bono legal services to community groups in need of a strong advocate for their causes. Griffith said her husband had a passion for protecting our natural resources. He served on the Stratford, Connecticut Waterfront Harbor Management Commission and was a forceful advocate for the protection of Stratford’s Great Meadows Marsh when its existence was threatened by potential development. In Atlanta, his leadership in the late 1990s led to the creation of a Grant Park Conservancy with a mission to restore and preserve Atlanta’s oldest park, Griffith said.

Schupf, LL.D. ’06, the Colby College Museum of Art will expand into downtown Waterville, offering the community and visitors a chance to engage with spectacular works in a vibrant setting. The contemporary gallery will be named in his honor. As part of the downtown arts complex announced earlier this week by Colby and Waterville Creates!, the Schupf gallery will be located in a transformed historical building at 93 Main Street. Located on the ground level, it will feature a rotating program of contemporary art exhibitions. Regularly scheduled gallery events will be held in the space. “The Schupf gallery will be a vital part of the new center for contemporary art and film, which has been conceived to create a hub of activity on Main Street and cement Waterville’s place as a destination for the arts,” said Colby President David A. Greene. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond. We are so fortunate to have his friendship and to benefit from his vision for institutions that serve the public good.” Schupf, who is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors and served as a College trustee for many years, has made several significant contributions to Colby, making possible the Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz and the Paul J. Schupf Sculpture Court at the Colby College Museum of Art; the Paul J. Schupf Scientific Computing Center; the Anthony-Mitchell-Schupf residence hall; and the Colby College-Memorial Sloan Kettering Summer Internship. A serious collector, Schupf has also donated numerous works of art, including significant works by Alex Katz and a major gift of more than 150 works on paper by Richard Serra. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” said Schupf. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped onboard immediately. The donation of the Paul J. Schupf gallery for contemporary art in downtown Waterville is just another manifestation of my admiration for the College and its museum.” “Paul has been such a great friend to the Colby museum, and once again we are humbled by, and grateful for, his remarkable generosity,” said Sharon Corwin, the Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator of the museum. “We see this gallery as a front door to the Colby museum and an opportunity to integrate more deeply into our community, and Paul’s support makes that possible.” On March 5 Colby and Waterville Creates! announced plans to transform the downtown building into a new center for contemporary art and film, making Waterville a singular destination for the arts in Maine. The project, which includes a significant fundraising effort, features new and renovated space to support leading programs in visual arts, theater, film, and arts education. The larger complex will also include the Waterville Opera House, Common Street Arts, and the Maine Film Center and Railroad Square Cinema. It is expected to attract even more visitors to a newly vibrant Main Street, anchored by a planned hotel a block from Castonguay Square and the Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, housing 200 Colby students, faculty, and staff. A technology center at 173 Main Street, housing software consultant CGI, Colby employees, and a student business incubator, opened last fall. Founded in 1959, the Colby College Museum of Art comprises five wings, more than 9,000 works of art, and more than 38,000 square feet of exhibition space. The museum also maintains a significant collection of contemporary American art, including works by Alex Katz (with more than 900 works represented), Agnes Martin, Sol LeWitt, Maya Lin, Kara Walker, Elizabeth Murray, Martin Puryear, Terry Winters, and Julie Mehretu.
