White, first elected in 2014, added a couple thousand dollars to his war chest during the first couple weeks of the month, bringing his overall fundraising total to $187,261, with just shy of $100,000 of that money still left to spend seven weeks out from the Nov. 6 general election. White, whose District 4 seat includes much of south and western Hillsborough County, faces Democratic challenger Andrew Davis in the general election. To date, Davis has raised $7,879 for his campaign, though he only has about $850 left in the tank. Crist, the current District 2 commissioner, is running for the countywide District 5 seat held by Hagan. His new report showed a healthy $16,550 in receipts alongside less than $1,000 in spending, bringing his campaign’s overall total to $147,630 with just shy of $56,000 on hand last Friday. Crist’s overall fundraising beats the combined records of his two challengers, Democratic nominee Mariella Smith and unaffiliated candidate Joe Kotvas. Smith has raised just over $99,000 so far and has $44,000 in the bank, while Kotvas has raised $10,125 and has and has $575 left to spend. Hagan, who is looking to move from his countywide seat into Crist’s northern Hillsborough one, only showed $1,500 in new money collected during the two-week reporting period, though his overall fundraising efforts dwarf those of his lone challenger, Democratic nominee Angela Birdsong. Through Sept. 14, Hagan had raised more than $487,000 in hard money and had more than $350,000 of that cash ready to deploy. Birdsong, meanwhile, has raised $27,817 and has $6,260 on hand. The fourth seat on the 2018 ballot, the countywide District 7, won’t feature any incumbents. Todd Marks, who overcame a major fundraising gap to defeat Aakash Patel in the Republican primary election, currently leads in overall fundraising in the three-way race between him, Democratic nominee Kimberly Overman, and Green Party candidate Kim O’Connor. Marks, an attorney, received $16,575 in contributions in his new report, which accounts for most of his on-hand cash after the bruising primary battle. He’s now raised nearly $176,000 overall and has a little less than $18,000 in his campaign account. Overman, meanwhile, has raised $77,321 thus far and had $13,300 banked, while O’Connor is currently the cash leader with $26,000 raised and all but $50 of that money still in her campaign account. The District 2, 4, 5 and 7 seats will all be on the Nov. 6 general election ballot, alongside other county government seats including sheriff and four school board districts.

Janice,Griffith,['http://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/wife-honors-late-husbands-legacy-with-1-million-gift.php'],b'1072',"['The late Richard “Dick” Perles ’62 will impact generations of faculty at William & Mary through a $1 million gift made in his memory to fund a government professorship at the university. Perles’ wife, Janice Griffith, created the endowment to honor her husband’s lifelong commitment to public service. Perles, who passed away in 2005, was an accomplished lawyer who was known for his community involvement, sharp sense of humor and quick wit. “I wanted to honor Dick for his extraordinary life and his civic participation,” Griffith said. “He always expressed a great interest in William & Mary and enjoyed his education there so I thought it would be especially appropriate to honor his memory with this gift.” By providing salary, research and teaching support, the Richard S. Perles Professorship in Government will ensure that dedicated and talented faculty continue to enrich the academic enterprise. “We are enormously grateful to be able to honor distinguished faculty members in government with this named professorship,” said Dean of the Faculty of Arts & Sciences Kate Conley. “The gift will help us recruit and retain top-notch faculty as well as recognize their outstanding work. It will also let our faculty know how valued they are by alumni, and I think that sends a very powerful message.” Perles, a government major, loved being surrounded by history as he pursued his undergraduate degree on William & Mary’s storied campus. He was especially interested in American history, governance and contemporary politics while he was a student. After graduating from William & Mary, Perles earned his law degree from Fordham University School of Law. He and Griffith met in New York City and forged a bond that spanned 30 years of marriage. Perles, whose legal work included real estate transactions and commercial and tort litigation, worked at New York City law firms before opening his own law practice in New York and Connecticut. The couple relocated to Atlanta in 1996 upon the appointment of Griffith, a law professor, as the dean of Georgia State University’s College of Law. Perles again set up a general practice law office. Now a law professor at Suffolk University in Boston, Griffith teaches State and Local Government Law. “Dick was the consummate lawyer. He was adept at both counseling and advocacy. In addition, he possessed sound judgment that made him a natural leader as well as an outstanding lawyer,” Griffith said. “He helped his clients plan for the future, even in areas of the law unmarked by settled boundary lines. He met the ideals of the lawyer-statesman by providing leadership in his community with exceptional wisdom and skill. Dick believed that a lawyer’s professional duties should include civic participation. ” Dick served on local government boards, often providing the leadership needed to effectuate new initiatives, Griffith said. He also provided pro bono legal services to community groups in need of a strong advocate for their causes. Griffith said her husband had a passion for protecting our natural resources. He served on the Stratford, Connecticut Waterfront Harbor Management Commission and was a forceful advocate for the protection of Stratford’s Great Meadows Marsh when its existence was threatened by potential development. In Atlanta, his leadership in the late 1990s led to the creation of a Grant Park Conservancy with a mission to restore and preserve Atlanta’s oldest park, Griffith said.

Schupf, LL.D. ’06, the Colby College Museum of Art will expand into downtown Waterville, offering the community and visitors a chance to engage with spectacular works in a vibrant setting. The contemporary gallery will be named in his honor. As part of the downtown arts complex announced earlier this week by Colby and Waterville Creates!, the Schupf gallery will be located in a transformed historical building at 93 Main Street. Located on the ground level, it will feature a rotating program of contemporary art exhibitions. Regularly scheduled gallery events will be held in the space. “The Schupf gallery will be a vital part of the new center for contemporary art and film, which has been conceived to create a hub of activity on Main Street and cement Waterville’s place as a destination for the arts,” said Colby President David A. Greene. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond. We are so fortunate to have his friendship and to benefit from his vision for institutions that serve the public good.” Schupf, who is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors and served as a College trustee for many years, has made several significant contributions to Colby, making possible the Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz and the Paul J. Schupf Sculpture Court at the Colby College Museum of Art; the Paul J. Schupf Scientific Computing Center; the Anthony-Mitchell-Schupf residence hall; and the Colby College-Memorial Sloan Kettering Summer Internship. A serious collector, Schupf has also donated numerous works of art, including significant works by Alex Katz and a major gift of more than 150 works on paper by Richard Serra. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” said Schupf. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped onboard immediately. The donation of the Paul J. Schupf gallery for contemporary art in downtown Waterville is just another manifestation of my admiration for the College and its museum.” “Paul has been such a great friend to the Colby museum, and once again we are humbled by, and grateful for, his remarkable generosity,” said Sharon Corwin, the Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator of the museum. “We see this gallery as a front door to the Colby museum and an opportunity to integrate more deeply into our community, and Paul’s support makes that possible.” On March 5 Colby and Waterville Creates! announced plans to transform the downtown building into a new center for contemporary art and film, making Waterville a singular destination for the arts in Maine. The project, which includes a significant fundraising effort, features new and renovated space to support leading programs in visual arts, theater, film, and arts education. The larger complex will also include the Waterville Opera House, Common Street Arts, and the Maine Film Center and Railroad Square Cinema. It is expected to attract even more visitors to a newly vibrant Main Street, anchored by a planned hotel a block from Castonguay Square and the Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, housing 200 Colby students, faculty, and staff. A technology center at 173 Main Street, housing software consultant CGI, Colby employees, and a student business incubator, opened last fall. Founded in 1959, the Colby College Museum of Art comprises five wings, more than 9,000 works of art, and more than 38,000 square feet of exhibition space. The museum also maintains a significant collection of contemporary American art, including works by Alex Katz (with more than 900 works represented), Agnes Martin, Sol LeWitt, Maya Lin, Kara Walker, Elizabeth Murray, Martin Puryear, Terry Winters, and Julie Mehretu.

Watch Part 1 James Comey: FBI had ‘basis for investigating’ possible ties between Trump and Russia Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Stuart Rothenberg of Inside Elections join Judy Woodruff to analyze a NewsHour interview with former FBI Director James Comey, reactions to Michelle Wolf’s performance at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, plus Sen. John McCain’s new book. Judy Woodruff: For some immediate post-interview analysis of my talk with James Comey, I\'m joined now by our Politics Monday team. That\'s Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Stuart Rothenberg of Inside Elections. And welcome to you both, Politics Monday. So, James Comey has been out there the last two weeks, ever since the book came out. He\'s done many interviews. We did have a chance to talk to him, Amy, as you heard. Amy Walter: Yes. Judy Woodruff: What do you think? Amy Walter: Well, I think that your opinion of James Comey and what he — how he answered your questions, as well as many others that have been asked over these last couple of weeks, your interpretation is based on how you feel really about the president in the first place. I think if you\'re prone to support the president, you\'re likely to say that there\'s nothing that James Comey is saying that is either believable or that actually puts Donald Trump in a position of committing any sort of actual crime. If you are opposed to the president, if you don\'t like the president, you see in James Comey a man who is signaling concerns about whether or not this person is able to be a president in the way we want to see a president, as a moral leader. Judy Woodruff: Something for everybody to dislike, Stu, is that really what we\'re talking about? Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. Judy, I think he said that to you. And he made the exact point. He said — what I wrote down is, partisans are going to be angry at you because they think you aren\'t on your side. He knows that. He acknowledges that. My question is, how about those of us that try not to be partisan and are trying to understand his decision-making? I continue to be a little uncomfortable about the role that his political assumptions played in the decisions he made. He in the past has sort of grudgingly acknowledged maybe it seeped into his head, but how could it have not been a part of his considerations? Judy Woodruff: Do you think it affects — basically, what you\'re saying, Amy, is if you\'re already disposed in one direction or another, so this book is and what he says about the book is not going to change… (CROSSTALK) Stuart Rothenberg: And The Washington Post/ABC News poll on this question showed 30 percent having a favorable opinion of James Comey, 32 an unfavorable, and 38 having no opinion. And if you looked in terms of partisans, Republicans tended to have an unfavorable view, Democrats had a favorable view, and independents, shockingly, were 30 favorable, 30 unfavorable, 40 percent no opinion. This is a guy that has been everywhere. Imagine having no opinion. I think it\'s just a general confusion of uncertainty who to believe. (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: Right. It\'s the continuing background noise of, what does this all mean? Because there has been no real new ground broken with this book in terms of the facts laid out. There is still a lot of questions about what actually happened. Is there collusion? Was the law broken? There\'s nothing new in this book about that. Judy Woodruff: Details about what he saw and heard. Amy Walter: Right. Judy Woodruff: Well, I don\'t think there\'s been a poll done about it yet, but last night, Stu, or — I\'m sorry — Saturday night in Washington, there was the white house correspondents dinner. And there are some strong views about — I wasn\'t there, but there are some strong views about what was said. President Trump declined to attend. He was in Washington, Michigan, giving a speech at about the same time that the comedian whose name is Michelle Wolf was giving some comments that there were — there were some strong reactions to. Let\'s listen to the president first, and then a little bit of her. President Donald Trump: Is this better than that phony Washington White House Correspondents Dinner? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) President Donald Trump: Is this more fun? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) President Donald Trump: I could be up there tonight smiling like I love when they\'re hitting you shot after shot. These people, they hate your guts, shot. And then I\'m supposed to — and, you know, you have got to smile. And if you don\'t smile, they will say, he was terrible, he couldn\'t take it. And if you do smile, they will say, what was he smiling about? There\'s no way. Michelle Wolf: I actually really like Sarah. I think she\'s very resourceful. Like, she burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like, maybe she\'s born with it. Maybe it\'s lies. It\'s probably lies. Judy Woodruff: So, Stu, some comedians are out there today defending Michelle Wolf. Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. Judy Woodruff: But there was a lot of pushback about whether that was appropriate, whether she went too far. Stuart Rothenberg: Well, I wasn\'t there either. I was sitting on my couch in my living room watching it. And 10 seconds after she ended, I tweeted out that I thought her material and her delivery was — her material was vulgar and mean-spirited, nasty. I think much of what the president has said over the years is vulgar, mean-spirited and nasty. But what I found is, if you criticize Michelle Wolf, then critics of the president automatically think that you support — they think they that if you criticize Wolf, then you are — how do I say this? Amy Walter: You sort of condone what he\'s doing. Yes. (CROSSTALK) Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. Yes. And so it\'s very — it\'s awkward. I think that they both can — both the president and the comedian can be wrong. But it\'s hard to hold that position these days — this day and age. Amy Walter: Yes. And here\'s the thing. Every year, we have the same controversy. A comedian comes. It\'s been happening since Bill Clinton. A comedian comes… Judy Woodruff: And even before. Amy Walter: And even — probably even before that. A comedian comes in, whether it\'s saying something about the president or people around him, or just saying things that are considered crass or politically incorrect or whatever, there\'s a minor controversy, and we move on. The reason we don\'t move on is because the president has in many ways used the press as this, you know, place that, as he said in that clip, they\'re against me all along. And, quite frankly, when you hear a bunch of people in the room laughing, right, a room that is filled with journalists laughing at all of those jokes, America can say, well, I guess this is where the press is. But if you don\'t want these controversies, here\'s a really great idea. Don\'t have comedians come in. Stuart Rothenberg: Right. Amy Walter: If you haven\'t watched comedy in the last — if you have watched comedy in the last 10 years, this is how comedians operate. So, bring in somebody who will tell knock-knock jokes. I don\'t know. But don\'t bring in a modern comedian. Judy Woodruff: There is a question about how much Hollywood and/or New York comedy and Washington really mix. Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. Amy Walter: Right. They don\'t mix. Judy Woodruff: The last thing I want to bring up, speaking of the embedding views that and the difficulty in crossing barriers, is John McCain, who is — we haven\'t seen him for several weeks. He\'s being treated for a cancer diagnosis. Stu, his new book called ""The Restless Wave"" is coming out in a few weeks. Some excerpts were released today. I\'m going to read just a small bit of it. He didn\'t name President Trump, but he said, referring to him — he said, ""He\'s declined to distinguish the actions of our government from the crimes of despotic ones. The appearance of toughness, or a reality show facsimile of toughness, seems to matter more than any of our values."" He goes on in these excerpts to lament the divisions. But he does make it clear where he\'s coming from about the president. Stuart Rothenberg: Yes. One other quick thing. He said: ""I don\'t remember another time in my life when so many Americans considered someone\'s partisan affiliation a test of whether that person was entitled to respect."" One thing that struck me is, John McCain was known as a maverick, a disrupter, a guy who would stir the pot. This president is also a maverick, an outsider, disrupter. And yet John McCain has so much dignity and seriousness. He\'s a hero. He\'s been a hero as a human being. Judy Woodruff: People are going to be poring over this book. Amy Walter: They are. And he brings up another point — and I\'m glad that Stu raised it as well — which is, he says, ""Paradoxically, voters who detest Washington because all we do is argue and never get anything done vote for candidates who are the most adamant in their assurance that they will never compromise."" And Stu and I have been watching this for years, which is, the way that, especially in some of these wave elections and these midterm elections, the incumbents who are the most vulnerable who end up losing are the ones in the middle, the moderates, the people who are willing to work across the aisle. There is no incentive because there\'s no reward to actually trying to broker any sort of compromise. And until that happens, it is not about — it\'s not just about President Trump. This has been going on for quite some time across Congress. Judy Woodruff: Words to think about. And we will continue to look at them. Amy Walter, Stu Rothenberg, Politics Monday, thank you. Stuart Rothenberg: Thanks, Judy. Amy Walter: You\'re welcome.

Chatter online among journalists and some in the administration’s orbit after the event was full of criticism for comedian Michelle Wolf, who was the evening’s headliner; criticism and soul-searching about the annual event itself; and an effort by former White House press secretary Sean Spicer to pressure the leadership of the White House Correspondents’ Association into answering for Wolf’s vulgar, personal jabs leveled primarily at the president and his inner circle. The comedian spoke for roughly 20 minutes to a ballroom full of Washington’s top journalists and political operatives. As The Washington Post’s Paul Farhi wrote, Wolf’s remarks “swerved from raunchy to downright nasty.” “She was particularly hard on the women associated with Trump,” Farhi wrote, adding “several cracks about [White House press secretary] Sarah Huckabee Sanders landed poorly.” (Courtesy of two of Farhi’s colleagues at the Post, here’s a list of Wolf’s “harshest” jokes.) And Politico said Wolf’s performance “was a risque and uneven routine at first met with laughs but often greeted by awkward silence.” The comedic routine laced with sexual innuendo and, at times, dominated by outright vulgarities was directed primarily at Republicans and conservatives — a fact not lost on those in the room who expressed their displeasure on Twitter afterward. “My wife @mercedesschlapp and I walked out early from the wh correspondents dinner. Enough of elites mocking all of us,” Matt Schlapp posted on Twitter just before 11 p.m. Schlapp is the chairman of the American Conservative Union and his wife, Mercedes, is part of the White House’s communications team. Former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus called the night an “R/X rated spectacle that started poorly and ended up in the bottom of the canyon. Another victory for @realDonaldTrump for not attending and proving his point once again. The room was uncomfortable. Trump lovers and even a large number of Trump haters were pretty miserable.” An R/X rated spectacle that started poorly and ended up in the bottom of the canyon. Another victory for @realDonaldTrump for not attending and proving his point once again. The room was uncomfortable. Trump lovers and even a large number of Trump haters were pretty miserable. — Reince Priebus (@Reince) April 29, 2018 Spicer’s critique was more pointed. “Tonight’s #WHCD was a disgrace,” the former Trump spokesman said on Twitter. On Monday, Trump weighed in, tweeting that the dinner was “is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!” The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 30, 2018 The criticism was joined by some well-known political journalists who sounded off both about Wolf’s remarks and the nature of the event more broadly. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was the particular target of harsh treatment by Wolf — as Sanders sat on the dais not far from the lectern where Wolf was speaking. Afterward, some of the journalists from outlets known to spar with the White House or to be on the receiving end of pointed attacks directly from the president spoke out on Sanders’ behalf. One example from Wolf’s performance: “And I’m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders, you know? Is it Sarah Sanders, is it Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is it Cousin Huckabee, is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? What’s Uncle Tom but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know. Aunt Coulter.” “That @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,” tweeted Maggie Haberman of The New York Times. (Haberman said on Twitter that she did not attend the event in person but had watched it on TV.) “Lots of critics but she has always been decent and professional to me — if not entirely forthcoming,” The Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey posted on Twitter about Sanders, attaching Haberman’s tweet about the Trump spokeswoman. Lot of critics but she has always been decent and professional to me — if not entirely forthcoming (and I don't expect any press secretary to be!) https://t.co/bM6Efz2Xmf — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) April 29, 2018 “The spirit of the event had always been jokes that singe but don’t burn,” said Kelly O’Donnell of NBC News, “Reporters who work with her daily appreciate that @presssec was there.” Like Dawsey, O’Donnell included Haberman’s tweet praising Sanders’ composure under fire. The spirit of the event had always been jokes that singe but don’t burn. Reporters who work with her daily appreciate that @presssec was there. https://t.co/PorH9jGJ7G — Kelly O'Donnell (@KellyO) April 29, 2018 “Unfortunately, I don’t think we advanced the cause of journalism tonight,” Peter Baker, also of The New York Times, said online. Baker’s tweet, as did Haberman’s, set off a series of responses, subtweets and amens from fellow journalists. Other journalists saw broader political implications stemming from the controversial remarks. “Michelle Wolf — and the WHCD — really played into Trump’s hand tonight. Trump is vulgar and mean-spirited, but that doesn’t mean that Wolf needed to be the same,” tweeted D.C. fixture and longtime political analyst Stuart Rothenberg. Michelle Wolf — and the WHCD — really played into Trump’s hand tonight. Trump is vulgar and mean-spirited, but that doesn’t mean that Wolf needed to be the same. — Stuart Rothenberg (@StuPolitics) April 29, 2018 Jon Ward of Yahoo News called the comedy routine “a political gift to the Trump admin[istration].” I sat there, not laughing and aghast at many of the jokes that took mean spirited personal shots, and knew the routine was a political gift to the Trump admin. https://t.co/egLyvEsNcK — Jon Ward (@jonward11) April 29, 2018 Echoing Ward, Rothenberg and Baker, Meg Kinnard of The Associated Press saw very specific implications for journalists, especially those working and reporting in predominantly Republican states. Saturday night’s event “made the chasm between journalists and those who don’t trust us, even wider,” Kinnard tweeted. “And those of us based in the red states who work hard every day to prove our objectivity will have to deal with it.” If the #WHCD dinner did anything tonight, it made the chasm between journalists and those who don't trust us, even wider. And those of us based in the red states who work hard every day to prove our objectivity will have to deal with it. — Meg Kinnard (@MegKinnardAP) April 29, 2018 In a trio of tweets early Sunday morning Spicer sought to elicit a response from the White House Correspondents’ Association to the criticism Wolf had received. The leadership of #WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinner #WHCD #WHCA has been silent @margarettalev @jonkarl @OKnox need respond since they paid for her to speak #whcd2018 https://t.co/emN6w6ClgX — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) April 29, 2018 Absolute silence from #WHCA #WHCD2018 #WHCD board member @abc @jonkarl on tonight’s dinner speech — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) April 29, 2018 Any comments from the leadership of #WHCD2018 ?? @margarettalev @jonkarl @OKnox If it had not been one of your own you would be demanding answers but you sweep under the rug https://t.co/e1PO2fldSf — Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) April 29, 2018 On Sunday evening, Margaret Talev, a Bloomberg News journalist who serves as president of the correspondents’ association, issued a statement saying, “Last night’s program was meant to offer a unifying message about our common commitment to a vigorous and free press while honoring civility, great reporters and scholarship winners, not to divide people. The entertainer’s monologue was not in the spirit of that mission.” Wolf was unsparing in her choice of targets, which also included other political figures from both parties, media celebrities and journalism itself. “I think what no one in this room wants to admit is that Trump has helped all of you. He couldn’t sell steaks or vodka or water or college or ties or Eric. But he has helped you,” said Wolf. “He’s helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you’re profiting off of him. And if you’re going to profit off of Trump, you should at least give him some money because he doesn’t have any.” Comedian Kathy Griffin, who has herself been embroiled in controversy over her past comments about the president, took up Wolf’s defense and responded to Baker and other critics. “Then don’t have a comic do a roast,” Griffin said on Twitter, “If you want to focus on the journalism do a boring awards show. Journalism is all about the 1st amendment..If you don’t see the import of what @michelleisawolf did tonight then you don’t get it.” Then don't have a comic do a roast @jeffzeleny @peterbakernyt. If you want to focus on the journalism do a boring awards show. Journalism is all about the 1st amendment..If you don't see the import of what @michelleisawolf did tonight then you don't get it https://t.co/giZj4f3Szm — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) April 29, 2018 For her part, Wolf responded to Spicer calling the event a “disgrace” with a simple “Thank you!” on Twitter. And the comedian also challenged Haberman’s critique, suggesting The New York Times White House reporter was harboring unspoken concerns about Sanders’ appearance. Hey mags! All these jokes were about her despicable behavior. Sounds like you have some thoughts about her looks though? 😘 https://t.co/JRzzvhBuey — Michelle Wolf (@michelleisawolf) April 29, 2018 The controversy over Wolf seemed to steal headlines which the president had seemingly tried to steal for himself by absenting himself from the dinner for a second consecutive year and going to Michigan for a campaign rally instead. In his remarks there earlier Saturday evening, Trump had called the press “very dishonest people” and “fake news.” He called the dinner in D.C. “phony” and said he had much preferred to be in Washington Township, Mich., rather than back in the nation’s capital in a ballroom full of the journalists who cover him and his administration. He told the enthusiastic crowd of supporters that had he been at the dinner in the other Washington, he would’ve been forced to smile through attacks on him or face negative stories afterward about not being a good sport while being roasted by Wolf. “You know, there’s no winning,” he said over cheers. Back in D.C., Matt and Mercedes Schlapp articulated Trump’s concerns more philosophically — concerns widely shared by conservatives across the country who see themselves as losing out in a broader culture war despite their electoral victories in the Trump era. “It’s why America hates the out of touch leftist media elite,” Mercedes Schlapp tweeted.

""The most important thing is for journalists to do the job, no matter what platform, and not be distracted by everything going on around you,"" Sweet said. ""Get it right, make the extra call, these principles never change. Look up the extra document, just the things that you do every day no matter if it\'s your first day or your last."" ""A fact is a fact,"" Sweet stressed. Lynn Sweet accepts award Photos: Daniel Swartz/Revamp Sweet, honored for her work in print, was one of four recognized at the event attended by over 300 at the home of Gloria Story Dittus, chairman of public affairs shop Story Partners, in D.C.\'s tony Kalorama neighborhood just around the corner from the Obamas and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. In today\'s news cycle, digital disruption, for better or worse, is part of our landscape, Dittus explained in her opening remarks. ""Words like \'truth\' and \'fake news\' are smacked around faster than the Williams sisters hitting a tennis ball,"" Dittus said. Dittus feels we\'re on the precipice of a new frontier for female journalists. She pointed out Time magazine\'s acknowledgment of the ""silence-breakers"" with its 2018 Person of the Year award. ""Silence breakers are telling the world not that women are a force to be reckoned with, but that women are the force of the reckoning,"" Dittus said. (L to R): Lynn Sweet, Audie Cornish, Gloria Dittus, Amy Walter, Amanda Bennett, and Cathy Merrill Williams. Dittus\' next door neighbor Cathy Merrill Williams, president and publisher, Washingtonian magazine, co-hosted the festivities. Williams presented the Washington Female Distinguished Journalist of the Year award to Amanda Bennett, director of the Voice of America. Bennett served as a Wall Street Journal reporter for 20 years. While there, she shared a 1997 Pulitzer for reporting on how officials misrepresented the AIDS epidemic. At The Oregonian in Portland, she led a team to the Pulitzer for public service in 2001 for investigating problems within the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. In 2003, Bennett became the first female editor in the Philadelphia Inquirer\'s 174-year history. She stayed on until 2006. Amanda Bennett Bennett reflected on her career and admitted all the current talk of fake news and the #metoo movement has made her wonder if she hasn\'t done such a good job of being a woman in journalism. But Bennett explained how her work at Voice of America keeps her grounded. She compared herself to It\'s a Wonderful Life\'s George Bailey because of how she has been able to speak to the most repressed societies on earth and see what it would be like if journalists weren\'t here. ""I see people who literally die for the things that we do,"" Bennett said. Bennett wrapped up with a mic drop, noting that the Voice of America, with 2,000 employees, is possibly the only national news organization headed by three women in their 60s. Audie Cornish, the co-host of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” was honored for her work in broadcast radio. She was previously the host of NPR’s “Weekend Edition Sunday,” and has served as a Capitol Hill reporter for the network. Cornish started as an intern at NPR 18 years ago. Since then she\'s covered stories such as the Boston Catholic Archdiocese sex-abuse scandal and won first prize for national education writing for her series on the achievement gaps in schools. Audie Cornish ""You don\'t look like what I thought you would look like either,"" Cornish joked when she started her remarks. Cornish explained that ""being a woman in journalism is one of these jobs where you walk into rooms where no one wants to see you or hear from you and you start talking and you don\'t stop and you don\'t try to sleep with anyone in that room."" ""We\'ve learned how in the past year that is very confusing to some people,"" Cornish quipped. Cornish noted that just seeing other women in journalism is what matters. ""It didn\'t occur to me to do the job until I saw Gwen Ifill,"" Cornish said. Amy Walter, national editor of The Cook Political Report, was recognized for her work in broadcast journalism. The former political director at ABC News, Walter is also a political analyst for ""PBS NewsHour"" (where she appears weekly on Politics Monday) and is a key member of their election and convention night coverage team. Amy Walter My life has come full circle, Walter explained. She noted how soon after arriving in D.C. in 1991 she witnessed the Supreme Court battle between Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. Then, the 1992 election was kicked off as the year of the woman. More women were elected that year than at any other time in history, according to Walter. ""Here we are all these years later where women are once again the inflection point, but women are doing much more,"" Walter stressed. She noted the majority of reporters covering the 2016 campaign as embeds were women. ""We\'ve finally reached this point where it\'s no longer weird to see a woman covering politics,"" Walter said. She dedicated her award to Gwen Ifill. ""There\'s not a day that goes by that I don\'t go into the NewsHour and desperately want to talk to her."" The award winners were selected from an advisory committee made up of public affairs and government relations professionals and congressional press secretaries.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/upside-down-american-politics-trump-skates-through-scandal-while-party-suffers-amid-booming-economy'],b'1025',"['President Trump is weathering allegations of an affair with a porn star and a ham-handed cover up, even as his party in Congress moves perilously close to losing the House despite presiding over an accelerating economy that has reached near-full employment. In the upside down of American politics, unemployment dropped to a staggeringly low 3.9 percent in April, but neither that nor other usually reliable political indicators are proving sufficient to protect House Republicans from an oncoming midterm buzzsaw. Political strategists blame this phenomenon on Trump. The president is insulated from scandal because voters expected he might be a philanderer who distorts the truth when they elected him. But Trump’s foibles are landing like a crushing thud on Republicans in Congress, fueling Democratic enthusiasm and alienating disaffected Republicans. “Today, for example, the lead story should the incredibly positive economic numbers. Instead, it’s about Trump and Giuliani. That’s not a bad story — that’s a horrible story,” Republican pollster Frank Luntz said Friday to the Washington Examiner. “To make matters worse, he repeatedly criticizes Congress without emphasizing that it\'s the Democrats who are blocking his agenda. His lack of partisan clarity could cost him control of the House in November.” Luntz was referring to Rudy Giuliani, a member of Trump’s legal team. The former New York mayor sparked a media frenzy when he revealed on Sean Hannity’s Fox News program Wednesday that Trump, contrary to previous denials, was aware of attorney Michael Cohen’s payoff to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election to keep their alleged 2006 tryst out of the news. Trump spent Friday walking back Giuliani’s admission, reiterating his denial of the affair and the payoff, and insisting the ex-mayor misspoke. There’s scant evidence that the episode will damage Trump. His job approval has climbed to the higher end of an average range that has fluctuated from the high 30s to mid 40s since the Stormy Daniels story broke, and now sits at 44.4 percent. Democratic pollster Mark Mellman explained Trump’s resilience as the product of low expectations. “People have concluded that he\'s a liar,” he said in an interview with CNBC’s John Harwood. “He lies every day. People know it."" Mellman added this crucial point: “The world hasn\'t come to an end … The world\'s looking a little better. There\'s some good news out there.” There’s evidence that the media’s fixation on the sex scandal has boosted Trump in other ways, said Amy Walter, national editor of Cook Political Report, in a Twitter post. “The more media focused on Stormy et al, the more that: 1) Rs rally around POTUS, 2) issues Ds want/need to talk about like health care, can’t break thru.” That rallying effect has materialized most in the ruby red states where Trump ran up big victory margins in 2016, and his strength there could help Senate Republicans pad their slim, 51-49 majority in November. House Republicans aren’t so lucky. They’re defending nearly two-dozen seats that opposed Trump for president, plus other mostly suburban enclaves that traditionally vote Republican for Congress but are dispirited by his polarizing brand of cultural conservatism. The chaos and scandal engulfing the White House is a glaring reminder of their dissatisfaction, and threatens to wipe out their 23-seat advantage. The April jobs report provided a golden opportunity to change the narrative in these districts, helping, Republicans connect the positive economy to their collective decision, with Trump, to enact tax reform over the unanimous opposition of the Democrats. But it wasted Friday, as it often has been, as Trump dominated the news with defense of his actions in the Stormy Daniels saga. “It just shows clearly how much of an anchor Trump’s personality and abrasiveness are on his own accomplishments, and on the party,” veteran Democratic strategist Joe Trippi said. Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, has warned Democrats to avoid hyping Trump’s character flaws and focus their campaigns on kitchen table issues. But a strategist with the group, Josh Schwerin, emphasized that the controversies surrounding the president nevertheless perform one crucial task for the Democrats as the elections approach. “It reminds Democrats everyday that they don’t like him, and keeps them fired up to go vote,” Schwerin said. “Democrats are turning out at higher levels, and a lot of that is because they want that check on the president.” The Democrats hold a critical edge on the measure of voter intensity, a crucial indicator in midterm contests, and have significantly over-performed in special elections. The party has flipped dozens of seats in state legislative elections, while markedly exceeding their typical partisan turnout in special elections for Congress, leading to two unlikely victories — one for Senate in Alabama, the other for the House in Pennsylvania. The Democratic advantage on the generic ballot, gauging which party voters want in charge on Capitol Hill, sits at 6 points in the RealClearPolitics.com average, not a sure sign of a takeover but not far off, either. The Democrats probably need to see this lead hold steady at 8 points or higher to be in a more firm position to capture the House, and their failure to get there so far is keeping Republicans’ spirits up. David Winston, a GOP pollster closely monitoring voter sentiment, said Republicans still have time to convince the electorate that their policies are working. He said that voters haven\'t made up their mind yet about the economy — in particular, how it is impacting their pocketbooks. If voters conclude that their lives have improved, and Republicans can make the case that the change is due to their work in Washington, GOP majorities will be harder to dislodge. “Stormy Daniels is not going to impact their lives,"" Winston added. ""That’s not why they voted for Trump or didn’t vote for him. They voted for him on economy, and that’s how they’re going to evaluate the failure or success of his presidency.""']",0.0,14.0,1.1666666666666667,0.0,1023578.0,1

Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. senator from Hampshire, spoke with audience members following the University of Chicago Institute of Politics event. Throughout the discussion, Ayotte noted the lack of Republican women running for public offices. (From left) Amy Walter moderated a discussion with panelists Kelly Ayotte, Jennifer Lawless and Lauren Underwood at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics to speak about the “Pink Wave” —a historic rise of women running for offices. Lauren Underwood, a congressional candidate for Illinois’ 14th district spoke with women May 2 following the University of Chicago’s “Pink Wave: Surge of Female Candidates in 2018” event. The 2018 midterm elections have been dubbed as the “Year of the Woman,” reflecting the surge of women running for public offices nationwide. Nearly 60 percent more women declared their intention to run for the U.S. House and Senate this year compared to the 2016 election. To interpret this political shift, the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics hosted a May 2 panel with experts titled “Pink Wave: Surge of Female Candidates in 2018,” moderated by Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. Panelists included Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. senator, R-New Hampshire; Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University’s School of Public Affairs; and Lauren Underwood, who is the Democratic candidate for Illinois 14th congressional district. Although women do not necessarily vote differently than their male counterparts within their own political parties, women put a higher value in congressional “school spirit” or collegiality than men, Lawless said. “It turns out that whether you have a ‘D’ or an ‘R’ in front of your name is way more predictive of how you are going to legislate than the presence of Y chromosome in your DNA,” Lawless said. Women are more likely to participate in the congressional softball game or secret Santa exchange, for example, she added. “It doesn’t mean those relationships will translate into bipartisan cooperation on bills, but maybe Congress would be even more dysfunctional if we didn’t have women to keep things running in a civil way,” Lawless said. Women currently make up only about a fifth of Congress, despite constituting half of the nation’s population. Six states have a woman serving as governor this year and 22 states have never had a female chief executive. Just three of the 18 Illinois representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives are women. One of the two current Illinois state senators is Tammy Duckworth, who is one of only two women to have ever been elected to the U.S. Senate from Illinois. Female candidates are judged in ways that men are not. While running for U.S. Senate, Ayotte said she was criticized for being a mother with young children. Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. senator from Hampshire, spoke with audience members following the University of Chicago Institute of Politics event. Throughout the discussion, Ayotte noted the lack of Republican women running for public offices. “Do you ever hear a discussion over what kind of tie our male candidates are wearing?” she asked. “But we often judge a woman’s looks or what she’s wearing.” Hadiya Afzal, an 18-year-old candidate running for a DuPage County Board position, asked the experts how to maintain strength as a female candidate without feeling “imposter syndrome” in the role. Afzal said there are currently no people of color on the DuPage County Board, despite the district’s large immigrant and refugee populations. “Women are more likely to bring light to issues that affect women and families,” Afzal said after the event. “At the local level, these resources count. [Women of color have] family backgrounds [that] are different, and that reflects in the integrity they bring to [public policy changes].” Women often feel underqualified to pursue elected office, Ayotte said, and need to be encouraged to run. “My male colleagues look in the mirror and saw a U.S. senator, but when I looked in the mirror, I didn’t initially see a U.S. senator,” Ayotte said. But when women are recruited to run for office, they are receptive, just as likely as men to raise campaign money and also to win their races, Lawless said. (From left) Amy Walter moderated a discussion with panelists Kelly Ayotte, Jennifer Lawless and Lauren Underwood at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics to speak about the “Pink Wave” —a historic rise of women running for offices. There is no perfect time to run for an office, but Walter noted that the Trump administration’s policies convinced Underwood to run despite not having a political background. Underwood saw the effects of those policies firsthand, while working as a nurse in disaster relief during Flint, Michigan’s water crisis, she said. “When the Trump team made it clear that they did not want to remain in Flint [or] continue progress we had made on the ACA, I knew I couldn’t stay in government and help them take away coverage,” Underwood said. While it seems like the trend of more women in politics is on the upswing, Lawless said she worries the “Year of the Woman” puts too much pressure on women to fix the political system. “If we think we expect women to come to Washington and clean up a mess and pass legislation and heighten productivity—in a political institution whose rules and norms make it difficult for people to do that—we might be holding women to a standard that our institution could never allow them to meet,” Lawless said.

Watch Next West Virginia primary is a national nail-biter for the GOP West Virginia voters head to the polls on Tuesday, but they’re not alone. There are also primary races in Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Shawna Thomas of Vice News join Amna Nawaz to discuss how Republican candidates are campaigning, whether President Trump will pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear agreement and CIA nominee Gina Haspel under fire. Amna Nawaz: And it\'s not just West Virginia voters that head to the polls tomorrow. There are also primary races in Indiana, Ohio, and North Carolina. So, it\'s a good time for Politics Monday. I\'m joined by Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and the newly announced Friday host of Public Radio International\'s ""The Takeaway,"" and Shawna Thomas of VICE News. Amy and Shawna, welcome. Amy, let\'s talk about some of these primaries. Now, we have talked a lot about the future of the Republican Party, right, what we can tell from some of these races and how they have gone. What can we learn from the primaries we\'re seeing right now? Amy Walter: Yes, especially Indiana and West Virginia. And I think Lisa did an excellent job of sort of setting the stage here and two big themes going on in both of those states. The first is, Democratic incumbents sit in both of those states. They are top targets, because these are deep red states that Donald Trump carried. The second is the embrace of Donald Trump, both his message and as well as his policies. There\'s a lot of talk about draining the swamp and building the wall. And, finally, what we\'re seeing in these primaries looks very familiar what we saw in 2016, all the candidates running against Washington, but many of them are part of Washington. They\'re either are a member of Congress. As we have seen in Indiana, there are two. In West Virginia, there\'s one. Or part of the so-called establishment. One of those folks running in West Virginia is the sitting attorney general. Sort of ironic, too, that they are running against Washington, when the Republicans are in charge of Washington. Usually, when you\'re in charge, you say let\'s send more people there to help build our majority. Instead, the focus is on they need to go there to help the president, not to help Republicans in Congress. Amna Nawaz: You have talked before about whether or not there is room in the party for Republicans who oppose the president as well. Does that mean that has gone away? Amy Walter: You\'re not hearing anything about a candidate who is trying to run against the Trump portfolio. In fact, I looked at all the ads that have been run since the beginning of January until now in all races across the country. Republicans have run almost three times as many ads that are supportive of Trump as Democrats have run ads against Trump. So Democrats are not running as much as an anti-Trump party as Republicans are running as the pro-Trump candidate. Amna Nawaz: Shawna, let me ask you about the president\'s involvement in these primaries, because he\'s tweeted about them before. He has weighed in. He is weighing in on the West Virginia primary, too. Does it make a difference anymore? Shawna Thomas: I think it seems to — I think he thinks it makes a difference. And especially with the West Virginia primary, the two more, let\'s say, establishment Republicans, his tweet was actually very interesting, because he named both of them. And it was basically like, don\'t vote for Blankenship, vote for one of these. But the interesting thing about that is that those two guys may split the vote, which just allows Blankenship to go ahead and raise up. But it is clear that Republicans in general, whether it\'s someone running far right or someone trying to like thread the needle of D.C., they think they need to keep President Trump on their side. And Blankenship\'s thing is that he keeps saying he\'s Trumpier than Trump. Amy Walter: Right. And the other irony is, that\'s exactly what Republicans said about Trump. If he wins the primary, he can\'t win a general election. And now you have the president saying, if this guy wins, who\'s running basically the same sort of campaign and he has a lot of baggage, he can\'t win a general election. Shawna Thomas: I also think he doesn\'t want to be caught — the president doesn\'t want to be caught in a Roy Moore situation out of Alabama, where he did actually endorse the more traditional candidate, then had to sort of backtrack and kind of endorse Roy Moore, even after saying Roy Moore couldn\'t win, which he couldn\'t in that case. This race is a little bit different, but I think they\'re trying to figure out how do they read the tea leaves a little bit. Amna Nawaz: And he\'s been tweeting about that connection to the Alabama special election as well. He is also tweeting about the Iran deal. There was a self-imposed May 12 deadline. He now says we will have a decision tomorrow. He\'s been threatening and threatening to take the U.S. out of it. So, what do you think? Are we in or out? Shawna Thomas: It seems like everything he has been telegraphing and everything that sort of the Europeans are saying about what they have done to try to convince him to stay in the deal has not worked. So I think we\'re all just sort of sitting in D.C. and assuming that he\'s going to say he\'s going to pull out. Now, what does that actually mean? It sort of means like that that deadline, Saturday, I believe, May 12, is about whether we\'re going to slap our sanctions back on Iran for certain things that we lifted them for in the nuclear deal. And that, snapping those sanctions back on, doesn\'t just affect Iran and it doesn\'t just affect the United States. It affects some of our dealings with European countries, which is also part of it. So it\'s a much larger kind of economic problem, too. But it seems like he\'s going to pull us out. We can\'t know until he tells us. But no one — I haven\'t talk to anyone, and no European person who knows about this has said they that have convinced him. And he\'s been talking about this since the campaign. And he follows through on… (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: He does follow through, absolutely. Amna Nawaz: Can he afford to not do it now, after talking about it for so long? Amy Walter: Right. I think he does it. Now, the question is always how far he goes, right? Amna Nawaz: Right. Shawna Thomas: Yes. Amy Walter: I\'m going to pull out of NAFTA. Well, we didn\'t really pull out of NAFTA. But we\'re renegotiating. I\'m going to slap tariffs and sanctions — or I\'m going to slap tariffs on China. I\'m going to call them the currency manipulator. Well, didn\'t call them a currency manipulator. There are some tariffs. It\'s unclear the tariffs, where they\'re going for other countries. But Shawna is exactly right. Everything we saw from — it wasn\'t just when Macron came to the U.S., his body language. He also basically said, I wasn\'t able to convince him. And then Rudy Giuliani went on TV, I guess it was this weekend or earlier in the week, saying, well, yes, no, he\'s definitely going to — he\'s going to tear… (CROSSTALK) Shawna Thomas: I don\'t know why that\'s Rudy Giuliani\'s problem. But… Amna Nawaz: We will see tomorrow. We expect that announcement tomorrow from the president. Another big story we\'re watching this week, Gina Haspel has her confirmation hearing on Wednesday. She\'s the president\'s nominee for CIA director. If you look back to some of the more recent nominees, look back to Ronny Jackson, for example, when he got into some trouble, when there was some heavy scrutiny and you knew it was going to be a tough confirmation hearing, the president kind of backed away a little bit. We\'re not seeing that with Gina Haspel. Is this different? Shawna Thomas: I think it is a little different. I think one thing is that Gina Haspel is probably qualified for the job. And it was unclear if Dr. Ronny Jackson was qualified for that particular position. She has that going for her. And you have to remember, she is the acting director of the CIA right now. I think the issue that comes up is about the word torture and her involvement in the destruction of certain videotapes that purport to actually show what the CIA did, water-boarding, and how much responsibility she needs to take for that in an open forum. Amna Nawaz: What about the votes here, Amy? We saw her on the Hill today. We know she was meeting with senators. Joe Manchin came out, shook hands, smiled, said it was great to meet her, we\'re looking forward to the hearing. Who are some of her problem votes? Amy Walter: Well, Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, always on issues like this has been on the other side from where more traditional Republicans have been. He was on the other side of the Bush administration. And, in fact, this debate we\'re having right now about Gina Haspel feels much more like the kinds of debates we had in Congress about pre-Trump. Right? This isn\'t about, is she qualified for the job? I think she\'s had six former CIA directors saying she\'s absolutely qualified. You hear people in the Intelligence Committee saying, this woman is absolutely right for the job. Shawna Thomas: Her former staff has said that. (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: Her former staff. The debate is about the issue of torture, how to deal with terrorism suspects. That was an issue when Bush was president. It was an issue when Obama was present about closing Guantanamo. Obviously, this president now wanting to keep it open or keeping it open. And so this is much more about policy than it is about personality. Amna Nawaz: Sure to be a tough hearing either way on Wednesday. Amy Walter, Shawna Thomas, thanks for your time. Shawna Thomas: Thanks. Amy Walter: You\'re welcome.

Now, more are going steady. For Mic, that means sticking with a few tried-and-true social partners. For the Christian Science Monitor, which went live with a subscription site on Monday, that means finding people who support its mission so much it would pay for it. For both sites, it’s about identifying loyal viewers, listeners and readers — and catering to them. Mic’s publisher, Cory Haik, calls it “deliberate distribution.” Faced with a steep fall in video traffic from Facebook, Haik has partnered with Apple News and Twitter Moments to highlight some of its best journalism. Haik cut production by two-thirds and its Facebook videos by half, pushing more distinctive material. Mic’s best work, such as this ASNE-winning take on opioid addiction, may not have as many viewers, but viewers spend more time on the quality segment. Another success: this social video on a gun owner giving up his weapon after Parkland. For Facebook Watch, Mic last week debuted ""For The Record With Jack Smith IV,"" a weekly show with one of its most recognizable names, a reporter who was arrested in the 2016 Standing Rock protests and has covered extremist groups in the United States. ""For The Record"" is billed as following “the troubled roots of everyday places, objects and activities in American history.” The Monitor, when it moved from Monday-Friday to weekly print publication, once chased trending topics and delivered significant monthly digital readership through social media — but those readers didn’t develop a habit for a site, and declining digital ad prices made the extra effort less tenable. So the Monitor doubled down on its core audience, listened to it, and has come up with the Christian Science Monitor Daily, a newsletter with five hand-picked articles, with editor commentary on why each matters. There are videos, graphics, a daily audio digest, a quick-read version — and no ads. It has a free, no credit-card five-day subscription — but the Monitor does get your email. Check it out. On Monday, the daily public radio show ""The Takeaway"" named a new host for Fridays — Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report. The move allows the WNYC-PRI co-produced show, which on Monday premiered Tanzina Vega as host, to go deeper on a single topic more often. Some of the strongest shows in recent years richly covered the history of the electoral college, the rise of Russian influence in 2016, the state of the EPA under Scott Pruitt and redistricting efforts in Pennsylvania, said ""The Takeaway’s"" executive editor, Arwa Gunja. “It’s extremely challenging for our daily host to find the time to think deeply about these issues while also taking on all the other duties of hosting and covering such a large array of topics all week long,” she said by email. That’s why they came up with a Friday show with a different host. “When looking for hosts, Amy’s vision for this show very much aligned with our own,” Gunja said. “She brings to this show a deep understanding of Washington policy and how those policy decisions impact real Americans; she is committed to journalism that provides context and history, with a focus on answering the question, ‘How did we get here?’” THE IMPLODING DENVER POST: Nearly all of the remaining staff signed an open letter urging the Alden Global Capital hedge fund to end censorship and immediately sell Colorado’s biggest newspaper. Two departing senior editors described the tumult of recent days, with one saying “I had more freedom as a journalist in Russia than I did under Alden Capital.” Here’s our full story. Departing editorial page editor Chuck Plunkett has more for Rolling Stone on the vultures who are “destroying public trust in what we do.” Protests are scheduled Tuesday outside Alden\'s New York headquarters and in Denver. UNION MOVEMENT: Journalists at Tronc newspapers in Hartford, Orlando and at the South Florida Sun Sentinel may be emboldened after the company’s flagship Chicago Tribune agreed to allow a union, reports NPR’s David Folkenflik. The chain’s Baltimore Sun already is unionized, as is the Los Angeles Times, which Tronc recently sold. GONE: New York\'s attorney general quit about three hours after The New Yorker reported that four women had accused him of physically assaulting them. Eric T. Schneiderman said the allegations ""will effectively prevent me from leading the office’s work at this critical time."" All the women in the article said the violence was not consensual. NOT READY FOR NOVEMBER: Former DNC head and CNN analyst Donna Brazile says statewide political campaigns are not ready for the type of hacking, from Russia and elsewhere, that bedeviled America’s 2016 vote. Brazile, in a paper for Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, finds less than half of Republican and Democratic campaign operatives have taken steps to make their data secure. Brazile wrote the 2017 best-seller “Hacks,” on the Russian infiltration of Hillary Clinton’s campaign communications. SOMETHING NEW FOR SUBSCRIBERS: A “conference call” sounds so blase and corporate, but what the NYT is doing with its podcast “Caliphate” might be a model that many could adapt, says Shan Wang of Nieman Labs. In this case, the call to subscribers to this ISIS-related podcast had the benefit of NYT’s Rukmini Callimachi, the Romanian-born, California-raised (and frequently Morning Mediawire praised) expert on ISIS who Wang wrote “sounded unpracticed, lively, and totally normal on the call.” DEATH KNELL FOR MEDIA FREEDOM IN CAMBODIA?: A rights group has criticized the sale of an independent Cambodian newspaper to a company that does public relations for the regime. Several editors of the Phnom Penh Post quit or were fired for refusing to remove a reference to the ties between the new owner and strongman Hun Sen. Seven months ago, the government forced another independent newspaper, the Cambodia Daily, to close. ANTI-SEMITES GALORE ON TWITTER: The Anti-Defamation League reported Monday that 4.2 million anti-Semitic tweets in English were posted or reposted on Twitter in the past year. That follows a report finding the highest number of anti-Semitic attacks in the United States in at least 20 years. ADL national director and CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said the Twitter data showed many used the social network as a “megaphone to harass and intimidate Jews,” AP reported. DOUBLE THE FUTURE: Axios is moving the veteran reporter Steve LeVine’s weekly look at jobs, discoveries, trends and policies for the future to twice-weekly. WHOOPS: Guns have gone off by mistake at least 30 times in schools since 2014, a data analysis found. Maybe convicted felon and new NRA president Oliver North — yeah, the guy behind an embarrassing and illegal arms-for-hostages deal with Iran — may encourage the NRA not to arm teachers. Or maybe not. CAN GOOGLE KILL THE BAIL BOND SYSTEM?: Google is banning ads for bail bond services starting in July, saying it does not want to be a part of a system that perpetuates racism. ""For-profit bail bond providers make most of their revenue from communities of color and low income neighborhoods when they are at their most vulnerable, including through opaque financing offers that can keep people in debt for months or years,"" wrote Google\'s global policy director, David Graff. ""We made this decision based on our commitment to protect our users from deceptive or harmful products."" Says Gina Clayton, executive director of the Essie Justice Group, Google\'s move is ""a call to action for all those in the private sector who profit off of mass incarceration. It is time to say ‘no more.’"" (Hat tip: Raju Narisetti) WHOSE SPIES WERE THEY?: How a private Israeli intelligence unit — the same one that harassed accusers of Harvey Weinstein — was employed to spy on and entrap U.S. officials who had negotiated the Iran nuclear arms agreement. The latest from the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow. BEYOND MOONWALKING: Michael Jackson also wanted his freedom, a white freedom, writes Ta-Nehisi Coates in the Atlantic. There’s a difference, however, with Kanye West’s embrace of Donald Trump. “The rule of Donald Trump is predicated on the infliction of maximum misery of West’s most ardent parishioners, the portions of America, the muck, that made the god Kanye possible,” Coates writes. WE’LL SEPARATE YOU FROM YOUR CHILDREN: That’s the message from Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday to people who cross U.S. borders without documentation. Sessions said 700 kids already have been taken away from their parents by U.S. officials since July. THE EYE ON THE BALL: The Trump administration’s denial of temporary protective status for 57.000 Hondurans puts the U.S. on course so that 400,000 people living in America will be unauthorized immigrants by January 2020, writes Dara Lind of Vox. If DACA goes down, that could be 1 million other Americans who are suddenly unauthorized to live here.

Amy,Walter,['http://wfae.org/post/democrats-base-energized-they-still-need-message'],b'1022',"['STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: OK, so Democrats who are running for office in 2018 believe they have the wind at their backs. Their political base is energized, and they hope to turn that energy into winning campaigns for the House and the Senate. Many general election campaigns officially kick off tonight after the winners are clear in primary races in these states - Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, West Virginia. But Democrats face one big question - do they stand for anything besides their opposition to President Trump? Here\'s NPR\'s Mara Liasson. MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: This year, Democrats don\'t need much of a message to motivate their base. Donald Trump has done that for them. What Democrats do need, says Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report, is a message to move beyond their base. AMY WALTER: The next challenge then for Democrats is, how do they talk to independent voters or voters who may have supported Barack Obama in the past, voted for Donald Trump this time? How do they talk to those voters? LIASSON: Those voters are telling pollsters they want someone who will be a check and balance on the president. For them, Walter says, the Democrats\' message will be heavy on kitchen-table issues like the cost of health care and the tax cuts, especially in swing districts. WALTER: The message that many Democrats in Republican-leaning districts are going to promote, which is that Republicans voted for a tax bill that\'s going to push our deficit up to unbelievable heights, that it\'s going to risk cuts to Medicare and Social Security and that you, as your regular, average taxpayer, are not going to get all the benefits that you should. LIASSON: But even more than any specific issue, the Democrats\' message this year will be focused on political culture and tone. They\'re offering themselves as an alternative to division and polarization. Geoff Garin is a Democratic pollster. GEOFF GARIN: It\'s really where the conversation starts for a lot of voters in terms of having people who are willing to work in a kind of a down-to-earth, common-sense way, not looking to get into fights. LIASSON: That was the message for several successful Democratic candidates this cycle - Doug Jones in Alabama, Ralph Northam in Virginia, Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania. Jim Kessler from the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way says all those candidates shared something he calls the power of the quiet voice. JIM KESSLER: They\'re not screamers. They\'re not populists. They\'re not overtly ideological. LIASSON: Many Democrats think this political style can bridge the divides inside the party. Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo, who\'s running for re-election this year, thinks it\'s a message that will appeal across the Democratic coalition. GINA RAIMONDO: I think whether you are a recent immigrant, whether you\'re in the LGBTQ community, if you\'re a woman, if you\'re a middle-aged, white working man, you need a good job. The thing that most people are most focused on is keeping up and getting ahead in an economy which is changing incredibly fast, and that\'s the message I believe Democrats need to pound home. LIASSON: Instead of presenting the left-wing mirror image of Donald Trump, these candidates promised to get things done and dial down the partisanship. Former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen is sending this same message as he tries to flip a Senate seat in Tennessee. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, ""WHY I\'M RUNNING"") PHIL BREDESEN: I\'m running for the Senate because I have the right kind of experience and the actual track record that it will take to start working across party lines to fix the mess in Washington and bring common... LIASSON: Joe Trippi, who ran Doug Jones\', winning and soft-spoken campaign in Alabama, says if he could make a generic ad for Democrats to use this year, that\'s pretty much what it would sound like. JOE TRIPPI: I think it\'s just - it\'s the candidate talking directly to people and saying that there\'s too much chaos and division in Washington. LIASSON: Trippi would skip the collage of porn star headlines, and he would never even mention Donald Trump. TRIPPI: The mistake is, as soon as I add the word Trump at the top of that, the second you do it that way, it\'s a political attack on Trump. And even these Republicans who have their doubts and are tired and exhausted by it see it as exactly that - a personal, partisan attack, and you\'re just a Democrat. It\'s a mistake, in my view, to join in the polarization. LIASSON: So in a year when Donald Trump is dominating the conversation 24/7 and has become so identified with chaos and division, the best message for Democrats in competitive seats may be to not talk about him at all.

Amy,Walter,['https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/05/are-democrats-losing-the-midterms.html'],b'1021',"[""By Jamelle Bouie With less than six months left before Americans choose a new Congress, the race for a House majority has gotten surprisingly turbulent. The generic congressional ballot—a roughly reliable gauge of the final outcome—is tightening. FiveThirtyEight’s average shows Democrats with a modest 4- to 5-point advantage over Republicans, down from 12 points at the beginning of the year. At least one survey shows Republicans with the lead. Donald Trump is also trending upward. Trump is more popular—or rather, less unpopular—than he’s been in at least a year, with solid marks on his handling of the economy. Writing for Cook Political Report, Amy Walter notes that Trump’s approval ratings are no longer at an historic low: “His 42 percent showing is basically where Presidents Carter and Reagan were at this point in their presidencies.” Given the tight relationship between presidential approval and midterm performance, Trump’s improvement can only help incumbent Republicans. Above all, Republican voters have only grown more supportive of the president. The GOP has retained its grasp on the voters and constituencies that delivered the party the White House and both chambers of Congress. Despite the constant tumult in Washington, the GOP is unified in defense of Trump and his allies, and the party is calling on voters to defend Trump at the polls from Democrats who might subvert his agenda, or even call for his impeachment. These facts don’t point to a “blue wave” of Democratic dominance. Instead, they suggest a tight contest—one where Republicans could hold their majority even in the face of scandal, corruption, and mismanagement. But those national numbers aren’t congruent with what we see on the ground. Special elections—from statewide contests like the Alabama Senate race to district-level fights like the one in PA-18 with Conor Lamb—show intense Democratic enthusiasm, with candidates covering huge ground relative to 2016. That performance—which has netted Democrats dozens of wins in state legislative elections around the country—is one reason why forecasters still favor Democrats for a House majority in November. Roll Call, for example, has 68 GOP-held seats on its board of competitive districts, while Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball gives Democrats a 50-50 chance of winning control. Bolstering these odds are the record number of candidates in the field; Democrats are running everywhere, and the party has recruited a number of skilled and experienced challengers. This, alone, raises the chance of a successful November. Take all this together and you’re left with a broad range of possible outcomes. Republicans could survive Democratic enthusiasm and keep control of the House. Or Democrats could generate a genuine wave, wiping out the Republican majority with a decisive repudiation of the president. Some close races will swing on who each party chooses to nominate between now and November, and at least a handful could be determined by whether Democrats survive next month’s jungle primary in California. But if you were to estimate Democratic gains given generic ballot performance and the president’s approval, then you would have a solid Democratic victory of 23 to 25 seats. Democrats need 24 to win the majority. If you think Slate’s work matters, become a Slate Plus member.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/amy-walter-and-susan-page-on-trumps-embassy-move'],b'1020',"[""Political analysis that you won't find anywhere else. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Susan Page of USA Today join Judy Woodruff to discuss President Trump’s political calculus in moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the president’s tweet about potentially helping a Chinese telecom company hurt by U.S. sanctions and the outcomes of last week’s primary contests. Judy Woodruff: From the president's announcement the U.S. will reconsider sanctions on a Chinese phone company to the opening of the American Embassy in Jerusalem, there's a lot of news today with potentially far-reaching political fallout. To discuss it all, I'm joined by Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Susan Page of USA Today. Politics Monday. Welcome to both of you. So, Amy, this festive celebration today in Jerusalem. The president promised, I'm moving that embassy to Jerusalem. It's happened, celebrating there, but a few miles away big protests on the part of the Palestinians, more than 50 dead. What about the political calculus for the White House? Amy Walter: Yes, I think that this was clearly something that the president, like many things he talked about on the campaign trail, campaign promise that he wants to show Americans he can keep. And this is especially important for a group of voters that have been the most consistently supportive of the president, and that's evangelical voters, who have seen this decision to move the capital — the embassy — excuse me — to Jerusalem as really a high point in the president's tenure. We talk a lot about these evangelical voters and how do they find a way to square the president's behavior with his presidency, and I think it really is on things like this, where, on the policies, they see somebody that is supporting them and fighting for them in a way they haven't seen in other presidents, even Republican presidents who were more outwardly religious. Judy Woodruff: Susan, how do you see the upsides, downsides politically? Susan Page: It's certainly true, as the White House side, that other presidents had promised to do this or had supported the idea, and then not followed through. But the reason they didn't follow through was because, once you're actually president, you can see the costs involved, the costs involved in these deadly protests we saw in Gaza, also the costs involving in the U.S. role going forward as an honest broker in the Middle East. That is now gone. I think it's unlikely that the Palestinians will be willing to see the United States as an honest broker in negotiations for the rest of the Trump presidency. Judy Woodruff: Well, another development we have seen in the last few days was an international component, Amy. And that is the president's surprising tweet over the weekend that he wants to negotiate a better deal for this Chinese telecom giant called ZTE. He's now — the administration now worried they're losing a lot of jobs. They want to renegotiate everything. So, the question is — this is the president who talks about America first, America first, but here he's worried about Chinese jobs. Amy Walter: Right. Whenever we talk about President Trump, we try to talk — people like us talk about policy and we try to put it in this nice little context of what it's going to mean. I think, for so many voters, what they do is they see President Trump through the prism of his personality, not his policies. And so for plenty of voters out there who supported the president, they said, he's a businessman, he's a negotiator, he's going to figure it out. This is how you negotiate. You give them a little, they give you a little, and you finally come out with a better deal. So they are not going to see this as, wait a minute, you're giving away something to the Chinese, especially something that has far-reaching consequences when it comes to security issues? And then, if you're opposed to the president, you say, well, we told you so, right? This is a guy who said he was going to be a great negotiate, he doesn't know what he's doing, he's giving away jobs, or at least he's putting more emphasis on Chinese jobs, and not as concerned about security as he should be. But, at the end of the day, the policy piece is really filtered through whether you believe that he's going to be able to deliver on his promise. Susan Page: Let me disagree with you. Amy Walter: OK. Susan Page: Which is that I can see a campaign ad in the making, saving Chinese jobs? And if you can see an ad in a place that didn't get manufacturing jobs back, the way the president promised when he campaigned there in 2016, and instead protected Chinese jobs, and with a very controversial way, a company that is linked to the Chinese government, that has been identified as posing a cyber-security threat. Their products cannot be sold on U.S. bases because of — for fears for how they can be manipulated. So I think this is a perplexing step by the president. And I would be, I guess, surprised if he ends up following through on it. I wouldn't be surprised if they pull back in a major way from what he promised to do. Judy Woodruff: I noticed he's tweeting today trying to clarify. Amy Walter: But isn't that's what we have seen all along, right? The tariffs come out, and then the tariffs have caveats. And then the decision comes out on Twitter, and then it gets sort of cleaned up afterwards. I think this has been part of the course. But even — I think it's going to take something pretty significant, in other words, a real bite out of people, whether it's the tariffs. We heard that there's going to be all this uproar in the heartland because farmers are upset about these tariffs, these people who supported the president. And yet you don't see a real loss of support from the president there. When I talk to some of the folks out there, the sense is, we trust him to do the right thing. Now, if that turns out not to be true, then I would agree with you. But I think for now there's still a sense that we hired him to do this kind of job, for the people who support him. If you don't like him, it doesn't matter what he does. You're never going to give him credit for anything. Judy Woodruff: Speaking of the heartland, Susan, the voters were actually — they're starting to speak. We're starting to see primary contests out there. Last week, you had, what, West Virginia, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, tomorrow, a primary in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Are we seeing any patterns here? I know it's early. It's still may, the election finally in November, but are we learning anything from this? Susan Page: I think we're seeing a lot of Democratic energy both in the primaries and especially in the special elections. The special elections, even the ones the Democrats didn't win, they perform so much better than they did two years ago. It's given Democrats, I think, a lot of hope that this is a good year for them. Pennsylvania, a state that has a primary tomorrow, an important state to look at, because you remember they had to change all their congressional lines because of a gerrymandering case. They have had some Republicans retire. They have got, I think, 18 congressional districts. And I think that maybe five of them, according to The Cook Political Report, might be flippable for Democrats. They might pick up five seats just in Pennsylvania. They need to pick up 23 to win control of the House. Picking up five seats would get you a long way there. Amy Walter: And adding on to that, the candidates who may be the nominees here on the Democratic side, they are women in every single one of those districts. So you could see a state that right now has zero women in the delegation actually having five potentially in the delegation. And, you know, one of the story lines of this year is the energy among women voters, the candidates. A lot of these women who are running here are first-time candidates. They have never done anything like this before. They were brought out of the woodwork by the last election. Judy Woodruff: And a lot of them going up against incumbents, who are historically tough to beat, but a lot of story lines we will be following in the months to come. Amy Walter, Susan Page, Politics Monday, thank you. Susan Page: Thank you. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

Amy,Walter,"['https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/political-foes-house-talk-podcasting', 'https://hotair.com/archives/2018/05/15/dems-lead-generic-ballot-shrinks-5-2-points-smallest-trumps-presidency/']",b'1019',"['Democratic strategist Ali Lapp and and Republican strategist Liesl Hickey chat before recording an episode of their podcast “House Talk with Ali and Liesl” at the EMILY’s List office in Washington, D.C. (Thomas McKinless/CQ Roll Call file photo) Ali Lapp spent several hundred thousand dollars trying to defeat Rep. Mark S. Kirk in 2006. The Illinois Republican, whose office was led by Chief of Staff Liesl Hickey, held on. Fast forward 10 years, and the two women met for the first time at Tonic, a bar in Washington’s Foggy Bottom neighborhood, for what they jokingly call their “blind date.” The encounter was a success. Lapp and Hickey still work against each other in politics. A veteran of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Lapp is the founder and president of House Majority PAC. Hickey, the onetime executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, is a founding partner of Ascent Media. But the two women come together several times a month to host their own podcast about House races, a topic of increasing national interest this year. “House Talk” just came out with its 19th episode. Its subscribers on iTunes are increasing, but Lapp and Hickey aren’t after the mass appeal of cable news. “You can’t have a political TV host get into the weeds the way they can,” said The Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter, who set them up. Like many women running for office this year, Lapp and Hickey’s appeal may lie in their authenticity: They talk about what they know and care about. And in a city known for polarization, their shared experiences — as strategists and moms — is a rare transcendence of partisanship. On a recent Monday this spring, the two sat side by side, armed with printed notes and water bottles in a conference room at EMILY’s List’s downtown headquarters. A recent purchase of portable microphones allows them to go where their guests are. They were interviewing EMILY’s List executive director Emily Cain, a former House candidate herself, and VIEW PAC executive director Julie Conway about women running for Congress this year. “They’re telling their own stories. They’re not trying to tell a male story,” Hickey said on the show, alluding to the authenticity female candidates are bringing to campaigns this year. The podcast allows Lapp and Hickey to share their stories and knowledge, too. Having both experienced the 2006 cycle, they’ve been at the forefront of campaigns for longer than many of the operatives and pundits dipping their toes into this year’s midterms. “They speak for a lot of us who have been working on the House side for a long time, often when other parts of politics were getting more attention,” said Democratic consultant Ian Russell, who was a guest on the 15th episode, which covered crowded Democratic primaries. Both women are raising three kids in between demanding jobs. Lapp is married to another Democratic operative, ad maker John Lapp. Hickey is married to an oyster farmer. Working in the podcast format fit into their busy schedules — jeans welcome and no blowouts necessary. Both Lapp and Hickey became interested in politics from an early age. Lapp’s earliest political memory is watching vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro’s plane land at Boeing Field outside of Seattle. Hickey played former Mississippi Sen. Thad Cochran in Model Congress in high school. They both got their starts working in similar moderate, suburban environments — Lapp worked for Rep. Adam Smith, who’s from her home state of Washington. Hickey grew up in Florida but cut her teeth in Illinois politics. “The fact that they’re women who are involved at the highest level of House race politics, there aren’t a ton of those out there,” Walter said. When it comes to campaigns, Lapp said she’s noticed female operatives are often less interested in “the politics-as-sport mentality” and more interested in voter psychology. “I really like thinking about why are these voters voting for Obama and Donald Trump? Like what is going on in their heads?” Lapp said. “That’s why swing districts are more fun,” Hickey added. “You actually have to go out and talk to a bunch of voters who don’t really want to vote for someone like your potential candidate, and how do you get them to want to?” That level of inquisitiveness makes them well-suited to host a podcast. Before starting, they reached out to two pollsters, Republican Kristen Soltis Anderson and Democrat Margie Omero, hosts of “The Pollsters” podcast. “I had been doing my podcast for over two years, and had found that there really was this appetite for a podcast that has voices from different sides of the aisle but is not a debate show,” Soltis Anderson said. Walter pointed out that women have often been the ones having civil, bipartisan conversations, going back to Dee Dee Myers and Mary Matalin co-hosting CNBC’s “Equal Time” talk show in 1995. “We’ll disagree about whether Obamacare is good policy or whatever, but we’re not going to have a whole show about that,” Lapp said. Most of the “House Talk” episodes feature at least one guest, except for the most recent, in which Lapp and Hickey shared their lists — with strong, but polite, disagreements — on the races they see as most competitive. Walter was the first guest, appearing on the inaugural episode about last year’s special election in Georgia. Since then, they’ve had on one member of Congress (Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos), other political analysts such as Nathan L. Gonzales and Dave Wasserman, operatives and pollsters from both sides of the aisle, and reporters Abby Livingston and Alex Roarty. “They’re not people who are on cable news,” Hickey said. “They’re people who are actually in the trenches working on campaigns.” They’ve talked about wave elections, millennial voters, the state of the Republican Party, independent expenditures and specific states. “There’s a real craft to our business that’s incredibly interesting,” Hickey said. “And if you take it seriously and you learn it, it’s a really fun career.” That shows on air. Unlike some podcasts that give way to rambling, tangential conversations, theirs is focused but with plenty of lighter interludes. The hosts are getting better at social media, with the help of an intern who also helps with research. Another woman from Hickey’s office helps with recording. The primary audience is in D.C., but they’ve also heard from listeners outside the Beltway who Lapp said sounded like them in college — “into politics and kind of looking for something that’s more detailed and insidery.” Lapp and Hickey are still on opposing sides in 2018. “Our goals are very different for the cycle and so [we’re] not talking a lot of shop,” Hickey said. On the show and in real life, though, they often finish each other’s sentences. “They’re a throwback to the way D.C. used to be 20 to 25 years ago where there would be more bipartisan friendships,” Walter said. But how long will House races be cool? The hosts know presidential chatter will soon eclipse the scrutiny House contests are receiving this year. But with redistricting around the corner, they think the appetite for House knowledge will still be there. “We haven’t even talked about what happens after November. We’re kinda just getting through this year,” Lapp said. For now, they’re hoping to match the summer intensity of the campaigns by starting to record once a week in June.

Get Roll Call in your inbox ×', 'AllahpunditPosted at 8:41 pm on May 15, 2018 America’s got a fee-vah and the only prescription is … continued Republican control of government? Maybe? Lately when there’s news about improving GOP fortunes in the RCP “poll of polls” the reference point has been to the first few months of Trump’s term. Through about May of 2017 (not coincidentally, the month he fired Comey), POTUS’s job approval was hovering at around 43-44 percent and the Democratic lead on the generic ballot was in the six-point range. Then began a long decline on both fronts followed by a recovery this spring. But today’s news is different. At 5.2 points, this is the smallest generic-ballot lead the Dems have had since Inauguration Day. At no point in Trump’s presidency, even over the first hundred days when the jury of public opinion was still out on him, was the GOP as close as it is now. Don\'t look now, but Democrats only lead the GOP by 5.2 on the generic ballot RCP polling average. That is down from a 13 point lead at the end of 2017, and is the smallest margin in the polling cycle for Democrats. pic.twitter.com/QpZHyrvIHx — Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) May 15, 2018 I know someone who’s going to be having two scoops of ice cream for dessert tonight instead of one: Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 15, 2018 That’s *technically* not true — his best polling of the year came nine days ago — but it’s close enough, especially given the rising Republican tide in the generic ballot. We have a new ballgame in the midterms if these numbers hold, says RCP elections guru Sean Trende: If the election were held today, I\'m not sure who would win the House. First time I\'ve been able to say that since summer of last year. — Sean T at RCP (@SeanTrende) May 14, 2018 Especially when you narrow down to Registered/Likely voter polls. So, my expectation remains that Ds will take the House, but it is now a VERY weakly held one. I would not be surprised if it did not flip. And if trends continue (IF), it probably won\'t. 7/7 — Sean T at RCP (@SeanTrende) May 14, 2018 Amy Walter, the elections chief at the Cook Political Report, concurs: Same. Trump has had good month. Job approve slowly ticking up. Most important: Rs not fighting w/ each other, and Trump not attacking GOP leaders. https://t.co/JajyKUIZHY — amy walter (@amyewalter) May 15, 2018 There have been a lot of good-news polls for the GOP lately and the explanations always boil down to the same factors — the economy, some foreign-policy successes, less drama than usual. It may be that some of the generic-ballot support for Dems last year rested on the suspicion that Trump doesn’t know what he’s doing and therefore disaster was perpetually right around the corner. Now that we’re nearly four months into year two and remain disaster-free, some of those suspicions might be starting to lift such that the idea of continued GOP control of government isn’t as scary. It may even be, says Niall Ferguson, that voters are beginning to think Trump knows what he’s doing: What about Obama’s North Korea policy? In essence, his administration applied ineffectual sanctions that did nothing whatsoever to slow down Kim Jong Un’s nuclear arms program. As Obama left the White House, we were assured that North Korea was still roughly five years away from having intercontinental ballistic missiles and a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on them. Not long after Trump’s inauguration, it became clear that North Korea had in fact been just five months away from possessing those assets. Trump’s approach is almost exactly the opposite of Obama’s. Trump began by explicitly threatening Pyongyang with “fire and fury.” For a time Kim acted defiant, but the fact that both South Korea and China feared Trump was in earnest had its effect. The South Koreans offered olive branches. The Chinese squeezed North Korea’s economic windpipe. Trump then made a key concession: He agreed to a summit meeting with Kim. Next month in Singapore we shall see what comes of it. My guess is that the deal will make Trump’s knee-jerk critics themselves look foolish. He won’t get complete denuclearization, but he will get some. Meanwhile, large-scale South Korean and Chinese investment in North Korea will start the process of prising open the hermit kingdom. Could be. Nothing can stop the GOP now! .@elianayjohnson & @sahilkapur hit the nail on the head.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/commentary-can-the-gop-keep-the-house-in-november/'],b'1018',"['If anything is a lead-pipe cinch in American politics, it\'s that the party out of power in Washington, DC always cleans up in the midterm elections—particularly the first midterm. If you Google ""midterm"" and ""Democrats"" right now, you\'ll be bombarded with the phrases #BlueWave, ""Blue Tsunami"" and ""That blue supervillain guy from the new Avengers movie."" With Trump\'s weak approval ratings and the history of off-year partisan backlash, ""Speaker Nancy Pelosi"" is a done deal. Except, in the era of Trump, there apparently are no ""done deals."" (Just ask his former contractors.) ""If the election were held today, I\'m not sure who would win the House. First time I\'ve been able to say that since summer of last year."" That tweet from RealClearPolitics numbers-cruncher Sean Trende earlier this week stunned many on the Right. Trende, like the vast majority of poll-obsessed politicos, has been writing off the GOP House majority as a political ""Dead Man Walking"" for months. Not anymore. And he\'s not alone. Amy Walter, national editor at Cook Political Report, agreed: ""Same. Trump has had good month. Job approve slowly ticking up. Most important: Rs not fighting w/ each other, and Trump not attacking GOP leaders."" Same. Trump has had good month. Job approve slowly ticking up. Most important: Rs not fighting w/ each other, and Trump not attacking GOP leaders. https://t.co/JajyKUIZHY Now Republicans are starting to allow themselves to dream: Is it even possible the GOP could hold onto the House in November? Some of this is inspired by the surprising and steady rise of President Trump\'s approval ratings. In mid-December he was underwater by 21 points—a disaster for him and his party. Since then he\'s gotten that margin down to single digits -- 43 approve, 52 disapprove in the latest RealClearPolitics average. For Donald Trump, that\'s practically unanimous consent. But to paraphrase scripture, ""The Trump Giveth, the Trump Taketh Away."" Every Republican knows this president is one bad morning on Twitter or one bad meeting with Bob Mueller away from blowing up his own success. Which is why the other numbers making news this week are so interesting. On Wednesday a new Morning Consult/Politico poll hit. The takeaway headlines were about America\'s warmth toward North Korea and coolness to the idea of a Trump Nobel Prize, but buried in the crosstabs, there was something else. When asked if an endorsement from Nancy Pelosi would make you more or less likely to support a candidate, 49 percent of self-identified Hillary Clinton supporters said ""less."" This is a problem because Pelosi and the Democrats\' congressional leadership have been trying to craft tickets for November that they believe have a better chance of winning independent and cross-over Republican votes. Democratic primary voters don\'t appear to be in the mood to listen. On Tuesday night, two progressive Democrats beat establishment-backed choices in swing house districts. Kara Eastman, a progressive activist who ran on a Bernie Sanders-style platform, beat former congressman and moderate Democrat Brad Ashford in Nebraska. In a swing open-seat district in Pennsylvania\'s Lehigh Valley, progressive attorney Susan Wild beat the better-known—and more moderate—District Attorney John Morganelli. Democratic leaders seemed to have sensed earlier on that the November election would be more competitive than once thought. They\'ve been working to nominate candidates in the Conor Lamb model—not as liberal as the Pelosi leadership, but more electable in their district. Progressives, however, have been energized by their anti-Trump animus and are pushing back. In Texas\'s Seventh District, for example, there is open warfare between the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and progressives at that primary goes to a runoff on May 22nd. The DCCC took the unusual step of attacking a Democrat, Laura Moser, in hopes of keeping her off the ballot in favor of a more moderate candidate. It didn\'t work, and now Moser has a very good chance of being the nominee in what is regarded as a rare, winnable GOP-held seat in Texas. Echoes of Hillary vs. Bernie don\'t help Democrats focus on November. And party unity wasn\'t improved when last month, an audio tape was released of a private conversation between Democratic House Whip Steny Hoyer and progressive Democrat Levi Tillemann. Hoyer is heard asking the liberal to drop out of Colorado\'s 6th congressional district primary, and states that the party has already decided to back a more moderate candidate, Jason Crow. If this sounds similar to the battle between Tea Party conservatives and the GOP establishment—it is. One reason Trump\'s numbers have steadily the past few months is because Republican voters are coalescing around him. There\'s more unity in the party over all. Some media reports say Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell has explicitly asked President Trump to stop criticizing the GOP Senate. And in West Virginia, Trump went out of his way to clearly denounce Don ""Trumpier than Trump"" Blankenship—a very different performance from the mixed signals he sent regarding Judge Roy Moore in Alabama. If Democrats are divided and Republicans are united, the GOP\'s chances of denying the Democrats the 23 seats they need goes up. But the real difference maker is Donald Trump. ""This is all about the President\'s performance,"" Trende says. ""The economy is doing great, he\'s made big moves on North Korea and Israel that make him look presidential, and he\'s proven that—even when he\'s saying unpresidential things—he\'s not going to get us into a war or blow the world up."" ""People were really worried about that when he told office,"" Trende says. ""It\'s easy to dismiss, but it\'s true."" Morning Consult\'s Jeff Cartwright agrees that, if the GOP really is back in the game for the midterms (he says that\'s a big ""if""), it\'s all Trump\'s doing. ""You can connect all the trends to Trump\'s approval numbers,"" Cartwright says. ""At their worst, Trump was in the mid-30s and the Democrats had a double-digit lead in the generic ballot. Trump\'s turned that number around and that big generic-ballot margin is gone."" Cartwright also notes that Democratic hopes for that #BigWave don\'t have as much data behind them as some believe. ""When you look race by race in the special elections since 2016, you tend to see Democratic upsets, yes. But not blowouts. These have mostly been tight races.""

Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Stuart Rothenberg of Inside Elections join Amna Nawaz to discuss who’s running in Tuesday’s elections in Georgia, Kentucky, Arkansas and Texas, plus tension among Republicans over immigration policy, and how lawmakers are responding to Friday’s shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, and what it will mean to voters. Amna Nawaz: It's a Monday evening in a midterm election year, which means voters somewhere are heading to the polls tomorrow. This time, it's primary voters in Georgia, Kentucky and Arkansas, and a run-off in Texas. To give us an early look at what to watch, I'm joined by Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Stuart Rothenberg of Inside Elections. Welcome, Amy and Stu. Let's talk about some of those primary races. Now, two in particular, Georgia and Texas, have caught a lot of people's attention. In Georgia, it's the battle of the Staceys, right, Stacey Abrams vs. Stacey Evans. In Texas, it's a run-off between Laura Moser and Lizzie Fletcher. Amy, what do we know about the Democrats right now? What do these two races tell us about where they are right now? Amy Walter: Well, I think the most important thing is the thing that you mentioned at the beginning, which is, if you noticed, all these the names were female. So, we're seeing a lot of these contests. Also, we have a contest in question Kentucky, where there's a woman in a very competitive primary. So women have been a big story of this 2018 election. In either case, we're going to see a woman come out of one of these primaries and be the nominee. There's some debate — a lot of it is centered in Washington — about whether there's this ideological battle going on the Democratic side between sort of the Bernie progressive coalition and the more centrist Hillary Clinton coalition. I think really what's happening is much more stylist than it is substantive. It's less ideological than it is about the real fervor on the Democratic side, not just to turn out and vote and put more Democrats in office and be a check on President Trump, but to do it in a way that brings in a whole bunch of new people. And so what you're seeing in both the Texas race and the Georgia race, one Democrat is saying, if we're going to win, we have got to do it by bring out younger voters, voters of color, people who don't normally turn out in midterm elections. You're not going to do that with sort of a mealymouthed moderate message. The other Democrat is saying, the only way we win in places like Georgia and Texas, you have got to win Republicans. These are not overwhelmingly Democratic areas. So, that's really what we're going to be watching for in the primary and then how they translate that. Whoever wins has to translate that vision in a general election. Amna Nawaz: Stu, what do you make about that? There's a lot of talk about the battle for the soul of the Democratic Party, right? Stuart Rothenberg: Yes, I think Amy is being too kind. She's being very kind, that I think, in many cases, reporters, analysts are trying to kind of impose a single interpretation on every race throughout the country. I think the Texas 7 race with Fletcher and with Moser is an establishment vs. insurgent progressive fight. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and EMILY's List have both endorsed Lizzie Fletcher. Laura Moser is the kind of Bernie Sanders insurgent progressive, hold your feet to the fire, you have got to be true blood every issue. The Georgia race is much less so, right, Amy? It's — there's a racial component here. We have an African-American woman and a white woman. And it's true that, traditionally, the argument was nominate the white woman who can hold the African-Americans, and yet get white voters otherwise. Amna Nawaz: That was the safe bet, right? Stuart Rothenberg: That was the safe bet. But, otherwise, this race isn't really the ideological race. (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: Right. And, right, this would be the first African-American woman governor ever, ever. Amna Nawaz: In the country. Amy Walter: So, that, you have to look to as the more motivating factor than whether this is ideological. Amna Nawaz: But does this say something about where the party is heading when you look at who they're choosing to endorse or support in these races? Stuart Rothenberg: Oh, yes. I think the party is divided. Look, both parties are divided. They have multiple wings and they are trying to figure out, how do we all get along here? How do we nominate candidates who can appeal to a broad spectrum of voters and have enough charisma and energy to bring out the base, the core believers? Amy Walter: Right. Right. And this is — the other issue in this election is so much of — especially on the Democratic side, the candidates who are coming, this is organic. These people just decided one day they were going to run. The Trump election really energized them, in a way that we haven't seen before. Normally, the parties, they go out, they recruit somebody in these districts, and then maybe there's an insurgent that comes in that they didn't expect. In this case, there are five or six or seven candidates they never talked to, they don't have anything to do with, meaning the party, and they may be the standard bearers. They have got to — they're going to have to catch up to where the candidates are, as opposed to the candidates catching up with the party. Amna Nawaz: Let me ask where about some of these candidates may end up, on Capitol Hill, where the Republicans are in control. They seem to have hit some road bumps, though, right? They failed to pass the farm bill on Friday. There's a new battle over immigration brewing now between the moderates and the Freedom Caucus. Amy, tell me about this. Is the Republican Party sort of at war with itself right now? Amy Walter: Stu made this comment. They're always at war, right? The parties are always at war with themselves. And this has proven time and again to be an ungovernable caucus on the Republican side, right? Time and again, it's the Freedom Caucus that tends to put the leadership in a really tight position. So, I think what we're seeing on immigration is the bigger internal battle with the Republican Party between the hard-liners — and now President Trump is over on that side talking about MS-13 and border security and sanctuary cities — and more moderate Republicans who have to go back in November and talk to more centrist voters with a message that is not as hard-line. Stuart Rothenberg: Let me just add, there is a reason why John Boehner survived as speaker for so long. The party couldn't figure out anybody else who they could vote for who would take the job. There was a reason why Paul Ryan became speaker. The party looked around, was looking for alternatives. Ryan had said no. Finally, they had to get Ryan. Leading this group is very difficult. And, in fact, the nature of political leadership now is much more difficult when you have these outside forces competing against the establishment. Amna Nawaz: Speaking of leadership, I want to ask you, Stu, before we go, in reaction to the Texas shooting last week, we did hear from Senate Majority Leader McConnell basically expressing his condolences, calling it a senseless act of violence. We haven't heard a plan. We haven't heard any let's move for action, let's take this up, let's do this. Is this where we are now? Is this just the way it will move forward? States will have to step up if they want to see some action? Stuart Rothenberg: Yes, I can't imagine the Hill doing anything in the near future. And you're seeing some states address the issue in terms of gun control or access to guns. No, it's going to have to be in the states. The only way this is a — guns is a national issue has to do with the midterm elections and motivating and mobilizing college-educated white women, who have simply had it now with guns and shootings and school shootings. Amna Nawaz: That's the core group that — for whom this could become a voting issue. Stuart Rothenberg: I think they're a key group. And they can be affected these efforts. But, otherwise, the states are going to have take the lead in terms of legislation. Amna Nawaz: Very quickly. (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: Right. And not just those women, but also younger voters, who have been marching in the streets. Are they going to show up to the ballot box? Amna Nawaz: We will see, indeed, in the midterms ahead. Amy Walter and Stu Rothenberg, always good to talk to you. Thanks for being here. Stuart Rothenberg: You're welcome. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

Amna Nawaz: But does this say something about where the party is heading when you look at who they're choosing to endorse or support in these races? Stuart Rothenberg: Oh, yes. I think the party is divided. Look, both parties are divided. They have multiple wings and they are trying to figure out, how do we all get along here? How do we nominate candidates who can appeal to a broad spectrum of voters and have enough charisma and energy to bring out the base, the core believers? Amy Walter: Right. Right. And this is — the other issue in this election is so much of — especially on the Democratic side, the candidates who are coming, this is organic. These people just decided one day they were going to run. The Trump election really energized them, in a way that we haven't seen before. Normally, the parties, they go out, they recruit somebody in these districts, and then maybe there's an insurgent that comes in that they didn't expect. In this case, there are five or six or seven candidates they never talked to, they don't have anything to do with, meaning the party, and they may be the standard bearers. They have got to — they're going to have to catch up to where the candidates are, as opposed to the candidates catching up with the party. Amna Nawaz: Let me ask where about some of these candidates may end up, on Capitol Hill, where the Republicans are in control. They seem to have hit some road bumps, though, right? They failed to pass the farm bill on Friday. There's a new battle over immigration brewing now between the moderates and the Freedom Caucus. Amy, tell me about this. Is the Republican Party sort of at war with itself right now? Amy Walter: Stu made this comment. They're always at war, right? The parties are always at war with themselves. And this has proven time and again to be an ungovernable caucus on the Republican side, right? Time and again, it's the Freedom Caucus that tends to put the leadership in a really tight position. So, I think what we're seeing on immigration is the bigger internal battle with the Republican Party between the hard-liners — and now President Trump is over on that side talking about MS-13 and border security and sanctuary cities — and more moderate Republicans who have to go back in November and talk to more centrist voters with a message that is not as hard-line. Stuart Rothenberg: Let me just add, there is a reason why John Boehner survived as speaker for so long. The party couldn't figure out anybody else who they could vote for who would take the job. There was a reason why Paul Ryan became speaker. The party looked around, was looking for alternatives. Ryan had said no. Finally, they had to get Ryan. Leading this group is very difficult. And, in fact, the nature of political leadership now is much more difficult when you have these outside forces competing against the establishment. Amna Nawaz: Speaking of leadership, I want to ask you, Stu, before we go, in reaction to the Texas shooting last week, we did hear from Senate Majority Leader McConnell basically expressing his condolences, calling it a senseless act of violence. We haven't heard a plan. We haven't heard any let's move for action, let's take this up, let's do this. Is this where we are now? Is this just the way it will move forward? States will have to step up if they want to see some action? Stuart Rothenberg: Yes, I can't imagine the Hill doing anything in the near future. And you're seeing some states address the issue in terms of gun control or access to guns. No, it's going to have to be in the states. The only way this is a — guns is a national issue has to do with the midterm elections and motivating and mobilizing college-educated white women, who have simply had it now with guns and shootings and school shootings. Amna Nawaz: That's the core group that — for whom this could become a voting issue. Stuart Rothenberg: I think they're a key group. And they can be affected these efforts. But, otherwise, the states are going to have take the lead in terms of legislation. Amna Nawaz: Very quickly. (CROSSTALK) Amy Walter: Right. And not just those women, but also younger voters, who have been marching in the streets. Are they going to show up to the ballot box? Amna Nawaz: We will see, indeed, in the midterms ahead. Amy Walter and Stu Rothenberg, always good to talk to you. Thanks for being here. Stuart Rothenberg: You're welcome. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

BioCardia CEO Peter Altman, PhD, stated, ""This new patent reflects the personalized approach we are taking with CardiAMP cell therapy. It details aspects of performing pre-procedural screening of a patient\'s bone marrow to determine if he or she is appropriate for the therapy. By selecting patients most likely to respond to therapy, we anticipate magnifying the efficacy signal in our CardiAMP cell therapy system clinical programs."" The patent provides coverage for BioCardia\'s CardiAMP Cell Therapy System, which is being studied in two FDA-approved pivotal clinical trials for the large unmet needs of heart failure and chronic myocardial ischemia with refractory angina. The heart failure trial is currently enrolling patients at 10 centers in the United States, while the refractory angina trial is expected to begin patient enrollment later this year. In prior marrow heart failure studies, therapeutic benefit has been correlated to higher effective doses of specific cell types. One of the primary challenges with point-of-care autologous cell therapy is the variability of a patient\'s own stem cells. The CardiAMP cell potency assay is designed to address this variability by assessing whether the amount of select cell types from a marrow sample meets a proprietary acceptance criterion derived from data from these past trials. The CardiAMP cell potency assay is an important element of the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System development and is believed to be the first assay of its kind proposed as a quality-based inclusion criterion for a non-cultured autologous cell therapy. BioCardia Chairman Simon Stertzer, M.D., added, ""This issued patent describes one important element of our comprehensive approach to advancing cell therapy for the treatment of heart disease. Data tells us that this personalized medicine element, in conjunction with other elements in the CardiAMP Cell Therapy System, should maximize our probability of clinical and commercial success."" About BioCardia BioCardia, Inc., headquartered in San Carlos, California, is developing regenerative biologic therapies to treat cardiovascular disease. CardiAMP and CardiALLO cell therapies are the Company\'s biotherapeutic product candidates in clinical development. The Company\'s current products include the Helixâ\x84¢ transendocardial delivery system and the MorphÂ® steerable guide and sheath catheter portfolio. BioCardia also partners with other biotherapeutic companies to provide its Helix systems and clinical support to their programs studying therapies for the treatment of heart failure, chronic myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction.

Massachussetts-based Ocean Spray on Friday announced it would buy the Atoka processing plant at Manseau, Que., about 70 km east of Trois-Rivieres, along with the Atoka brand from berry producer Canneberges Bieler. Financial terms of the deal, which is expected to close “in the coming weeks,” weren’t disclosed Friday. Ocean Spray, which makes and markets cranberry juices, juice drinks and dried cranberries, also plans to buy Bieler’s freezer and receiving facilities “in the coming year,” and to make “additional capital investments in these facilities to further increase efficiency and improve yield.” Spitz to continue using Canadian sunflower seed Moving freight to get more expensive for food companies Governments to kick-start Ontario hazelnut sector ADVERTISEMENT Bieler is to continue its cranberry-growing operations, Ocean Spray said, and will become a “farmer-owner” in the Ocean Spray co-operative. Out of its 700-odd members in three countries, the co-op’s Canadian cranberry-growing members are based in Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. It recently set up a 125-acre co-operative-owned farm at Rogersville, N.B., about 40 km south of Miramichi. The co-operative’s Canadian holdings also include receiving facilities in British Columbia, at Langley and Richmond. The co-operative said the deal “will expand Ocean Spray’s manufacturing footprint in Quebec, the second-largest and fastest-growing cranberry farming region in the world.” On its website, the co-op noted Quebec’s cranberry industry has seen “stunning” expansion, having become the world’s second-biggest cranberry growing region as of 2014, compared to just three growers on 264 acres in 1992. According to Atoka, Quebec’s production in 2012 represented about 20 per cent of the world’s total cranberry output, behind Wisconsin at about 40 per cent that year. ADVERTISEMENT “Ocean Spray’s brand strength and global marketing reach, coupled with Atoka’s unique product portfolio and location, will benefit all of our farmers and expand the reach of the overall Quebec cranberry industry,” co-op CEO Randy Papadellis said in a release. The deal for Atoka, he noted, comes “exactly 60 years after Quebec growers first joined the Ocean Spray co-operative in 1958.” Atoka began building its processing plant in 1988, four years after Bieler began growing cranberries in the Centre-du-Quebec region. Since then, Atoka said on its website, its processing business expanded into marketing and packaging and its plant has undergone seven more expansion phases, today including five production lines, three freezer units and a laboratory, and employing about 130 people. Atoka employees will become part of Ocean Spray’s manufacturing network, the co-op said. That network also includes manufacturing plants in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Washington and at Lanco in southern Chile, plus beverage plants in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Texas and Nevada. “The employees of Atoka and Ocean Spray share a similar culture of quality and customer focus, as well as a unique dedication to increasing demand for cranberries,” Bieler CEO Marc Bieler said in Ocean Spray’s release. — AGCanada.com Network Staff's recent articles More Articles ADVERTISEMENT Stories from our other publications Farmtario crops New soil test can be tied to yield Grainews columns Cover crops and green manure Grainews features Farming for the insects and birds Grainews crops Submitting seed for germination testing ADVERTISEMENT Subscribe to the Country Guide daily newsletter You'll receive current daily news every morning free, as well as market updates and special features. * PERMISSION TO CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL By providing your e-mail address, you confirm that you are providing consent to Glacier Farm Media LP, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates, and carrying on business through its divisions, to receive emails containing news, updates and promotions, including third party promotions, as well as product and/or service information, including that of third parties, that may be of interest to you, and that you understand you may unsubscribe at any time.

Randy,Papadellis,['https://qz.com/1246514/the-us-china-trade-war-has-turned-cranberry-farmers-into-an-unlikely-pawn/'],b'1006',"['The secret of the cranberry’s success has always been stealth. After two centuries of cranberry-free Thanksgivings, the fruit quietly became a holiday staple thanks to US general Ulysses S. Grant’s 1864 holiday feast. It slipped into lunch sacks across America by pioneering juice boxes, and craftily came to dominate the juice aisles by commingling with apple juice. In the 1990s, a little shape-shifting allowed dried cranberries to infiltrate baked goods and trail mixes. In recent years, it crept its cranberry creep over to China, nestling into the palms of health-conscious young people across the Middle Kingdom. And now, the bitter red bog-berry finds itself in the midst of the burgeoning US-China trade war. According to the latest list of items on which China is considering slapping duties, the duty on Chinese imports of American dried cranberries will total 40% if the proposal goes into effect. America’s cranberry-growers are upset—and they should be. “Overall, exports represent about 31% of annual cranberry sales,” says Terry Humfeld, executive director of the Cranberry Institute, a nonprofit industry group based in Massachusetts. ”As a result of significant investments by the US cranberry industry, the Chinese market has been grown over the last several years to represent about 7% of those exports or about $45 million annually.” The industry’s angst is illustrative of a much bigger problem. As sipping and snacking sensations go, the cranberry is an unlikely one. It’s managed to succeed with marketing innovation—which includes taking advantage of the forces of globalization. The cranberry industry needs new sources of demand to keep growing, and that’s meant nurturing foreign markets like China. A trade war could cost the US its comparative advantage in a tiny, but irreplaceable, symbol of American commercial ingenuity. America doesn’t have much in the way of native fruits grown at any commercial scale. Three, to be precise: the Concord grape, the blueberry, and the cranberry. Many millennia ago, at the end of the Ice Age, retreating glaciers pocked New England with what are called “kettle holes”—craters filled with dense, decaying muck and layers of wind-scattered beach sand. Cranberries grew wild in these bogs, the chill rains that filled the kettle holes in autumn insulating the fruit from deep-winter frosts. The Wampanoag who settled the area more than 10,000 years ago harvested the berries, drying them to mix with deer jerky and tallow into pemmican—essentially the planet’s first energy bar. Pemmican kept for months, which made it a vital commodity for fur traders, as National Geographic notes. Native American also ate them fresh and—presaging the cranberry health craze centuries later—as medicine. European colonists, however, mainly used cranberries the way they used the similarly sour berries back home: in a sauce to moisten up fowl. Then, in 1622, the honeybee arrived North America—and with it, a way to turn cranberry sauce from sour to merely tart. Until the 1800s, settlers plucked the wild cranberries that flourished in natural bogs—particularly in the peaty pits that flecked Cape Cod’s marshlands. Then, in 1816, a former Revolutionary War veteran named Henry Hall noticed that wild cranberries thrived when sand blew over them. Hall transplanted the berry’s vines into what he called “cranberry yards,” and dusted them with sand—and within a few years was shipping his product from Cape Cod to New York City. Hall’s impressive harvests paved the way for commercial cultivation. The cranberry’s popularity surged, as trade—and the fact that sailors ate the Vitamin C-packed berries to prevent scurvy—spread its popularity. Throughout the next century, growers fanned out from Massachusetts to New Jersey, Wisconsin, and, eventually, the Pacific northwest. In 1864, Civil War general Grant permanently associated the sauce with Thanksgiving when he ordered that the side dish be included in the holiday feast for the troops at the Siege of Petersburg. To this day, around 20% of all cranberries are bought in the week before Thanksgiving. By 1900, “Cranberry Fever” swept the nation, and the industry took off, with production buoyed by technological advances that sped up harvesting and preserved the berries for shipment. In 1930, growers formed a marketing cooperative, which eventually became known as Ocean Spray. Its first product was jellied cranberry sauce. Then calamity hit. In 1959, just two weeks before Thanksgiving, the US government announced that an herbicide suspected of causing cancer had tainted cranberries (though in truth, it only affected a tiny share of acreage). The great Cranberry Scare of 1959, as it was known, drove the industry toward ruin, as crops were destroyed and prices tanked. US consumers turned on cranberries; in 1959, fresh cranberry sales totaled exactly zero, according to the USDA (pdf, p.180). To revive the cranberry, Ocean Spray only had one choice: innovate. Up until this point, cranberries had been marketed primarily in sauce form, selling mainly before Thanksgiving and Christmas. In 1963, Ocean Spray recruited Edward Gelsthorpe, the marketing genius behind roll-on deodorant. Soon thereafter, the company unveiled Cran-Apple, the first mass-market blended juice. Cran-Apple was an instant hit—and it transformed cranberries from a generally seasonal item to a product that was in demand year-round. Its popularity pushed supermarkets to create entire aisles dedicated to fruit juice. Soon thereafter, Ocean Spray revolutionized those shelves with the first-ever juice boxes. Having won kids over, Ocean Spray turned its attention to converting their parents into cranberry-juice fans, too. In the 1960s, the company began adorning its juice labels with a recipe for a “Harpoon,” made of cranberry juice and either vodka and rum, a spritz of lime, and served “over the rocks or tall with soda,” according to Difford’s Guide. The cocktail is thought to be the evolutionary forbearer of the Cosmopolitan, the iconic pink drink made famous by the HBO series Sex and the City. (Ocean Spray’s other cocktail invention attempts—e.g. the Pink Lagoon, the Firecracker, and the Boston Mist—failed to take hold.) Between 1970 and 1980, the average American’s fruit juice consumption leapt 45%, according to a 2006 case study on the cranberry industry (pdf, p.5). The Cranberry Scare of 1959 wasn’t the only thing driving Ocean Spray innovation. Because the company is a cooperative, it must buy all of the crops its growers produce—about two-thirds of total cranberry output—at a high set price (plus a cut of profits). “Imagine if Pepsi had to maximize the aluminum it used, and at the highest price it could afford!” Randy Papadellis, Ocean Spray’s CEO, told Businessweek in 2006. In other words, Ocean Spray faces constant pressure to nurture new sources of demand. It can’t rest on buying power to preserve margins. And that led it straight to dried cranberries. The sudden ubiquity of cranberry-orange muffins in the 1990s coincided with the company’s move to start shelving dried cranberries, which it dubbed Craisins, in grocery-store baking aisles. Then, in the early 2000s, Papadellis noticed his colleagues compulsively popping Craisins into their mouths as they sat in a meeting. The idea struck him: What about marketing dried cranberries not just as baking items, but as snacks? “We knew that roughly 38% of American consumers ate cranberries or drank cranberries in some fashion. We also knew that about 60% of American consumers liked dried fruit,” Papadellis told Forbes in 2010. “So when you did the Venn diagram intersecting those who liked dried fruit with those who loved cranberries, it was a huge population.” In no time, Craisins could be found scattered amidst trail mixes, breakfast bars, and snack shelves. It was a crucial breakthrough for Ocean Spray. Another came in 1994, when research by Harvard Medical School that it had sponsored revealed cranberry juice helped prevent urinary tract infections. That cemented the berry’s reputation as a health food, which would later be reinforced by the discovery that cranberries are high in antioxidants. The dried-cranberry craze couldn’t have come at a better time. While Ocean Spray has been focusing heavily on low-calorie cranberry juices, it’s faced headwinds in recent years from health advocates who blame sugary fruit drinks, including cranberry juice cocktails, for soaring childhood obesity rates. Thanks to growing concerns about the dangers of sugar, US demand for fruit juice began slumping in the late 2000s. On top of that, thanks to the planting cycle and the higher efficiency of new cranberry cultivars, in the last few years, the industry has been growing far more cranberries than it can sell. In 2017, growers asked the US government to allow the disposal of a large share of inventories, mostly by composting, reports Bloomberg. The dried-cranberry craze has been vital in sopping up that oversupply—in particular, in new markets overseas. That’s in no small part thanks to booming demand from China (paywall), particularly from young urban residents in search of healthy snacks. In 2017, China became American cranberry growers’ second-biggest export market. Demand from Europe has also proved essential to the cranberry industry, particularly since the European Union suspended the 17.6% import duty on dried cranberries in 2011. This brings us to the cranberry’s current predicament. In March, the Trump administration announced a series of protectionist measures, prompting backlash from big US trading partners. In retaliation against steel and aluminum tariffs, the EU announced that it is considering raising duties on cranberries, among other things. The EU imported nearly half of US cranberry exports in 2017. The simmering trade war with China is even more ominous. ”The cranberry industry strongly supports free trade and we are disappointed that cranberries are caught in the middle of an impending trade dispute,” says the Cranberry Institute’s Humfeld, adding that “tariffs could certainly be detrimental to US cranberry growers.” In Wisconsin—which in 1995 surpassed Massachusetts to become the biggest cranberry-producing state, with production nearing $1 billion—the head of the industry group voiced similar fears. “We hope that the parties involved can reach an agreement that will allow us to continue our important role in providing cranberry products to consumers in China,” says Tom Lochner, executive director of the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association. The Chinese government hasn’t yet implemented tariffs on dried cranberries. Even if it does, the snack already enjoys something of a luxury status, which may help it weather the 40% higher costs. However, the US industry also faces a threat from cranberry growers in other countries that are eager to fill the gap. For instance, Canada is also a big exporter of fresh cranberries. Although it currently doesn’t sell much to China, the leap to processing for the Chinese market wouldn’t be huge. It’s also worth noting that Ocean Spray has relationships with both Canadian and Chilean growers. For instance, the company just closed on a purchase of a Quebec processing facility in February. The US cranberry advantage might have begun with Ice Age kettle-holes. But it has endured thanks to a century of relentless reinvention that’s taught first the American public, and then the world, of the many different ways to savor a bitter berry. And so it’s paradoxical that even if Trump’s tariffs succeed in reviving some US industries, he risks costing his country one of its unsung innovators—a business whose improbable rise from the cranberry yards to the juice aisle and on to the snacking section of Chinese e-commerce sites is exactly, you might say, what makes America great. Correction (Jun. 18, 2018, 12pm ET): This article has been corrected to reflect that Chile exports blueberries to China—and not, as an earlier version of this story asserted, cranberries.']",0.0,57.0,5.181818181818182,0.0,1017650.0,1

Sara,Burns,['https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/17/augusta-conference-mixes-business-with-drones/'],b'1003',"['Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The daylong seminar, which drew about 75 people, spotlighted the application of commercial drones. AUGUSTA — One brief statement in David Price’s presentation Saturday morning sums up the state of commercial drones today. “I fly drones most every day. I don’t go more than 10 days without thinking up a new business application,” Price said. The possibilities are vast and expanding. During his presentation, which kicked off a daylong conference at the University of Maine at Augusta on the use of commercial drones for business, Price rattled off some of the possibilities for using drones to gather information easily and quickly through remote sensing that otherwise might be too dangerous or time-consuming for anyone to do. Price’s assessment is backed up by industry research. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International projected in 2013 that as many as 100,000 new jobs would be created in the industry nationwide between 2015 and 2025. In Maine, that number was projected to be 810, with an economic impact during that same period of $641 million. Only recently have the remotely-piloted small aircrafts – sometimes referred to as unmanned aerial vehicles – become legal for commercial use. Daniel Leclair, director for education and research for unmanned aircraft systems at UMA, said the Federal Aviation Administration released its rules on the commercial operation of drones on Aug. 29, 2016. UMA launched its first class less than two months later. That’s a fast turnaround for an academic organization, he said. The college has trained 125 pilots in a year. The rules spell out who can operate commercial drones and how they ought to be operated. They are restricted to flying during daylight hours only, and they must be operated within the line of sight of the operator. They are not allowed to operate over people not involved in the operation they are being flown for, and they can’t travel faster than 100 mph or higher than 400 feet above ground level. However, Price pointed out, pilots may seek waivers from the FAA in some circumstances. Even with the restrictions, the applications for drone use by public and private organizations are broad. In the wake of the storm in late October that triggered a massive power outage across Maine, Sara Burns, then-president and chief executive officer of Central Maine Power Co., said her company was using drones as part of its assessment of power lines. Price’s presentation included a short video, captured by a drone, of a fire crew fighting a large building fire. The video showed in real time that the high water pressure of the hoses deployed on the building’s front was knocking bricks onto the people who were fighting the fire from behind the building. In Maine, the state police have used drones to capture images and aerial views of crashes, including at the 2017 double-fatal motorcycle crash during the Toy Run on Interstate 95, said Steve McCausland, spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety. The Augusta Police Department does not use drones currently. “We are still waiting for rules and polices to come out so we can utilize them,” Deputy Chief Jared Mills said Saturday. Price, who is a former professor and dean of aviation sciences at Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, said drones can carry different kinds of cameras for different applications. A ski resort in western Massachusetts uses a drone with heat-sensing technology to guide its snow-making operation. “We’re using drones for 3-D jobs,” he said. “They’re either dull, dangerous or dirty.” Using drones for tasks such as inspecting bridges or wind turbines makes those jobs far less risky. The conference, Drone Applications for Business: Navigating Your Airspace, debuted Saturday, drawing about 75 people from across New England and Washington, D.C. to hear about the regulatory landscape, insurance and liability considerations; and to take part in a range of workshops on using drones in agriculture, emergency situations, surveying, and as a method of helping those with disabilities explore the world. Leclair said this business sector is in its infancy and the drone program at UMA is its fastest-growing program. “It’s like the wild, wild West,” he said.

Joe,Boulos,['https://bangordailynews.com/2018/04/20/education/colby-alum-donates-2-5m-to-college-that-gave-him-financial-aid/'],b'1002',"['Gardiner native Steve Ford dipped into Colby College’s financial aid pool 50 years ago so he could graduate with a bachelor’s degree in government. This week, he donated $2.5 million to his alma mater so other Maine students could also get a financial leg up at the Waterville college. The gift, announced April 19, adds to the $1 million he’s already donated to the college. Ford earmarked the new money he donated to the general financial aid pool for students from Maine. They can apply for financial aid any year of college. “Colby helped me financially so I was able to attend,” Ford, who graduated in 1968, said in a statement. “It was important to me that the college invested in me, so I want to give back.” When Ford entered Colby, his tuition of $1,200, a princely sum in the 1960s, was paid by a foundation. Nowadays, tuition is $53,000. Ford also worked at Colby to help pay his way. He recalled his time at Colby as one when the Vietnam War and protests were in full swing, and the men’s and women’s side of the campus were just starting to come together. His first year working in the cafeteria was the first year some women used the men’s cafeteria. “I worked in the food serving line, made and served coffee and cleaned up the dining hall,” Ford told the Bangor Daily News. During his last two years at Colby he made some money on the side officiating at football, soccer and lacrosse games at high schools and colleges in central Maine. The gift is from Ford and his wife Mary Ford, who have contributed to the college for the past 37 consecutive years. Their son, Bill, graduated from Colby in 2005, and Steve’s father, William, graduated in 1926. “We are especially grateful that this gift supports Colby’s commitment to the students from our home state of Maine,” Colby President David A. Greene said in a statement. The Fords have been seasonal residents of Maine for nearly 40 years, and also have a home in Pennsylvania. Steve Ford had a lifelong career as a corporate attorney, including 20-plus years with Scott Paper and S.D. Warren, working with their Maine operations and timberlands. Colby offers about $6 million per year in financial aid to students from Maine, who make up about 10 percent of the student population. There are currently 211 Maine students at Colby, with 53 Mainers scheduled to graduate in May. Colby spokesperson Kate Carlisle could not say how many of those received financial aid specified for Maine students. In December 2017, Colby expanded its financial aid program so that parents or guardians of students entering the college this fall and earning $60,000 or less would not be required to contribute anything to their educational expenses. The median income in Maine is about $58,000. “Mainers may dismiss Bowdoin, Bates and Colby as too expensive, but they can go to those schools and come out without a tremendous amount of debt,” Ford said. The class of 1968, celebrating its 50th Reunion in June, is currently breaking gift records with a total of nearly $16 million. Steve Ford is a member of the class along with Portland real estate developer Joe Boulos, who with his wife Sheri Boulos also have focused on financial aid donations. They created the Boulos Family Scholarship program that has funded at least 310 Maine veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 with scholarships of $10,000 each.

Steve,Cummings,"['https://www.americanbanker.com/news/mufgs-big-us-expansion-is-just-getting-started', 'http://clicklancashire.com/2018/03/27/uk-anti-doping-confirms-cyber-attack-but-says-no-athlete.html']",b'989',"['Among the chief executives of major banking companies in this country, Steve Cummings is a curious example. He is in charge of MUFG’s operations across the Americas, but also not especially high in the global bureaucracy of the Japanese megabank. He runs a U.S. holding company with just over $150 billion in assets, but his name is not as familiar across the industry as CEOs overseeing similarly sized operations (like Bruce Van Saun at Citizens Financial Group or Beth Mooney at KeyCorp). Instead, as CEO of a foreign subsidiary, Cummings is shielded from the public scrutiny that comes with quarterly analyst calls and investor presentations. “You are not the heart, you’re an appendage,” Cummings, the chief executive of MUFG Americas, said in an interview at his office, which has a view overlooking midtown Manhattan and memorabilia from the X-League, the American football league in Japan, on the walls. “But I’ve gotten over that.” What the industry misses in not watching Cummings closely is how he is laying the groundwork for what is expected to be a major U.S. expansion of MUFG, the biggest bank in Japan and the fifth largest in the world. His parent company has been clear about its ambitions, stating publicly that it wants to be a top 10 bank in the United States. With Japan’s economy battling negative interest rates and a declining population, it needs new markets to grow. It’s hard to see how MUFG will get there without a splashy acquisition, even if it increases lending and deposit-gathering at a steady pace. Its best-known business, its U.S. regional bank, which operates under the Union Bank brand on the West Coast, has just under $125 billion in assets, making it the 24th largest, according to the Federal Reserve. To jump into the top 10 would mean nearly doubling in size, to over $200 billion in assets — a goal Cummings seems to take in stride. “It would be natural to get to that scale,” he said. ’Thinking as if we’re a stand-alone company’ MUFG has a complicated structure, of which its regional bank is only part. There is an additional $35 billion in securities and leasing assets under the U.S. holding company. Cummings also is in charge of his parent company’s U.S. branches, which offer corporate and investment banking in a handful of major cities, such as New York and Los Angeles. In total, Cummings oversees about $350 billion in U.S. assets. So he has a lot of moving parts to work with, which ultimately could be an advantage or a disadvantage for him as he tries to execute on his goal. But growth ambitions aside, Cummings has a more immediate challenge: improving performance. On that front, he has a ways to go. Profitability has been a drag. The efficiency ratio for the U.S. holding company has hovered in the mid-70% range over the past year, much higher than U.S. peers. Its margin also has lagged — staying around 2.30% last year — though a strategy of pushing into higher-yielding businesses, such as leveraged lending, is intended to help. Since coming on board three years ago, Cummings has been focused on improving these metrics, even if his efforts have yet to materialize in the numbers in a big way. He has reorganized the commercial banking division and trimmed staff. He also has encouraged cross-selling with commercial clients, and pushed the company into new areas of middle-market lending. In April the company plans to unveil a three-year plan to boost returns and increase revenue. One of his biggest challenges, he said, has been changing the company’s mindset — getting its U.S. employees to feel less complacent operating in the shadow of their foreign parent, and without the scrutiny placed on publicly traded competitors. “We need to be thinking as if we’re a stand-alone company and taking ownership of what we do,” Cummings said. MUFG broke from its longstanding practice in appointing Cummings to his role. Its parent company had previously relied on Japanese leadership for the U.S. division, rotating in senior executives from Tokyo for short stints in New York. It changed course in 2015, hiring Cummings, a UBS executive at the time, as its first American CEO. In announcing his successor, the outgoing CEO, Masashi Oka, said at the time that having someone who is a native of this country would be key to deepening customer relationships, navigating U.S. regulations and guiding the transformation ahead. Rita Sahu, an analyst at Moody’s, said the appointment of Cummings is telling. “To me, it just reinforced the importance of this as a market, in that they really wanted someone on the ground and entrenched.” Cummings, 62, has a background that suits a company like MUFG well. He is a product of the golden age in U.S. banking — and its reverse during the financial crisis. He started in the industry in the late 1970s, working in investment banking and M&A advisory. In the early 2000s, during the rise of the financial conglomerate, he advanced to the top ranks of a regional bank that would later become Wachovia, a retail banking powerhouse. When the mortgage meltdown happened, he served as global head of corporate and investment banking during the Charlotte, N.C., company’s breathtaking collapse. Cummings said he’s not undertaking a massive overhaul at MUFG, just looking for ways to improve efficiency. His goal is to create something sustainable — a locally managed U.S. company that is more profitable, and potentially much larger, than it was when he arrived. He would like to demonstrate to the Japanese parent company that this business strategy is workable over the long term even after he retires. “What I want as part of my legacy is for them to be in a position where that is a permanent view of how this business can be run,” Cummings said. Why the U.S. matters so much If you want to understand the business that Cummings runs, the first thing to know is that it’s a small — but increasingly important — piece of a much larger global enterprise. MUFG Americas is part of the thicket of companies that operates under the umbrella of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, a $2.6 trillion-asset global company. The Americas division is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, the global parent’s best-known brand that also makes up the bulk of its net income. MUFG Americas accounts for about 10% of the global parent’s annual profits. It is based in New York, but serves clients from Canada to Latin America. When factoring in the Bank of Tokyo operations in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, U.S.-based businesses account for roughly 16% of the global parent\'s annual net income. But with Japan facing an economic crisis, the Tokyo bank is turning to foreign markets, including the United States, as it looks for ways to grow. After more than a decade of deflation, The Bank of Japan, the country’s central bank, in 2016 took the unusual step of adopting negative interest rates. The move charges banks a fee for storing their excess deposits, with the goal of encouraging lending and stimulating economic activity. Japanese banks are “absurdly overdeposited,” said Alicia Ogawa, a director at the Center on Japanese Economy and Business at Columbia Business School. Ultralow rates, in Japan and across the globe, have weighed on results. The return on equity at the global parent slumped to 7.25% in 2016, from nearly 9% five years earlier, according to its most recent annual report. There are longer-term problems facing the Japanese economy as well. The country’s population is shrinking, having declined by about 1% as of the 2015 census, compared with five years earlier. Companies, in turn, are facing the prospect of declining demand. “This is a crisis,” Cummings said, discussing the economic pressures. “It’s not a heart attack, but it’s a ‘you’re really sick and there’s no relief in sight.’ ” One of the markets the Tokyo bank has targeted for growth is Southeast Asia. It announced in December that it planned to buy a majority stake in the Bank Danamon in Indonesia. Three years earlier, it bought Bank of Ayudhya in Thailand. The United States is another promising target. The Tokyo bank gained a foothold in the U.S. banking industry during the 2008 financial crisis, when it acquired a 20% stake in Morgan Stanley. It also acquired UnionBanCal, now known as MUFG Union Bank, which has just over 350 West Coast branches. Following the crisis, the U.S. division consolidated its operations — including its regional bank in California and securities division in New York — under a single holding company, MUFG Americas, to comply with a Federal Reserve requirement for foreign-owned banks. The requirement has helped to streamline the company’s U.S. operations, according to Cummings. “I think it catches us up to more of a model that we are all accustomed to here in the U.S.,” he said of the holding company structure. “That’s how the other big guys do it.” A plan to become more profitable Asked about the Tokyo bank’s growth ambitions, Cummings said that U.S. acquisitions are a possibility. “This is not a kind of wishful thinking,” he said. “We’ve got somebody who strategically needs to and wants to change the look of their business mix to a more global, more balanced model.” In the meantime, though, Cummings is under pressure to boost returns and create a more solid foundation for that future growth. While it can take years to improve a big company’s financial health, meager results have nonetheless been a defining aspect of his tenure. “What’s been the challenge is profitability,” said Sahu, the Moody’s analyst. “There are a lot of moving parts there.” Revenue at MUFG Americas has slid over the past year, falling by 1% during 2017 compared with the prior year. Profits, however, rose 8%, on lower tax expenses and credit costs. Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the company, though, is its escalating expense base, which rose 5% last year from a year earlier. A big part of that uptick came from technology, as MUFG upgrades its core system and looks for new ways to automate manual tasks. “We’re on a financial path where we’re still not satisfied with where we’re at today,” said Johannes Worsoe, chief financial officer at MUFG Americas. The company in April intends to announce a three-year plan to “balance growth and returns,” he said. Part of the plan involves boosting fee-based income, as MUFG makes a bigger push into the debt capital markets and looks to expand its portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. Another part of the plan involves taking on additional credit risk. MUFG’s commercial banking business primarily serves high-end, investment-grade companies. But the U.S. division is starting to move into the somewhat riskier end of the middle market, with a bigger focus on asset-based finance and leveraged lending. Offering unsecured consumer loans is also under consideration. MUFG currently purchases personal loans from fintech lenders like LendingClub, but it is developing its own product, according to Cummings. The product, which is “in deep planning stages,” could launch later this year. “There’s so much left to do to better serve customers, and to monetize those relationships,” Cummings said. Over the long term, MUFG also will need to lower its funding costs, according to Cummings. About two-thirds of the U.S. operations are funded with consumer and commercial deposits, but the remaining portion of the business is funded with swapping yen for dollars — a process that can get expensive, he said. To that end, MUFG launched a direct consumer bank under the brand PurePoint last year. The division competes for online consumer deposits, offering high-yielding savings accounts similar to Ally Financial, Goldman Sachs’ Marcus and Synchrony Bank. PurePoint, which also has storefronts in New York and a handful of other major markets, has about $3 billion in deposits so far. Cummings declined to specify if the personal loan product that is in the works is for PurePoint. Cultural differences As he reflects on his three years at MUFG, Cummings, who spent the bulk of his career in North Carolina, projects an air of Southern gentility. He talks openly about MUFG’s financial challenges, while remaining deferential to his foreign parent. “I’ve felt nothing but complete support here,” he said. Still, it’s clear that navigating two very different corporate cultures is a big aspect of Cummings’ role as MUFG’s first American CEO. In advocating for his part of the global company, he said he makes sure that executives in Japan feel comfortable with the changes he wants to make — and the fast pace at which he wants to move. “We’re pressuring them to move more quickly, which I would say they would agree is a good thing, and they’re pressuring us to give them more details,” Cummings said. “I actually think that ends up at a pretty nice middle ground.” The two countries simply have different ways of doing business. Many Japanese companies, for instance, still operate under a system of lifetime employment, guaranteeing workers a job until they are old enough to retire. American companies, by contrast, have no qualms about laying off employees when needed. Additionally, while Japanese companies pride themselves on perfection and meticulous planning, American companies prefer to move fast and have more tolerance for fixing mistakes later. So it’s not surprising that, after just a few months on the job, Cummings raised eyebrows when he said he planned to reorganize MUFG’s U.S. commercial banking division. The reorganization, dubbed the “Trailblazer” project, consolidated a stand-alone middle-market division into MUFG Union Bank, with some positions getting eliminated. The idea was to foster a more collaborative approach — for instance, getting commercial bankers to refer the C-suite executives who are their clients to the bank’s wealth management team. “When we go in and say, ‘We’re going to do the Trailblazer, and we’re going to lay off 100 fairly senior people as part of this,’ it’s, ‘Wow, are you sure you can do this? Isn’t it going to disrupt the entire business?’ ” Cummings said. Asked whether he speaks Japanese, Cummings was blunt: “It would be nice if I did,” he said. Still, he said the language barrier hasn’t been a big issue. Many of the Tokyo executives he works with speak English. Also, when he travels to Japan, he has a translator by his side. “There is an element at the margin that doesn’t come out right, going both ways,” Cummings said, noting how some phrases get lost in translation. “So we have very experienced Japanese partners who are embedded with our team that make sure those communications are clear.” The rebound after the crash Unlike high-powered executives who claim they accidentally stumbled into success, Cummings has the resume of someone who seemed destined to become a bank CEO. He ran a boutique advisory firm at an early age, and quickly worked his way up the big-bank corporate ladder. Still, the mortgage meltdown had Cummings questioning whether he was on the right career path at all. Cummings got his start in the industry nearly four decades ago, accepting a job after business school at Kidder Peabody, the investment banking firm based in New York that, through a series of acquisitions, is now part of UBS. He worked in the corporate finance division in New York. After his wife’s father passed away, however, she persuaded him to move to North Carolina. “She really wanted to go home, and I wanted to stay married,” Cummings said, with a laugh. In 1984 Cummings joined Bowles Hollowell Conner, a boutique M&A advisory firm in Charlotte. The firm was founded by Erskine Bowles, a well-known figure in the Democratic Party. When Bowles was tapped by the Clinton administration in 1993 to serve as head of the Small Business Administration, he named Cummings — who was only 37 at the time — as CEO. “He had a certain confidence about himself,” said Bowles, who later served as President Clinton’s chief of staff and, more recently, as lead director on Morgan Stanley’s board. “He had that judgment — you could see it from day one.” It was a big test for Cummings. The economy was in a slump, recovering from the early 1990s recession. After relying for years on Bowles to generate a pipeline of business, the firm had to forge a path forward without him. “I had this moment of truth, of ‘holy smokes,’ ” Cummings said. “I knew I was young, and the firm was only 35 people. But will they follow me?” Cummings said he made it clear to everyone that, in order to make the firm successful, they had to “grab a shovel.” Everyone had to know their role, had to be disciplined about their assignments and had to be held accountable. Eventually the firm found its footing. “That was a real learning moment for me,” he said. By the late 1990s, when financial conglomerates came on the scene, big banks began scooping up small brokerage and advisory firms. Seeing an opportunity in the market — and recognizing that Bowles Hollowell had had a good run — he oversaw a sale in 1998 to First Union, a fast-growing regional bank. As part of the deal, he agreed to stay on for a few years. “I thought I would do my time and then go,” Cummings said. “But they just started asking me to do more things.” Cummings thrived in the world of megabanking. First Union acquired Wachovia several years later and adopted its name. The company began to grow ambitiously, in part by building out its investment bank and advisory division, a business that Cummings was tapped to lead. Wachovia’s success took a turn several years later when the subprime mortgage crisis began to ripple through the economy. Cummings’ memories from the time are still raw. He recalled the exact moment, in early 2007, when he and his colleagues spotted cracks in the commercial mortgage-backed securities business and began to pull back. Soon after that, his division began taking heat for losses that had surfaced in Wachovia’s investment bank. But “the anchor that could not be dealt with,” Cummings said, was the company’s ill-fated acquisition, in 2006, of Golden West Financial in California, a provider of pick-a-pay mortgages, which allowed borrowers to pay less interest than what was due. By the fall of 2008, Wachovia, which had more than $800 billion in assets, was on the brink of collapsing. Wells Fargo hustled through an emergency deal to buy the company, with the closing just over a year later. Cummings was one of several senior executives who were not asked to join the San Francisco megabank. “The original dream for Wachovia was to move to California and somehow do a deal with Wells,” Cummings said. “So we did that in a backwards way.” After the sale, Cummings, who was 53 at the time, stepped away from the industry. He took time to think about the possibility of a radically different career path. He described the first months after the crash as a period of recovery. “It really was devastating for me,” Cummings said. “I had to think through where I was.” He considered doing some investing and joining a board. But it didn’t take long for him to recognize that, as he said, his “engine was still running,” and that banking was where he belonged. About 18 months after he left Wachovia, Cummings began looking for his next opportunity in investment banking, recognizing that he would have to leave Charlotte for New York to find it. Cummings was hired by UBS in 2011. As chairman of the U.S. investment bank in New York, he was put in charge of restructuring the division, which was struggling after the crisis. Doing so involved slashing the loan book and moving to a “capital-light structure,” he said. The experience taught him how to oversee a corporate turnaround. Four years later, when he was offered his current role at MUFG, he knew that he was up for the challenge. “What an opportunity to have another chapter,” Cummings said. “This was not, ‘Fix something that’s broke.’ It’s, ‘Tune it, make it better, and help take it to the next level.’ ” Looking ahead While Cummings may be close to the end of his career, he insists that he has no plans to retire anytime soon. His six children are fully grown, with the youngest having just graduated from college. (None of them have followed him into banking, though one of his sons works in a boutique advisory firm on the West Coast.) His wife and dogs still live in Charlotte and, though he travels frequently for work, he visits them as often as possible. It remains to be seen what kind of legacy Cummings will ultimately leave behind at MUFG. Beyond MUFG’s disappointing financial performance, brand recognition may be its biggest challenge. Executives are quick to note that MUFG is not well-known in the United States, despite its large size and high-profile commercial clientele. Its complicated structure and multiple retail brands make it somewhat inscrutable to consumers. MUFG also has attracted some controversy over the past year, amid a legal battle between the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ and the New York State Department of Financial Services. The Tokyo bank last year won approval to flip its state-regulated U.S. branches to a national charter. Its primary New York branch, however, had been fined by the state regulator in 2013 and 2014 for improperly handling transactions to sanctioned countries. After receiving approval for federal oversight, the bank sued the New York financial regulator to halt state oversight of the branch. The DFS, which is run by Superintendent Maria Vullo, is challenging the suit. MUFG, meanwhile, has said it makes financial sense to consolidate its subsidiaries under a single regulator. Whether Cummings will succeed in getting MUFG into better financial shape overall — bank acquisition or not — is an open question. But MUFG is busy making moves on multiple fronts, and Cummings is orchestrating them all with quiet confidence. “He is the CEO of the Americas operations of one of the biggest and oldest banks in the world, which wants to make investments in businesses, clients and acquisitions,” said Ogawa, the Columbia professor. “He’s a very powerful guy in that respect.""', 'How to Prepare Your Dog for Competitions Runners May Live Longer Was 2018 Grand National The Best Ever?

Bob,Diamond,['https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/gender-pay-gap-masking-problem/women-in-business/article/1461893'],b'988',"[""For a long time now, we have suspected that there has been more ‘noise’ around gender equality than actual action. Not only is this unhelpful, it may be lulling us into a false sense of security that we are actually doing something, when we are simply masking the problem. So now gender pay gaps (GPG) are public knowledge, we did some research to test our hypothesis: We correlated the Times Top 50 Employers for Women 2017, Catalyst Group Award Winners for the past 10 years, and the Glassdoor Top 50 in the UK (the PR) against the same companies' actual gender pay gaps (the reality). Here’s what we found. Our hypothesis was correct. Take a look at the next two graphs and you'll see that many of the companies have huge GPGs despite being highly regarded/awarded. Across all three award-winning categories, most of these celebrated companies were actually worse than the UK average. Of Catalyst awardees in the last ten years, only four of the 22 UK companies that have won (18%) had a GPG that was better than the national average. Of the Times Top 50, only three (6%) had a GPG better than the national average. Of the Glassdoor Top 50, only 13 (26%) had a GPG better than the national average. Undoubtedly, many of these award winners are doing great work. But it is not resulting in smaller gender pay gaps. As we found, a majority of these award winners were actually worse than the average. It’s highly likely that these organisations are focussing time and effort on Diversity 101 compliance activities such as training, Diversity 2.0 activities such as events and awards, but insufficient time and effort on Inclusion 3.0 work such as leadership programmes and reducing the effects of unconscious bias. 1. Make unconscious behaviour more conscious At some of the organisations with the smallest gender pay gaps, we have recently conducted inclusive leadership programmes with largely male teams. The purpose of this is to hold up the mirror (to the men in particular) and re-frame diversity as a leadership issue (for them personally). By taking them on a journey over a period of weeks we can avoid the usual failing of ‘diversity training’ and instead focus on repeated behaviours that sink in over the course of the programme. People internalise diversity as a good thing in their own self-interest and are far more receptive to seeking it out as a result. This has resulted in more men stepping up and calling out behaviours and practices that would disadvantage women. 2. Nudge the remaining unconscious behaviour But training alone doesn’t work. Up to 97% of our behaviour is unconscious - to tackle the majority of our actual behaviour, we need nudges. We deploy nudges throughout HR processes and systems. We analyse a system (let’s say promotions) and we identify the gaps and biases in it. Then we prioritise which ones to intervene in, and de-bias them by implementing process changes (nudges). Recent examples include presenting anonymised CVs side by side, implementing mixed panels, and recruiting and assessing groups of individuals at the same time, not individuals one by one. At one client, we led a series of sessions involving all regional chairmen to map the three-year talent pipeline for the business. They placed their initial candidates names on a large whiteboard in red ink by groups of one, two and three years away from promotion. Then they re-wrote female names in green. This showed that women had been de-prioritised in the process to date. Candidate-by-candidate, they discussed the business case and the reasons for each candidate’s position and slowly and surely many women started to advance from three years out to two years out to ‘promotion ready’. We were leading a process to point out the group’s collective blind spots. None of them were maliciously sexist or consciously discriminatory. But all of them had been susceptible to the blind spots of 1-1 promotions, without the big picture view of group aggregation. They simply didn’t know the women as well as the men and the women hadn’t put themselves forward as obviously as the men. This process resulted in more competition, more rigour in decision-making, and more diversity in promotions As Bob Diamond said: 'Culture is what happens when no-one thinks they are being watched.' Now they are. You can’t apply a technical fix to a cultural problem and expect to solve the problem. If you really want to tackle the gender pay gap, focus more on the men and less on chasing awards that are masking the real problem. Stephen Frost is the founder of inclusion consultancy f(i).

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) began their probe into Mr Staley\'s conduct a year ago. Mr Staley, who has apologised for his conduct, has been given time to appeal. Barclays said there was no suggestion Mr Staley acted with ""a lack of integrity"". A statement from Barclays said the FCA and PRA ""are not alleging he acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as group chief executive officer"". It also said the two bodies would not take enforcement action against Barclays. Barclays said that its ""management continues to have unanimous confidence in Staley and continues to recommend his re-election as a director at the Barclays annual general meeting on May 1"". But Mr Staley does face a financial penalty from within the bank itself, although that will be decided once the FRA and PRA processes are complete. Barclays shares were up 1% in early trading. Jes Staley is found to have been driving Barclays without due care and attention but won\'t lose his licence. He will face a fine from regulators and a cut to his pay from the board but crucially he\'s been deemed fit and proper to run a bank. Investors will be relieved - they didn\'t want to be looking for a fourth chief executive since Bob Diamond was sent packing by the Bank of England in 2012. Staley has accepted the criticism and wants to get on with the job of returning Barclays to the role of last serious European investment bank. The City watchdog may feel some heat. Many will say that sparing a boss who tried to track down a whistleblower will discourage those whistleblowers, who can be such an important tool in policing bad financial behaviour. The board of Barclays supports Staley - we\'ll find out what the shareholders think at Barclays\' AGM in two weeks. The issue dates back to June 2016, when members of the Barclays board received an anonymous letter raising concerns about a senior employee who had been recruited by Barclays earlier that year. The letters, which were being treated as whistleblows, raised concerns of a personal nature about the senior employee, and Mr Staley\'s knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer. They also raised questions over the appropriateness of the recruitment process followed on this occasion by Barclays. Mr Staley asked Barclays\' internal investigation team to attempt to identify the authors of the letters, which the chief executive thought were an unfair personal attack on the senior employee. We know Jes Staley will be fined for trying to unmask an anonymous whistle blower - but how much? Mr Staley will in fact face three financial penalties: one from the Financial Conduct Authority, one from the Prudential Regulation Authority and one from his own board. The FCA and PRA will use a five step formula. 1. Did he derive personal financial gain from the conduct - in this case that\'s a no. 2. The percentage of annual income a person is fined depends on how deliberate or reckless the conduct is judged to be. Given he has been censured for lack of care and skill, he could well have been deemed to have behaved recklessly. 3. The penalty can be aggravated or mitigated by the level of co-operation the authorities received from the bank. In this case Barclays say they co-operated fully and shared the result of their own internal inquiry - a potential mitigation discount. 4. Is there a case for increasing the fine to act as a deterrent - you bet there is! The FCA/PRA may try to deflect criticism of dealing leniently with him by applying a steep deterrent premium to the fine. 5. If you pay within 28 days - you get a 30% discount. So that\'s how the PRA and the FCA crunch the numbers. The board of Barclays has already said he may lose a significant chunk of his £1.3 million pound bonus for 2016 which is the year in question. Directors decided to defer the decision on how much until the investigation was complete and they knew the outcome and the regulatory penalty imposed. That will be known in the next couple of weeks as the regulators do their calculations and present their final findings to the company. Bottom line - the fine could easily run into seven figures. A hefty fine but certainly not ruinous for a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Zamira Hajiyeva, a 55-year-old from Azerbaijan, has been ordered to explain how she got all her money.

Bob,Diamond,['https://news.sky.com/story/relief-at-barclays-over-jes-staley-as-regulators-show-teeth-11338959'],b'985',"['Getting rid of Jes Staley would have caused immense disruption at a bank that has endured immense turmoil in the last decade. 14:26, UK, Friday 20 April 2018 There will be a profound sense of relief at Barclays that Jes Staley, its chief executive, has not lost his job as a result of his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. For under the so-called ""senior managers"" regime, introduced after the financial crisis to make those running banks more accountable for failings on their watch, a case for him to have been banned could have been constructed. Moreover, as this was the first major test of the regime, there was an immense amount of pressure on the two regulators involved here, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, to show the new setup has teeth. With no bankers having gone to prison following the financial crisis, the public perception is that the big bosses somehow get away with misdemeanours, while the little guys - as in the Libor-rigging cases - go down. The regulators also needed to prove that whistleblowers in financial services institutions will be protected - something that has not always been the case in the past. Confidence in the new post-crisis regulatory system needed to be maintained. Yet there cannot have been much appetite, either at the FCA\'s headquarters at Canary Wharf or the PRA\'s on Moorgate, to ban Mr Staley. Barclays, in the jargon, is a systemically-important financial institution - a financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. It is also an organisation that, while not requiring a taxpayer rescue during the crisis like Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, has endured an immense amount of turmoil during the last decade. Mr Staley\'s immediate predecessor, Antony Jenkins, was pushed overboard when the Barclays board decided he was not making sufficient progress. Mr Staley\'s predecessor-but-one, Bob Diamond, was forced to step down at the insistence of the former Bank of England Governor, Lord King, after Barclays admitted its role in Libor-rigging in 2012. Mr Diamond\'s immediate predecessor, John Varley, has been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and providing unlawful financial assistance in relation to the bank\'s emergency fund-raising in November 2008. He and three other former Barclays executives face prison if convicted. With Barclays having had three chief executives during the last six years, each of whose strategies have contradicted those of their predecessor, regulators will have been reluctant to insist on yet another change at the top. Getting rid of Mr Staley would have caused immense disruption in the bank and, in all probability, resulted in a lot of the senior staff recruited by him leaving as well. Added to this is the sense that Mr Staley is doing a good job and that it would have been very hard to find an adequate replacement for him. That is why it has taken more than a year for the investigation to take its course. The regulators were on the horns of a particularly nasty dilemma. The decision they have reached today is hugely pragmatic. The regulators will hope a heavy fine on Mr Staley, as yet to be determined, will demonstrate that the senior managers regime has real force. They can point out just how rare it is for a CEO to be fined and censured in this way. The Barclays board meanwhile, having already said it will cut the pay of its chief executive by a ""very significant"" amount, avoids the disruption and turmoil that would have come with replacing Mr Staley. Longer term, there may be a sense that the bank\'s luck has turned. Its latest results point to real progress being made. And, at the end of March, Barclays struck a deal with US regulators to pay a $2bn settlement for the mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities during the run-up to the financial crisis - substantially less than had been expected. Barclays is not out of the woods, as US regulators may yet punish Mr Staley over this incident, while further embarrassment and reputational hits may emerge in Mr Varley\'s trial. However, for the first time in a long while, it feels as though things may be going the bank\'s way. © 2018 Sky UK']",0.0,12.0,1.0,0.0,1015016.0,1

Wednesday, Oct 10th Pan-Africa focused banking group, Atlas Mara is to pursue a digital banking strategy to grow its footprint and consolidate its operations on the continent as regional banks rush to embrace mobile and other internet banking platforms. Bob Diamond on Tuesday announced the appointment of John Staley as CEO of Atlas Mara. The company has banking operations in Zimbabwe, Botswana as well as Zambia and elsewhere across Sub-Saharan Africa. ""His (Staley) appointment reflects the ambitions of the Company, including to build out a leading IT infrastructure, and to utilise digital products and channels to accelerate the pursuit of the Company\'s (growth) strategy,"" said Diamond. Staley worked at Equity Bank as chief of finance and innovation until the end of last year. Other banks that are pursuing digital banking switches across Africa include Barclays Africa, Ecobank and Standard Chartered. During the year to the end of December 2017, Atlas Mara ""enhanced electronic channels, including mobile and internet banking"" in Rwanda, a key market that has seen a massive rise in e-commerce and uptake of digital payment solutions. In Zimbabwe, Atlas Mara adds, the bank re-introduced internet banking to bring its BancABC unit up to speed with rival operators such as Barclays Zimbabwe. According to a study by McKinsey & Company, released in March this year, nearly 50% of African banking executives under its banking executive survey cited ""digital as their number one priority (while) an additional 40 percent cited it as very important\'\'. In line with this, banks in Africa are now expected to ""digitally transform their existing operations, to increase their share of digital sales and transactions to beyond 60 to 70 percent"". Moreover, models such as partnerships between banks and telecom companies as well as arrangements between banks and FinTech firms are expected to take root across Africa, tapping into experiences in South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe.

I have given some of them six months just to get on with it"". - Mthuli Ncube, Zimbabwe’s minister of Finance. NUMBER OF THE DAY US$7.5 billion - The amount Microsoft is seeking approval for, to purchase GitHub.', 'The Herald Business Reporter Atlas Mara Zimbabwean unit, BancABC, has reported more than $50 million in deposit capture in the southern African country for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the back of a strong agency banking programme. The group said the agency banking program continues to be a strong driver of customer growth and deposit capture. In line with the growth in use of plastic money in Zimbabwe due to cash shortages, BancABC also upgraded its digital platforms during the financial year. The programme included the reintroduction of mobile banking as well as adding instant interbank transfers. Additionally, the bank also rolled out over 1 000 point of sale (POS) terminals to enhance efficiency and ease of transacting. “Our agency banking programme continues to be a strong driver of customer growth and deposit capture and we expanded it in 2017 including in Tanzania and Mozambique, adding hundreds of new agents and thousands of new customers. We also achieved more than $50 million in deposit capture in Zimbabwe in the year,” said group chairman Bob Diamond. The group’s net income rose to $45, 4 million for the year to December 31, 2017 from prior year’s $8, 4 million on the back of strong performance and enhanced efficiencies across its various markets. Overall, the group’s revenue was 7 percent above prior year on continued focus on lower cost of funding, revenue growth, increased net interest margins, and the full year impact of the Zambia acquisition. In 2017, Atlas Mara’s focus was on managing down higher risk portfolios in certain countries where the group had a cautious credit risk appetite. This has resulted in muted loan book growth for the financial services group. Resultantly, the group narrowed its non-performing loans (NPL) ratio for the year to December 31, 2017 to 11,8 percent from 13,3 percent, thanks to robust recovery efforts in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique. “We achieved significant NPL recoveries in our legacy NPL portfolio, driving a substantial improvement in NPL ratio. Excluding certain accounts in Zambia and Zimbabwe, which are already in the legal process for recovering the collateral, the group’s NPL ratio reduces to 9,3 percent from the reported 11,8 percent,” said Mr Diamond. Atlas Mara’s total loan impairment charge by year end was 44, 8 percent above prior year to $22, 3 million from $15, 4 million on the back of additional impairments in Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zimbabwe adjustments. Despite increase in recoveries in Zimbabwe, there was also an increase in portfolio impairments resulting in an overall increase in the impairment charge for the year. Management said the group would continue to focus on restructuring and recovering further from the legacy NPL book. Receive news headlines directly to your inbox, daily!

WATERVILLE — Colby College this week celebrated its $750 million comprehensive campaign in New York City with a trustee making it possible for the Empire State Building to be lit in Colby blue. The Colby and Dare Northward campaign theme logos were projected on the Nasdaq sign in Times Square as part of the activities, which represent the first of many regional events planned around the country in the next couple of years, according to college officials. Dan Lugo, Colby’s vice president for college advancement, was interviewed about the campaign in a Facebook Live segment at Nasdaq. With support from trustees, the Empire State Building was lit Tuesday night in Colby blue; and on Wednesday night, alumni, parents and friends celebrated by attending Jazz at Lincoln Center, according to Colby’s communications director, Kate Carlisle. Performances included those by Grammy-winning jazz vocalist Cassandra Wilson and several Colby students, including jazz band members; and Katie Monteleone and Josua Lutian, who performed selections from their original musical, “Lost with You.” An original film about Edwin Torres, of the Colby class of 2012, was screened at Wednesday night’s event. Torres is now the official photographer for the mayor of New York and won the Pulitzer Prize for news photography this year as part of a New York Daily News/ProPublica team. Colby officials say Torres is a great example of the access and inclusion — and the type of successful student outcome — Colby’s campaign supports. On Oct. 20, Colby launched the $750 million fundraising campaign in Waterville. Officials announced the college already had raised more than $380 million toward that goal. Since then, the campaign total has increased to $387 million. Colby President David Greene, who has led the effort to help revitalize the city’s downtown, and more than 800 Colby trustees, alumni, donors, administrators, faculty members, students, Waterville city officials and others turned out Oct. 20 at the Waterville Opera House for the campaign announcement. The campaign will enable the college to improve access to a Colby education for deserving students from around the globe, provide new facilities that support a multidisciplinary approach to learning and connect the college to the community beyond its campus, according to college officials. Construction of a new performing arts and innovation center also will be built as part of the effort. Campaign funds will allow Colby to continue to redefine the liberal arts, offering distinctive programs to connect students to a rapidly changing world and prepare them to solve the most vexing issues of our time, Colby officials said. The Dare Northward campaign theme reflects the bold and unprecedented nature of the initiatives and priorities it will support, they said. Eric S. Rosengren, chairman of the Colby board of trustees and a 1979 Colby graduate, told the crowd Oct. 20 that Dare Northward refers not just to the current upward momentum of the college but also to its remarkable history, starting with its chartering in 1813. “In 1877, Colby admitted women, more than 100 years before many of our peer institutions,” Rosengren said. Rosengren said Waterville residents raised $107,000 to buy land on Mayflower Hill in 1930 for the college, as the survival of Colby was in question, financial institutions were failing and unemployment was rising. It was a daring move, according to Rosengren. Just as the country fell into the Great Depression, Colby’s leaders were willing to take a significant risk to secure the college’s future. Colby is working with civic, philanthropic and art leaders to help revitalize downtown Waterville. Colby invested $5 million to renovate the former Hains building, a historic bank building on Main Street, and is building a $25 million mixed-use development that will open in the fall of 2018 and house 200 Colby students and faculty and staff members working in civic engagement. Colby also plans to build a hotel and restaurant next year on Main Street that would serve the Waterville community and visitors. Colby’s total investment in Waterville is expected to exceed $45 million, with significant additional resources being committed by private investors, according to college officials. Major campaign commitments include a gift from Colby trustee and campaign co-chairman Bill Alfond, a 1972 Colby graduate, and his wife, Joan, to name the residential and mixed-use complex that Colby is building downtown at 150 Main St. Major gifts to the campaign include more than $100 million to establish the Lunder Institute for American Art, which was launched this fall. The campaign commitment from Overseer Peter Lunder, a 1956 Colby graduate, and his wife, Life Trustee Paula Crane Lunder, included nearly 1,150 new works by artists including Maya Lin, Joan Mitchell, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. The Lunder commitment established Colby as the only liberal arts college with both an innovative art museum dedicated to cross-disciplinary study and a global research center for American art.

WATERVILLE — Colby College alumnus Malcolm Chace has donated $1 million to support a community meeting space at the northeast corner of the mixed-use residential complex Colby is building downtown. The space will be named Chace Community Forum and is an intentionally integrated civic and institutional room designed to enhance the ways Colby, the community and civic leaders work together on issues related to Waterville and beyond, according to a Colby news release. The $1 million gift from Chace, who graduated from Colby in 1990 and is the parent of a Colby senior, will support construction of the 3,800-square-foot space on the first floor of 150 Main St. and will “endow robust programming organized by students, including workshops, symposia, and lectures that will engage a broad cross-section of the Waterville community.” The series of events will be named for the Chace family. The Chace Community Forum will be home to Waterville City Council meetings sometime after the construction of the dormitory is complete. Other public meetings also will be held in the forum, which will serve as a resource for local nonprofit organizations by providing public gathering space in the heart of downtown. Colby President David A. Greene said Chace’s generosity will make it possible for Colby students to interact with and learn from neighbors in the community. “This downtown project is unique in the way that it connects our students to the community through civic engagement, and this remarkable gift aligns beautifully with the spirit and mission of the Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons,” Greene said. The mixed-use residential complex will house 200 Colby students and faculty and staff members in a program blending community work, academics and service in a rapidly revitalizing downtown and beyond. Dean of the College Karlene Burrell-McRae, a 1994 Colby graduate, sees the addition of accessible community space and the speaker series as critical to the civic-engagement mission of the new residence. “This new space represents Colby’s commitment to the wider community,” said Burrell-McRae, who oversees civic engagement at Colby and is working with faculty members, students, and community partners to create a new, robust program this year. “Interaction is key to being responsible for and accountable to each other. As we become involved with meaningful collaborative work with our neighbors, we are afforded the opportunity to learn from those we welcome into the forum.” Burrell-McRae and Brian Clark, Colby’s vice president for planning, met with more than 25 community groups and civic organizations last year to help frame the mission of The Chace Community Forum. “Colby’s commitment to the city of Waterville is nothing short of inspiring,” Chace said. “This effort is the real thing and will forever transform the community in bold and imaginative ways. We could not be more pleased to partner in this dynamic new revitalization.” The Chace family, which has a decadeslong commitment to the revitalization of historic areas, is responsible for numerous renewal and revitalization projects in its home city, Providence, Rhode Island. In the 19th century, ancestor Oliver Chace founded textile mills in Rhode Island, including the Valley Falls Co., an antecedent of Berkshire Hathaway. The Colby dormitory, to be called the Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, is scheduled to open in August.

WATERVILLE — A longtime Colby College supporter is donating $2 million for a contemporary art gallery in a downtown arts center planned by Colby and Waterville Creates! at 93 Main St., college officials announced. The donor is Colby Trustee Emeritus Paul J. Schupf, who received an honorary degree from the college in 2006. Schupf has given several significant contributions to Colby in the past, making possible the Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz, and the Paul J. Schupf Sculpture Court at the Colby College Museum of Art; the Paul J. Schupf Scientific Computing Center; the Anthony-Mitchell-Schupf residence hall; and the Colby College-Memorial Sloan Kettering Summer Internship. Schupf, a collector, has also donated numerous works of art, including pieces by Katz and a gift of more than 150 works on paper by Richard Serra. Colby and Waterville Creates! are trying to raise $18 million to $20 million to transform The Center at 93 Main St. into a thriving art and film center, including the contemporary art gallery on the first floor and a relocated Railroad Square Cinema with new equipment and seating on the second. The gallery, to be named after Schupf, allows the Colby art museum to expand into downtown Waterville, Colby officials said in a statement. As part of the downtown arts complex, the Schupf gallery will feature a rotating program of contemporary art exhibitions. Regularly scheduled gallery events will be held in the space. “The Schupf gallery will be a vital part of the new center for contemporary art and film, which has been conceived to create a hub of activity on Main Street and cement Waterville’s place as a destination for the arts,” Colby President David A. Greene said in the statement. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond.” Schupf is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s board of governors and served as a college trustee for many years. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” Schupf said in the statement. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped on board immediately. The donation of the Paul J. Schupf gallery for contemporary art in downtown Waterville is just another manifestation of my admiration for the college and its museum.” On March 5, Colby and Waterville Creates! announced plans to transform the downtown building to help make Waterville a singular destination for the arts in Maine. The project will feature new and renovated space to support leading programs in visual arts, theater, film and arts education. The larger complex will include the Waterville Opera House, Common Street Arts, the Maine Film Center and the cinema. It is expected to attract even more visitors to Main Street, anchored by a hotel Colby plans to build a block from Castonguay Square and Colby’s Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, which is expected to house 200 Colby students, faculty and staff at 150 Main St. Colby also bought and renovated 173 Main St. across the street from the Commons.

The project has also brought a significant economic boon to the area. Construction work continues at Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons in Waterville on Wednesday, March 28. (Photos above and below by Micky Bedell/Colby College.) The Alfond Commons project alone has brought $14.5 million to local businesses, according to Paul Ureneck, Colby’s director of commercial real estate. Local vendors include Fortin’s Home Furnishings of Winslow, which is supplying appliances for the apartments, and American Glass of Waterville, for the windows that help create the building’s signature aesthetic. Construction on the site started in spring of 2017 and is expected to wrap up before August, when the more than 200 Colby students, faculty, and staff move into Alfond Commons, a unique complex focused on civic engagement and community partnership. Since that time, approximately 120 workers have been employed on site at any given time, including machine operators, excavators, and skilled tradesmen such as carpenters, glaziers, and electricians. The general contractor on the project is Maine-based Landry/French. “Our goal from the beginning has been to work with local vendors, contractors, and subs whenever possible,” said Ureneck. “We’ve found great partners in central Maine, and the results are really beginning to come together.” The contracting work is not the only boost to the economy from the downtown projects. Colby has also focused on working with the civic and business community to create an environment where at least 1,000 new jobs will be established in Waterville in the coming years. Several hundred jobs have already been created or committed, including high-tech jobs with CGI, new positions at incoming retail establishments on Main Street, and at Colby. Many of those jobs are in the newly rehabilitated 173 Main Street, now a tech center and office building. That project, which turned a long-vacant building into a hub of activity, included everything from demolition and concrete work to windows and flooring, and infused approximately $1 million into local businesses. The focus on long-term economic growth—attracting jobs to Waterville, supporting existing and local businesses, and investment by Colby and many others in the downtown—is starting to pay off. People are increasingly choosing to live in Waterville, with Waterville’s population rising to its highest level since 1997. The residential real estate market in Waterville, long lagging, has started to show the effects of these economic booster shots, with single-family home sales on the increase and the price of those homes on the rise. According to Maine Life Real Estate, “Waterville saw an almost 30% jump in the number of homes sold from 2016 to 2017” and an average price increase of almost 10 percent, making it Maine’s “hottest” real estate market in 2017—the first time the city has made the list. “A lot of it has to do with what’s going on downtown,” Don Plourde, owner of Coldwell Banker Plourde Real Estate in Waterville, told MaineBiz. Spurred by Colby’s investments, commercial activity downtown has also experienced an unprecedented volume of sales and redevelopment, including reinvestment in downtown buildings, the creation of new apartments, and several new shops and restaurants.

Construction on the 100,000-square-foot Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons mixed-use building at 150 Main St. has brought $14.5 million to local businesses, Paul Ureneck, Colby\'s director of commercial real estate, said in a Thursday news release. Since construction began a year ago, approximately 120 workers are employed on the site at any given time, including machine operators, excavators, and skilled tradesmen such as carpenters, glaziers, and electricians, Ureneck said. Local vendors used in the project include Fortin\'s Home Furnishings of Winslow, which is supplying appliances for the building\'s 52 apartments, and American Glass of Waterville, which is supplying the windows. The general contractor is Scarborough-based Landry / French Construction. ""Our goal from the beginning has been to work with local vendors, contractors and subs whenever possible,"" said Ureneck. ""We\'ve found great partners in central Maine, and the results are really beginning to come together."" The college said it expects more than 1,000 jobs to be added to the local economy, spurred by the investment by the college and other private investors have made in downtown. Besides the Alfond Commons, the college bought five buildings on Main Street. Renovation of the building at 173 Main St. was recently completed and Portland Pie Co. signed a lease on 3,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space in February. A tenant for the remaining 2,500 square feet is in the works, the college has said. Tech company CGI plans to move into the building from the Hathaway Creative Center this spring, eventually growing from about 50 employees to 200. ""Several hundred jobs have already been created or committed, including high-tech jobs with CGI, new positions at incoming retail establishments on Main Street, and at Colby,"" the release said. The college said work on 173 Main St., which had been vacant for years, infused $1 million into the local economy, using local firms for the work, including ""everything from demolition and concrete work to windows and flooring."" Alfond Commons, across the street, is slated to open in August, and house more than 200 Colby students, faculty, and staff. The building also will have ground-floor retail and a public community room. The college also bought the long-vacant Levine\'s department store building, at the other end of Main Street. The building was torn down, and plans are to build a 42-room hotel on the site. College development officials haven\'t settled on plans for a block of four buildings across the street at 10-14 Main St. The college announced last month that it is partnering with arts nonprofit Waterville Creates! to turn the building it owns at 93 Main St. into an arts hub, at a cost of $18 million to $20 million. Colby also bought the former Elks lodge on Appleton Street, across from the back entrance of 173 Main St., and tore it down, using the site as a parking lot. Colby stated its investments have spurred commercial activity downtown, including reinvestment in downtown buildings, the creation of new apartments and several new shops and restaurants. ""People are increasingly choosing to live in Waterville, with Waterville\'s population rising to its highest level since 1997,"" it said.

Joan,Alfond,['https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/04/10/colby-college-to-buy-camden-bank-building-in-waterville-to-buttress-hotel-development/'],b'970',"[""Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The college plans to raze the current bank building at 33 Main St. and build a boutique hotel on both that lot and the adjacent former Levine's lot. WATERVILLE — Camden National Bank announced Tuesday it will sell its building at 33 Main St. downtown in June to Colby College and will move in early fall onto the ground floor of the new $25.5 million mixed-use residential complex Colby is building down the street at 150 Main St. Meanwhile, Colby officials said the college plans to demolish the current Camden building and build an already-planned boutique hotel on both that lot and the adjacent former Levine’s clothing store lot, where Colby initially had planned to build the hotel. The bank issued a news release Tuesday that says it has signed a purchase and sale agreement with Elm City 9, LLC, an affiliate of Colby. Camden is the first business to announce it will move into Colby’s mixed-use building, which is 103,000 square feet in size and will be named the Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons. The under-construction building — the most visible cornerstone of a revitalization effort that involves millions of dollars of investment downtown — will house 200 Colby students and faculty and staff members on its upper floors and have a glassed-in community space on the northeast corner of the ground floor. The 3,500 square-foot banking center will be on the corner of Main and Temple streets and serve as a one-stop shop for all financial needs, according to the release. “We are very committed to the Waterville region and appreciate the opportunity to serve our customers and the community with a new, modern location,” said Greg Dufour, Camden’s president and chief executive officer. “As a fellow neighbor in downtown Waterville, we feel this is an exciting next step for the entire community and we value the investment Colby College and the Alfonds have made to the community.” Brian Clark, Colby’s vice president of planning, said the college is pleased Camden will continue to be a vital presence in downtown Waterville. “And, importantly, a hotel was identified early on as a key project to bring visitors and new activity to Main Street, and this agreement allows Colby to resume plans for the hotel on a new site that offers the best opportunity for success,” Clark said in the release. The property closing is expected to occur in June. The current bank will remain open at 33 Main St. until it is ready to move to 150 Main St. in early fall, officials said. Camden National has planned for a seamless transition to its future location and customers will not experience any interruption in service when the move occurs, according to the release. Asked when Colby hopes to open the hotel, Clark responded via email Tuesday that Colby is entering the early planning phases now and once the design is complete, it expects to move quickly on construction. Renee Smyth, executive vice president and chief experience and marketing officer for Camden, said in an email Tuesday that there is ample parking space behind the Bill and Joan Alfond Commons for bank customers and there is additional street parking. The current Camden building, built in 1920, is 40,000 square feet in size, but the bank uses only 8,000 square feet of it. The bank bought the building in 2012 from Bank of America, according to Smyth. According to the Waterville assessor’s database, the parcel the bank occupies is 0.67 acre, the back side of the property at 11-13 Front St. is 0.61 acre, and the 9 Main St., the former Levine’s property, is 0.27 acre. The question of parking for the proposed hotel has long been debated, with councilors voting last year to approve leasing 30 spaces on the west side of the 60-space public parking lot on Front Street exclusively to Colby. Clark said Colby generally plans to use parking spaces in the Front Street parking lot that the college has leased from the city and will identify other ways to manage hotel parking. Asked if there is a chance the hotel will be built with parking spaces under it, Clark said, “That’s not a possibility we are currently considering.” The agreement with Camden has allowed Colby to restart the planning process for a high-end hotel that will take full advantage of the new site, Clark said. “Camden’s move is currently planned for early fall, and the agreement allows the bank to remain in 33 Main St. until it is ready to move into 150 Main,” he said. The hotel site with additional property, according to Clark, is about ensuring a hotel downtown that achieves the goals identified through the planning process and the revitalization strategy adopted by the City Council. “Having visitors staying in downtown Waterville will benefit local retailers and restaurants and will contribute to the vibrancy of the street,” Clark said. While the Camden bank building looks relatively intact on the Main Street side, the reality of the building is more complicated, according to Clark. “Only a fraction of the building’s 40,000 square feet (is) currently occupied and much of the remainder of the building is not up to code,” he said. “It does not make financial sense to rehabilitate the building, and the best option at this time seems to be construct a new building on that site.” Clark said 4,000 square feet of space is still available on the ground floor of the residential complex at 150 Main St., and Colby is having productive discussions with several additional prospective retail tenants.

WATERVILLE — Local preschool children at Educare Central Maine recently browsed the titles and chose a new Little Golden Books to take home and share with their families. A partnership with The Molina Foundation and their Books Across Maine initiative made the event possible. The Kennebec Valley Community Action Partnership was awarded more than 500 books to distribute to children served by the organization. Reading with children has a myriad of benefits. Numerous studies have shown that students who are exposed to reading during the early years are more likely to do well in school. It is a bonding activity shared between adults and children, a time to relax and unwind together. And reading with children helps them to build speech skills and improve their ability to communicate. Over time, it can help children develop longer attention spans and better memory retention. And most of all, sharing books with children teaches them that reading is fun, according to a news release from Kennebec Valley Action Program. “We are delighted to partner with The Molina Foundation on their Books Across Maine initiative,” said Suzanne Walsh, KVCAP’s chief executive officer, according to the release. “Books are a vital tool for both learning and pleasure. This wonderful community endeavor helps families build their home libraries.” Educare Central Maine is a partnership between KVCAP, Waterville Public Schools, the Bill and Joan Alfond Foundation, and the Buffett Early Childhood Fund, serving children aged six-weeks to five years old in Waterville.

An Apple executive and his wife have donated $10 million to Bowdoin College to expand the private school’s Coastal Studies Center in Harpswell. The gift is from Philip Schiller and Kim Gassett-Schiller of Half Moon Bay, California, whose son graduated from Bowdoin last year, college officials said Wednesday. Philip Schiller is senior vice president of worldwide marketing at Apple Inc. The money will be used for a new lab, a conference center, housing and dining facilities at the center, which is located on 118 acres on Orr’s Island. The Schillers said they hope their gift will further research on climate change. “I can’t think of anything more important than the environment, climate change,” Schiller said. “It’s happening and it’s inescapable and looking for things we can do, ways we can reduce its impact, change its impact – that’s going to take a lot of research and data and test theories. And Bowdoin is a unique place to contribute. “Knowing that there is an opportunity for studies on the Maine coastline to contribute to research on global climate change is really great, and we want to help assist that and help Bowdoin be a leader in that,” Schiller said. The Schillers’ donation is the latest in a series of recent major gifts to Maine’s private colleges. Earlier this year, Bates College graduates Alison Grott Bonney and Michael Bonney gave the college $50 million, after giving $10 million the year before. In February, the Colby College Museum of Art received its second gift of art valued at more than $100 million from longtime supporters Peter and Paula Lunder, which will be used to launch the Lunder Institute for American Art. Also this year, Colby received $25 million from the Davis Family Foundation to fund study abroad opportunities, and $10 million from Portland developer Joseph Boulos toward a new athletic complex. Bowdoin also received a $10 million gift in 2016 from David Roux, a college trustee, and his wife, Barbara, parents of a Bowdoin graduate. The funds will go toward a center for environmental studies on campus, with classrooms, laboratories, faculty offices and an auditorium. Construction of the building, tentatively named the Roux Center for the Environment, is scheduled to begin in May, pending regulatory approvals, and be completed by fall 2018. Bowdoin’s Coastal Studies Center, located 12 miles from campus, has been renamed the Schiller Coastal Studies Center, officials said. The property was donated to Bowdoin in 1981 by William Thalheimer and his wife, Irma G. Thalheimer, who lived there. In 1995, a $2.1 million gift from L.L. Bean chairman Leon Gorman and his wife, Lisa Gorman, was used to develop it into a research facility. It currently has several labs, a farmhouse, a dock, research vessels and a sailing center. “This extraordinary act of generosity and vision by Phil and Kim Schiller will transform the Coastal Studies Center into a facility where students and faculty from Bowdoin and from other institutions can gather together for concentrated periods to learn from each other and to advance knowledge and understanding about the ocean, marine science and the impact of climate change on marine life,” Bowdoin College President Clayton S. Rose said. Bowdoin enrolls about 1,800 students and has an endowment of $1.34 billion, as of June 2016, the most recent figure available. Tuition, fees and room and board are approximately $66,000 a year. Noel K. Gallagher can be reached at 791-6387 or at: [email protected] Twitter: noelinmaine Send questions/comments to the editors.

Established in 2002 in Abu Dhabi, NAS is a regional leader in the provision of third-party administrator (\'TPA\') services to more than 40 health insurance and takaful companies in the Arabian Gulf (GCC) region. NAS provides its customers a comprehensive network of more than 7,200 healthcare providers across the GCC region, the Middle East and India, as well as a complete suite of outsourcing and state-of-the art IT solutions in the field of healthcare benefits administration. NAS services a pool of more than 500,000 insured members and processes in excess of 3 million medical claims per year. The market for outsourced medical claims management in the GCC region is expected to grow significantly as more countries are expected to introduce compulsory health insurance for their expatriate populations as well as higher healthcare spending resulting from the general improvement in the quality of healthcare treatments available in the region. Atif A. Abdulmalik, Arcapita\'s Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""The global wellness and healthcare sectors are core focus areas for us; Arcapita\'s management has made a number of successful investments in these sectors in the past. NAS is a regional market leader with a strong technology backbone and highly scalable business model. The company is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth in the market for outsourced medical claims management in the GCC region.

Arcapita, Mumtalakat to acquire an approximately 90% stake in NAS United Healthcare Services. A beautiful view of Four Seasons Hotel and ARCAPITA bank in Manama, Bahrain. Established in 2002 in Abu Dhabi, NAS is a regional leader in the provision of third-party administrator (TPA) services to more than 40 health insurance and takaful companies in the GCC region. NAS provides its customers a comprehensive network of more than 7,200 healthcare providers across the GCC region, the Middle East and India, as well as a complete suite of outsourcing and state-of-the art IT solutions in the field of healthcare benefits administration. NAS services a pool of more than 500,000 insured members and processes in excess of 3 million medical claims per year. The market for outsourced medical claims management in the GCC region is expected to grow significantly as more countries are expected to introduce compulsory health insurance for their expatriate populations as well as higher healthcare spending resulting from the general improvement in the quality of healthcare treatments available in the region. Atif A Abdulmalik, Arcapita’s chief executive officer, commented: “The global wellness and healthcare sectors are core focus areas for us; Arcapita’s management has made a number of successful investments in these sectors in the past. NAS is a regional market leader with a strong technology backbone and highly scalable business model. The company is well-positioned to take advantage of the growth in the market for outsourced medical claims management in the GCC region.

Joan,Alfond,['http://www.centralmaine.com/2017/11/13/snow-pond-arts-center-in-sidney-a-gift-worth-supporting/'],b'962',"['Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The venue benefits everyone and offers education and cultural enrichment opportunities, plus year-round concerts, Amy Calder writes. It was a cold night on Snow Pond in Sidney but inside the Snow Pond Center for the Arts’ Alumni Hall, the literal and figurative warmth was palpable. The Philharmonia Boston Orchestra was performing Arnold Schoenberg’s Verklarte Nacht Opus 4, and Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings in C major, Opus 48, directed by Jinwook Park. Sitting among the adults in the audience Nov. 4 were children dressed in black and holding violins and bows, listening intently to and watching with awe their mentors on stage who had worked with them earlier. The children, members of the Snow Pond Youth Symphony, sat mesmerized as the musicians delivered an exquisite, impeccable performance of both the complicated Schoenberg piece and the heartrending Tchaikovsky. Later, the youths joined the Boston orchestra and students of the Maine Suzuki Association onstage, where they played their hearts out in a performance of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Divertimento No. 1 in D major. The presentation was top-drawer, which is no surprise. Park, the conductor, is a common thread here. He is a violinist, performer, educator and music director of not only the Philharmonia Boston Orchestra, but also the Snow Pond Youth Symphony and Colby Symphony Orchestra, teaches violin and viola at Colby and has a private studio in the Boston Area. At Colby, he directs four concerts a year at Lorimer Chapel that are free and open to the public and of a stellar quality you typically find only in larger cities in the northeast. Which is all to say we are fortunate to have venues in central Maine that feature not only great music, but also offer a top-notch music education for children and teens that include bringing professional musicians from places such as Boston to serve as teachers, mentors and inspiration to youth in central Maine. Thanks to the Wiggin family, which started New England Music Camp Association 80 years ago and continues to expand and improve offerings in music education and performance, we adults also benefit. The music camp was founded by Paul E. Wiggin, a musician and conductor, and his wife, Nina, who believed every student, regardless of financial situation, should have access to a high-quality music education. Every summer since 1937, the camp has offered musical, social and recreational activities for 350 musicians, ages 11-18, and given financial aid and scholarships to those in need. Now doing business as Snow Pond Center for the Arts, the camp has expanded its summer program by offering affordable, year-round music education through Snow Pond Community Music School on the camp grounds. Also, the center has added partner locations throughout central Maine, making more sites accessible and raising awareness about the value of music education. The YMCA in Augusta and Alfond Youth Center in Waterville are just two of those sites. In 2016 the Snow Pond Arts Academy opened on the Sidney campus. It is the only public performing arts charter high school in Maine, has 148 students enrolled and offers what school officials call a rigorous academic curriculum integrated with arts education in a culturally rich environment. The residential program is optional. Snow Pond Enrichment, the center’s after school program, was launched in September for students in grades one through eight and offers daily academic support, recreation and music education. Instruments are available for use by students at no cost. In 1970, the Wiggins’ son, Davis Wiggin, and his wife, Jeanette, took over New England Music Camp, transforming it into a venue that began to draw students not only from around the country, but also the world — and from all walks of life. Seven years ago the couple’s son, John Wiggin, and his wife, Kim, took over the camp leadership and have expanded programs and offerings, improved infrastructure and joined others in central Maine working to help revitalize the area, enhance the arts and boost economic development. Wiggin, Snow Pond’s executive director, who spoke at the Nov. 4 performance, is just now announcing that the center has received a generous challenge grant through the Bill and Joan Alfond Foundation to help renovate and improve the amphitheater on campus known as the Bowl in the Pines. The Alfond grant requires that Snow Pond raise $100,000 by Dec. 31 this year in order to receive $65,000 from the foundation to support the project. One of the largest outdoor stages in the U.S., the amphitheater on the lake has great acoustics and is one of the most appealing performance venues anywhere in the country, as Wiggin duly notes. Eleven free concerts and three requiring tickets were held this past summer. Improvements to the amphitheater will allow for seven or eight ticketed events on a much larger scale, as well as 12 free concerts, according to Wiggin. The changes will enable the center to become one of the premier outdoor concert venues in New England and offer central Mainers major national music performances in their own backyard. Plans call for the amphitheater stage to be extended forward by 8 feet next spring and improved steel supports will allow for additional sound and lighting required by national touring artists, according to Wiggin. In the fall of 2018, concession renovations, ambient lighting and landscaping are scheduled to be completed. The investment is anticipated to draw well-known performers and larger summer concerts which will benefit local businesses because of the increase in visitors to the region. Snow Pond officials estimate the revenue to local businesses will be $350,000 per event and profits will support students, their families and community members engaged in Snow Pond programs or facilities, according to Wiggin. Meanwhile, Snow Pond has created a task force — whose members include town, police and fire officials, as well as residents and business owners — to discuss safety, traffic, parking, communications, scale and type of events. Those interested in joining the panel may call Christa Johnson, the center’s director of development, at 844-476-6976, extension 203, or email her at [email protected] Wiggin says he is optimistic central Mainers will support the amphitheater project. In addition to thanking the Alfonds for their investment, he encourages people to visit the center to see first-hand the opportunities there. We are fortunate to have a gem such as Snow Pond Center for the Arts in our sphere. It benefits everyone and offers education and cultural enrichment opportunities — as well as year-round concerts — many communities can only dream of having in their midst. When the winter is long, dark and cold, live performances serve to warm our hearts and inspire our intellects. It’s a gift worth perpetuating.

Malcolm,Chace,['https://www.capecod.com/lifestyle/the-story-of-point-gammon-lighthouse/'],b'961',"['CapeCod.com Your Source for everything Cape Cod Point Gammon Lighthouse from just after the turn of the 20th century, courtesy of Jeremy D’Entremont. Great Island, located on Nantucket Sound in West Yarmouth, is perhaps the most exclusive area on Cape Cod. The 700-acre area, which is technically connected to the rest of the Cape at low tide, is privately owned and dotted with multi-million dollar homes owned by some big time players. It is next to impossible to make your way out to the southern tip of Great Island due to the layers of security. That is a shame as standing stoically and usually in complete solitude is a wonderful piece of living Cape Cod history that only a select few have been able to see up close. It is Point Gammon Lighthouse and this is its story. Today Great Island is off limits to just about everyone, however two centuries ago it was uninhabited by just about everyone. Back then it was completely open land used by Yarmouth residents for cattle pasture. Jutting out more than a mile into the ocean the sometimes-island became home to a smallpox inoculation hospital in 1802 after an outbreak which had begun in 1797. Due to its proximity the hospital was relatively secluded. The area of Great Island where the hospital was located was named Point Gammon. The waters just offshore are dotted with dangerous boulders which caused numerous shipwrecks. Its name would come from the game of backgammon as sailors were often ‘gammoned’ or deceived by the submerged boulders. Point Gammon Lighthouse This constant threat of shipwreck as well as the increased traffic into Hyannis Harbor led to the construction of a lighthouse at the tip of Great Island in 1816. Standing twenty-five feet tall and made of stone it would be named Point Gammon Lighthouse. The tower would help but as time went on the vessel traffic continued to increase and the landlocked lighthouse was seen as inadequate. In 1855 lighthouse keeper John Peak noted a total of 4,969 schooners, 1,455 sloops, 216 brigs, and four steamboats which passed Point Gammon during the year. These numbers made it necessary for a lightship to be stationed further off shore. The spot chosen was close to a pair of rocky ledges known as Bishop and Clerks more than two miles from the shores of Great Island. In 1858 this was replaced by a permanent structure known as Bishop and Clerks Lighthouse. Upon its creation Point Gammon Lighthouse was deactivated and Great Island went dark. The story of Great Island began to change in 1872 when the land was purchased by Samuel Payson of the prominent import-export J.C. Howe & Co. out of Boston. Payson would be the first to construct a summer home on the peninsula. The land would be sold to wealthy ornithologist Charles Cory in 1883 who would make some major changes. Cory would be the first to make Great Island private. He did so by placing a gate at the entrance to the property, and doubled-down on it by constructing a six-foot tall fence around its entirety. Inside the fence Cory created a rare game preserve and a hundred acre golf course. Cory would spend more than $100,000 ($2.5 million in 2017) on improving the property between 1883-1907. This included the creation of a grand hotel called Aberdeen Hall. Point Gammon Lighthouse After spending much of his time on Great Island for nearly thirty years Cory gave all but fifty acres of the property away to a corporation in 1911. The land would end up in the control of Henry Phipps, a New York steel tycoon in 1916. It would in turn be sold to Malcolm Chace and to this day much of Great Island remains owned by the Chace Family. Today Great Island remains one of the most exclusive areas on Cape Cod. Point Gammon Lighthouse has been deactivated for more than 150 years yet still stands stoically looking over the Nantucket Sound waters that it used to protect. The keeper’s house was eventually taken down in the years around World War I with the materials used to build another dwelling. Bishop and Clerks Lighthouse, the bacon which replaced Point Gammon Light, stood tall out in the sound for nearly a century before falling into disrepair and being demolished in 1952. Point Gammon Lighthouse being at the tip of the highly private Great Island is for all intents and purposes off limits. One can see it from the nearby Keyes Beach in Hyannis, and Craigville Beach in Centerville, or you may traverse the boulder laden coast by boat. However up close visits are not likely and should not be attempted.

Your support makes that possible — subscribe today Your support makes that possible — subscribe today Atlantic City’s Convention Hall was the site of the first-ever indoor college bowl game in 1964, when West Virginia faced Utah in the Liberty Bowl. The year was 1964 and it was the last time that WVU played Utah in a bowl game. It was not much of a game as Utah won handily 32-6, but it was a historic day for college football. The two teams played in the Liberty Bowl, a northeast bowl game that was plagued by cold weather and poor attendance. The next season the game would move to Memphis, where it has remained with good success. The 1964 meeting between the 8-2 Utes and the 7-3 Mountaineers was the first major-college bowl game played indoors. The game was played in the Atlantic City Convention Hall in front of 6,059 fans. Earlier that year the building had hosted a Beatles concert, the Miss America pageant and the Democratic National Convention. The game was broadcast on national television and legendary announcers Curt Gowdy and Jim McKay were a part of the broadcast team. Playing conditions were less than ideal as burlap was laid over the hard concrete convention floor and the game organizers tried to plant 4 inches of grass over the burlap. The convention center lights were left on during the week to try to help the grass grow. End zones were only 8 yards deep, instead of 10, so the playing field could fit in the building. In 1964, there was not much college football on television, but it seemed like everyone in our state watched this game. It was a time before sports bars, so my father and I went to Conley’s Barber Shop in Rand to watch the game on television with “the fellas.” In many places in our state the barber shops were the places to gather to talk sports. The place was packed and spirits were high. That enthusiasm quickly faded as Utes stars Roy Jefferson and Ron Coleman took over the game. Much like the sports bars of today, the crowd in the barber shop branded WVU coach Gene Corum “an idiot for not having the boys ready to play.” Utah QB Pokey Allen was named the game’s Most Valuable Player. He would go on to be the head coach at Boise State, and his Broncos beat Marshall in a semifinal game in the 1994 I-AA playoffs. The next week he was disliked in Huntington when he referred to the city as “Boonville” when he was bringing his team to Huntington to play Jim Tressell and Youngstown State in the national championship game. The only Mountaineer touchdown was scored on a 15-yard pass from Allen McCune to Milt Clegg. McCune was a hero of mine who had played his high school football at Meadow Bridge and East Bank. Later, in 1978, his nephews Steve and Mike would lead East Bank to a berth in the Class AAA basketball state championship game, where they lost to a Logan team with Mike Stone and coached by Willie Akers. Later in life, I became good friends with one of the captains of the WVU team, Larry Canterbury. He played for Carl Ward at Ceredo-Kenova and later was head football coach at Oak Glen and Hurricane high schools. In 1964, the country was changing. Soon, much of the population would start migrating to the southeast. The Beatles’ fame was growing, the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series and the Cleveland Browns were the kings of pro football, shocking Johnny Unitas and the Baltimore Colts 27-0 in the NFL title game in Cleveland. Locally, Mike Kitchen led East Bank to the AAA state football championship with a 6-0 win over Huntington High on a frigid day at Laidley Field. Bowl games were not plentiful like they are today, and it would be five years before WVU would play in another one. The packed crowd in Conley’s Barber Shop was too depressed to appreciate the historical significance of the game. We also had no idea that in Marion County a junior high kid named Nick Saban was probably watching the game, and he would go one to arguably be the best coach in college football history. The crowd at the barber shop in Rand also could not have realized that some 30 years later, the best athlete in the history of our state, Randy Moss, would grow up around the corner.

Phillip,Frost,['https://hyperallergic.com/420102/a-deeply-modern-cuban-artist-who-connected-with-the-divine/'],b'886',"[""Rafael Soriano’s richly colored works possess mysterious geometries that reflect his connection to the divine. MIAMI — In the early 1960s, Rafael Soriano received a spiritual revelation — a divine intervention — in a dream. The painter was napping, explains his daughter, Hortensia, in an interview for the New York Times, and he “felt himself levitate above his bed.” Then, says Hortensia, a figure appeared and spoke to Soriano: “‘Rafael, where do you want to go?’ He said he wanted to go see his little house back in Matanzas.” The figure brought Soriano to Matanzas, where a herd of wild horses galloped down a hill, threatening to trample everything in their path. Soriano knew then that he, like Thomas Wolfe, couldn’t go home again. Still, upon waking, he arose out of a years-long creative blockage and began to paint. The dream has all the elements of Soriano’s late work: divine transmission; displacement; the temporal interjected by the spiritual. The Artist as Mystic, an exhibition on view at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum — it was originally organized by the McMullen Museum of Art, Boston College, in collaboration with the Rafael Soriano Foundation — features more than 90 of his paintings and drawings, beginning with his experimentation in Cuban abstraction and ending with the years preceding his death, when the flat planes of his early work softened and lifted, like a bird in flight. Geometric forms gave way to curvy, illuminated, surrealistic images; in the ’80s and ’90s, Soriano’s paintings all looked a bit like the cosmos. The show presents Soriano as a kind of practical mystic: a dreamer at once fascinated by God and doggedly aware of his own mortality. That Matanzas dream came shortly after the Cuban Revolution; in 1962, Soriano fled Cuba for Miami with his wife and daughter. But the sense of exile left him distressed and uninspired. According to a placard accompanying his painting, “La gitana (The Gypsy)” (1965), he’s quoted as having said, “[M]y uprooting was such that for two years I couldn’t paint.” Prior to his move, Soriano’s abstract paintings had garnered wide acclaim, and he eventually went on to co-found the collective Los Diez Pintores Concretos (Ten Concrete Painters), whose ideological philosophies and concepts were reduced to bright colors and uncomplicated planes. Works from this time are playful and linear, stylized with wide angles. I love “Juego infantil (Children’s Game),” a 1950s gouache piece in which the depicted shapes look like bursts of energy, a rainbow of clustered lines thinning into spinning-top points. There’s a theme of kinetic buoyancy in pieces like the oil painting “Luciérnaga (Firefly)” (1955), where geometric outlines appear to float in space, or in “Plenilunio (Full Moon)” (1953), with its adoration for the seemingly weightless moon. Even in the 1950s — and especially in the 1940s, before his lines temporarily took on a hard geometry — one could’ve foreshadowed his later, far more cosmic oeuvre. Soriano’s work doesn’t yield to typical notions of artistic evolution, the idea that one must continually reinvent himself. Despite the stark differences between each period of his work, one can find a wondrous thread throughout. Like the magic present in his earlier paintings, a strange geometry infuses the later work; Soriano was always interested in preternatural luminosity. In “El filósofo (The Philosopher”) (1974), the subject’s face, its Picasso-esque jigsawing, appears to emerge from darkness, glowing and stoic. The dark became a constant. I’d be remiss to describe any of Soriano’s post-exile work as sad, but they contain a somber liminality: a feeling of not quite here, nor there, either. His paintings from the 1970s through the ’90s are deep —blacks, dark purples, rich indigos — but their figurative forms are willowy, wispy: biomorphic peels and curves that evoke a space in between worlds. A note in my journal, scrawled quickly while exploring the exhibition, reads: “Thinking of Alexander Grey.” This is a visually inaccurate comparison (an embarrassing one, too), but ideologically speaking, it isn’t too far removed: bodies glow, faces melt into aquatic layers, forms take on alien qualities. In a section devoted to work from the 1990s, there’s an easel from Soriano’s studio, along with a striking photograph of the artist. Soriano sits in a plush chair, a billowy curtain to his left, pastels and paint to his right. He looks calm, at ease, and decisively alone; he reminds me of the Hermit Tarot card and its corresponding archetype, that wise old figure seeking spirituality, lit by the light of his own lantern, nothing more. Soriano seemed to move through his life, ever onward toward its end, with an inexplicable grace, documenting each phase however surrealistically. As a placard at the exhibition quotes him: “‘The anxieties and sadness of exile brought in me an awakening. I began to search for something else … And I went from geometric painting to a painting that is spiritual. I believe in God, I believe in the spirit.’” Rafael Soriano: The Artist as Mystic continues at The Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum (Florida International University, Modesto Maidique Campus, 10975 SW 17th Street, Miami) through January 28. Protesters and activists promise to continue to stage the Anti-Columbus Day Tour until the museum corrects the displays.

Since then, her story-based advocacy has helped win policy change on hate crimes, racial profiling, immigration detention, solitary confinement, marriage equality, and internet freedom. In order to equip a new generation of advocates, she founded Groundswell Movement, America’s largest multi-faith online organizing community.

The season kicks off with an opening reception for this spring’s first exhibition — Dawoud Bey: The Birmingham Project — on Jan. 18. Here is a sneak peek of what is coming to The Frost during the Spring 2018 semester: These two portraits from “The Birmingham Project” are part of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Exhibition Series, which addresses issues of race, diversity, social justice, civil rights and humanity. In 2013, 50 years after the infamous attack on the African-American 16th Street Baptist Church and the ensuing violence throughout the city of Birmingham, Dawoud Bey created a project to commemorate the children who were killed or injured. Over the course of seven years, Bey developed The Birmingham Project— a series of vibrant and poignant portraits of current residents who represent the ages of the victims when they died, as well as the ages they would have been if they were still alive. The exhibition is part of The Frost’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Exhibition Series, which addresses issues of race, diversity, social justice, civil rights and humanity to serve as a catalyst for dialogue and to enrich our community with new perspectives. The opening reception will take place Jan. 18 at 5 p.m. Pietro da Cortona’s oil painting “Hagar and the Angel” will be one of the paintings featured in the Dangerous Women exhibit coming to FIU. The Old and New Testaments are full of compelling female characters: good wives and bad, courageous heroines and deceptive–sometimes deadly–femme fatales. Dangerous Women presents 23 works from the rich holdings of the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art that explore different artists’ responses to the women of the Bible. Paintings by Pietro da Cortona, Francesco Cairo and Fede Galizia are complemented by Old Masters and Robert Henri’s sumptuous, sensuous Salome, which stands as a reminder of how dangerous biblical women have continued to loom large in the modern imagination. An opening reception and panel discussion will take place Feb. 17 beginning at 3 p.m. Jorge Alberto Hernández Cadi (El Buzo) is one of the most recognized Cuban artists in the genre of outsider art. Outsider Artists from Havana is a project managed by the National Art Exhibitions of the Mentally Ill Foundation, in close collaboration with specialists from the Frost Art Museum and FIU researchers, which aims to show the artistic production of two of the most recognized Cuban artists in the genre of outsider art: Misleidys Castillo and Jorge Alberto Hernández Cadi (El Buzo). Each artist presents very different aesthetics and themes, according to their respective mental disorders. The interpretation of their special universes is shaped consistently with the recurrence of a distinctive language that is supported by their craft, which is an important concept that unites them. Laura Aguilar’s “At Home with the Nortes” will be on display at FIU as part of Show and Tell. The Frost will close out the season with Laura Aguilar: Show and Tell, the first comprehensive retrospective of Chicana photographer Laura Aguilar. Laura Aguilar: Show and Tell assembles more than 100 works produced over three decades. Through photographs and videos that are frequently political as well as personal, and which traverse performative, feminist and queer art genres, Aguilar offers candid portrayals of herself, her friends and family, and LGBT and Latinx communities. Aguilar’s now iconic triptych, Three Eagles Flying (1990), set the stage for her future work by using her nude body as an overt and courageous rebellion against the colonization of Latinx identities — racial, gendered, cultural and sexual. Her practice intuitively evolved over time as she struggled to negotiate and navigate her ethnicity and sexuality, her challenges with depression and auditory dyslexia, and the acceptance of her large body. This exhibition tells the story of the artist who for most of her life struggled to communicate with words yet ironically emerged as a powerful voice for numerous and diverse marginalized groups.

So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly in an overpriced market or after disappointing news Here's a look at some notable insider purchases reported in the past week. Beigene Ltd (NASDAQ: BGNE) saw beneficial owner-director Baker Bros. Advisors scoop up more than 1.98 million shares of this Chinese biotech at a price of $101 apiece, for a total just short of $200 million. That brought the stake of the Baker Bros. partnership to more than 5.12 million shares, or about 10 percent of the total outstanding.

At between $410.36 and $412.66 per share, that cost him more than $1.44 million. Note that Biglari is a frequent buyer of small batches of shares, and his stake is most recently listed as more than 696,000 shares. The owner of Steak 'n Shake and Maxim magazine recently announced plans to reorganize itself as a holding company with a dual-class structure, with the aim of preserving Biglari's control of the company. The stock closed most recently at $418.73, which is above Biglari's latest purchase prices. The share price is fractionally lower year to date. At Opko Health Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK), chairman and CEO Phillip Frost has resumed his habit of frequently buying batches of shares. Most recently that was 375,000 shares of this medical test and medication company. At share prices ranging from $4.40 to $4.99, that totaled almost $1.79 million. Before this, Frost's most recent reported purchase of shares was back in September. This week it was announced that president of BioReference Laboratories, an Opko subsidiary, had resigned. Shares of this Miami-based company rose almost 8 percent in the past week and closed on Friday at $4.88 apiece. The stock has traded as high as $8.92 a share in the past 52 weeks.

From Judith to Esther, Salome to Mary Magdalene, Delilah to Lot's Daughters and Potiphar's wife, these women — perceived as dangerous to society — shaped biblical history. The Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum FIU presents the world premiere of Dangerous Women, the timely new exhibition that explores shifting perceptions of these historic characters, whose power to topple the strongest of male rulers made them “dangerous” but whose strength serves as an historical foundation for thinking about contemporary causes (including the “Me Too” movement). While some were portrayed as paragons of family goodness who saved their people, others were shown as harlots and hussies, purveyors of sin, deadly temptresses and seductresses. Featuring spectacular and thought-provoking Old Master paintings from the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Dangerous Women showcases more than twenty paintings and etchings of women found in the Bible by 16th and 17th century artists, including: Pietro da Cortona, Fede Galizia, Pordenone, Giovanni Andrea Sirani and Francesco del Cairo. Many of these works are accompanied by Old Master prints and drawings, including Jan Saenredam’s series Famous Women of the New Testament. The exhibition concludes with modern and contemporary works, including the sensuous Salome (1901) by Robert Henri, and Portrait of Mamma Bush(2010) by Mickalene Thomas. The opening reception is free and open to the public on Saturday, February 17, from 4:00-7:00 p.m. The museum presents a panel discussion about feminism in art history and the lives of women in Renaissance society, on the day of the opening from 3:00-4:00 p.m. Led by the museum’s Director, Dr. Jordana Pomeroy, panelists include: Kimberly Dennis, PhD, Associate Professor in the Department of Art & Art History and Program in Sexuality, Women’s & Gender Studies, Rollins College; Mary D. Garrard, PhD, Professor Emerita of Art History, American University; and Guido Ruggiero, PhD, Professor of history and College of Arts and Sciences Cooper Fellow, University of Miami. The panel discussion is also free and open the public (RSVP required in advance). The museum is located on the campus of Florida International University “Dangerous Women demonstrates how throughout history men have feared women who wield power through their intellect and sexuality,” said Dr. Jordana Pomeroy, the Director of the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum FIU. “This timely new exhibition of old-master paintings demonstrates how powerful women were feared, even when their acts were heroic,” adds Pomeroy. “As the museum in Miami that distinguishes itself by presenting works that span all historical periods, we want our audiences to appreciate the narrative of women who are either victims of sexual violence or dominate powerful men, which feels utterly relevant to conversations trending right now. As remote as some of these works may initially appear, art history provides a lens with which to see shifting perceptions about women over centuries,” said Dr. Jordana Pomeroy. Whether these women were deemed as saints or sinners, their stories and passions shaped biblical history and these perceptions of women have been taught, reviewed and re-evaluated for centuries. While some artists from the Renaissance and Baroque periods often included these characters as an excuse to paint the sensuous female nude form, other artists from these and other periods focused on the drama and morals contained in these women’s stories. Dangerous Women is a partnership between the Ringling Museum of Art (Florida State University), the Frost Art Museum (Florida International University) and the Cornell Museum (Rollins College). The exhibition is organized by the Ringling and will only appear at the Frost Art Museum FIU and the Cornell Museum. The exhibition is accompanied by a catalogue published by Scala Arts Publishers. The exhibition will be closed for a ticketed concert performance by the choral group Seraphic Fire onSaturday, March 10 (purchase tickets here).

Phillip,Frost,['http://www.southflorida.com/theater-and-arts/art/sf-womens-history-month-art-exhibits-miami-pompano-beach-20180227-story.html'],b'860',"['The idea behind curator Byron Swart’s female-driven art exhibit in Pompano Beach, “No Constraints to Beauty,” was forged in a moment of frustration and sympathy. While reading statistics published in a 2011 National Endowment for the Arts study, Swart found that while 51 percent of professional visual artists are female, women earn roughly 81 cents for every dollar made by men. The glaring figures were motivation enough. Coinciding with Women’s History Month, “No Constraints to Beauty,” opening Thursday, March 1, at the Pompano Beach Cultural Center, celebrates what Swart calls South Florida’s “female powerhouses,” 15 artists whose paintings and sculptures champion women’s rights and accomplishments. “If you look at the works here — the sculptures and paintings — it’s obvious that anything a man can do, a female can do,” Swart says. “The whole premise is to celebrate the women in South Florida trying to make their voices heard, and not to take them for granted.” “No Constraints to Beauty” joins two other female-centric art exhibits opening for Women’s History Month. Following is a breakdown of these shows. Saturday, March 10, through May 2 at ConcreteSpace Art Projects, 3400 NW 78th Ave., Doral; free admission; 305-219-0811 or ConcreteSpace.net Nine empowering photographs about femininity by nine veteran photographers — Peggy Nolan, Priscilla Forthman, Sheila Elias, Mirta Gomez, Alexandra del Canto, Gloria O’Connell, Angelika Rinnhofer, Niloufar Banisadr and Lissette Schaeffler — are featured in this show, opening with a reception 4-7 p.m. March 10. “Too often, women are unsung heroes,” ConcreteSpace owner Flor Mayoral says in a prepared statement. “We are celebrating women that help our community behind the scenes.” Through May 20 at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, 10975 SW 17 St., Miami; free admission; 305-348-2890 or TheFrost.FIU.edu Twenty works by old masters feature feisty heroines, biblical temptresses, femmes fatales and other headstrong subjects in this collection of 16th and 17th century paintings of women of the Bible, on view now at the museum. These portraits, which include Salome, Mary Magdalene, Delilah and Lot\'s daughters, demonstrate “how powerful women were feared, even when their acts were heroic,” says Frost Art Museum director Jordana Pomeroy, adding that “Dangerous Women” shares parallels with the #MeToo movement. “We want our audiences to appreciate the narrative of women who are either victims of sexual violence or dominate powerful men, which feels utterly relevant to conversations trending right now."" All day March 1-31 at Pompano Beach Cultural Center, 50 W. Atlantic Blvd.; free admission; 954-545-7800 or CCPompano.org Works by Mimi Botscheller, Leah Brown, Janet Gold, Kelcie McQuaid, Lori Pratico, Hilda Vidal and others are featured in this show, which will be paired with an art-music-and-gabbing gathering titled “artPOP! Phenomenal Women” at 7:30-10 p.m. March 8. During the event, going down at the cultural center’s plaza, six artists (five female, one male) will race to finish fresh canvasses in a 45-minute art battle. There will also be chalk-art activities, food trucks, art vendors and performances by local R&B, hip-hop and spoken-word musicians.

Kevin DeGeeter - Ladenburg Thalmann Michael Petusky - Barrington Research Operator Welcome to the OPKO Health Incorporated Business Update Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following management's prepared remarks, we'll hold a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, March 1, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Anne Marie Fields. Please go ahead, ma'am. Anne Marie Fields Thank you, operator. Good afternoon. This is Anne Marie Fields with LHA Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining today's call. I'd like to remind you that any statements made during this call other than statements of historical fact will be considered forward-looking and as such will be subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect the Company's expected results. Those forward-looking statements include, without limitation, the various risks described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as filed this afternoon. Before we begin, let me review the format for today's call. Dr. Phillip Frost, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will open the call, followed by Steve Rubin, OPKO's Executive Vice President who will provide an update on the Company's various businesses and clinical programs. After that Adam Logal, OPKO's Chief Financial Officer will review the Company's 2017 fourth quarter and full-year financial performance. Finally, Dr. Frost will provide his closing remarks and then we'll open the call to your questions. Now, let me turn the call over to Dr. Frost. Dr. Frost? Phillip Frost Thank you. Good afternoon. 2017 was a challenging year for OPKO. There were a number of headwinds at BioReference, a slower-than-expected ramp-up in sales of RAYALDEE and some unexpected one-time impacts on our financial performance. The other hand, we've made significant progress. We're in the process of selecting the next President of BioReference from the group of highly qualified candidates that we are hopeful and we are hopeful that early science of improved results there will continue. RAYALDEE sales have been increasing steadily. The recent results appear to indicate a more rapid upward trend. We also recently signed the RAYALDEE licensing agreement with the Torii Pharmaceutical Division of Japan, Tobacco. Given the breadth and potential of OPKO's assets and as positive as ever about our future. And as described in today's filing, I've confirmed that confidence by investing an additional $25 million into the Company, alongside my colleague Dr. Jane Hsiao, and a highly successful Asian businessman already an OPKO investor for a total of $55 million. As you've heard me say before, I can't think of a better investment for my money. We're all working hard on our strategy to build OPKO into the leading diversified healthcare company it was meant to be. And I'll now pass you on to Steve who will provide more details on our commercial and clinical programs as well as our plans for the future. Steven Rubin Thanks, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. As Dr. Frost just noted, despite facing certain challenges in 2017, we made meaningful progress across a number of key areas critical to OPKO's growth. On today's call, I will discuss our strategies to address some of these challenges as well as our plans to continue to advance our clinical and commercial programs. My discussion will include a review of our diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, and clinical development programs. Let's start with our Diagnostic business, BioReference Laboratories, which is the country's third largest reference lab. Throughout 2017, we shared with you some of the challenges we faced with this business and how they were impacting revenue growth in the short-term. We have worked hard to implement system improvements and cost reductions that over time are expected to positively impact BioReference Labs financial performance. Adam will elaborate more on these efforts in his financial remarks. In addition, we made a number of leadership changes including a new head of commercial operations and we are in the process of recruiting a new President with the skills and industry expertise consistent with our vision for BioReference's role in the rapidly evolving diagnostic market. We are highly impressed by the several outstanding candidates we have already met with and hope to announce our selection in the near future. We remain particularly excited about the potential for BioReference Labs, GeneDx subsidiary, which continues to demonstrate growth and innovation in its high complexity exome and related test with a 49% year-over-year increase in exome based testing volumes. These include new exome base test it open up and further expand other clinical areas for testing such as for patients with neurologic conditions and critically ill patients. Our strategy for GDx is to continue to expand relationships at large and leading healthcare systems to continue to broaden the testing menu in order to provide testing in many additional healthcare settings and to form other strategic alliances which GeneDx can create and add value to these partnerships. An example of a new test offerings, last week's launch pharmacogenomics testing. Pharmacogenomics is the study of how genes affected person's response to drugs. This relatively new field combined pharmacology, which is a science of drugs and genomic which is a study of genes to their functions to develop and prescribe effective safe medications and doses that will be tailored to a person's individual genetic makeup. In January, we were delighted to announce a research collaboration with Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, which is aimed at identifying novel genes and pathways to help diagnose and manage human genetic diseases. This supplements GeneDx's other ongoing large scale collaboration, so just with the internationally based Deciphering Developmental Disorder study that was formally announced last year. At a leader in whole exome and genome sequencing GeneDx's helped discover and contribute to the phenotypic understanding of over 58 novel disease genes in the last three years alone. The shared combination of our data summaries and analytical tools to conduct met analysis of GeneDx and its other datasets will help us better understand the genetic basis of human health and disease and to continue to provide differentiated testing options. Moving on our 4Kscore blood test gives a man with elevated PSA levels, a personalized prediction of his chance of having or developing an aggressive form of prostate cancer. During the fourth quarter, 20,600 4Kscore test were performed, a 15% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. As many of you may have seen we've launched a series of television ads for the 4Kscore in the New York region at the end of last year and in Florida in February. We have also increased our presence in social media outlets, including directed digital advertising. We believe that focused sales and marketing to professionals and expansion of consumer awareness will help increase the utilization of the 4Kscore test. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and is projected to account from 160,000 new cases and over 29,000 deaths in 2018. The 4Kscore test is a simple blood test that has demonstrated strong clinical utility as a follow-up test after an initial screening with PSA or digital rectal exam. In several prospective clinical validity studies, it has been shown that the 4Kscore test did not miss any aggressive Gleason - with the Gleason Score greater than or equal to eight cancers and it reduced unnecessary biopsies in 21% of men who were scheduled for biopsy. New payment schedules implemented on January 1, 2018 provided a 26% increase in 4Kscore reimbursement. Medicare reimbursement is now $760 per test, up from approximately $600 per test previously. In addition, we've expanded our clinical validity studies in subjects who are diagnosed with borderline Gleason 6 prostate cancer. For example, the soon to be published Homburg radical prostatectomy study has demonstrated that the 4Kscore test can effectively differentiate biopsy Gleason 6 cancer from those men likely to harbor adverse pathology. November we filed a pre-market approval application with the FDA for our Claros 1 immunoassay analyzer in total PSA test. The Claros 1 immunoassay is a proprietary diagnostic devise that can provide rapid, quantitative blood test results in 10 minutes right in the physician's office with only a finger stick drop of whole blood and with precision and accuracy comparable to the PSA test performed in the central lab, using a large instrument. The PMA filing included supported data from two multi-center field studies involving a total of 864 men. We have been active and correspondence with FDA on the submission and it had a bioresearch monitoring audit at our [indiscernible] facility and two clinical trial sites with no observations issued on Form 43. We are hopeful for an approval during the third quarter of this year. This new point-of-care diagnostic offers a significant market opportunity as there are more than 25 million PSA test performed annually in the United States. In addition, we continue to advance the development of additional Claros 1 test for indications to interface with our other products and programs such as testosterone and vitamin D. In the coming months, we plan to initiate clinical validation studies for a Claros 1 testosterone test and file a 510(k) application for approval with the FDA. Turning now to our pharmaceutical business, let me start by discussing RAYALDEE, the first and only therapy approved by the FDA that both raises 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lowers parathyroid hormone levels in patients with chronic kidney disease with a safety profile similar to placebo. For 2017, our first full-year of launch IMS reported that nearly 8,000 prescriptions of RAYALDEE were fulfilled. It is a level of acceptance and success that we find very encouraging due to the products ever escalating favorable trends. We believe RAYALDEE's market penetration will slow at first due to a number of factors. The gradual ramp of insurance coverage for RAYALDEE, not alike all newly launched innovative drugs. The need to educate physicians about RAYALDEE's ability to safely treat secondary hyperparathyroidism as well as the importance of lowering parathyroid hormone levels to reduce the risk of vascular calcification, the major cause of mortality in chronic kidney disease. We are continuing to build sales momentum and we have seen steady week-over-week increases in total prescriptions since the start of the year. We have also increased the number of healthcare providers who prescribe RAYALDEE. We had almost 600 active prescribers in Q4, an increase of 38% from Q3, demonstrating increase in adoption by targeted providers. We ended 2017 with access to RAYALDEE being available for 51% of covered lives in the Medicare space and for over 79% of all covered lives. In view of this insurance coverage, we expanded our sales force from 35 to 64 reps last October and expect significant impact on sales in 2018. Currently, in meeting out-of-pocket patient costs RAYALDEE is less than $5 after available financial assistance. We are more confident than ever in the importance of RAYALDEE is resulting in chronic kidney disease patients and our business. Adam will elaborate on RAYALDEE revenue in his financial discussion. In the next few months, our renal team will be active at several important clinical meetings, the Renal Physicians Association Annual Meeting in Orlando, the National Kidney Foundation Spring Clinical Meeting in Austin, and the Annual Meeting of the Endocrinology Society in Chicago. Our teams activities at these meetings enhanced our reach to Renal Healthcare providers and provide a clinical data and support needed to increase adoption and utilization of a new treatment option like RAYALDEE. In addition, we expanded the global market potential for RAYALDEE by entering into an exclusive agreement with the Torii Pharmaceutical unit of Japan, Tobacco for the development and commercialization of RAYALDEE in Japan as a treatment for SHPT and non-dialysis and dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. Turning to the agreement, Torii will be responsible for all regulatory approvals and commercial activities in Japan. Turning to VARUBI, we are disappointed with the TESARO's decision a couple days ago to suspend distribution of the intravenous or IV form of a VARUBI. As TESARO noted they will continue to support the oral formulation of the drug. We believe that the recently reported safety issues arise from the formulation of the IV version of the drug and not the drug itself, and intend to seek more information concerning TESARO commercialization efforts for the drug. No episode of anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock or other serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with respect to oral formulation of VARUBI since its launch in 2015. Let's turn now to our clinical development programs. Our strategy is to build a diversified portfolio addressing a number of indications with significant unmet medical needs, limited treatment options and large markets. We have a robust pipeline of products candidates at varying stages of development, which we believe mitigates the risk inherent in reliant to any one product program or study. This pipeline provides attractive opportunities for creating both near and long-term value for our shareholders. Let me start with the programs in our renal business. Vifor Fresenius and another of our global partners has filed a new drug submission with health candidate is on track and is on track to file in the third quarter of this year in market authorization application with the European Medicines Agency for RAYALDEE as a treatment for SHPT in chronic kidney disease patients. Vifor Fresenius is an ideal partner for RAYALDEE as they are a world-leading renal pharmaceutical company with a strong presence in Europe and other territories. We are also continuing with our plans to initiate a global Phase II clinical trial of a higher strength RAYALDEE in patients with stage five chronic kidney disease and Vitamin D insufficiency who require regular dialysis. We have finalized a regulatory strategy and trial design with our partners Vifor Fresenius and JT Torii and expect to initiate this study in the second quarter of this year. The Phase II study has a randomized dose ranging placebo control designed and will proceed in two successive cohorts, with the first expected to roll approximately 40 patients for six months of treatment, and the second to enroll more than 200 patients for up to 12 months of treatment. OPKO expects to share the costs of this study with its development partners. In addition to this Phase II study, we plan to augment our growing presence in the renal market with synergistic products that address other significant unmet needs. We plan to commence in the coming months a single dose Phase IIa clinical study with our NK-1 antagonist for uremic pruritus or hitching, which is a serious problem for more than half of the patients on dialysis. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of OPK88002 in the dialysis population. Turning now to our clinical pipeline candidates in metabolic and endocrinology diseases, we have a number of late-stage programs underway or nearing the initiation, that should reach important inflection points throughout this year. I'll begin with our long-acting human growth hormone product, hGH-CTP, which is partnered with Pfizer for worldwide commercialization. We have good momentum in patient enrollment in our global pediatric Phase III hGH-CTP study in growth hormone deficient or GHD children, which represents more than 80% of the GHD market. This is a pivotal non-inferiority study comparing a single weekly dose of hGH-CTP with daily injections of Genotropin it currently marketed growth hormone. The study uses pen device and formulation that will be launched commercially upon approval. The pediatric GHD subjects we treated weekly or 12 months. Last summer, we launched a pediatric hGH-CTP registration study in Japan to assess pharmacokinetics and compare efficacy of weekly hGH-CTP to daily Genotropin in 44 pre-pivotal hGH subjects. We expect to complete enrollment in both studies before the end of this year. Our Phase II open-label extension study continues without interruption with some patients now having been exposed to our hGH-CTP from more than three years which provides us with important long-term safety and efficacy data. Turning now to our progress with the adult hGH-CTP Phase III study. As you know, we completed a post-hoc sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of statistical outliers on the primary endpoint result using pre-planned analysis protocol. We have recently submitted a request for meeting with the FDA regarding the analysis of the efficacy and a safety data and any additional work required for a potential BLA submission in this indication. Let's turn now to OPK88004, our once-daily oral selective androgen receptor modulator or SARM, which we are developing for patients with benign prostate hypertrophy, also known as BPH or enlarged prostate and other urologic and metabolic condition. BPH affects one half of all men aged 51 to 60 and 90% of men over the age of 80. In November, we commenced our Phase IIb dose ranging study of OPK88004 to treat people with BPH. This trial is expected to enroll approximately 125 patients at the resides in the U.S., to identify appropriate doses given over four month period to reduce prostate size, the primary efficacy end point of the study. The study also assesses additional end points including blood PSA levels, lean body mass and fat mass. We expect to complete enrollment during the second half of this year. Our enthusiasm for this program is supported by pre-clinical data that demonstrated the ability of OPK88004 to reduce prostate size in animals and PSA levels in human trials. In addition, Phase II study of 350 elderly male subjects being studied for another indication utilizing OPK88004 showed a significant increase in lean body mass and muscle strength and significant fat mass reduction. The study also showed an acceptable safety profile to permit clinical development. We are excited to have initiated this Phase IIb study in men suffering from BPH as current treatment options such as alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors at undesired side effects. Surgical procedure to treat BPH are often associated with complications and lengthy recovery times. Let me now update you on our long acting Factor VIIa-CTP, for the treatment of bleeding episodes in hemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors to Factor VIII or Factor IX. The Phase IIa dose escalation study of the IV or intravenous formulation of Factor VIIa-CTP is nearing completion and are dosing in the Phase I dose escalate study of the subcutaneous formulation of Factor VIIa-CTP is completed and no serious safety event has been reported. Given the recent approvals of alternative therapies for hemophilia including Roche's monoclonal antibody ACE-910, we intend to further evaluate the commercial potential for our product including potential partnerships prior to initiating the next round of trials. Let's turn now to OPK88003, our once-weekly GLP1-Glucagon dual agonist for the treatment of type II diabetes and obesity. We are in the final stages for Phase IIb dose escalation study in prostate 110 type II diabetes patients. Enrollment is expected to commence in second quarter of this year and patients will be treated with the dose escalation regimen over three months to optimize the dose levels, to increase body weight loss, and reduce adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting. Patient will be treated for a total of 30 weeks in the study. The key primary endpoint will be HbA1c, a marker for blood glucose levels and secondary endpoint such as weight loss, lipid profile and safety will also be analyzed. Our decision to pursue OPK88003 is supported by data from our Phase II study with 420 diabetic patients that showed greater weight loss compared with the approved extended-release exenatide and placebo. In addition, the data also showed improvements in the lipid profile and similar reduction in HbA1c levels compared with the approved once-weekly product. Moving forward into 2018, we expect our investments in expanded marketing programs and clinical studies will result in continued revenue growth for RAYALDEE and [indiscernible]. We are advancing a robust clinical development program that addresses a number of large markets with great unmet need. Throughout 2018, we expect to make a meaningful progress with these programs and to achieve a number of important milestones. We look forward to appointing the new President for BioReference Lab and expected this new readership along with our ongoing investment in operational efficiency and continue grow the expansion allow us to return our laboratory business back to growth mode. We look forward to keep new price of our progress in all our businesses. With that overview, let me turn the call over to Adam for a discussion of our 2017 financial performance. Adam? Adam Logal Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. While we made substantial progress from the business initiatives that Steve discussed, our financial performance in the fourth quarter lagged behind our expectations and we face some unexpected items which I will provide additional color on shortly. I will also provide topline revenue guidance for BioReference and RAYALDEE to provide clarity on our expectations as we start the year. We closed 2017 with just over $91 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on our balance sheet with an additional $10 million of availability under our credit facilities. As we reported today, we also raised $55 million from existing shareholders in OPKO as Dr. Frost mentioned. The investment was in the form of convertible note with a five-year term, a conversion price of $5 per share and interest accruing at the rate of 5% per year payable at maturity or conversion. This additional funding provides us with the flexibility to accelerate the timing of our development programs, while cash flow from operations of BioReference improved. We continue to be mindful of our cash balance in investments into both our R&D pipeline and commercial activities to align with the anticipation of our improving cash flow from both BioReference and RAYALDEE, both of which remain important drivers of achieving a near-term breakeven point for cash flow from operations. Moving on to some of the challenges we faced during the fourth quarter of 2017. You will recall that we implemented a new billing system at the clinical lab portion of BioReference. As I mentioned last quarter, their early days of that implementation did not go as smoothly as we had anticipate. We worked aggressively on claims in the billing process. We were not as successful as we anticipated in cash collections. As we completed our review of the year became clear that we would not realize the cash collections on those early claims and as a result changed our estimates, which negatively affected our fourth quarter revenues. Our billing and sales teams have been working tirelessly to improve the collection rates in order to maximize the value of each requisition. We realized an approximate 225 basis point improvement on the amount of - collected on claims process in the fourth quarter of 2017 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2016, a significant improvement. Our total cash collection and at the speed at which we are getting paid greatly improved during the second half of the year and going forward we anticipate our DSO will be significantly improved compared to prior years. Also significantly and adversely impacting our fourth quarter results, over $73 million related to reimbursement adjustments on claims from commercial and federal payer programs. Turning to our pharmaceutical business, we recognized $9.1 million of revenue related to sales of RAYALDEE. Of the $9.1 million, $2.9 million related to revenue during the fourth - product shipped during the fourth quarter while the remaining $6.2 million related to revenues deferred through September 30, 2017. Moving to operating expenses, during the quarter, we continue to make investments in our pharmaceutical and diagnostics pipeline, which resulted in R&D expense of $34 million. In addition, our investment in the RAYALDEE commercial organization was $7.9 million during the fourth quarter. As Steve mentioned a few days ago, the team at TESARO announced the discontinuation of the IV formulation of VARUBI. As a result of this discontinuation, we recorded a non-cash impairment of $13.2 million reflecting a decline in the anticipated future cash flows from our royalty stream in VARUBI. Finally, income tax provision included a charge of approximately $31 million during the fourth quarter as a result of the recently passed Tax and Jobs Act. In addition, we recorded a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax asset that resulted in the total tax provision during the fourth quarter of $63 million compared to a $31 million income tax benefit for the comparable period of 2016. After considering these items, revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 totaled $193.7 million and our net loss was $213.9 million. The comparable period of 2016 had total revenues of $275 million and a net loss of $13.7 million during that period. Given all of the complexities we saw in 2017, I'm going to provide topline revenue guidance for BioReference and RAYALDEE. Before I do, I want to cover some changes to the accounting rules for revenue recognition, which will impact our overall revenue including our revenue of BioReference. At BioReference, we have historically had bad debt expense of approximately 10% to 11% of revenue recorded within SG&A expense. Under the accounting pronouncements that went into effect January 2018, bad debt for revenue from our services will move to net revenue, effectively reducing revenue and at the same time reducing SG&A expense by the same amount. This does not have an impact on our operating results as a whole, but will result in less net revenue recognized. This new accounting literature will have an impact on our other revenue streams as well, which I'll provide further clarifications on during our first quarter call. Under this new accounting, the first quarter of 2017s revenue from services will be recast in our results to be reflecting approximately $228 million compared to the $255 million recorded under the old accounting pronouncements. I wanted to provide that detail first to set the expectations clearly for BioReference's revenue for the first quarter of 2018 with the proper comparatives. For the first quarter of 2018 we are assuming volume growth of GeneDx, but a volume decline in our core clinical laboratory of approximately 3%. As such we anticipate revenue from services during the three months ended to March 31, 2018 to be in the range of $195 million to $215 million, which include the impact of volume fluctuations, the impact of PAMA and other reimbursement challenges we faced during 2017 as well as the accounting changes I previously mentioned. Moving to RAYALDEE, we anticipate first quarter revenues will be between $3.5 million and $5 million, which reflect a range of estimates to our gross to net calculations as well as our expectations for volume trends. In addition, we expect the first quarter operating expenses for our investments in R&D as well as the RAYALDEE commercial team to be approximately $35 million and $8 million respectively. We provide additional financial guidance as the year progresses. But now I'll turn the call back to Phil. Phil? Phillip Frost When I last spoke to after the third quarter report, I said we were determined to strengthen all elements of our Company. As to RAYALDEE sales are off to a slow start, but we've exerted great effort and although it's a bit early to be sure, sales seem to have begun a more rapid growth phase. We increase the size of our sales force from 35 to 64 as Steve mentioned, but more important, we find our message to physicians and trained our people to deliver it and a compelling way. As we speak we have a reality national sales meeting under way which we've introduced our new Sales Manager, Kurt Miller a terrific guy will play an active role an accelerating sales of RAYALDEE. The best-in-class medicine for secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic kidney disease. Before case court let us remains the most reliable predictor of serious prostate cancer in men with an elevated PSA and we expect and used to continue to expand hopefully in an accelerated pace. Our clinical development program is in high gear. Of course we can predict outcomes of trials, but the need for the products we're developing is great. They all have important market potential. Our BioReference unit is a valuable asset. 2017 was a year and which we invested an infrastructure made management changes. After the departure of his President as we said we began an active search process for his successor and we've already met with several candidates more than capable of taking BioReference to us next level of better performance. We hope to make a selection soon but in the meantime the business is being managed in a very positive way by a highly capable team of the department we are is working together with us it OPKO. OPKO is a unique company. Our management team has a history that extends back nearly two decades. A history that includes many successes, we're really proud of this history and we believe it's a firm foundation for building OPKO. With a gulf a diversified product platform with myriad possibilities, it's an exciting time in diagnostics, genomics and therapeutic medicine. It's an exciting time to be at OPKO. We've began 2018 on a strong flooding and we look forward to achieving value creating milestones that will position OPKO for continue growth in 2018 and beyond. With that, let's open the call to questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead with your question. Louise Chen Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. I had a few. So first question I had is, what is your strategic vision for OPKO and what do you think the market is missing about your story? Second thing is just on the gross margin in the fourth quarter, how should we think about that and how should we think about margins in 2018 based on what we saw in fourth quarter? And then you talk about you gave a guidance of $195 million to $215 million for BioReference Labs, but just curious if you could provide a bridge on how we get from the fourth quarter number to the first quarter 2018 number? Thanks. Phillip Frost I will take the vision part and I'll let my colleagues do the rest. Basically what we try to do is assemble valuable assets. These assets are in the form of products few of which are on the market and others that are underdeveloped. The thing they all have in common is that they have big potential. We can't be sure that they'll all be successful, but we don't need them all to be successful for us to have great results. Although there's no reason that those underdevelopment now won't be. BioReference is a great asset. We had envisioned that as a source of cash to help pay for the development program and we still believe that it will work out that way. In fact, we've taken quite a bit of cash out of BioReference over the time we've had it. So strategically it really was a pretty good move and the actual value that it has to this space, we believe as far an excess of what we paid for. I think this is what the investment community is missing. We are a company that's in the investment mode. And our results reflect that. RAYALDEE true was off to a slow start, but we have every confidence that it's going to pick up steam and move forward more rapidly. 4Kscore still has the potential for being one of the most important tests in the history of the diagnostics industry. We believe that. I think eventually the market will begin to understand this. Now for the specific questions… Adam Logal Yes. So on margins I think the way to think about is that most of this is going to be impacting net revenue, so the gross margins will come down as a result. Obviously, operating margins will remain consistent, but overall gross margin for BioReference is going to come down as we bring the topline net revenue number down because of those accounting changes. So I think if you just take that 10% of revenue you just knock that off of the gross margin figure. The bridge from our fourth quarter revenue to the range that I provided, we recorded about $148 million of revenue from services and we had $73 million impact on related to these payer adjustments. So that would give you an adjusted $221 million in that as we talked about that the reallocation of bad debt up to net revenue brings you into that that range that I had mentioned. Louise Chen Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question is from Yale Jen with Laidlaw. Please go ahead with your question. Yale Jen Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just follow-up with the earlier questions that the guidance for the first quarter $195 million to $215 million of quarterly revenue from the BioReference Lab. Could we analyze that figure to think that might be the sort of the annual revenue for 2018 or there is other consideration need to be put in? Adam Logal Yes. Yale, so we only provided first quarter guidance and I think we obviously as we are transitioning the leadership, I think we want to be cautious about looking too far ahead of ourselves, so that's why we provided that first quarter growth number. And I think if you look at the historical trends, you could probably come in with some reasonable estimates as you try to annualize that number. Yale Jen Okay. Thanks. And just another follow-up question here is that for the growth hormone, you mentioned in the script that the adult that you already completed a study, I mean analysis and you are in the process I guess try to speak with the FDA. Could you give us a little bit more color in terms of what the time line these discussion might take place as well as what the current status of the - taking recruitment for the children study or maybe some expectation in terms of when we will get some topline result from that study? Thanks. Phillip Frost So it's hard to tell, I mean - it's a multi-step process. We first asked FDA based upon that analysis we discussed before in essence to get their response to that form of analysis and their willingness to accept it and then to see what other steps that FDA would deem necessary for us to submit a BLA in the adult. So I can't really predict, give you a timeline on that. So it's in the hands of FDA at this point. We expect the placebo written response and then we will respond to that and ultimately it may results in a meeting, but a little bit up in the air. For pediatric, it's obviously one-year trial and it's blinded. So it depends when we complete enrollment. Enrollment momentum is going strong. We certainly expect to complete enrollment before the year end. How far before that? It just depends on a lot of factors. So you can just - we will announce completion of enrollment in the 12 months, but there will be no last patient administered drug and when we can get top on results will probably be a few months after that. Yale Jen So just sort of extrapolate from that that could potentially be late 2019 events in terms of topline data, if their recruitment is blinded. Phillip Frost That's correct. Yale Jen Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciated. Operator Our next question is from Eric Joseph with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Eric Joseph Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just looking for some additional color around sort of the one-time of the non-recurring reimbursement adjustment that you noted in fourth quarter. It sounds like these are unexpected, but I'm trying to get a sense of their potential. What gives you confidence in that? I guess making sure going forward and secondly, is it proper to think about some portion of these effects sort of being write-offs in terms of tax receipts? And also looking forward if you could give a little color around tax guidance as a result of tax reform? Thanks. Adam Logal Sure. I'll take the second one first. So I think, Eric we've got a number of different tax stream I think in a blended rate. It would likely be in the mid-teens in the out years, but certainly in the near-term, the majority of our income is being generated in the U.S. So we would be higher than that in the near-term. Obviously, we have a pretty significant tax asset on our books in the U.S. to offset that. So they get a fairly complicated assumption around there. Going to the $73 million, so yes we look - most of this is related to claims that were processed throughout 2017 and earlier. So we do feel as though that the receivables on our books and revenues that will record in the future will not be negatively impacted in a meaningful way going forward. So that $73 million is related to prior quarter's numbers. Eric Joseph Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Operator Our next question is from Kevin DeGeeter with Ladenburg. Please go ahead with your question. Kevin DeGeeter Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for take my questions. With regard to marketing around 4Kscore, can you just - company has been active with some direct-to-consumer activities. Can you just provide some metrics to help us appreciate, where you've been getting traction with that marketing spend and how that message maybe evolving through the course of 2018 to further accelerate volume growth? Phillip Frost Kevin, it's still early because as we started the TV ads as kind of a pilot task in the New York region and we obviously have an 800 number to try to track somewhere to calls up that and then we saw enough activity that we've launched them in Florida. We have a corresponding a directed digital advertising and web presence and we will increase some of that spend try to optimize who we are on the web this year, but it's still really committed to obviously I think the more attention and knowledge we get about the product and the more consumers themselves about it. I think it is a plus. It's hard for this early on in there in a process to give metrics on where they are being. Clearly, we think that's going to benefit significantly from the marketing effort but time will tell. Kevin DeGeeter Okay and on a separate note with regard to RAYALDEE, you mentioned the prepared comments, change the general selling message provided by the sales team? Can you just provide your updated thoughts with regard to right position for RAYALDEE in the market and in terms of how much of that was driven by data or incremental sort of kind of data how much of that was driven by feedback from clinicians in the field? Charlie Todd Hi, Kevin, this is Charlie. Thanks for your question. We do listen to the feedback from the field and we adjust their marketing and positioning strategies RAYALDEE accordingly and it is a learning process. We do find that positions greatly are attracted to the effective physiological characteristics of RAYALDEE and this is very consistent with the position that KDIGO guideline has taken that physiological treatment is probably preferred over pharmacological treatment with active vitamin D agents. So we emphasize the KDIGO guidelines and our messaging real so emphasized the data does show that reality very gradually raises 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the blood to correct vitamin D insufficiency and a correspondingly gradually lowers parathyroid hormone levels without having any significant clinically significant impact on side effects which are elevation of calcium and phosphorus. Kevin DeGeeter Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator Our next question is from Mike Petusky with Barrington Research. Please go ahead with your question. Michael Petusky Hi, guys. Adam I guess what are the current thoughts around EBITDA margin in BRL for 2018 or you know whatever think and that would helpful? Adam Logal Mike, so I think they're going to be in the first quarter, they are going to be compressed from the comparable period of last year and which we're in the 10% range. So I think will likely be below that with some of the volume declines that we've seen and we have put as we mentioned in his remarks we have put a number of cost control measures in place and we were working to reduce those costs, but what the volume decline in the fourth quarter we just didn't take enough cost steadily the organization to make up for that. But I do think once we stabilize the volume and return to growth will obviously be positioned to see that expand and accelerate. Michael Petusky Any kind of rough guidance for full-year? Adam Logal No, sorry. Not that I don't want to get ahead of myself in the spirit in this call. Michael Petusky I guess on the - and I understand it's really going, but you obviously processing something in New York, DTC that cause you say hey let's spend a little bit of money in Florida? Can you talk at all about incremental pick up that you saw in New York or what essentially made you decide we're going to go spend more money on this in and other like? Adam Logal It's really I mean to be frank with the sales of it and use of the product that has been growing already on a steady pace as you've probably seen in the positive quarter to quarter basis. But it's really the number of calls and clicks to our website that let us know that it was function. So I can't put a number that translates into additional sales but the amount of activity and interest around our product and the nature subject matter of the calls let us know that people are paying attention and trying to learn and you can't help but think that that's going to ultimately translate into further growth, that's what triggered it. Michael Petusky So I think you would said on that but you thought you spend in New York three months would be under $1 billion that's not how it came in roughly? Adam Logal Yes, it's actually TV right now it is quite inexpensively but I was actually a little more expense to optimize your praises on the Internet than it is to advertise on TV. Michael Petusky So came in under and what do you expecting with them DTC on 4Kscore or any kind of guidance around that if it continues to seem to produce results? Adam Logal We don't expect to get and that's it'll be proportional to sales. So sales bump up will spend more but we won't - we're going to be prudent so far and again the TV ads are quite inexpensive. So we'll start with smaller steps and see where grows and as growth justify that increase to spend I can't - right now I wouldn't depends when a higher number than we could get to last year. Michael Petusky All right. The last question on that are you continuing to run at the New York and shifted resource in Florida? Adam Logal So the ones in New York cab ended so and the ones right now one in Florida then will revisit growing our perhaps even on a broader platform. Phillip Frost It's really as Steve said a pilot operation to get our systems for responding critically the back end to make sure that we realize that most revenue from the effort. Michael Petusky Okay. All right. And then I guess just last question that went from 35 or 64 rep I actually had it know from last quarter that was up 71 did I get that wrong few months ago or just you guys let's some reps go? Phillip Frost Yes, so it's the 71 is inclusive of the regional business managers as well so they entire sales organization is that 71 versus before field reps. Michael Petusky Okay. All right, terrific. Thanks. Operator There are no further questions at this time. Dr. Frost, please proceed with your closing remarks at this time. Phillip Frost I think that it ends our session and we want to thank everybody for participating. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."", 'New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Wednesday that Alberto Carvalho would be the new leader of the city’s schools. It seemed like a done deal ― until Carvalho backed out on live television the next day. The de Blasio administration starting looking for someone to fill the position of city schools chancellor when Carmen Fariña announced in December that she would be stepping down. Carvalho, who is currently superintendent of schools for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, is largely seen as a rising star in education. De Blasio’s decision to tap him was widely praised. But Carvalho has had a change of heart, he said Thursday at a televised meeting with the School Board of Miami-Dade County. The first three hours of the meeting had been dedicated to board members and community members making emotional pleas for Carvalho to stay. Carvalho said the promise he had made to the children of Miami was more important than his agreement with de Blasio’s administration. “I underestimated the emotional tug, the level of commitment, the power that crying members of the community have had on me,” he said. “Madam Chair, against probably my personal best interest, I am making a decision and announcing a decision today.

Bezos, 54, who founded and runs Amazon.com, an online shopping business based in Seattle, topped Forbes’ 2018 list with the first 12-figure net worth ever reported by the business publication’s popular annual billionaires’ ranking — a near-incomprehensible $112 billion. That’s after his net worth leapt more than $39 billion in a single year, according to Forbes’ estimates. He also owns the Washington Post, and Amazon last year acquired Whole Foods in a $13.7 billion merger. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. Microsoft co-founder Gates, ranked as the world’s richest human for 18 of the past 24 years, lagged well behind at number two with a mere $90 billion. At number three was avuncular Midwestern billionaire Warren Buffett, worth $84 billion. Both saw their net worth rise over last year, according to Forbes, which estimates the value of the assets of the world’s wealthiest inhabitants to come up with the list. One “notable loser,” according to the magazine: U.S. President Donald Trump, whose fortune dropped by $400 million to $3.1 billion. He’s now ranked at number 766, compared to 544 last year. Overall, it was a very good year to be filthy rich. Forbes recognized a record 2,208 billionaires from 72 countries and territories worth a cumulative $9.1 trillion, up 18% since last year. The average net worth on the list is $4.1 billion, also a record. Some other part- and full-time South Florida residents also made the list, as well as some with significant local business connections. SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son of Japan, a new investor in retired soccer star David Beckham’s Miami football team, was the richest of those, at number 39 on the list, with $22.7 billion. Then came Len Blavatnik, a partner in the Faena District in Miami Beach, at 48 with $20.2 billion. New York developer Steven Ross, owner of the Miami Dolphins, was No. 205 with $7.6 billion. Another pro sports team owner also made the list again: The Miami Heat’s Micky Arison’s net worth of $9.7 billion put him at No. 154. Other Miamians: Miami Beach hedge-fund manager David Tepper came in at No. 138 with $11 billion. Airline magnate Rakesh Gangwal was at No. 703 with $3.3 billion. Developer Jorge Perez sat at 791 with $3 billion. Philanthropist and medical entrepreneur Phillip Frost came in at 924 with $2.6 billion. Auto-dealer magnate Norman Braman was tied at 965 with numerous others with $2.5 billion. Some other South Floridians on the list were: ▪ 372. Robert Rich, Jr., Islamorada, frozen foods, $5.2 billion. ▪ 588. Jeff Greene, Palm Beach, real estate and investments, $3.8 billion ▪ 606. Nick Caporella, Plantation, beverages, $3.7 billion. ▪ 703. George Lindemann, Palm Beach, investments, $3.3 billion. ▪ 859. H. Wayne Huizenga, Fort Lauderdale, investments, $2.8 billion.

They’re full of life. When Nina Simone released “Mississippi Goddam” in 1964, the Alabama she sang about was, specifically, Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church — the church that became a rallying point for the Civil Rights Movement, the church nearly destroyed by fifteen sticks of dynamite planted by four Ku Klux Klansmen. Four girls, none older than 14, were killed in the explosion. 22 other people were injured. It was September 15, 1963, just 11 days after schools in Birmingham started the process of racial integration for the first time. The truth is that the deaths of Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson, and Carol Denise McNair were not the beginning or the end of a violent movement against their right to exist — merely its midpoint. The murder of innocent black children and adults didn’t start that day, and didn’t end either — not even in churches, not even later that day, when two boys, 16-year-old Johnny Robinson and 13-year-old Virgil Ware, were shot in Birmingham. As a child, photographer (and MacArthur “Genius Grant” winner) Dawoud Bey pored over Lorraine Hansberry’s book The Movement: Documentary of a Struggle for Equality; a photograph of an injured survivor of the bombing — Sarah Collins, whose sister was killed — seared itself on his memory. It would later become the impetus for The Birmingham Project, Bey’s 2013 commemoration of the tragedy’s 50th anniversary. Bey’s black-and-white portraits — presented as thirteen diptychs — show children the same age as the four girls and two boys who died in 1963, alongside adults who, in 2013, were the same age that the kids would have been. The subjects are Birmingham residents, and many of the adults were close to the bombing in some way: some lived nearby, or knew a victim; all remember it. The Birmingham Project debuted with an accompanying video at the Birmingham Museum of Art (where about half the photos were taken; the other half were snapped at the 16th Street Baptist Church), and is currently on view at The Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum-Florida International University. Even without the video, the photographs are striking. They’re nearly life-sized, and have a plain quality (stoic faces, straightforward poses) that engenders an equally plain acknowledgment: they’re alive. For all our human suffering and pleasure, we’re never more alive, perhaps, than when we’re just sitting, a little bored. You can really feel this in the images of the children, who have the kind of pubescent awkwardness that’s never charming to oneself, only to everyone else, and the effect is painful. It hurts because those Birmingham girls, often commemorated in what look like class portraits, could have been goofy, self-conscious, bookish, or disobedient. Maybe they didn’t even want to go to church that day; maybe one had a sore throat. They were kids. So are Bey’s sitters: A teenaged subject named Matthew Lundy is handsome, but hasn’t quite grown into his own head yet; a bespectacled girl named Faith Speights and a pouty-mouthed boy named Tyler Collins both still look like babies. Bey is an excellent portraitist, nuanced enough to make every detail striking — bracelets, hats, the church’s preternatural light — even in reference to the subjects’ already compelling faces. The adults seem regal or, next to the kids, supremely comfortable in their own bodies. Think of the lives the victims could’ve had, they seem to say, if they’d had the opportunity to live. Maybe they, too, would’ve had time for their hair to gray and their gazes to soften. I think of Trayvon Martin, who wanted to be an aeronautical engineer, who didn’t have a chance to change his mind about it, whose life was valuable even if he’d grown up into something else. Tamir Rice liked toy pellet guns and, maybe one day, would’ve found them boring. The Birmingham victims “exist largely in small photographs or in the imagination,” Bey said in an interview about the project. “It’s a very different … somewhat abstract experience from actually seeing a young person who’s 11 years old.” Post-tragedy, the dead become timeless, and it takes imagination to remember their unlived lives. Bey is imaginative, and knows his subjects are too — that they live in the aftermath, but shouldn’t have to. Ironically, through his empathetic images, the children lost on September 15th are no longer images: they’re part of a community that includes these subjects, who look back at us, their own passages through time made permanent. They are not displayed in memoriam. They’re full of life. Dawoud Bey: The Birmingham Project continues at The Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University (10975 SW 17th St, Miami) until March 18. Protesters and activists promise to continue to stage the Anti-Columbus Day Tour until the museum corrects the displays.

Greene said in the statement. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond.” Schupf is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s board of governors and served as a college trustee for many years. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” Schupf said in the statement. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped on board immediately. The donation of the Paul J.

The project will feature new and renovated space to support leading programs in visual arts, theater, film and arts education. The larger complex will include the Waterville Opera House, Common Street Arts, the Maine Film Center and the cinema. It is expected to attract even more visitors to Main Street, anchored by a hotel Colby plans to build a block from Castonguay Square and Colby’s Bill and Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, which is expected to house 200 Colby students, faculty and staff at 150 Main St. Colby also bought and renovated 173 Main St. across the street from the Commons.

The former Waterville Savings Bank building houses software consultant CGI Group, Colby employees, and a student business incubator. The Colby College Museum of Art was founded in 1959 and comprises five wings, more than 9,000 works of art, and more than 38,000 square feet of exhibition space. The museum also maintains a significant collection of contemporary American art, including more than 900 works by Alex Katz, as well as works by Agnes Martin, Sol LeWitt, Maya Lin, Kara Walker, Elizabeth Murray, Martin Puryear, Terry Winters and Julie Mehretu.

Schupf, LL.D. ’06, the Colby College Museum of Art will expand into downtown Waterville, offering the community and visitors a chance to engage with spectacular works in a vibrant setting. The contemporary gallery will be named in his honor. As part of the downtown arts complex announced earlier this week by Colby and Waterville Creates!, the Schupf gallery will be located in a transformed historical building at 93 Main Street. Located on the ground level, it will feature a rotating program of contemporary art exhibitions. Regularly scheduled gallery events will be held in the space. “The Schupf gallery will be a vital part of the new center for contemporary art and film, which has been conceived to create a hub of activity on Main Street and cement Waterville’s place as a destination for the arts,” said Colby President David A. Greene. “Once again, Paul Schupf has given so generously to help make art accessible to the Waterville community and visitors from Maine and beyond. We are so fortunate to have his friendship and to benefit from his vision for institutions that serve the public good.” Schupf, who is an emeritus member of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors and served as a College trustee for many years, has made several significant contributions to Colby, making possible the Paul J. Schupf Wing for the Works of Alex Katz and the Paul J. Schupf Sculpture Court at the Colby College Museum of Art; the Paul J. Schupf Scientific Computing Center; the Anthony-Mitchell-Schupf residence hall; and the Colby College-Memorial Sloan Kettering Summer Internship. A serious collector, Schupf has also donated numerous works of art, including significant works by Alex Katz and a major gift of more than 150 works on paper by Richard Serra. “Starting in 1985 with President Bill Cotter and museum director Hugh J. Gourley III, I became entranced by the wonderful, adventurous Colby College Museum of Art,” said Schupf. “When David Greene discussed with me the possibility of creating a gallery in Waterville, I jumped onboard immediately. The donation of the Paul J. Schupf gallery for contemporary art in downtown Waterville is just another manifestation of my admiration for the College and its museum.” “Paul has been such a great friend to the Colby museum, and once again we are humbled by, and grateful for, his remarkable generosity,” said Sharon Corwin, the Carolyn Muzzy Director and Chief Curator of the museum. “We see this gallery as a front door to the Colby museum and an opportunity to integrate more deeply into our community, and Paul’s support makes that possible.” On March 5 Colby and Waterville Creates! announced plans to transform the downtown building into a new center for contemporary art and film, making Waterville a singular destination for the arts in Maine.

Sandy,Maisel,['http://colbyechonews.com/6906-2/'],b'831',"[""In the September faculty meeting, Provost Margaret McFadden made a brief reference to the existence of ‘the Two Colbys, a term that faculty at the meeting seemed familiar with. Following interviews with faculty and administrators, the Echo has discovered that this concept, little known among students, has been pervasive in faculty conversations for many years. Most students are not familiar with the phrase. Many students the Echo spoke with had differing theories about what it implies. Lily LaMarre ’18 said, “I actually don’t know. To me, that makes me think of being a member of the Colby community as a student, and then again as an alumnus, or something like that.” Kiernan Somers ’17, a recent graduate, also voiced his thoughts, telling the Echo that “from an alumni perspective, the Two Colbys seem like a divide between the opinion of students and the actions of the administration.” McFadden defines the Two Colbys as the idea that “students are very diligent and very hardworking on a nine to five basis, but then on some evenings, or on the weekends, that it’s very much a party-hard place. I’ve had students say to me something like ‘the people you meet in your classroom are not the same people we meet at a party on Saturday night.’ There’s this sense that there are two aspects to Colby culture, this very ambitious achievement oriented culture, and then this how we cut loose, if you will.” The work hard, play hard mentality is almost a given on college campuses, but it seems to have become a point of contention on the Hill in recent years. Dean of the College Karlene Burrell-McRae ’94 echoed this interpretation of the phrase, saying that this has been her understanding since she became a member of the administration and during her time on the Board of Trustees. She says that some students have two sides to themselves: one the academic and diligent student, another committing dorm damage and engaging in harmful drinking behavior. She does not recall the Two Colbys being a part of the college lexicon during her time as a student, she suggested that this has become a persistent issue in Colby’s recent history. McFadden mentioned that she was surprised to learn that students were not familiar with the term, as she believes faculty and staff picked it up from the student discourse several years ago. Assistant Professor of English Aaron Hanlon also spoke with the Echo about his perception of the Two Colbys. “I think there is a desire from everybody for the culture at Colby to be a wider intellectual culture that carries beyond the classroom and one that’s inclusive for people who might want to get together to socialize and talk about ideas, not super intense or academic necessarily, but that are meaningful to them as they develop as human beings.” Hanlon points out that if Colby’s social culture is rooted in getting drunk, as students have discussed openly with faculty and staff, “the question is what is being done and is that actually cutting into the social space that would help to develop this intellectual culture.“ Hanlon supports the idea that the basis of a liberal arts college is founded in the intellectual, even if people are still drinking and going out, “that it’s also in the spirit of not I want to forget about the stuff that I’m learning, but let’s hang out and talk about stuff, and if there’s alcohol involved, then great.” Hanlon addressed the lack of attendance at academic events at Colby; acknowledging that it could be because of how overscheduled the student community is, but also argues that campus culture needs to encourage students to seek events and guest speakers out independently. Hanlon is a member of Colby’s faculty in residence program and lives in Williams dormitory. He believes that the faculty in residence program can contribute to promoting a more robust intellectual culture on campus and fighting the perception of the “Two Colbys”. To this end, he hosts both organized and informal events, such as study breaks, movies and TV shows, and collaborations with the Williams CA on events such as smoothie making. He also points to joining some of his residents on the Waterville March for Racial Justice, which offered the chance to “walk with a few students into town and talk and get to know each other.” Goldfarb Family Distinguished Professor of American Government Sandy Maisel reiterated this; he lived on campus as a faculty in residence in Mary Low with his two young sons for several years. He and his sons ate in the dining halls, and he highlights that his sons had the run of the campus and viewed it as home. During his first few years on campus, “all apartment style spaces on campus were faculty, and many of them were senior faculty,” referencing a dean of faculty who lived in heights, among others. Maisel believes that faculty are the most effective choices for College housing employees. Ten years ago, staff were placed in on campus housing to mitigate housing costs, and he believes that “that was a mistake.” Maisel highlights the importance of building the faculty-student relationship through shared housing. “My presence there made a difference… faculty make a huge difference.” He points out that Colby will circle back to this policy in the next few years, especially with the introduction of faculty and staff living in the downtown dorms. Maisel defines the Two Colbys as: “We have these students that are in our classes that we think are wonderful and they are smart and work very hard, and then they go off at night and do crazy things and some are irresponsible.” He continued, saying “there are Colby students who work very hard and who play very hard and irresponsibly.” Maisel believes that it is a “day-to-night” issue, not one rooted in a divide between students who are active in classes and do not make poor decisions, and students that don’t participate in the classroom and then are the main perpetrators of dorm damage and drinking culture. Maisel points to students he believes are in underground fraternities as an example of this. “Kids that are in the underground fraternities are very much engaged in the classroom and you can’t believe they’re doing this. For me, [it is the fact] that you are being absolutely dishonest to the people right in front of you.” Maisel also discussed the culture of secrecy surrounding drinking culture and dorm damage, saying that students who want to report the perpetrators of dorm damage do not because they fear ostracization and social retribution for coming forward. “I think faculty being around is part of solving [the problem]. I think frankly, the maturing of the student body is part of solving it.” Maisel also argues that being open and honest about the issue is crucial, especially encouraging faculty to talk in their classes about making healthy choices around events like Doghead and Loudness contributes to this shift on campus. Hanlon, Maisel, McFadden and Burrell-McRae all agree that encouraging more faculty to live on campus alongside their students is an important step in reducing the division between the Two Colbys. This is seen in more apartments for faculty, faculty apartments downtown, and the introduction of a faculty associate program. This is reflected in the campus climate survey as well. The CCCAC survey provided significant insight into a multitude of issues that exist at Colby, including the Two Colbys and the divide between academic culture and social culture on the Hill. The survey revealed that faculty engagement, admiration and student-faculty relationships are high, but issues on intellectual engagement and feeling comfortable in Colby’s social scene were revealed. McFadden points out that the survey has translated anecdotal stories into real data. The campus climate survey plays an important role in understanding how the College interprets the Two Colbys and how it manifests itself in the community. Conversation is key to solving this issue, Burrell-McRae said, “what we wanted to do is show a lot of what the community had suggested or recommended the year before I came in the Task Force report,” and that the College is acting on these recommendations. Burrell-McRae admits that drinking culture and in some cases, drug culture, add to the lack of intellectual culture and negative weekend experiences. McFadden and Burrell-McRae called attention to that idea that many students don’t want to participate in drinking culture or are moderate in their participation, and that there is a narrative among students that because of Colby’s location in central Maine, there is not a lot to do apart from drinking. McFadden refutes this, pointing to several drinking alternatives. For students who do not view this as fun, they struggle with social acceptance and finding and enjoying the programming provided to them. Burrell-McRae has made a concerted effort to add a wider variety of activities for students for weekend nights. Burrell-McRae commented that since her arrival to Colby, many students have approached her about the underground fraternities and their concerns. Burrell-McRae said it is something that the community needs to talk about, but states that “I don’t know if it is real or myth, but certainly there are many students that feel [underground fraternities] are a driving force” in campus culture. She also adds that she has had encounters with students because “they have a look that others perceive to be a fraternity look” and are believed to be active in those organizations, despite being vehemently against underground fraternities at Colby. The Two Colbys is nothing new; Maisel has worked at Colby for 47 years, and he argues that the Two Colbys have been around since he started. “I think it’s been there for a long time. I’ve seen some very good friends in the seventies who worked hard and they played hard.” Additionally, Two Colbys is not limited to a lack of intellectual culture outside of the classrooms. Based on the differing opinions and experiences of students, faculty, and staff, the phrase Two Colbys has many meanings and speaks to the duplicity that campus culture at Colby can often represent.

AUGUSTA — In his final year as governor, Republican Paul LePage has reflected often on what he has and has not done. This week, he told the Associated Press, “Of the things I’ve campaigned on, I would say I’m the only governor that’s ever done what he said he’s going to do.” Not surprisingly, some would disagree, including at times the governor himself. But even some of his foes acknowledge there is some truth to the claim. Democrat Diane Russell, a former state representative who hopes to succeed LePage, said the governor “has achieved much of what he campaigned on – and that’s the problem.” Few would argue that LePage has not tried to cut taxes, restore fiscal stability, reduce regulation and generally pare the size and scope of state government. He has done better in some areas than others. As recently as December, LePage said he “tried so hard” on some key issues – energy, taxes and regulation – but fell short of what he wanted to do. Sen. Eric Brakey, an Auburn Republican who is running for the U.S. Senate, said LePage “has provided for Maine what is sadly so often lacking in elected official across the country: straight talk and principled leadership.” “Even his detractors concede that he is man of his word,” Brakey said. “He stands in rare company, and I am proud to call him a friend.” But others say LePage’s words are just part of the picture. “Like most politicians, Gov. LePage tends to pick and choose facts carefully. No one knows what many of our past governors have promised, nor what they have succeeded in delivering, so no one can fact check the governor on that,” said L. Sandy Maisel, a government professor at Colby College in Waterville. Besides, Maisel said, no governor can “do on a whim all that he would like.” That said, “no one should be surprised by some of the directions he has taken. He promised a socially conservative, pro-business, anti-those-with-needs-that-the-state-is-serving administration, and he has delivered that,” Maisel said. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Adam Cote said the governor has not delivered on all of his promises. “The fundamental promise Gov. LePage made repeatedly to Maine people was, ‘I am a job creator who knows how to grow Maine’s economy.’ ” Cote said. “All personality points aside, the fundamental fact, seven-plus years later, is he has not gotten the job done. “Maine lags New England and the country when it comes to job, income and economic growth. And rural Maine has been hit the hardest.” Sen. Mark Dion, a Portland Democrat running for governor, said LePage’s claims that he is the only governor to accomplish what he promised does not stand up to scrutiny. “As governor, Paul LePage has not kept his word, and has often done the opposite of his own stated goals,” Dion said. Dion cited LePage issuing bonds that he once challenged, and not delivering on a repeated pledge to oversee “the most-transparent” administration in Maine’s history. “He routinely denies public information to legislative committees, and refuses to let his commissioners meet with lawmakers to discuss their budget requests,” Dion said. “The people’s representatives don’t have access to the basic information needed to do their jobs.” Betsy Sweet, another Democrat running for LePage’s job, said that “for the things that the governor believes he has accomplished, he has done so by tearing at the very fabric of democracy,” and eroding the faith people have in democracy. “He has insisted that it be his way or the highway, and has done so by name-calling, overturning the will of the voters, refusing to allow his commissioners to participate in the democratic process and berating the Legislature,” Sweet said. Garrett Murch, communications and political director for the Maine Republican Party said LePage has done what he said he’d do. “Many people don’t like our governor and take cheap shots at him, but that doesn’t change the plain fact he didn’t just talk the talk, he walked the walk,” Murch said. “Whether it was reforming welfare to spend limited resources on those in need, defending the Second Amendment, reducing Mainers’ tax burdens or eliminating harmful government regulations, Gov. LePage fought hard for the policy platform he ran on and, amazingly, he achieved much of it, even as some of it was obstructed by Democrats.” “In modern Maine history, which governors have delivered more on their campaign promises?” Promises kept or not, LePage has not done his job, many Democrats say. Sweet said that LePage will not talk “about the things he didn’t campaign on,” such as leaving Maine with “increased child poverty and hunger, a stalled economy with the lowest growth rate in New England and more people uninsured than before.” Russell agreed, saying: “While he’s been busy pushing Mainers into poverty, I’ve been building a cannabis economy that’s created hundreds of new jobs, and working to change the election system to put power back into the hands of the people. “But, yeah, congratulations to LePage on his legacy of bankrupting the economy.” Send questions/comments to the editors.

In his first game back from injury last year, he totaled just one catch for 10 yards on four targets, so they seemingly eased him back in. Pass catchers with foot injuries simply don't work together and we've seen it time and time again. Olsen has said that he'll need offseason surgery for the fracture in his foot, which tells me there's still an issue and re-injury is very likely. Because of that, it's going to be very difficult to recommend him until we see him make it through a full game. Washington hasn't been a defense to target with tight ends this year, anyway. They've yet to allow a single tight end score more than 11.6 PPR points and they've played against Jack Doyle/Eric Ebron, Jimmy Graham, Ricky Seals-Jones, and Ben Watson. Keep Olsen on the bench if possible. As long as Olsen practices in full, I'm starting him. Tight ends are just too shallow in fantasy not to. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com"", 'There are currently no notes for this player. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com', ""Evans fared far better with Ryan Fitzpatrick last month than he did with Jameis Winston at the helm last year. Yet there's tantalizing upside against a Falcons defense that has yielded the fifth-most fantasy points per game to opposing wideouts. They've yielded at least one 100-yard pass-catcher in each of the last four games and 10 touchdowns exclusively to receivers in five games. He's a strong candidate to add his name to both lists. The Falcons are just 28th against fantasy wide receivers, Evans is a WR1 coming off his bye in a great matchup.

The fifth named storm of the season would bring a “very windy” spell to the UK on Tuesday night and Wednesday, forecasters said. The Met Office issued several national severe weather warnings because of the potential for travel disruption. Coastal roads and properties along Britain’s western and southern coasts were vulnerable to high waves throwing beach material on to seafronts, forecasters warned. The Met Office’s chief forecaster, Paul Gundersen, said: “The unsettled theme continues throughout this week, with further spells of rain moving across the UK from the west as many return to work on Tuesday and there will again be some snow over the high ground in Scotland. “The wind will pick up again later on Tuesday and Wednesday as developing Storm Eleanor heads towards the UK and Ireland.” The Environment Agency warned previously that strong winds and high tides could bring coastal flooding from Tuesday until Thursday. Carol Holt, the Environment Agency’s flood duty manager, said: “We urge people to stay safe on the coast – take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades, and don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger trying to take ‘storm selfies’. “If you’re travelling please check your route before setting off and don’t drive through flood water.” An amber weather warning has been issued for between 6pm on Tuesday and 8am on Wednesday for north-eastern and western England, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. Gusts of 60-70mph were likely, while some western coastal areas could experience 80mph winds. The Met Office’s deputy chief forecaster, Dan Harris, said there could be a return of colder conditions next weekend, with a risk of frost, ice and wintry conditions, particularly in the north. “It could remain more unsettled in the south. The details of the forecast later this week and into the weekend are extremely uncertain at this stage, so my advice is to keep up to date with the latest forecasts as confidence will increase later in the week,” he said.', 'The Met Office predicts that severe wind and rain could disrupt the first of the year\'s commuter traffic as people are warned not to endanger themselves taking \'storm selfies\' Weather warnings, rain and and gale-force winds will herald the end of the Christmas holidays as Brits return to work on Tuesday. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning and predicts that low pressure systems could cause disruption to the first of the year\'s commuter traffic. And the Environment\'s Agency has urged people not to take storm selfies which could put them in unnecessary danger during severe weather conditions. A yellow weather warning has been issued for between 6pm on Tuesday and 8am on Wednesday for north east and west England, northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The warning predicts gales with gusts of 60 to 70mph are likely, while some western coastal areas have a chance of seeing gusts of up to 80mph. Andy Page, the Met Office\'s chief forecaster, said: ""The unsettled theme continues throughout this week, with further spells of rain moving across the UK from the west as many return to work on Tuesday and there will again be some snow over the high ground in Scotland. ""The wind will pick up again later on Tuesday and Wednesday is expected to be very windy across England and Wales, with gales or severe gales in places and national severe weather warnings have been issued for these strong winds. ""The gales, combined with locally thundery downpours, may make driving difficult and cause some disruption."" A second yellow weather warning for high winds is in place from just after midnight to 10pm on Wednesday, covering the same areas as the previous day, plus the Midlands, the east of England, London, the south east and the South West and Wales. The fresh warnings come just a day after Storm Dylan lashed parts of Ireland and Wales with howling gales in excess of 70mph and squally rain for a wet and windy New Year\'s Eve. Carol Holt, the Environment\'s Agency\'s flood duty manager, said the predicted strong winds and potential large waves, combined with high tides, could lead to some coastal flooding from Tuesday until Thursday. She said the agency\'s frontline teams would be out checking defences and may close coastal flood gates. ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast - take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades and don\'t put yourself in unnecessary danger trying to take storm selfies,"" she said. ""If you\'re travelling, please check your route before setting off and don\'t drive through flood water."" The Met Office said the unsettled weather was likely to continue throughout the rest of the week, with further bouts of wet and windy weather interspersed with brighter, showery periods, expected. Deputy chief forecaster Dan Harris added that next weekend could bring a return of colder conditions with a risk of frost, ice and wintry conditions, particularly in the north. He said: ""It could remain more unsettled in the south. ""The details of the forecast later this week and into the weekend are extremely uncertain at this stage, so my advice is to keep up to date with the latest forecasts as confidence will increase later in the week."" On Tuesday, the Met Office also warn that there may be some mist in northern areas during the morning. Tuesday is set to be mostly cloudy after a bright start in the east of England but rain in the west will spread to most areas by midday with snow on Scottish hills. It will be briefly drier in south and west before more rain sweeps in later on. On Tuesday night, showers or longer spells of rain are forecast for most of the UK with thundery showers likely in western areas and sleet or snow across the hills of Scotland. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said conditions around the coast were likely to be ""very dangerous"" over the next few days with an increased risk of flooding, particularly on the south east coastline around Monmouth and Newport, coastal areas in Swansea and Carmarthenshire and the entire North Wales coastline. The environment body said the first high tides were expected on the South Wales coast at around 7pm on Tuesday and at 11pm in North Wales and that the risk would also apply to the Wednesday morning and evening high tides. Ceri Jones said NRW would be keeping an eye on the situation, with staff on the ground in vulnerable areas, and added: ""Our advice is to keep at a safe distance from the coast, and from piers and promenades which will be particularly exposed. ""Large waves could overtop defences and throw up debris - this could easily cause injury or knock you off your feet.""', ""JavaScript is not enabled on this browser For the best viewing experience of this website, JavaScript should be enabled.

There may be snow at times across northern areas, especially Scotland, as well as ice at night between the wet spells. Looking ahead to the weekend Deputy Chief Forecaster Dan Harris added: “Later in the week and over the weekend there are signs of a trend to colder conditions, especially in the north, with clearer skies for many and a return of the risk of frost, ice and wintry showers. It could remain more unsettled in the south.

Harris is the co-anchor of ABC News\' ""Nightline"" and the weekend edition of ""Good Morning America,"". After covering the religion beat for ABC News, he discovered meditation and wrote the bestselling book 10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works--A True Story. He has been honored several times for his journalistic contributions. He received an Edward R. Murrow Award for his reporting on a young Iraqi man who received the help he needed in order to move to America, and in 2009 won an Emmy Award for his ""Nightline"" report, ""How to Buy a Child in Ten Hours."" Dan Schawbel: After writing 10% Happier, why did you decide to focus specifically on meditation for this book? Dan Harris: In many ways, this new book is an attempt to fix a mistake I made with my first book. I naïvely assumed that anybody who read 10% happier would start meditating. What I underestimated is how hard it is for people to adopt healthy habits. We did not evolve for long term health planning. Evolution bequeathed us a mind that is really good at threat detection and finding food and sexual partners. That’s because evolution doesn’t care about your long-term health; it cares about getting your DNA into future generations. After the book came out, the above became quite clear to me. I realized that while people might be reading the book, that didn’t mean they were actually meditating. The first thing I did was to start a company, also called 10% Happier, which teaches people how to meditate through an app. We have recruited many of the best meditation teachers and scientists to deliver short, entertaining, practical meditation lessons. Working at this company give me a front row seat at the rich pageant of human neuroses that prevent people from adopting this simple habit that is manifestly beneficial. Which gave me the idea for this new book, which systematically taxonomizes and tackles all of the obstacles to meditation. For fun, we structured the book as a gonzo road trip across the country. Schawbel: How has meditation affected you on both a personal and professional level? Harris: It’s not a miracle cure. I retain the capacity to be a moron. But I’m significantly less of a moron than I used to be – and I am also better at apologizing. Professionally, I think meditation has been a huge boon. It has boosted my focus and productivity while also making me less emotionally reactive. I think it has also made me calmer, more patient and generally easier to be around. In fact, I believe kindness is the most underrated professional asset in the world. Schawbel: Many organizations, like Google, have meditation rooms at their facilities. Why do you think this trend has started and how can employees best use those rooms effectively? Harris: I believe there’s a one word explantation for why meditation is taking off in the corporate world: science. There is a growing body of scientific evidence that strongly suggests meditation can provide a long list of tantalizing health benefits, from lowering blood pressure to literally rewiring key parts of the brain that regulate focus and self-awareness. The best way to use the proliferating corporate meditation rooms is simply to use them. Period. The hardest part about meditation is getting started. A great motto I’ve heard is, “just put your body there.“ Meaning, just get your ass on the meditation chair – even if it’s just for a minute. And really, a minute does actually count! Schawbel: How can technology be a hindrance, or beneficial, to the meditation process? What are other obstacles that get in the way of meditation? Harris: One of the major drivers of the widespread adoption of meditation in our society these days is that people feel – justifiably – totally frazzled because of the attentional demands of technology. We are bombarded by texts, tweets, and status updates. I love the idea that we can co-opt the engines of our distraction – our phones – and turn them into vehicles for Mindfulness. That’s why I’m so proud of the 10% happier app. Schawbel: What are your top three pieces of career advice? Harris: I\'m a partner and research director at Future Workplace, an executive development firm dedicated to rethinking and reimagining the workplace. I also wrote the New York Times bestselling book, Promote Yourself, and Me 2.0. In 2012, I was named to the Forbes Magazine 30 Under...

There are times when everything seems to be breaking right, and you’ve established that perfect mix of veteran talent and young up-and-comers that should allow you to field a competitive team for the foreseeable future. But there are other times when your team’s immediate future is bleak. Your solid veterans have aged overnight, and your young guns haven’t panned out the way you thought. And when you reach that point – when it’s clear that it’s time to go into rebuilding mode – then you need to consider unloading some of your more established players and acquiring draft picks. The basic premise of the strategy is probably easy enough to understand. You’re dealing players who can contribute immediately to other teams for draft picks that should hopefully allow you to bulk up your roster and set you up for success a year or two down the road. But there are several considerations to take into account when looking to acquire draft picks in a dynasty league, and you should be aware of them before setting out on what is a pretty drastic course of roster reconstruction. Get a free $3 Best Ball entry into a 2018 DRAFT contest with your first deposit >> The earlier you look to trade, the better The NFL has done a remarkable job of staying relevant all year long. Between free agency, offseason trades, training camp, and the preseason, there’s hardly a time where the league isn’t dominating the sports headlines. But the excitement picks up when we begin to approach the NFL Draft. Scouting profiles, mock drafts, trade rumors, combine results – all of it. The draft isn’t just a three-day event anymore. It’s a months’ long affair. And as you get closer and closer to to the big day, draft fever sets in for dynasty fantasy players. Everyone becomes completely familiar with any offensive player who will get drafted and has a chance to break out. And everyone dreams of how wonderful it would be to own these rookies for years to come in their fantasy leagues. In other words, the price to acquire draft picks gets exponentially higher the closer you get to draft day. At that point, a potential trading partner is no longer just trading an abstract draft pick that has no meaning. He’s trading away the career of Leonard Fournette, Corey Davis, or O.J. Howard. Your best bet is to assess your team in the middle of your season and, if you determine that your franchise is in need of a makeover, make your move to acquire draft picks right then and there. Not only are other owners likely to de-value future draft picks at that point, but they’re far more likely to feel pressure to make a deal if they’re in the hunt for a championship. But absent making your move during the season, make sure you try to acquire draft picks sooner rather than later after your fantasy season ends. Once you get closer to Draft Day, you’ll likely have to give up a whole lot more. Do Your Research on the Future Draft Classes Looking to acquire draft picks in a dynasty league makes sense, but not all draft classes are created equal. The value of a first-round pick one year might be worth far less than it would be the next. Before looking to acquire draft picks, you need to become familiar with the talent-level of rookies who will be available in any given year. Obviously, projecting the quality of draft classes more than even one year out is a difficult task, but there’s often analysis of the talent that should be available in future years. Getting a sense of who will be available in future years allows you to tailor your trade demands, and perhaps get significant additional compensation in the form of draft picks for two years down the road that your trading partner may not appreciate. If you’re serious, and if you have some free time, then nothing beats doing the legwork yourself. Watch college games or full-game videos. Don’t just watch a player’s highlight reel. Watch full games, to see not only whether potential high draft picks have the necessary traits so find success in the NFL This is so you can ask yourself questions like:Â “Can your prized running back pass-protect?” and “Does your favorite wide receiver block well and run his routes on every play?” Even if you don’t have time to watch actual tape yourself, there’s plenty of outstanding analysis out there (including Mike Tagliere’s big board on the 2018 Draft). Become familiar with the available players in the upcoming draft and future drafts (as best you can), so you can know who you might be trading for when acquiring draft picks. Ignore Non-Quality Picks Obviously, acquiring a first-round pick is better than a second-round pick, and a second-round pick is better than a third-round pick. And if you’ve been playing in a dynasty league for several seasons, you’ll know that once you get past the second round, you’re not usually looking at much value. As an example, below are the results of the 2016 Draft in my long-time running dynasty league, which is a PPR format: Obviously, dynasty draft results will differ, but I found this to be fairly representative of ADP. Looking at the first round, you see that the majority of players have at least been fantasy contributors already, and the majority are at least likely to develop into solid producers by 2018. When you get to the second round, things get a bit dicier. Jordan Howard was a fantastic surprise, Carson Wentz developed into a legitimate stud at the QB position in his second year (though he obviously missed time with an injury), and Hunter Henry is a borderline starter in fantasy leagues. Outside of that, there’s not a usable player in fantasy leagues. Once you get to the third round, we have Jared Goff, who played himself into a potential QB1 in Sean McVay’s system, and Kenyan Drake, who benefited from the surprising Jay Ajayi trade to carry fantasy owners down the stretch. In my experience, the results of that 2016 dynasty draft are consistent with how drafts play out. The first round gives you a bevy of players who should contribute either right away or within the next couple of seasons. The second round gives you an occasional breakout player with mostly duds. And third-round players usually need some drastic change in circumstances to become relevant. In any trade involving draft picks, your trading partner is going to try to throw in a second- or third-round pick to sweeten the deal. For the most part, don’t bother considering them. Sure, a Jordan Howard or Alvin Kamara will occasionally break out of the second round of your draft to become a fantasy stud. But the chances of that are low. Focus on getting back high-quality picks, even a single one, rather than trading for depth picks. Understand the Risks Along the same lines, it’s important to understand the risks that come along with acquiring draft picks. Take the draft results we discussed above. Ezekiel Elliott and Michael Thomas are bonafide fantasy studs. Sterling Shepard and Will Fuller have been fantasy starters when healthy. Corey Coleman, Derrick Henry, and Josh Doctson haven’t done all that much yet but look like they may have bright futures. And Tyler Boyd, Kenneth Dixon, and Laquon Treadwell may never contribute to a fantasy team. In the end, even when dealing with first-round picks, you’re probably looking at about a 50 percent chance at best that the player you draft will help you in any significant way within your first few years. Draft picks are unknown commodities. Give yourself the best chance possible by acquiring multiple first-round picks if you can, but remember that there are no guarantees. Don’t feel pressured to give away the farm. Dan Harris is a featured writer for FantasyPros.

It’s about feeling the way you feel.” Dan Harris Joining the podcast for a second time is my friend Dan Harris, an ABC News correspondent who serves up co-anchor duties on both Nightline and the weekend edition of Good Morning America. In one of the greatest side hustles of all time, Dan has distinguished himself in recent years as a leading voice in the advocacy of meditation as a means to live both happier and more fulfilled. For those unfamiliar, Dan’s journey is compelling. An embedded war correspondent covering everything from mass shootings and natural disasters to conflicts in Myanmar, Afghanistan and the Middle East, including six visits to war-torn Iraq, Dan’s mental well-being began to suffer, his stress escalating with each overseas deployment. Depression, anxiety and PTSD ensued, followed by self-medicating with drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Ultimately, these factors conspired to take a serious toll on Dan’s mental and physical health, culminating in a meltdown of epic proportions in 2004 when he suffered an on-air panic attack while delivering the news that was witnessed by 5 million people. Although unsure as to the cause of his breakdown, it was a wake up call that led him to seek professional help. At the same time, in a bizarre stroke of synchronicity, Peter Jennings assigned Dan to begin covering stories on faith, religion and spirituality. Dan was less than enthusiastic about this, but ultimately it was this exploration that that eventually led Dan to understand that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head. A thinking mind which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business yet also led him to make the decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out. We all have that voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Dan stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a protocol he initially dismissed as useless, but which ultimately not only saved his life, but gave him a new one altogether: Meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Dan took a leap of faith. A deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even prison guards and marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness. Dan chronicles his experiences in his highly entertaining and illuminating memoir, 10% Happier and provides a practical guide to the actual hows and whys of meditation in the recently released, 10% Happier: Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics. In many ways, Dan is the perfect ambassador for meditation. The furthest thing from a monk or a guru, he’s a professional family man living in New York City — a highly relatable, very human being who, just like all of us, is trying to live just a little bit better and a little bit happier in the face of life’s daily pressures. This is a conversation about the power of meditation to combat and overcome the thought patterns and behaviors that drag us down. It’s about the science that establishes meditation as an effective tool to quite literally rewire our brains — all while lowering our stress response, reducing our blood pressure, and alleviating depression. But mostly, this is a conversation directed at the skeptic. Perhaps you’re convinced meditation wont work for your unique problems. Maybe you just don’t quite understand how to do it. Or you dismiss it as a frivolous waste of time. If so, then this wide ranging conversation with Dan picking up where we left off last time (RRP #97), is appointment listening.

Jack Parker and Jack Shemwell were on target for Malvern, with Matt Brookes replying for the Gloster. A giant-killing act was on the cards at St Johns where the Division One title challengers were holding cup favourites Callow End to a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes. However the Saints ran out of steam in extra-time as the visitors took control to win 5-1. Matt Andrews (2), Ash Millard, Adam Webb and Joe Wood were the Callow End scorers. Hallow also needed extra-time before going through 5-2 against Upton Snodsbury after a 2-2 scoreline in normal time. Kyle Belmonte hit a hat-trick for Hallow with Ben Harbourne and Zaq Hussain also on the score sheet. Chris Allen and Ryan Pugh netted for Upton. Perrywood completed the semi-final line–up with a 3-1 win at New Inn Athletic courtesy of a double from Gavin Podmore. The Wood will play FC Malvern for a place in the final with fierce rivals Hallow and Callow End contesting the other semi-final. The quarter-finals of the Southam Trophy saw Callum Morris firing a hat-trick for Lower Teme & Martley who beat Arrow 4-1. Worcester Athletic strolled through 5-1 at Northwick Saints, with Macauley Austin notching a double. Hornets had a surprise 2-1 victory over high flying Eaton with Jacob Whittall netting both their goals. FC Korono are the other semi-finalists after a 4-1 win at Colwall St James, with strikes from Jack Hancock, Tom Groves, Joe Wood and Charlie Hooman. Mike Cox and Lewis Barson gave Fernhill Heath Athletic a 2-0 win against The Bell in the Katherine Rayer Cup and they will meet Drakes Broughton Rangers in the semi-finals. In the Kilbourne Kay Cup quarter-finals, Luke Bailey, Joe Dallow and Daniel Hunt struck as Malvern Vale defeated Powick 3-1. Pershore Town Eagles had a narrow 2-1 win over Warndon Villages with goals from Aaron Northall and Luke O’Sullivan. Matt McClatchy and Dan Harris gave Worcester City Wanderers a 2-1 extra-time victory at Kempsey Colts United. In the league, Division Three title contenders Express Falcons romped home 9-1 at Brewers Saints. Brad Morton cracked a treble and Josh Benson-Smith a double. Masons kept up their challenge with a 5-1 success at GDL Athletic thanks to a hat-trick from Josh Bowen. Colwall Wanderers are the new Division Four leaders after a comprehensive 7-2 win at Worcester Saints. Ben Miller hit a hat-trick with Lewis Williams adding a brace.

Ok, that’s not true. Sure, Christian Yelich is now on the Brewers and Yu Darvish is now on the Cubs, but over the course of a career, those changes do not move the needle that much (yet) for dynasty purposes. Still, even without any baseball action, there’s been plenty of time to recalibrate our dynasty values. So, let’s take a gander at where things stand now as we approach Spring Training. Just a reminder: The values below do not represent auction dollars or FAAB. They’re simply a way to evaluate potential trades in a vacuum. Complete a mock draft in minutes with our free Draft Simulator >> As you can see there’s plenty of movement throughout the trade values, but the majority of it is simply a product of taking a closer look at the values and my dynasty rankings. Essentially, any movement of three spots or less should not be considered significant at this stage. For the most part, it’s simply a factor of updating a player’s projections for this coming season and a reassessment of his long-term value. There’s a lot of tweaking that goes on throughout the offseason, and dynasty trade values are no exception. There are, however, some players who made major moves in the values, so let’s discuss the circumstances. The Projection Movers There are a handful of players who have gained or lost a significant amount in trade value simply because my projections for the upcoming season have changed, or because I’ve taken a closer look at their recent performance and determined that it appears to be more sustainable that I thought. Jose Ramirez and Tommy Pham are two examples of players whose long-term value I’m more bullish on after taking a deep dive into their 2017 numbers. The 2017 version of Ramirez looked like largely the same as the 2016 version except for a massive jump in power (29 home runs and 56 doubles in 2017 versus 11 home runs and 46 doubles in 2017). And yes, the “juiced balls” undoubtedly made a difference, but a closer look at the numbers shows that Ramirez’s power gains were due largely to a change in approach. Ramirez upped his pull percentage to 46.3% (18th-best in the league), his hard-hit rate to 34%, and his fly-ball percentage to 39.7%. In other words, Ramirez made a conscious effort to pull the ball and hit the ball in the air more, which led to a .265 ISO, just below Paul Goldschmidt. That approach, as much as the likelihood that the balls were juiced, suggests that Ramirez’s long-term outlook may be more in line with his 2017 numbers than his previous performances. As for Pham, his shocking 2017 numbers certainly came out of nowhere, but there’s a narrative that makes it seem plausible that his performance was for real. Pham complained of vision problems in previous seasons which apparently affected his depth perception, and his strikeout rate dropped from 38.8% in 2016 to 22.1% in 2017, a number that continued to decrease as the season went on. He also got consistent playing time for the first time in his career and is one of the more analytically-minded players in the entire game. He’s a bit older than we’d like from our dynasty-league stalwarts (he’s entering his age-30 season), but there’s certainly more there to support long-term success from Pham that I had originally suspected. Other significant movers include Shohei Ohtani, who gains 32 points in trade value from our previous post, and Michael Conforto, who takes a rather large dive. Ohtani wasn’t in the player pool as of the last update, so he was not included on our dynasty trade value chart. Seriously. That’s the whole explanation. But long-term, he should be valued on par with Noah Syndergaard and Madison Bumgarner. As for Conforto, rosier projections about his return from the torn posterious capsule in his left shoulder injury have abated, and he’s now looking at a best-case scenario of May 1st. Shoulder injuries, though they affect pitchers more often, are notoriously unpredictable and it’s fair to have question marks about how the injury will affect Conforto’s career. In the immediate future, however, when your best-case scenario is five months of the season, and you play for a Mets team for which best-case scenarios are never met, you’re going to take a downgrade in trade value. The Prospect Movers Almost all of the other significant movers are prospects. As we discussed in the first article discussing trade values, I believe the greatest amount of emphasis should be put on immediate impact (i.e., 2018) with future seasons taking a lesser, though still important, role. But there are enough prospects out there who either look ready to make an impact earlier than expected or appear to be entering into the can’t-miss category. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is still a couple of seasons away from making an impact in the major leagues, but there’s little doubt that he will. He had a .450 OBP in High-A last year and has walked more than he has struck out in the minors. He should eventually develop into a monstrous power hitter, and there’s little doubt of an eventual significant fantasy impact. The fact he won’t see the majors for at least a year (and likely more) keeps his value in check, but it’s certainly going to rise further. Eloy Jimenez got a cup of coffee in Double-A with the White Sox and was far from overmatched, slashing .353/.397/.559 over 18 games. Jimenez’s ability to make contact and his developing patience at the plate shows why he has been one of the top prospects in the game for at least the last year. With the possibility of a September callup and an almost guaranteed impact in 2019, Jimenez moves up. Finally, Nick Senzel, who has been outstanding at every minor league level for the Reds, has the best chance of the above-mentioned prospects of making an impact in 2018. Senzel lacks the upside of Guerrero and Jimenez, but his overall line in the minors (.315/.393/.514) shows that he has the tools to be a strong everyday player. Currently blocked by Eugenio Suarez at third base, the Reds will surely want to take a look at their third baseman of the future at some point soon, and he should see the majors this season and make an immediate impact.

Katz on Feb. 8, 2018 - 11:35 AMComment Apparently the week of Feb. 5, 2018, is the de facto “TV newser book launch week.” On Tuesday, ABC News and ZonderKidz threw a party for ABC News correspondent Linsey Davis in honor of her first children’s book, The World Is Awake: A Celebration of Everyday Blessings. Davis says was inspired to write this book after the birth of her son, Ayden, when she realized there aren’t enough books that feature protagonists who look like him. “It’s essential that all children’s books have a window and a mirror,” Davis remarked at the American Folk Museum in New York. “A mirror for kids to see the reflection of themselves and a window so they can peer out and see a world that’s unfamiliar to them.” The soiree was well-attended by ABC Newsers. Partygoers included: Diane Sawyer, Robin Roberts, David Muir, Dan Harris, Rebecca Jarvis, Linzie Janis, Ryan Smith, Barbara Fedida, Candi Carter, Almin Karamehmedovic, Roxanna Sherwood, Marc Burstein and singer Jordin Sparks. The book was released on Tuesday, and is already an Amazon best-seller.

Stay up-to-date with the podcast by signing up for our newsletter. —The Editors Some of us know what it\'s like to reach a moment of reckoning—a low point in life when we know that something has to change, and there\'s nowhere to go but up. For Dan Harris, this moment occurred on live television in front of 5 million people. It took a panic attack reading the news on Good Morning America to make the journalist and anchor realize he needed to address his anxiety. After years of searching, Harris found his savior in meditation. But ever a skeptic at heart, Harris had to first cut through a lot of what he perceived to be flowery language and woo-woo jargon that diluted the practice\'s power in order to home in on his own brand of simple, straightforward mindfulness meditation. In the process, he wrote a book, 10% Happier, which went on to become a No. 1 New York Times best-seller, a practical meditation guide for the modern day. In this podcast episode, Harris—who first shared his story with mbg on the 2014 revitalize stage—dives into the genesis of his legendary first book, and his latest one, Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics. Along the way, he gets real about his rock-bottom moment, his first foray into mindfulness, and the tips that have helped him meditate every day for the past nine years. He also speaks candidly about the ""gurus"" of today and why you don\'t need to shell out for a silent meditation retreat or travel to an ashram to harness all of meditation\'s truly life-changing benefits. If you\'re a skeptic, or just someone who has trouble quieting the mind regularly, you\'re going to want to give it a listen. Enjoy this episode!

The academy has transitioned from a 66 day basic training curriculum that for years enabled the agency to get agents to the field quickly and has implemented a 117 day basic training program. “We want them to get it right in the field,” Harris said. The new curriculum includes a substantial amount of scenario based training in comparison with the previous curriculum. “We don’t want to stay stagnant,” Harris said. “We want to take what is really happening in the field and recreate that in a safe training environment where mistakes are made here and mistakes made by us in the field.” The training method takes the cadet through more real life scenarios in a controlled environment. “They make their mistakes here and get it right when they get in the field.” Harris said recent news accounts involving law enforcement have had an impact on an officer’s judgement and decision making skills. “Do we have the appropriate ones?” he asked. “By keeping them here (in Artesia) we have taken our program from about 70 hours of judgement and decision making to approximately 170 hours, so you’re looking at over doubling the amount of time that if you were a trainee, I’m going to give you more scenarios.” Harris added, “it’s one thing to sit in a classroom and tell someone this is how you do it and this is what you do, it’s another thing to take them and put them into one of our venues and basically show them and have them show us and evaluate them on that.” Training supervisor Lloyd Sams said one major change involved learning Spanish during the previous training period. “For those that did not understand or speak Spanish, they had an additional 40 days, so for non-native speakers or those that their Spanish speaking skills weren’t as well you had a 66 day basic for those that were unable to communicate the Spanish language they stayed an additional 40 days,” he said. Sams added that made up an additional 30 percent that were hired during that time frame. “Now with the 117 day we have reintegrated Spanish back into the full academy, it’s one of the major things we have done in the 117 day is reincorporate Spanish back into the basic training,” he said. Sams said the reinforcement of those Spanish speakers are force multipliers for USBP Academy instructors, “and the ability to go in and as we learn the languages, during those time frames within the 117 day program we’re able to apply a lot more practical applications.” He said they want to thread the Spanish program throughout the entire academy. Harris added, “you couple that with everyone getting that foundation together as a class with partners and teammates and getting more practical applications in our training and tracking abilities, tracking disturbances in the field to our use of force and judgement, when you add all that up into one basic academy, it makes the border patrol one of the top-10 in the country.” Equipment and how to use it are also part of the training process, according to Harris. He cited lights for their weapons. He said, “the technology changes everyday.” “Whether I’ve got to have an agent who goes into a school and stop an active shooter or he’s in the desert in the middle of the darkness, I want them to be able to identify the threat, make the appropriate action, whether it’s escalation or deescalation and stop that threat,” Harris said. Harris added the mission is to put the best possible light into that agent’s hand. “That’s just one small piece,” he said. “When we send the men and women out there with some of the best equipment, that is available to them, whether that’s their protective armor, their uniforms, their weapon, their weapon mounted light, we train and certify them intensely train them for six months.” Harris said in the past it would have taken a few years for an agent through their training to have all that equipment, training and tactics, “that they used to protect themselves and others.” Sams added in the former 66 day program there were a limited number of tools that they were able to provide those trainees that left the academy with about five or six certifications. “Now they’re leaving here with close to 13 to 14 certifications, so giving them those more tools, now are being taught at the academy, where traditionally it was one of those where it may have been two to three years longer before we were able to get that in the field.” The USBP said President Donald Trump has a mandate of hiring 5,000 additional agents.

The fifth named storm of the season will bring a ""very windy"" spell to the UK on Tuesday night and Wednesday, forecasters said. The Met Office has issued several national severe weather warnings due to the potential for travel disruption. Coastal roads and properties along Britain\'s western and southern coasts are vulnerable to high waves throwing beach material onto sea fronts, forecasters warned. Met Office chief forecaster Paul Gundersen said: ""The unsettled theme continues throughout this week, with further spells of rain moving across the UK from the west as many return to work on Tuesday and there will again be some snow over the high ground in Scotland. ""The wind will pick up again later on Tuesday and Wednesday as developing Storm Eleanor heads towards the UK and Ireland."" The Environment Agency warned earlier that strong winds and high tides could bring coastal flooding from Tuesday until Thursday. Carol Holt, the Environment Agency\'s flood duty manager, said: ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast - take extreme care on coastal paths and promenades, and don\'t put yourself in unnecessary danger trying to take \'storm selfies\'. ""If you\'re travelling, please check your route before setting off and don\'t drive through flood water."" A yellow weather warning has been issued for between 6pm on Tuesday and 8am on Wednesday for north east and west England, northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The warning predicts gales with gusts of 60mph to 70mph are likely while some western coastal areas have a chance of seeing gusts of up to 80mph. Deputy chief forecaster Dan Harris added that next weekend could bring a return of colder conditions with a risk of frost, ice and wintry conditions, particularly in the north. He added: ""It could remain more unsettled in the south. ""The details of the forecast later this week and into the weekend are extremely uncertain at this stage, so my advice is to keep up to date with the latest forecasts as confidence will increase later in the week.""

(COURTESY PHOTO) The Conway OLLI snowshoe group is seen on an outing in the winter of 2017. (COURTESY PHOTO) CONWAY — As Osher Lifelong Learning Institute enters its 10th year, organizers are looking to expand its programming and hoping to reach a younger audience — people in their 50s and 60s who are still working. Known as OLLI, the institute’s mission is to provide non-credit courses and activities to adults over age 50. The volunteer-run program is seeking new members, participants in upcoming classes and teachers/presenters. In the past, most of the programs were held during the day, making them easily accessible for retired seniors. But Betsy Gemmecke, founder of the Conway branch of OLLI, said the program leaves out those who work during the day. Therefore, six of the planned 27 classes for the upcoming semester will be held at night or on Saturdays. Classes also will start in February instead of March, and run through June. A second semester runs September-December. OLLI will unveil its upcoming classes at two preview events at Granite State College, 53 Technology Lane in Conway. The first will be held Monday, Jan. 8, at 10:30 a.m.; the second is planned for 5:30 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 17. Classes can range from talks on travel to discussions of literature, philosophy and current events to camping trips and cruises on Conway Lake. Past classes have included “America’s Health-care Landscape,” “Oldtime stories from Mount Washington Valley” and “Making Custom Skis.” Many of the classes reflect the interests and experience of the presenters, and anyone is welcome to suggest a topic they would like to teach. But Gemmecke said there are also programs like the Foreign Policy Institute discussion groups that have a set curriculum but need a facilitator. Among classes planned for the upcoming semester is one to be presented by Gemmecke called “Welcome to the Mount Washington Valley.” Designed for newcomers, it promises to give an overview of the valley along with practical information. “We’re getting a lot of people over 50 moving to the valley, retiring, who don’t know anybody,” Gemmecke said. “We want to do more welcoming kinds of things.” Gemmecke said OLLI is also planning to do more interactive social groups, focused on things like going to the movies, playing games or outdoor recreation Classes usually last one to four weeks. There are no grades, and for most, no advance preparation or homework is required. The first Osher institute was created in 2001 at University of Southern Maine by philanthropist Bernard Osher, a native of Biddeford. Since then, the program has spread across the country, and today, there are institutes at 120 universities and colleges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. All OLLI programs must be affiliated with a university or college. In New Hampshire, the programs are tied to the Granite State College arm of the University System of New Hampshire. Gemmecke brought the program to the valley in 2008. It is one of four OLLI locations in New Hampshire. The others are in Manchester, Concord and the Seacoast region. There are 128 members in Conway and about 1,200 statewide. OLLI members in Conway have access to programs at all four locations.

Highlights of the spring schedule include topical seminars led by Jon Caridad, Dan Ellis, Philip Levin, Charlie Mabry, and Dickie Scruggs; cooking experiences with Cheri Hiers, Julie Hall, and Shayne Varone; trips to the Gulf Coast Research Lab in Ocean Springs, Lazy Magnolia Brewery in Kiln and Mississippi’s new museums; a ‘foodie’ tour of Bay St. Louis; a Saturday matinee of An American in Paris at the Saenger Theatre in New Orleans; and an overnight trip to Space Camp at the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. “I’m very excited about the upcoming semester. We’re lucky to be able to draw on the wealth of knowledge from experts at USM and across south Mississippi for our classes, and we have some interesting and fun activities lined up as well,” said Brett Harris, director of OLLI. “If I didn’t have to manage the program, I’d be signing up for one of them every day of the week.” With more than 180 annual courses, trips, interest groups, and skill-building opportunities in Hattiesburg and along the Gulf Coast, OLLI offers experiences for every interest, including exploration of new technology, connecting mind and body through exercise, or taking up a new interest in painting, photography, or writing – all in an environment that values learning. There are no grades or tests, and members pay only for the courses they take. For more information on a free OLLI seminar, or to request a copy of the spring schedule, visit www.usm.edu/olli. Schedules are also available at the OLLI Hattiesburg office, located in the Peck House at 3601 Pearl Street; or at Elizabeth Hall, room 104 on the USM Gulf Park Campus in Long Beach.

FAIRBANKS — When the new Osher Lifelong Learning Institute catalog landed on my desk this week, I shared some of the listed classes with colleagues in the newsroom, who are younger than me. They were excited and intrigued by a few of them. Then I had to break the bad news: “Sorry, you’re not old enough yet to take these classes.” OLLI classes are specifically for “seasoned adults, age 50 and over.” They are, according to the catalog, “a health club for your mind.” Registration begins Jan. 24 for OLLI, a program through the University of Alaska Fairbanks that is supported by its membership, which determines curriculum, policies, procedures and fees. Supported by the Bernard Osher Foundation, OLLI offers classes that are both academic and practical, without the stress of tests and grades. All members need are curiosity and self-motivated learning. Annual membership is $35 and includes e-newsletters, socials, lecture series, special interest groups and eligibility to register for courses and special programs. Classes are held February through April, and again in the fall. All the instructors are volunteers. Those who pay $35 also pay $15 tuition per course. The other option, for unlimited classes with no extra fee, is to pay a membership fee of $185. The classes cover Alaska topics, film and photography, computer applications, social studies and science. Love your bicycle? Learn bike maintenance. Try kayaking or learn beekeeping. Discover scoundrels in Northern history. If you love musicals, learn songs from the brand-new original “Dueling With Dragons: The Musical.” Wonder why you have trouble decluttering? Sign up for “The Psychology of Downsizing,” taught by a licensed professional counselor. There are 23 pages of classes and most of them meet during the day. Some are just once a week for four weeks; others last longer. Online registration at www.uaf.edu/olli begins at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 24. You must be an OLLI member to register. Questions? Call 474-6607. Scooters find homes Six vintage scooters, discovered buried in a storeroom at Barnette Magnet School, have been auctioned off to new owners. These were the old wooden scooters used 30 or 40 years ago that probably distributed plenty of painful slivers into young hands. They were found during a routine rearranging of the storeroom. “The scooters must have been at Barnette since the 1960s,” Joy Simon, P.E. teacher, said. “This gym was built in 2009, so they probably moved all the old equipment from the old gym to the new equipment room.” Once she had them in hand, she did some research and discovered that on eBay, the scooters sell for $125 apiece. With permission from the school principal, she created an auction to raise money for new gymnasium equipment. Those old scooters have been replaced by new plastic versions. Here are the lucky winners: Carissa Gallentine, who successfully bid on two scooters Kelly Milles, Ron Veliz, Giava Zanazzo and the Ostnes family. The $215 raised by the auction may fund more badminton rackets and balls for school programs. The school also needs new lacrosse nets.

Now you can seek new friends and a community that shares the love of learning during times that meet your busy schedule at a new, six-week pilot program featuring classes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. \u200bThere are 17 class options over six weeks exploring art, science, technology, history, literature, self-help, travel, social activities and more. The Bernard Osher Foundation supports 121 lifelong learning programs on university and college campuses across the country, with at least one grantee in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Classes Start Tuesday, Feb. 13 and run through March 24. All classes are on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at 6 p.m. and Saturday mornings at 10 a.m. Classes are located at the Central Tucson campus at 4485 N. First Ave. on the northwest corner of North First Avenue and Wetmore Road. The facility includes three large classrooms and a member lounge that facilitates the community aspect of the organization. There are accommodations for coffee service, lunch storage and heating, and tables for eating or just gathering. There is ample parking in the lot just south of the facility. Proximity parking is available just east of the entrance for those with mobility concerns. Access to the River Walk, which connects to over 20 miles of walking and biking trails throughout Tucson, is at the north end of our property. A bike rack is available for our members’ use. Study group/class sessions are planned for 90 minutes, and courses will be held on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings (see above for times). Courses will meet once a week and vary in length from a single session to six weeks. As a pilot program, the curriculum will include typical OLLI-UA offerings including courses in the arts, history, science, literature and social sciences presented by members from the four existing OLLI-UA campuses. We will work to enrich that curriculum to reflect any special interests of the OAH membership. As a pilot program, the event will call heavily on registered members to help determine the social content. The facility will be available for member use an hour before class time. This should provide opportunities for members to engage socially over coffee or a meal. Depending on response, there may include an OLLI Dines Out event which invites members to an early evening, relatively inexpensive dinner (or Saturday lunch) with fellow members. Local restaurants, varied menus, separate checks and free parking contribute to the success of this program. For more information, go online to olli.arizona.edu/olli-ua-after-hours.

Meg Hovell, a retired IBM employee, enjoys learning and has taken non-credit classes at the Osher institute. Students of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Arizona volunteer at the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona as part of their civic engagement. The University of Arizona recently received $1 million of a $2.4 million endowment grant for its Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, a program that attracts some 1,200 older adults to classes for the pure joy of learning. Lifelong learning for personal fulfillment is aimed at students age 50 on up who attend non-credit classes on campuses and at community sites throughout the Tucson area. “Students come from all walks of life and their average age is in the late 60s, early 70s, and there are some in their 90s who volunteer and help teach classes,” said Scott Aldridge, the institute’s program manager. One of those students is Meg Hovell, who only admits that she is in her 70s, and proudly says she has been attending classes for nine years because “curiosity never retires.” Hovell retired from IBM after working there for 30 years, climbing the ladder as an engineer on up to director of product development. She now is president of the institute’s UA board of directors. As a student of the institute, Hovell has explored writing poetry and enrolled in a history class, Case Studies of Democracies, and a literature class, Reading the New Yorker, followed by intense discussions. The institute also benefits from retired professors who come to Tucson for the winters and volunteer to teach classes. “They have told us that our audience is much preferable to undergrads who are on their iPhones and whose only question is, ‘Will that be on the test?’” recalled Hovell. Technology classes are popular and include lectures on finding answers to such topics as bitcoin, or learning everything there is to know about smartphones, including how to take the best photos. Other class topics include the sciences, business, history, art, music and the humanities. Most of the classes are lectures with interactive discussions, and there also are field trips to restaurants and jazz nights. Students also get involved by giving back to the community, including volunteering with organizations such as the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona. For many seniors living alone, “It is fun to get out of the house and enjoy the opportunity to meet people in a structured setting where you find common interests and establish friends,” said Hovell. She said of the 1,200 members, at least 500 volunteer by either leading a class in discussion, making sure equipment is working for the instructor or also making the event a social gathering. The annual fee to become a member of the institute ranges from $150 up to $350, much depending on the courses offered. A new after-hours, six-week pilot program will start Feb. 13, and an informational meeting will be held Jan. 27 at 10 a.m. at the Central Campus, 4485 N. First Ave. More information is available at www.olli.arizona.edu About the endowment to the institute at the UA, Osher Foundation President Mary Bitterman, said, “We recognize that the program’s success represents the collective achievement of its excellent staff and dynamic community of intellectually vigorous members who give generously of their time and talent. “We applaud, too, the university’s leadership for its support of the institute and for embracing the notion that — at its best — education is a lifelong pursuit that has the power to elevate, delight and forge our connection to one another and to a larger world,” said Bitterman. Philanthropist Bernard Osher founded the foundation in 1977 to improve the quality of life through support for higher education and the arts, according to the foundation’s website. More than 120 institutes operate on university and college campuses across the country.

Professor David Green, vice chancellor and chief executive, said: “The University of Worcester was first founded just after World War Two. Our mission was to educate teachers to ‘win the peace through education’. “Over these past 70 years we have educated tens of thousands of outstanding teachers who make a positive difference every school day to children’s lives and opportunities. “We work with over 500 schools every year and are very happy to be working with the Worcester News to help give them the recognition they deserve.” Also lending their support is Western Power Distribution, sponsoring the Unsung Hero Award, Babcock Prime, sponsoring the Newcomer of the Year Award, Worcestershire County Council, sponsoring the Teacher/Lecturer of the Year Award, Worcestershire Local Enterprise Partnership, sponsoring the College, or Post-18 Education & Training Provider of the Year Award and Worcester Sixth Form College, sponsoring the Primary School of the Year Award.

HP10 9TY |3104052|Registered in England & Wales"", '(Bloomberg) -- Larry Robbins gives out “gag awards” to the kids he coaches in hockey, but not to employees at Glenview Capital Management. “The kids are thicker-skinned than the hedge fund people,” said Robbins, Glenview’s founder and chief executive officer. Instead, Robbins found another way to pass on coaches’ wisdom to the adults in his life: with milkshakes and foosball at a benefit for the Positive Coaching Alliance-New York City. Robbins, National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman and seven student-athletes were honored at the Feb. 1 event held in a middle-school gym in Manhattan. The organization trains coaches, teachers and players to develop life skills and values through team sports. Jonathan Barry of Goldman Sachs and Glen Matsumoto of Actis are board members. Benefit guests included Patrick Raley of Goldman Sachs, and Bob Burns, Jesse Perrin and Curtis Tange of Glenview. One PCA motto is “Better athletes, better people.” Another is, “Flushing mistakes.” The idea is that errors dwelled upon become “a time machine keeping you in the past,” said Jim Thompson, PCA’s founder. He encourages kids to create “mistake ritual that gets you to come back to the moment.” Robbins was 10 when he experienced one of PCA’s key tenets: keeping the emotional tank filled. It happened when his hockey coach, handing out gag awards at the end of the year, gave Robbins a picture of a turtle along with an aphorism: “He may not be fast, but he gets the job done.” His takeaway: Being the highest scorer or the fastest wasn’t all that mattered. Also, his coach had found a way to reframe a weakness. “That’s such a positive way to say you’re slow,” Robbins said. Playing hockey as a kid taught Robbins “at least half” of what he’s needed to know to run Glenview, he said. Like hockey, hedge funds are “a team sport, not an individual passion,” he said. When discussing investments, “we bring in about seven or eight people from our team,” Robbins said. “It’s not just me and another person in a corner isolated. We include partners and everyone who’s worked on it and has a perspective. We’re not a democracy. I have a little more votes than others, like a head coach executes, but we need all players on the field.” Hockey has also shaped how he hires. Robbins said he looks for job candidates who have experience in group activities. “It doesn’t have to be athletic, but the person who does solitary things, whether it’s running triathlons or being a voracious reader, tends not to have those bonding and team work experiences,” Robbins said. “We find that when they face adversity, or conflicts, or difficulty, that they may not have the experience to find the grit to overcome and persevere.” Mind you, Robbins is still out to win. “Hedge funds are a competitive sport, hockey is a competitive sport,” he said. “But along those lines, people don’t have good cultures because they win. They win because they have good cultures. That’s the message of PCA and the way I’ve experienced coaching and managing.” Robbins doesn’t insist his employees play hockey. Instead, he works to build team spirit through philanthropic outings. Among them: a casino night for the KIPP Foundation, painting a school on a Saturday, working on a Robin Hood or Ira Sohn ideas conference, or the PCA event, which possibly had his favorite dress code: jeans and jerseys. Robbins wore his Avalanche jersey, representing the teams his four eldest sons have played on. His youngest has skates, but isn’t allowed to wear them on the ice rink at home until he turns two. Robbins, 48, owns a junior hockey organization, the Chicago Steel, and said owning an NHL team is something he dreams about for retirement. ©2018 Bloomberg L.P.', ""Worcester 17°c Cllr Marc Bayliss A freeze in council tax increase for Worcester City Council will be proposed Tuesday evening by Conservatives at the Guildhall. Leader of the group, and deputy leader of the council, Marc Bayliss will suggest that the budget for 2018/19 sees no increase in the tax it levies compared to the 2.85 per cent rise that is proposed by the administration. He says that consistent underspends have left the council with no need for extra money. He said: “There has been an underspend of at least £300,000 every year for the last eight years, sometimes it’s been as high as £600,000. That means there’s £2.5 million at least that hasn’t been spent.” Cllr Bayliss said the proposed 2.9 per cent increase would bring in money that was easily covered by the accumulated underspends. He added: “This increase will bring in about £125,000. The council doesn’t need to raise that money, because it has been sensible and it’s in a strong financial position. “I don’t think that council tax should be raised unless it’s absolutely necessary, and it isn’t this year. “I know the increase is only a few pounds, but we should leave that money in the pockets of the public. Every penny helps.” With the council split down the middle politically, Cllr Bayliss said he expected 17 Conservative councillors to vote for the freeze, and therefore only needed one of the 16 Labour or two Green councillors in the chamber to agree with him to get the measure through. He also said that Labour county councillors were likely to vote against an increase in the tax set at County Hall, and thought that those members also on the city council would do the same. Councillor Adrian Gregson, Labour leader of the city council rejected that argument. He said: “There are Conservative members of the county council, who are in cabinet, making decisions, who will vote for an increase in that council’s tax. It’s hypocritical for them to vote for a freeze in the city council.” He added: “The government funding model is based on the government’s expectation that we’ll be putting up council tax, so there’s a shortfall if we don’t. And it’s dangerous to base a freeze on an underspend, if you don’t know what it will be, or even exist. “The increase is very small, about £3 per person, but cumulatively it allows the city council to deliver its services much more effectively.” Cllr Bayliss will make his proposal at Tuesday night's Resources and Policy Committee meeting. If it isn’t adopted by that committee he says he will put it forward at the council’s full meeting on Tuesday, February 20 where the final decision will be made on next year’s budget proposals.

ABC News anchor Dan Harris doesn\'t have to. In 2004, he had a panic attack on live TV after years of working in war zones and using drugs to cope with the stress. But that mortifying moment led him to take up meditation. He wrote a book about it, 10% Happier: How I Tamed The Voice In My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, And Found Self-Help That Actually Works — A True Story. And in that book, he mentioned research that suggests meditation can lower blood pressure, help with depression and increase awareness. The book sold well, but Harris still thought its impact fell short. ""In that first book I made this naive assumption that — I didn\'t think anybody would read it — but anybody who did read it would want to meditate and would meditate,"" Harris says. ""And it was pretty quickly after the book was out that I realized that that [was] not true. It\'s just complete underestimation of how hard it is for us to create healthy habits."" Harris\' new book is called Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics. In it, he set out to discover why it\'s so tough to start and stick with the practice. On finding time to maintain a meditation practice People want to do meditation especially at this time of year — the whole ""new year, new you"" thing. But they feel like it\'s just another thing on their to-do list that is further stressing them out, which of course defeats the whole purpose. My answer to this fear is I\'ve got good news and even better news. The good news is that I think five to 10 minutes a day is a great meditation habit, and I\'ve spent a lot of time talking to the neuroscientists who study what meditation does to the brain. They haven\'t cracked the dosage question fully, but generally speaking, [the scientists] say, ""Yes — five to 10 minutes should be enough to derive the advertised benefits of meditation."" So that\'s the good news. The better news is that I truly believe one minute counts and that it doesn\'t need to be one minute every day. You can shoot for daily-ish. On the purpose of meditation for beginners The primary insight for beginning meditators is that we are crazy, nuts, insane, that it is a zoo inside of our skulls. It is just that we are having this nonstop conversation with ourselves — about which, most of us are unaware. But when you tune into it, you see how negative, repetitive, ceaselessly self-referential it is. ... And when you see that — which you do clearly in meditation — that is a victory. Why? Because when you see how absolutely bonkers you are, you have a much better chance of not being owned by the insanity. So that the voice in your head, which is in the business of giving you terrible ideas like, ""Oh yeah you should finish that sleeve of Oreos"" or ""You should say the thing that\'s going to ruin the next 48 hours of your marriage,"" or whatever, that voice has less purchase over your actual actions. On teaching meditation to formerly incarcerated youth and finding they were already using similar strategies without calling it ""meditation"" There are lots of ways to increase your well-being, and meditation is one of them — but not the only one. That really hit home for me in spending time with these kids who are part of a group called InsideOUT Writers, which is run by screenwriters in Hollywood. They teach formerly incarcerated youth and presently incarcerated youth how to write as a way to deal with their life situation. We spent some time with the alums of the program who regularly meet and write together, and talk about and read their writing to each other, and talk about what\'s in the writing. And what I saw is that they have a practice. They were open to meditation — and in fact, as I\'ve heard from some of them subsequently, they are continuing to meditate. But there are all sorts of practices that have beneficial results, and for them the act of writing, the act of fellowship — sitting there and talking to each other — that boosts their self-awareness muscles and their compassion muscles every bit as much as meditation does. And so it is so important when talking about well-being not to get stuck on one thing only. I think it\'s important to ... you know, use every arrow in the quiver and that includes sleep, nutrition, exercise, having good friends and meditation. I just think meditation needs to be in there as well. Maddalena Richards and Ashley Brown produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Sydnee Monday and Deborah Franklin adapted it for the Web. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Imagine having one of the worst moments in your professional life play out in front of 5 million people. ABC News anchor Dan Harris doesn\'t have to. In 2004, he had a panic attack on live television after years of working in war zones and using drugs to cope with the stress. That moment led him to start meditating. He wrote a book called ""10% Happier"" about his experiences with meditation and its potential health benefits. It became a best-seller, but he still thought the impact fell short. DAN HARRIS: In that first book, I made this naive assumption that anybody who did read it would want to meditate and actually would meditate. And it was pretty quickly after the book came out that I started to realize that that is just not true. It\'s just complete underestimation of how hard it is for us to create healthy habits. MARTIN: Now, Harris is out with a new book with co-author Jeff Warren. It\'s called ""Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics."" What was the No. 1 obstacle you heard from people when they described why they just couldn\'t get into it or why they haven\'t been able to maintain a meditation practice? HARRIS: Time. When I wrote my first book, I was dealing with this - the No. 1 obstacle at that time was that people thought meditation was weird. I think that... MARTIN: Yeah - some kind of stigma. HARRIS: Yeah. I think that\'s still true, but I think it\'s going away. But so now we have this new issue, which is that people want to do meditation, especially at this time of year, the whole new year, new you thing. But they feel like it\'s just another thing on their to-do list that is further stressing them out, which of course defeats the whole purpose. And so for people, my answer to this fear is I\'ve got good news and even better news. The good news is that I think five to 10 minutes a day is a great meditation habit, and I\'ve spent a lot of time talking to the neuroscientists who study what meditation does to the brain, and they haven\'t cracked the dosage question fully, but generally speaking, people, the scientists, say, yes, five to 10 minutes should be enough to derive the advertised benefits of meditation. So that\'s the good news. The better news is that I truly believe one minute counts and that it doesn\'t need to be one minute every day. You can shoot for daily-ish (ph). MARTIN: So let\'s talk about this. HARRIS: Yeah. MARTIN: Because I read the book clearly and that stood out to me. Oh, I only have to do this one minute a day. So I sat the other day for a minute, and my mind was all over the place. And I guess that\'s supposed to improve. But by the end of the minute, I just felt like, well, now I just know how undisciplined my brain is. HARRIS: Let me reframe that whole experience for you... MARTIN: OK. HARRIS: ...As a victory because the primary insight for beginning meditators is that it is a zoo inside of our skulls. We are having this nonstop conversation with ourselves about which most of us are unaware. But when you tune into it, you see how negative, repetitive, ceaselessly self-referential it is. And when you see that, that is a victory. Why? Because when you see how absolutely bonkers you are, you have a much better chance of not being owned by the insanity so that the voice in your head, which is in the business of giving you terrible ideas, like, oh, yeah, you should finish that sleeve of Oreos or you could say the thing that is going to ruin the next 48 hours of your marriage or whatever, that voice has less purchase over your actual action. MARTIN: So you\'re saying that just by recognizing in this 60 seconds that I\'m meditating if there is just one moment when I recognize that I\'ve wandered and I\'ve brought myself back, that is the work, that is the practice and the victory. HARRIS: Yes, yes. That is the bicep curl for your brain. And this is what shows up on the brain scans in the areas of the brain that regulate attentions or your ability to focus but also in self-awareness, which is, in meditation speak, mindfulness. But this self-awareness, this ability to see your inner urges, impulses, desires, conversation, without being carried away by it is a game-changing skill. MARTIN: You ended up talking with some young people who were transitioning from prison to life on the outside. This was in California. And this was interesting because you came in thinking, oh, we can help these guys learn some meditation skills that will hopefully help them make this really challenging transition. And it turned out that they were already employing a lot of these strategies in their own life. They may not have - they just weren\'t calling it mindfulness or meditation, right? HARRIS: It\'s really useful and humbling for somebody like me who is, you know, an unabashed meditation evangelist that there are lots of ways to increase your wellbeing. And meditation is one of them but not the only one. And that really hit home for me in spending time with these kids who are part of a group called InsideOUT Writers, which is run by screenwriters in Hollywood. And they teach formerly incarcerated youth and presently incarcerated youth how to write as a way to deal with their life situation. And we spent some time with the alums of the program who regularly meet and write together. And what I saw is that they have a practice. There are all sorts of practices that have beneficial results. And for them, the act of writing, the act of fellowship, that boosts their self-awareness muscles and their compassion muscles every bit as much as meditation does. And so it is so important when talking about well-being not to get stuck on one thing only. I think it\'s important to, you know, use every arrow in the quiver, and that includes sleep, nutrition, exercise, having good friends and meditation. I just think meditation needs to be in there as well. MARTIN: You reveal in the book that you meditate for two hours a day. Come on. HARRIS: I know. It\'s ridiculous. MARTIN: How do you - where do you find - I mean, that is such a cliche question, but literally where do you find the time? HARRIS: First of all, let me just issue this caveat. I\'m reluctant always to talk about my meditation dosage because people - I\'m... MARTIN: It\'s a pretty high standard. HARRIS: It is. MARTIN: Like, no one\'s going to get there (laughter). HARRIS: Right. And I know how the mind of a skeptic works, which is you\'re just looking for an excuse not to do the thing. MARTIN: Right. HARRIS: And so I don\'t want this to be an excuse. I don\'t want people to say, oh, well, that\'s where this thing goes and I don\'t have time for it - not true. One good way to think about this is like exercise. You know, most of us, if we exercise, we know that we need 30 minutes of cardio a certain amount of days per week, and we do it grudgingly. There are some people, however, get really into it and do triathlons. And so for me, I think five to 10 minutes a day is an incredible habit - or just one minute a day. But I got really interested. I\'m writing these stupid books about meditation. I\'m really into this thing, so I just allow myself to do it whenever I can - in the back seat of taxis, on airplanes, in my office before or after a show. And for me, it\'s just - the reason I want it to go up is the mind is trainable. Happiness is a skill. And if you can become 10 percent happier, what\'s the ceiling? And I really am interested in deriving the benefits at an even higher level. MARTIN: Dan Harris - his new book is called ""Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics."" Dan, thank you so much. HARRIS: Thank you. I really appreciate it.

Apparently so in the case of Byron Katie, whose new book asks readers to question fundamental assumptions. There are basically two types of spiritual writers. The first are the “skeptic guides”: relatable stand-ins for the reader, like Elizabeth Gilbert in Eat, Pray, Love or Dan Harris in the #1 bestseller 10% Happier. These people start out neurotic and normal, and take readers on their journey to something slightly less neurotic (and less normal). The second type is less common: someone who has basically jumped off the deep end and is writing from a position of something like enlightenment, liberation, whatever. A lot of these people, we suspect, are frauds. But some—Eckhart Tolle, Oprah’s guru; the ’60s icon Ram Dass—seem, upon close inspection, to be the real deal. Which, you know, only makes us more skeptical. Byron Katie—who combines the cutting wisdom of a Zen master with the look of a less-made-up Paula Deen—is in the second category. Katie herself hit bottom in 1986: a massive depression, suicidal despair, the inability to function as a mother, wife, or anything else. And then something happened. Katie is too wise to call it “enlightenment” (it’s a truism that the more someone uses words like that, the less they’ve experienced it) but it was some kind of… shift. As she describes in her new book, A Mind at Home with Itself, written with her husband, the poet and translator Stephen Mitchell, Katie suddenly realized that the multitude of thoughts and assumptions she was carrying around just weren’t that reliable. And when they were held a little more lightly, all those clichés about the present moment—radiant, pure, no problem, compassionate—came true. “My depression had nothing to do with the world around me,” Katie writes in the book’s first chapter. “It was caused by what I believed about the world. I realized that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn’t believe them, I didn’t suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that.” Recently, over tea at a New York City hotel, where Katie was staying during her book tour, I asked her how she does it. How does she manage to be both uncompromising in her own perspective—more on that in a minute—and a bestselling writer? “Because this stuff works,” Katie told me. “It doesn’t take a teacher, doesn’t take another human being to do it. It’s 100 percent free.” The “stuff” Katie was referring to is a deceptively simple technique she calls “The Work.” In The Work, you take a particularly nettlesome thought—my spouse is unkind, my job is unfulfilling, the world is a mess, whatever—and inquire into it. Do you really know that it’s true? What would you be like if it weren’t? What would it be like if you “turned it around” on yourself? On paper, these questions may seem banal. In practice, they lead to a kind of radical skepticism about your own opinions and preconceptions that can be extremely clarifying. Once our interview was over, I did The Work with Katie on my envy of other writers, and basically started crying in that midtown hotel. She legitimately had me realize that I was happier with my life than I would be with theirs. For a minute anyway. Or, to take another example, Katie said, in most of our relationships, “You really are who I believe you to be—and this is always false. That’s why inquiry is so important. We’re never dealing with each other—we’re dealing with our own internal lives.” I pointed out that to many of my skeptical journalist colleagues, not to mention my “social justice warrior” friends, there’s something selfish about all this “get happy” stuff—maybe something narcissistic, puerile, mushy-headed. “I love skepticism,” Katie said. “I think it’s very helpful.” “The Work is the essence of skepticism,” Mitchell chimed in. “If skeptical New Yorkers would take their skepticism further, and inward, they would see that what they think they know, they don’t really know.” I countered that, living in New York, knowing stuff is the name of the game: which subway to take home, how much a Snapple costs at a bodega, how not to get taken advantage of on the street… “And why am I so frightened?” Katie interrupted. Well, I said, this a tough city. “I know!” Katie replied. “I left my purse at a coffee shop or something years ago, and I walked out. Then I remembered and came back for it, but it was gone.” But then Katie said something I didn’t expect. “My mind immediately started working on what they would do with my credit cards, and my money, but then I thought that they would see my children’s picture—and I thought of the joy, you know, that that can bring to anyone.” “I remember you talking about the gift that the person could give to his girlfriend,” Mitchell added. “Or the food for a child,” said Katie. “Or alcohol, whatever—we need what we need when we think we need it.” Wait, so she had her purse stolen, but was really feeling joy and compassion? Really? This, I said, sounds radically different from the lives most people lead. Is it even compatible with a normal life? “For me it’s a matter of do people suffer in it, or not,” Katie said. “I haven’t talked to anyone that is doing The Work that feels like he must do anything in particular with his life. We question everything.” Even, apparently, how much it sucks when someone steals your stuff. But wait a minute, I said. Some ideas are important—like “racism is bad,” for example. Do we really want to question that too? “Yes,” she said, “because you’re more likely to understand the racists. You’re more likely to have sane discussions. You’re more likely to grow, listen, expand, and find common ground.” “One effective kind of questioning,” said Mitchell, “would be to inquire into a statement like, ‘I’m angry at racists because they are ruining the country,’ or something to that effect. The fact is, that thought—even though it comes from a place of justice and compassion—is a thought that can cause tremendous stress and once you investigate it you find some very interesting creatures that live in the dark under that thought. And it’s to the benefit of everybody to be a little clearer about it.” The truth is, Katie is a radical teacher, disguised as a nice lady who calls you “sweetheart.” For example, consider the passage in A Mind at Home with Itself where Katie says, “It’s all a dream—all of life, everything. Nothing ever is; nothing ever can be, since the very instant it seems to be, it’s gone. This is truly hilarious.” This isn’t the cuddly spirituality that, say, Eat, Pray, Love offers for mass consumption. It’s almost shockingly uncompromising, albeit delivered in kind and reassuring tones. But, I asked, if I’m feeling spiritually happy about getting robbed or racists ruining the country, aren’t I being irresponsible, given how privileged and fortunate I am? “Isn’t it odd how people combine those two things [happiness and irresponsibility] when it’s just not so,” said Katie. “You know, the Dalai Lama has such a sense of humor. He’s such a good, clear man, it seems, and so bright.” We sat there for a moment, perhaps reflecting on the horrors that the Dalai Lama has seen in his life, how much responsibility is on his shoulders, how his people are the victims of the largest ethnic cleansing operation on the planet right now. Or maybe that’s just what I was thinking. Maybe Katie was just enjoying the moment. Midway through A Mind at Home with Itself, Katie addresses the “enlightenment” question head on. “People used to ask me if I was enlightened,” she writes, “and I would say, ‘I don’t know anything about that. I’m just someone who knows the difference between what hurts and what doesn’t.’” Just so.', ""Power Up Naomi Alderman won the U.K.’s Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction in June 2017 with The Power, a work of speculative fiction in which young women discover the ability to release powerful electrical currents from their fingers. The premise resonated with U.S. readers when the title pubbed here in October (our review praised its “stirring and mind-bending vision”) and the book has seen steady sales, boosted by its inclusion on numerous best-of-2017 lists. The week before Christmas, the Washington Post noted that demand had exceeded supply, which led to a sales dip, but a subsequent reprint helped the title debut on our fiction list at #21. (See all of this week's bestselling books.) Movie Watch Publicity preceding the November 2017 big-screen release of Call Me by Your Name, adapted from André Aciman’s novel, boosted sales of the conventional trade paper edition of the book throughout the year: it sold 21K print copies in 2017, or about 42% of total sales since its 2008 release. The movie tie-in edition pubbed in October, and print unit sales continued to climb in the weeks after the movie opened; it debuts on our trade paper list at #17. Relax and Reassess The last week of 2017 saw two “new year, new you” books—one aimed at soothing the spirit and the other at taking financial control—debut on our hardcover nonfiction list. At #16, Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics is, our review said, an “entertaining and useful guide” by ABC News correspondent Dan Harris and meditation teacher Jeff Warren. Harris’s 2014 memoir, 10% Happier, has sold 308K print copies. Former CPA Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting software company YNAB, lands at #22 with You Need a Budget. “Mecham makes it seem simple and his tone is encouraging,” our review said, citing the “especially helpful” cheat sheet reminders that close each chapter.

Called The Jacobite Risings: the Fight for Britain’s Throne, the exhibition (open until February 2) traces the doomed attempts by the House of Stuart and its supporters to regain control of Great Britain. Constructed entirely in Lego (using around one million bricks), the model includes detailed miniature recreations of two sites in the care of Historic Environment Scotland (HES). The spectacular six metre by three metre model has been painstakingly crafted by Brick to the Past, a team of volunteer Lego and history enthusiasts who specialise in creating massive, detailed and meticulously researched historically themed Lego models. Dan Harris of Brick to the Past said: “We had a great time designing and building its different parts, from the Jacobites themselves to the major buildings, which are based on HES properties such as Corgarff Castle and Ruthven Barracks. “It also gave us an opportunity to take on Scotland’s dramatic landscape, so we have built mountains, rivers, forests and animals that are designed to represent those of the Highlands”.

Enchantress of Numbers: A Novel of Ada Lovelace by Jennifer Chiaverini The only legitimate child of Lord Byron, the most brilliant, revered, and scandalous of the Romantic poets, Ada was destined for fame long before her birth. Estranged from Ada’s father, who was infamously “mad, bad, and dangerous to know,” Ada’s mathematician mother is determined to save her only child from her perilous Byron heritage. Banishing fairy tales and make-believe from the nursery, Ada’s mother provides her daughter with a rigorous education grounded in mathematics and science. Any troubling spark of imagination—or worse yet, passion or poetry—is promptly extinguished. Or so her mother believes. When Ada is introduced into London society as a highly eligible young heiress, she at last discovers the intellectual and social circles she has craved all her life. Little does she realize that her delightful new friendship with inventor Charles Babbage—brilliant, charming, and occasionally curmudgeonly—will shape her destiny. Intrigued by the prototype of his first calculating machine, the Difference Engine, and enthralled by the plans for his even more advanced Analytical Engine, Ada resolves to help Babbage realize his extraordinary vision, unique in her understanding of how his invention could transform the world. All the while, she passionately studies mathematics—ignoring skeptics who consider it an unusual, even unhealthy pursuit for a woman—falls in love, discovers the shocking secrets behind her parents’ estrangement, and comes to terms with the unquenchable fire of her imagination. In Enchantress of Numbers, New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini unveils the passions, dreams, and insatiable thirst for knowledge of a largely unheralded pioneer in computing—a young woman who stepped out of her father’s shadow to achieve her own laurels and champion the new technology that would shape the future. Nonfiction Natural Disaster: I Cover Them. I am One by Ginger Zee ABC News chief meteorologist Ginger Zee pulls back the curtain on her life in Natural Disaster. Ginger grew up in small-town Michigan where she developed an obsession with weather as a young girl. Ginger opens up about her lifelong battle with crippling depression, her romances that range from misguided to dangerous, and her tumultuous professional path. This cyclone of stories may sound familiar to some-it’s just that Ginger’s personal tempests happened while she was covering some of the most devastating storms in recent history, including a ferocious tornado that killed a legend in the meteorology field. This book is for all the mistake makers who have learned to forgive others and themselves-even in the aftermath of man-made, or in this case Zee-made, disasters. It’s a story that every young woman should read, a story about finding love and finding it in yourself. Beloved by Good Morning America’s audience, Ginger is a daily presence for millions. Zee’s gained fame for her social media presence which is as unfiltered as Natural Disaster-from baby barf to doggy doo-doo. She’s shattered the glass ceiling for women in meteorology, but admits here first, she’s the one natural disaster she couldn’t have forecast. Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics: A 10% Happier How-to Book by Dan Harris ABC News anchor Dan Harris used to think that meditation was for people who collect crystals, play Ultimate Frisbee, and use the word “namaste” without irony. After he had a panic attack on live television, he went on a strange and circuitous journey that ultimately led him to become one of meditation’s most vocal public proponents. Here’s what he’s fixated on now: Science suggests that meditation can lower blood pressure, mitigate depression and anxiety, and literally rewire key parts of the brain, among numerous other benefits. And yet there are millions of people who want to meditate but aren’t actually practicing. What’s holding them back? In Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics, Harris and his friend Jeff Warren, a masterful teacher and “Meditation MacGyver,” embark on a cross-country quest to tackle the myths, misconceptions, and self-deceptions that stop people from meditating. They rent a rock-star tour bus (whose previous occupants were Parliament Funkadelic) and travel across eighteen states, talking to scores of would-be meditators—including parents, military cadets, police officers, and even a few celebrities. They create a taxonomy of the most common issues (“I suck at this,” “I don’t have the time,” etc.) and offer up science-based life hacks to help people overcome them. The book is filled with game-changing and deeply practical meditation instructions. You’ll also get access to the 10% Happier app, where you can listen for free to guided audio versions of all the meditations in the book. Amid it all unspools the strange and hilarious story of what happens when a congenitally sarcastic, type-A journalist and a groovy Canadian mystic embark on an epic road trip into America’s neurotic underbelly, as well as their own.

Van Gogh only sold one painting in his lifetime, but he still painted time and again. Though it happened after his passing, Vincent went on to become one of the most beloved artists of all time. See how his greatest work was inspired in this gorgeously illustrated picture book.

Another 19 nervous breakdowns. That describes me as we enter the second year of the T-man takeover. It’s embarrassing, weak-kneed, first-world whiny. I should have worked it through by now. I haven’t. So today I offer what’s helping, modestly: some coping skills. In these divisive, 24/7-news-alert times, “Do you ever find yourself distracted in a way that’s counterproductive, or yanked around by your emotions, or eating when you’re not hungry?” asked ABC anchorman Dan Harris, pumping his new book and app, on my radio show last week. “Are you unable to silence the unwanted voices yammering in your head?” he continued. Like Donald Trump’s, I asked, since his is the yammer I dread. The real question is: What can go right for Trump? But Harris knows something of dread and nervous breakdowns, too. He suffered both in 2004, live on ABC news, millions watching. Watch him yourself and take heart. At least when you crumble — heart pounding, chest panting, palms sweating — you can crumble alone. Harris, however, has recovered beautifully. He’s not just a big-time network star but the author of two books on the meditation practice he credits with quieting his head-infesting demons — no need to go all Himalayan in a loincloth, he said Is this not worth a look if you’re currently enduring the Trump battering ram, too? Now consider the fate of Bill McKibben, father and hero of the modern day environmental movement. Imagine his pain as our president dismantles his life’s work in an odd quest to make our air dirtier, our water greasier. Drill, baby. Drill. Drill! DRILL!!! I asked McKibben how he endures it all. “A backpack and a pair of hiking boots may be the best defense,” he said. Then he referred me to a piece he wrote in the New Yorker about Alaska’s remoteness and grandeur and grizzly-bear tracks, “like a van Gogh wheat field times a thousand.” McKibben’s trip there marked the first time post-President Trump when he’d been totally out of touch — no Internet, no Twitter, no connections, period. “And it made me understand in a gut way precisely how deep he’s managed to get in my mind,” McKibben wrote. But in Alaska, Trump couldn’t “blitzkrieg” him. Here in the lower 48, you and I can de-blitzkrieg too. My old college roommate takes her collie to the woods and actually sings to the trees. A hardscrabble newspaper guy admits he sometimes covers his ears and shuts his eyes, like he’s blotting out gruesome parts of a horror movie. I did that last weekend when another guest at a Memphis wedding told me, “I hate the media.” But I’m in the media, I protested. You’ve known me for years. “No facts, all opinions and lies,” she ranted on. I covered my ears like a three-year-old. It felt pretty good. California psychologist Tina Suzanne writes a newsletter for Together We Will, a grass-roots activist group that grew out of pro-Hillary Pantsuit Nation. She just finished “Tips for Recovery from Trump Induced Stress,” to bolster spirits of volunteers who feel they’ve got big thick black blankets over their heads. It’s what you’d expect: self-care, a good cup of tea, humor. But it’s important, said Suzanne, who likes John Oliver and Trevor Noah. I like The Borowitz Report. Andy Borowitz has Tillerson tussling with a massive button, “eight inches in diameter,” bigger and better than the president’s hands or anything “little rocket man” could even dream of. Better to laugh than cry, as they say. Or to lose your marbles completely. For the headlines say the Trump Train is barreling headlong into 2018. This year “will bring us full Trump,” says Axios’s Mike Allen, meaning 2017 was but half Trump, or quarter Trump, or Trump in training. In other words, we ain’t seen nothing yet. © 2018 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC']",,,,,,1

Live. A meltdown in front of five million people. Dan was struggling with PTSD. And it led him to substance abuse and depression. But like many people at bottom, his panic attack was the best thing that ever happened to him. Dan knew he needed to make changes in his life. But he didn’t know how. His mentors and friends said “find faith.” So he tried.... Religion. Spirituality. Self help. And finally meditation. I asked Dan, “So what exactly is meditation?” Because I think to a lot of people it has this unappealing notion of finding enlightenment and being closer to Buddha, talking to the Dalai Lama and blah blah blah. “There are a couple of ways to define meditation,” he said. “One is anything that gets you to pay attention to what’s happening right now is meditation. That’s a very broad definition. Another broad definition is training the mind/mental training.” Your mind is trainable. It’s plastic. And ready to be molded at any stage of your life. (Including now.) But it takes work. And trust me it’s not easy. I’ve been practicing meditation practice for many years. “All the things we want the most: fresh ideas, spontaneity, gratitude, calm, inner peace, self awareness, compassion, these are all mental skills,” Dan said. “These are skills that you can train. And to me that is just a hugely liberating idea.” I think what I learned the most from Dan in this podcast is that meditation can be enjoyed. It’s not supposed to be a forced activity. And making meditation an essential part of your daily routine will help improve your life tenfold. But only if you really put in the work. Wellbeing doesn’t always imply happiness, (sometimes that goal is out of reach), it means you’re well right now. I’ve never had a panic attack on air. But I have had them. And it can feel like you’re dying. I’ve read hundreds of articles on “what it feels like to have a panic attack” to see if I’m alone. I’m not. And even though that’s comforting, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I hope this podcast can help you or someone you love feel just 10% happier. I always say 1% improvement a day at anything you love, improves you 3800% a year. Most people don’t realize that. Our efforts can be small.

This year signalled the Scottish Government’s ‘Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology’, a year of special events and projects celebrating Scotland’s fascinating past. We wanted to make a real show of who we are and what we are capable of doing, and I think we have done just that. Looking back at the past year, I am very pleased with the progress being made by the Caithness Broch Project. So what did we do this year? Well, every day we were hard at work organising something broch-related, and, nineteen days into 2017, we made a trip across to BBC Radio Orkney to contribute to a fantastic programme for BBC Radio Shetland about the brochs of Scotland, featuring a number of notable archaeologists and academic speakers. It was rather humbling to be invited to the conversation – we are not ‘experts’ on the subject, after all. In May we were able to organise our first ever archaeological event! Working alongside Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk Programme, (SCHARP) we ran ‘Between the Brochs’ – a community-based archaeological walk-over survey along a stretch of Caithness coast, between the brochs of Skirza and Nybster. SCHARP’s mission is to record, investigate and in some cases rescue or protect sites across Scotland before they are lost to the sea, so we invited them to Caithness to admire our own fantastic coastal heritage, and help get the local community involved. Around 50 volunteers – from across Scotland- joined us across 4 days of fairly decent weather and intriguing archaeology, investigating sites including mills, crofts, fishing huts, carved stones, fossils, harbours, monuments, tangs, kilns, forts, tank traps, Viking settlements, castles and of course, our favourite, brochs! Of particular interest was the discovery of a sculptured stone, most likely by the farmer / artist / sculptor John Nicolson, who accompanied famous (or infamous) antiquarian Sir Frances Tress Barry on his numerous broch excavations. The event was a great success and we hope to see SCHARP in Caithness again soon. Also in May Iain Maclean spoke with the BBC Radio Scotland’s ‘Out of Doors’ team down at Ousdale Broch, discussing our plans to hep ‘save’ this broch. If you follow our newsletters or social media posts then you’ll know Ousdale Broch is one of our prime concerns – it is undoubtedly one of Caithness’ finest brochs, but has recently suffered a fair amount of collapse and damage. All of this started in 2016 when we discovered that the broch had fallen into disrepair. We spoke with Historic Environment Scotland who agreed to fund an ‘initial assessment’. HES also advised to tender for a ‘prioritised scheme of works’ – that is, a detailed plan as to how the broch will be consolidated and conserved, and how much it should cost. I am pleased to announce that HES were very recently (so recently, in fact, that I had to re-write this paragraph to announce the good news!) able to provide us with funding to go towards this report. In June, after working with local artist Kerrie Moncur, we were able to unveil our new Caithness Broch Trail leaflets, featuring a map of all the (known) brochs of Caithness. These leaflets act as an accompaniment to ‘standing stone’-style interpretive panels at 3 broch sites located at Achvarasdal, Keiss and Thing’s Va. The stones feature exclusive artwork by renowned archaeological illustrator Alan Braby as well as art by Caithness Horizons’ ‘Peter’s Pals’ Youth Group, and, earlier in August, we were able to erect our first stone panel at Achvarasdal, and last week we were able to install the stone at Keiss shoreline. It’s well worth visiting these amazing sites! Last year we were awarded £10,000 from Big Lottery Fund Scotland and £2,000 from Highland Council towards the creation of a business case and feasibility study for our ‘ultimate aim’, the construction of a replica broch. This piece of work was undertaken by Alan Jones Associates, and, in June 2017, this body of work was completed. This was an important step in realising our vision, and understanding the mechanics of how the broch would fare as a business. Would it work? Is this something worth investing in? Good news – the report states that our broch would be a sustainable venture! One of the most important aspects of this project was understanding where we should build the broch. This was, for us and for many others, the burning question! We were offered 5 sites, all along the east coast of Caithness, and by the ‘North Coast 500’ route. After many discussions we decided on a site at John O’Groats, beside to the John O’Groats Mill. A huge step forward in realising our ambitions! Arguably our most exciting project came to fruition in July – the Brick to the Past Lego Broch. The Broch was built by Dan Harris and James Pegrum of ‘Brick to the Past’, who specialise in making epic Lego sets, inspired by historical events – they’ve built sections of Hadrian’s Wall, castles, even Medieval towns – but the broch would be their biggest challenge yet. The broch was delivered intact (one Lego man fell out during the journey) and on time, so special thanks to Dan and James of Brick to the Past for their amazing Lego Broch construction. Our aim was to use the Lego broch as a way to introduce brochs to children (and us big kids too…) with schools in the area, as well as create a broch exhibition to introduce the general public to the ‘Home of the Broch’. Though we lacked in broch ‘finds’ – something we hope to remedy in the coming years with excavations of broch sites– we were still able to create an engaging an interesting exhibition, featuring an extremely popular ‘Iron Age Burial’ sandpit. The exhibition itself was a real group effort, and I’d like to thank Iain Maclean, Lisa Poulsen and Joanne Howdle especially for their energies and efforts in bringing it all together. Of course we would also like to thank Tamara Hicks for her amazing broch map mural! We were able to show children the 10,000-piece Lego broch, before working with ImmersiveMinds to get the children to build a digital broch on laptops - funded by the Spirit of Caithness and the Dounreay Communities Fund - using Minecraft, a popular digital building game. In all, we talked to over 750 pupils about brochs, and there were over 4,000 visitors to the Broch Exhibition. In August we commenced with the Caithness Broch Festival, a series of archaeological investigations at two broch sites in Caithness – Bruan Broch, just south of Whaligoe; and Thing’s Va Broch, a little west of Thurso. These brochs were chosen so that the festival had a ‘pan-Caithness’ feel, and would allow different part of the community to get involved. The festival was funded by Baillie Community Wind Farm Fund, Tannach and Camster Windfarm Fund and the Caithness North Sutherland Fund (NDA), allowing us to put together a number of events and activities alongside the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeological Institute. Throughout 2017 we provided several talks across Caithness and Scotland. In April we made the journey to Anstruther, 270 miles away, to provied a talk for Anstruther Rotary Club. In November Iain provided a talk for Wick Girl Guides whilst on the same day Kenneth provided a talk in Mull for Mull Archaeology and History Society and Mull Museum – two talks at the same time, 225 miles apart! In July, Kenneth and Iain spoke to an Icelandic tour group, our most international talk to date, whilst in August Kenneth spoke to several groups in a day – children from a number of schools, before chatting to the ladies of West Church - we are delighted to speak to people of all ages and interests, to groups large and small. We decided to go out with a flourish and organise a number of events (including the ‘Caithness Broch Festival’ excavations) in October. Our month of activities kicked off with a Highland Council Ranger-guided walked across Westerdale, which features surely one of the highest concentrations of brochs anywhere in Scotland. Following on from last year’s ‘Brochtoberfest’ in Orkney, we decided to cap off a fantastic year by organising a day of academic and archaeological guest speakers, hailing from all over Scotland – and even one from Bradford – to talk about brochs at Caithness Horizons, on the 21st October. The day was a sell-out and so it was great to see such an interest in the academic research into the brochs of Scotland. We simply wouldn’t get very far without support from the local community. And that includes local businesses who have been so helpful and supportive to our cause. Special thanks must go to JA Mackays and Coo’s Tail Gallery, who stock our various items at no profit to themselves and at no cost to us. Additionally, we’d like to especially thank local crafter Kelly Munro of Kelly Munro Jewellery for her super kind venture earlier in the year. Kelly made an exclusive range of brooches with £15 from each pin going to us – a fabulous gesture! Kelly had this to say about her wee project: At the heart of our 2017 events programme was a celebration of Caithness’ rich heritage and archaeological landscape. However, we were really eager to create events which would involve the community – we cannot hope to inspire tourists from across the world to visit here, without having at least an awareness of our own past. I believe that the heritage and archaeology of Caithness can be used to stimulate growth and success. There are already other groups out there doing sterling work – Dunbeath Heritage, Castlehill Heritage Centre, Caithness Horizons, Thurso Heritage Society and Wick Heritage Society, Yarrows Heritage Trust – and together, we can make Caithness an exciting place to visit and live – so here’s to an even more exciting 2018!

Dan Harris’s appointment as head of the club’s academy was made with little fanfare, but if his plans come off it will be an excellent addition. With a CV which is hard to believe for someone aged only 38, he brings experience accumulated in the Premier League, Champions League and England youth sides. Harris’s last posting was with Seoul E-Land and after completing his three-year contract there were offers to stay in Asia, but the job at United proved too tempting. “I’ve got a young family, so that was a factor,” he said. “I had chances to go elsewhere in Europe and the UK, but this was the role for me.” A quick talker with plenty to say, it is clear Harris has big plans. United have spent years repairing the damage done when the youth system was scrapped during their non-league days. A host of youth team graduates have made the first team, but few have become regulars and it is almost two decades since the crop including Dean Whitehead and Chris Hackett came through. Harris said: “There are some great things in place at this academy already, but there’s an awful lot where we can do more. “One of the big challenges we have is that a lot of the best talent in this county leeches out of it and we have the vultures circling from the category one clubs north and south of us. “We’ve got to make sure that best talent in Oxfordshire as much as possible stays here, because there’s nothing quite like having a home-grown boy made good.” It is a message most supporters will have heard before, but United’s new academy chief intends to go on the offensive. “The academy has to be more visible,” he said. “I don’t mean that in any way to be disrespectful to anyone involved in the academy for the last few years. “We have to be a viable option for parents who have the option to keep their son here in this county, or go further afield. “The first thing is they need to know what we’re doing and we’re offering something a bit different. “The danger of going to one of the big clubs with the bright lights, is you become lost in the system and you become just another statistic. “The numbers are damning in terms of the number of players who are out of the game by 21. “We have to make sure the relationships we have within this county are as strong as they can be. “I’m trying to find as many gatekeepers, missionaries and foot soldiers as I can – that means building relationships with people in local clubs, PE teachers in the schools. “Who are the people who know Oxfordshire football inside-out? “We’ve got to start in our own back yard and on top of that – and I try to say this without being bashful – we’re going to start looking a bit further afield and start putting pressure on other teams. “Rather than sitting here being passive and letting them come in and taking our best talent, we’ll start looking elsewhere.” The message of aiming high does not just apply to the club, but also to the individual players. Harris said: “What we need to create is a Champions League mentality. “If you look at people like Dele Alli, Adam Lallana, Daniel Sturridge, they all started at small academies – Bournemouth, Coventry, MK Dons. “The reality is the mentality has to be a Champions League mentality and I can say that because I’ve seen it. “I’ve been in the Premier League and the Champions League. “The reality is if boys aim there and miss it, then they might still play 300 games for Oxford. “What we’re looking to do is raise the expectation levels to say don’t limit your targets. “We’re a long way from that at the moment, but that has to be the mentality. “What I’ve learned over the years is if you want to go fast you go alone, if you want to go far you go together. “That’s important and we’ve got to take guys on a journey with us, but there’s no point being sheepish about it. “I’ve got high expectations for this academy and this club.” Last Updated: Are you sure you want to delete this comment?

Veteran ABC news anchor and self-proclaimed meditation evangelist Dan Harris is back with a second book, Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics, which has already made its way on to the New York Times bestseller list. For his sophomore title, co-written with meditation teacher Jeff Warren and journalist Carlye Adler, Harris goes beyond “simply demystifying meditation” to a how-to format aimed at “helping people get over the [meditation] hump and actually do the thing.” The best way to accomplish this, Harris and his 10% Happier podcast crew decide, is to embark on a 11-day cross-country journey on a rockstar tour bus (previously inhabited by the iconic seventies band Parliament-Funkadelic) in a modern version of a wandering retreat. Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics is a combination of true stories from people who’d like to meditate but don’t know where to start, practical meditation exercises, and the self-deprecating anecdotes we’ve come to expect from Harris. Here are five obstacles to meditating that Harris and his podcast team hear about along the way: 1. How do I find time to meditate? On the first day of the meditation road trip, Harris is live on a Top 40 syndicated radio show when he fields a call from a high school teacher named Brian, who asks how long it actually takes to meditate—10 minutes? 15 minutes? This important question comes up continually when Harris talks about meditation. “Once they grasp the benefits of the practice and realize that it doesn’t require clearing the mind, the next big problem is: How the hell do I fit this into my schedule?” Harris writes. Every minute counts, according to Harris, especially if it gets you coming back to the cushion, and he usually recommends that beginners practice for 5 to 10 minutes a day. To build up the habit, co-author Jeff Warren recommends a series of “free-range meditations,” that use activities throughout your day, such as brushing your teeth or washing the dishes, as brief opportunities for practice. 2. Will people think I’m weird? Harris and his 10% Happier crew were all set to interview park rangers at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia . . . until officials clammed up at the message that meditating federal employees might send. In a pinch, Harris called up Congressman Tim Ryan, a former quarterback, practicing Catholic, and open meditator whom Harris describes as a “one of the most normal, non-weird American male specimens you could imagine.” Ryan, who had learned the Christian centering prayer in his earlier years, turned to Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as a career politician on the edge of burnout, and had a profound experience of seeing his own thoughts arise. As for the “weirdness” factor, Ryan, who authored A Mindful Nation, says he has plenty of brain science to back up the practice—not to mention sports legends such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, who are both meditation believers. For his part, Harris writes that he’s convinced that meditation is the “next big public health revolution,” and that someday soon meditation practice will be just as mainstream as running or yoga 3. Meditation could bring up too many painful emotions. In Las Cruces, New Mexico, Dan and Jeff visit with therapists and social workers who work with disadvantaged children living with disabilities. Though meditation was encouraged by management, many of the staff members were afraid that looking inward could lead to an avalanche of difficult emotions. Physical therapist Zoe Gutierrez said she loves her challenging work, but says she’s more inclined to shut down after work than to reflect on the situations she sees every day. Instead of sweeping emotions further under the rug, meditation can help us address them proactively, Harris writes, adding that practice helps us “see them clearly rather than having them sally forth from their dark mental redoubts at a time of their choosing.” The exception, they write, is for people suffering from trauma, who are advised to speak with a mental health practitioner before beginning a meditation practice. 4. Meditation could make me too soft. Cruising around the streets of Tempe, Arizona, Harris introduces us to Sergeant Raj Johnson. Reflecting on the ever-present danger associated with the profession, as well as the negative attitudes toward police in the United States over the past few years, Johnson says he’s apprehensive that meditation could slow him down and affect his abilities to make split-second decisions. Johnson doesn’t have much of a choice when it comes to meditation, because his boss, Tempe Chief of Police Sylvia Moir, encourages her officers to practice, and has them trained in “combat breathing”— a deep breathing technique that can be used during or on the way to tense situations. And, Harris adds in the book, research shows that meditation can help people with dangerous jobs have better working memory, a lower level of cortisol release, and improved recovery time. In Harris’ words: meditation can give you an “edge” without the “edginess.” 5. Something else is my meditation. At the East Hollywood offices of InsideOUT Writers, a nonprofit that pairs professional writers with formerly incarcerated young people, Dan and Jeff lead a concentration meditation for the participants, followed by a writing session on their worries. We meet Mylrell Miner, who has a baby on the way and a broken-down car to fix, and Candice Price, who is feeling the pressure to take care of multiple family members who have recently been released from jail. Dan writes that he found the participants’ stories incredibly moving, and recognized that as a group they’re practicing a lot of the skills that meditation practice can cultivate, such as exploring strong emotions and treating others with compassion. When it comes to other activities, such as martial arts or running, replacing a formal sitting practice, Warren explains that meditation is like “life skills for dummies”—you can tune in and practice any activity mindfully. If you want to practice while you jog, Warren recommends setting a meditation time within the activity time and committing to being fully present (so no music or podcasts).

We are giving this same advice to companies that come to us wanting to switch suppliers after having learned that their existing supplier is copying and selling their products. We give this advice because over the years our China lawyers have repeatedly seen the following: So yes, switching your China manufacturer can be risky, at least when done without sufficient planning.

One way the self-described “unabashed meditation evangelist” pushed his message was a Time magazine essay on “How meditation can help in the era of angry politics.” Harris confessed “during one of the Trump-Clinton presidential debates I stress-ate a family-size bag of popcorn. I didn’t realize what I’d done until I looked down to see my feet surrounded by stray kernels. Nevertheless, I really do believe meditation can help you survive this season of discontent and division.” It\'s guaranteed all his stress was about Hillary losing. But here\'s the part to like: Harris describes the Robert Mueller probe as the dearest cause of the toxic Left. Conservatives want ""liberal tears,"" and liberals want Mueller to force Trump\'s impeachment: When you’re blinded by outrage, you’re unable to understand the views of people with whom you disagree. A consistent meditation practice can help you know your biases. Does your heart soar every time the Mueller probe inches closer to the White House? Or do you own a mug emblazoned with the words Liberal Tears? When you’re more aware of your own tribal instincts, you may be more inclined to venture out of your ideological bubble and examine opposing views. There are many liberals out there with an ""insane inner torrent,"" to borrow from the Harris conclusion: ""Sitting and watching your insane inner torrent puts you in touch with a fundamental truth: everything changes. This can be a bitter pill. Nothing lasts–not the dopamine hit from a fistful of popcorn, not even your life. But at a time of national tumult, a felt sense of impermanence can also be deeply comforting."" Please support NewsBusters today!

Bianca Barratt picks the best books on mindfulness and meditation to give you a helping hand In an increasingly busy world, it can be hard to forget our daily stresses and find moments of inner calm. The term 'mindfulness' has become the word du jour recently, but what does it actually mean? Using expert advice to guide you to greater inner peace and wellbeing can be really useful, but also daunting; after all, it's not likely that you're going to up sticks and move to a Tibetan monastery any time soon. We've rounded up 11 of the most accessible mindfulness and meditation books that can help anyone to lead a more peaceful life. 10% Happier by Dan Harris Mindfulness isn’t all chiming gongs and healing crystals, as Dan Harris found out when he dipped his toe into the pool of Meditation. Having paved a career as a highly successful newsroom anchor and war correspondent, Harris had always prided himself on his restless mind and relentless energy. That is, until it all went a bit wrong. Diving straight into the moment he suffered a panic attack live on Good Morning America, Harris relays his own journey from ambivalence to enlightenment with self-depreciating humour.

Take my advice I’m only tryin’ to school ya. Smiling faces, Smiling Faces, Sometimes they don’t tell the truth. Smiling Faces Sometimes, by The Undisputed Truth Not a month goes by without some company telling one of our China lawyers how great their relationship is with their Chinese counter-party, be it the Chinese company with which they are contemplating a joint venture or the Chinese company that manufactures their widgets. As lawyers, our thoughts upon hearing this sort of thing tend to be as follows: 1. Great. Truly great. It is always better to have a good relationship with the companies with which you do business, be that company be in China or in Peoria. I am always saying that “we can draft the world’s best contract, but if it is with a crook, it won’t be worth the paper on which it is printed.” So yes, the character of those with whom you do business does matter. A lot. 2. But to us as lawyers, that you are friends with your Chinese counter-party or that you have a great relationship is legally irrelevant. We have been trained to ask the what ifs and the what ifs here are easy-peasy (sorry, but I just wrapped up season two of Stranger Things, which BTW, is every bit as good as season one). The what ifs here are easy for us because we deal with them pretty much every day, usually in one of the following two situations: Either way, we as lawyers can help a company having to deal with one of the above situations if they have written documents to protect them. And if they don’t, we typically can’t help them. Contracts are generally written when the relationship among the contracting parties is good. There are three reasons why it makes sense to have a contract with your Chinese counter-party — even if your relationship with it is great: 1. Clarity. The first is to achieve clarity. To make sure you and the Chinese company are on the same page. For example, if you ask your Chinese supplier if it can get you your product in 20 days, it will say “yes” pretty much every time. But if you put in your contract that the product needs to ship in 20 days AND for every day it is late, the Chinese company must pay you 10% of the value of the order, there is a great chance the Chinese company will get honest with you and tell you that 20 days is impossible. At that point, you and the Chinese company can figure out what is realistic and then you know what to expect, realistically, going forward. Needless to say, I can give countless examples of this sort of thing, but this is yet another reason why we advocate putting your contract in Chinese (and not just translated). Clarity before you start the relationship. It is more important than you think and it totally makes sense no matter how good your relationship may be. 2. Stricture. The second benefit of having a contract with your Chinese counter-party is that it will likely bring that company to heel. By this I mean that just having a well written contract that is at least potentially enforceable means that the Chinese company knows exactly what it must do to comply. And, in most cases, it might as well. Let’s use the 20 day example as the example here as well. If your Chinese manufacturer makes widgets for 25 foreign companies and 5 of those have very clear time deadlines with a very clear liquidated damages provision, and the Chinese company starts falling behind on production, to which companies will the Chinese manufacturer give production priority? Of course it will put the five companies with a good contract at the front of the line and that is relevant even if you have a good relationship. Or are you willing to go to the back of the line because your Chinese counter-party believes you are the safe one to delay because of your good relationship? 3. Enforceability. You may at some point need to sue your “friend” and if you do it will help to have a China contract that works. And for those who do not believe China is good with contracts, note that the World Bank ranks China 5th (yes 5) among 183 countries in terms of enforcing contracts. Dan Harris is internationally regarded as a leading authority on legal matters related to doing business in China and in other emerging economies in Asia.

So it’s a relief to discover Meditation For Fidgety Skeptics by Dan Harris, the US newscaster whose earlier book, 10% Happier, chronicled his adventures in meditation following an on-air panic attack. This new book isn’t mainly about how to meditate, but how to actually meditate – how to make yourself sit down and do the damn thing; in that sense, it’s really a manual for cultivating any good habit. Specifically, the book makes the case for transforming how we think about “falling off the wagon”. In most approaches to habit change, unsurprisingly, falling off the wagon is seen as a bad thing. (In Alcoholics Anonymous, which has much to answer for here, it’s exceedingly bad.) But Harris argues that sometimes it’s not just excusable, it’s essential. Meditation teachers are generally warm and smiley people, and they explain basic meditation in a warm and smiley way: sit comfortably, close your eyes, pay attention to the sensations of your breath, and if you get distracted, don’t beat yourself up; just gently return your attention to the breath. But this isn’t just them being nice about your ineptitude. Getting distracted genuinely isn’t a problem; indeed, noticing when you’re distracted is arguably the whole point – the very moment in which the skill of meditation is developed, equivalent to the moment that you pick up a dumbbell at the gym. “Every time you catch yourself wandering and escort your attention back to the breath, it is like a biceps curl for the brain,” Harris writes. “It is also a radical act: you’re breaking a lifetime’s habit of walking around in a fog of rumination and projection, and you are actually focusing on what’s happening right now.” Getting back on the wagon, over and over, is the practice. And good luck doing that if you haven’t fallen off first. A similar logic applies to establishing a daily meditation habit, or many other habits, such as physical exercise. If you stop doing it for a while, and then notice that you’re feeling more crotchety, tired or downcast, you’ll have a strong motivation to return to it – far stronger than trying to force things using willpower. Or maybe you’d like to get better at listening to your partner, or not checking your phone during meals, or whatever; again, the more times you notice you’ve failed, the more you’re entraining exactly the presence of mind the new habit requires. You might think of this as a kind of superhabit, which makes acquiring any new habit easier. If you can turn falling off the wagon into an integral part of the process – even to learn to relish the experience of climbing back aboard – you’ll be using your failure as fuel for success.

And despite the fact that Democrats were bragging that they had the votes to do it, the liberal network trashed Republicans and touted how President Trump would take all the blame. “The government is not going to stay closed forever. The question is how long will it take. And you can see the argument on both sides. As our polls show, you guys showed it, people coming into this debate believe the President and Republicans will be to blame by a wide wide margin,” hyped Clinton lackey George Stephanopoulos while he was giving his “analysis."" Yet there was no mention the CNN poll from Friday that showed that 56 percent of Americans don\'t believe DACA was worth the shutdown. Even before Stephanopoulos started mouthing off, the network was pouring on the partisan hyperbole. Correspondent David Wright introduced his segment on the shutdown by bemoaning about an early morning Trump tweet that praised Congressional Republicans and knocked Democrats. “That gives you a sense of where we stand on this shutdown: Not even close to resolving things,” he whined. And when the video started to play, Wright declared that because of the shutdown “lady liberty [was] on lockdown” when it was just closed. “The ultimate symbol of a partisan battle over immigration so intense it has ground the federal government to a standstill,” he continued to opine. When presenting the arguments of both sides, Wright treated the Republican claims of Democrats holding the American people hostage as just inflammatory rhetoric. But he treated Democratic smears with the utmost seriousness. “The Democrats accuse the President of negotiating in bad faith,” he echoed. “They insist the shutdown is proof the Republicans aren\'t fit to govern.” He then played a clip of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) blaming the Washington State train derailment on Trump, even though it was Congress, under Obama, who voted to push off the safety requirements. Wright mocked Trump for declaring that “now arrives the hour of action” one year ago during his inauguration speech. “Instead of action there\'s now a full-scale government shutdown,” he chided. “During the 2013 government shutdown, citizen Trump accused President Obama of failing to lead,” he continued before playing a clip of himself at a White House press conference snidely asking: “Why isn\'t he following his own advice?” After the report was over, co-anchor Dan Harris asked Wright about a White House answering machine message that said: “Thank you for calling the White House. Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because Congressional Democrats are holding government funding including funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate.” “This is one of the many ways the normal business of government has been weaponized for politics,” he sneered. In addition to trashing Trump and Republicans over the shutdown, ABC highlighted a ridiculous poll they conducted that purported to show that nearly half the country thought Trump was insane. “Trump\'s approval rating right now, historically low. Also, we have nearly half of Americans questioning his mental stability and nearly two-third rejecting his assertion that he\'s a genius,” touted Harris. There was no mention of the fact that a recent medical test proved that liberal media narrative fake news. The relevant portions of the Transcript are below: ABC Good Morning America January 21, 2018 8:02:59 AM [Government shutdown: 4 minutes 51 seconds] (…) DAVID WRIGHT: Good morning Dan and Paula as the government shutdown enters day two the President is up and tweeting saying: “Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our military and safety along the border. Democrats just want illegal immigrants to pour in the country.” That gives you a sense of where we stand on this shutdown: Out even close to resolving things. [Cuts to video] This morning lady liberty on lockdown. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I think it\'s dumb on both sides. WRIGHT: The ultimate symbol of a partisan battle over immigration so intense it has ground the federal government to a standstill. MITCH MCCONNELL: Day one of the Senate Democrats’ government shutdown. WRIGHT: Republicans accuse the Democrats of holding the nation hostage. For the sake of illegal immigrants. (…) WRIGHT: The Trump campaign released this inflammatory ad suggesting the Democrats will have blood on their hands. AD: Democrats who stand it our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants. WRIGHT: The Democrats accuse the President of negotiating in bad faith. CHUCK SCHUMER: Negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with jello. WRIGHT: They insist the shutdown is proof the Republicans aren\'t fit to govern. NANCY PELOSI: He promised infrastructure, he gave us a train wreck. Now one-year anniversary, a big fat failure, F for that first year. WRIGHT: One year after President Trump vowed to end Washington gridlock once and for all-- DONALD TRUMP: The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. WRIGHT: Instead of action there\'s now a full-scale government shutdown. Many federal workers have been through this before. (…) WRIGHT: During the 2013 government shutdown, citizen Trump accused President Obama of failing to lead. TRUMP: You have to get everybody in the room and you have to be a lead. The president has to lead. WRIGHT: Why isn\'t he following his own advice? (…) WRIGHT: As of today the idea of a bipartisan deal seems like a lost art in Washington. (…) DAN HARRIS: David, you mentioned in your story that the Trump camp released the new ad criticizing Democrats saying they’ll have blood on their hands if there are murders by illegal immigrants. They also tinkered with the voice message at the White House. So if you call the White House you get a special message. What\'s going on there? WRIGHT: Yeah. This is one of the many ways the normal business of government has been weaponized for politics. If you call into the White House switchboard, this is what you hear. VOICE MESSAGE: Thank you for calling the White House. Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because Congressional Democrats are holding government funding including funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate. WRIGHT: Go figure. All any of us can do is hope with the rest of the country this thing is over quickly. (…) PAULA FARIS: Do you think they\'re actually going to get something done and compromise here? GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, they\'re going to have to eventually. The government is not going to stay closed forever. The question is how long will it take. And you can see the argument on both sides. As our polls show, you guys showed it, people coming into this debate believe the President and Republicans will be to blame by a wide wide margin. But the White House believes they have the better argument going forward to this idea the Democrats are holding the government hostage for illegal immigration. What complicates that is that many Republicans, at least four Republicans did not vote to keep the government open either on Friday. The question is, if Republicans can get unified they might be able to figure out a way to get to the next step. (…) HARRIS: Let\'s just dig into the ABC/Washington Post poll that you referenced. Trump\'s approval rating right now, historically low. Also, we have nearly half of Americans questioning his mental stability and nearly two-third rejecting his assertion that he\'s a genius. How damaging is this dynamic to his overall agenda? (…) Please support NewsBusters today!

Dan,Harris,['https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2018/02/03/how-distraction-can-make-you-a-better-meditator-and-more-from-one-of-americas-biggest-meditation-advocates/'],b'800',"['Dan Harris is the co-anchor of ABC’s Nightline and the weekend editions of Good Morning America. His first book, “10% Happier,” was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller. He later launched the 10% Happier podcast and an app called 10% Happier to help people learn meditation. His new book “Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics: A 10% Happier How-to Book,” co-authored with meditation teacher Jeff Warren, addresses common roadblocks to starting a meditation practice. Harris is interviewed here by Emma Seppala, Science Director of the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at Stanford University. Dan, you famously had a panic attack on live TV. This incident led you to delve into meditation as a way to manage your anxiety. In person, you always give off a sense of calm — even though you are very busy. How has your life changed thanks to meditation? [Harvard neuroscientist: Meditation not only reduces stress, here’s how it changes the brain] Harris: I would say the biggest difference for me is not being so owned by my emotions. I still experience plenty of difficult emotions — most notably for me is anger. But it’s like you have an inner meteorologist who can see the storm before it makes landfall. You’re less likely to be carried away by it. That makes a huge difference. [Neuroscientist and prominent atheist] Sam Harris talks about the “half-life” of anger: the amount of damage you can do in an hour of anger vs. 2 minutes is an incredible reduction in so many ways. I’m definitely of the view that meditation is not a miracle cure (thus the “10%” idea). You are building up the skill of seeing clearly what is happening in your head so on the one hand you don’t get knocked around by it and on the other you get better and better at it. The core of my whole side hustle as a meditation proponent is that the mind is trainable. People don’t point this out in Western culture. All the things we want most — happiness, calm, patience, gratitude, compassion, peace of mind — these aren’t factory settings you can tinker with but skills you can work on. That’s an incredibly radical and empowering notion. Dan, you wrote your NYT best-selling book “10% Happier” to get people to meditate. Then you realized there are all sorts of things that stop people from meditating. You then wrote this new book to address the stumbling blocks and misconceptions people have about meditation. What do you think is the biggest misconception out there? [I tried mindfulness to quit drinking. It actually worked.] Harris: The biggest misconception — which is a true misunderstanding — is the idea that you have to clear your mind. There are thousands of kinds of meditation. The one I talk about is mindfulness, which involves sitting in a reasonably quiet place and focusing on the feeling of your breath coming in and out. Every time you get distracted, you start over again — and again and again. For many people, the moment they get distracted their ego tells them that they are failed meditators. What you need to know is that the moment you notice you were distracted, that’s a victory! It means you’re doing it correctly. You’re noticing again and again how distractible or emotional or negative you tend to be. The result is that you aren’t so yanked around by these tendencies. That’s an incredibly important and powerful process. The biggest obstacle — also a misconception — to meditation is that meditation requires a bunch of time. People often tell me that they’d like to meditate but don’t have time. The answer there is that I have good news and better news. Five to ten minutes a day is a great meditation habit and scientists agree that even this short amount of time allows you to access the benefits: a boosted immune system, less vulnerability to anxiety and depression, etc. The even better news: If you feel like five to 10 minutes is too much, one minute counts. Really. In this book, you went out on the road to meet everyday Americans and share insights about meditation. We learn about the twists and turns (some very funny) of this journey in your book. How would you sum up your experience of this trip looking back on it now? Harris: Eye-opening. You see the depth of the misunderstandings and the difficulties people face in adopting a simple habit that is manifestly beneficial. Evolution did not bequeath us a brain and a mind that is good at adopting long-term healthy habits. We evolved to detect threats on the savanna and to find sources of pleasures like food and sexual partners so we could pass on our DNA. It’s really hard for us to do the things we need to do to take care of ourselves. [You’re missing out on your experiences. A meditation expert explains how to live in the moment.] I learned a lot about how to work around these impediments to give people a whole variety of tools — a panoply of approaches — that are flexible and elastic and can help people. For me, adopting meditation was reasonably easy. That’s not to say that I’m disciplined; in the not too distant past I ate so many Oreos that I woke up that night and puked. But because I suffered with anxiety and depression my whole life, I embraced the habit much more easily when I saw the data around how meditation can help and when I noticed the benefits in my own life. I underestimated how hard it can be for people from social workers to celebrities to cops of various ages and gender and races to sit and meditate. Dan you have a wonderful sense of humor that your ABC viewers love (as do I). Has meditation made you funnier? Harris: I feel like it makes me more spontaneous. My best moments are when I can get out of my own inner planning and rumination and focus on whatever is happening right now. Doing so has immeasurably boosted my ability to respond spontaneously. I work in a TV context and do a lot of interviews that are unscripted and live — I learned to systematically get out of my own way. I found out that when I’m not always feverishly planning on what I’m going to say next, something useful and maybe even funny can come up. [Do these exercises for two minutes a day and you will immediately feel happier] It’s interesting to watch how that happens. I’m not perfect at doing it. There are times when I get nervous or distracted or stuck in a rabbit hole of worry or even wake up on the wrong side of the bed. But it’s very interesting for me to notice that I can trust that something will come if I’m not tying myself up in knots. It’s never really let me down. I’m confident this has nothing to do with me. Someone told me once that one of the translations of the way Tibetans talk about enlightenment is “clearing the way and bringing forth,” which is what we’re talking about here: Clearing away the self-referential chatter and bringing forth our universal ability to respond wisely. Now you have made it your mission to bring meditation to our everyday lives. It’s one thing to receive the benefits from a practice like meditation but what inspired you to want to share and teach meditation to others? Harris: I was reading a bunch of books [on meditation] that were excellent but also a little cloying and syrupy. I had an entrepreneurial hunch that if I could write a book with a little bit more of a skeptical and even cynical tone, it might appeal to people like me. There are no original ideas in my book, my innovation is that I tell jokes, add the f-word and tell embarrassing stories about myself. That’s really what made me want to get in the game. The second reason is having experienced the benefits meditation personally and waking up to the fact that the mind is trainable. That fact is what keeps me in the game beyond the initial impulse. When I talk to people and see them light up when they tell me how their lives change as a consequence of meditation, it is incredible. Or seeing those stories on my Twitter feed.

Key Quotes “Spending on debit and credit cards rose strongly in November, beating market expectations. In addition, spending in October was revised higher. Spending growth has picked up after a flat patch through the middle of 2017.” “Retail card spending rose by 1.2%, beating even our top of the range forecast of 0.8%. The total was boosted by a 5% rise in fuel spending, which was in line with the rise in petrol prices over the month. Spending in the core retail categories rose by 0.8%, led by a 1.2% rise in both durables and hospitality, and a 2.7% rise in clothing.” “November was filled with anecdotes of retailers increasingly adopting the US trend of 'Black Friday' sales. However, the jury is out on whether this leads to more spending or simply shifts the timing of spending.” “One factor that may have contributed to the recent pickup in consumer spending is the link to housing wealth. House prices flattened out over the first half of this year but have picked up again in recent months, and card spending has more or less followed suit.” “The strength of the housing market is a critical part of our outlook for the New Zealand economy. We expect that the new Government's policies aimed at cooling housing demand will see house prices fall slightly in 2018, which in turn would dampen growth in consumer spending.” Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

Amy,Walter,['http://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/01/07/there-are-many-reasons-mitt-romney-might-run-for-the-senate-and-many-why-he-might-not/'],b'796',"['Being in the arena during a time of political turmoil might be the biggest draw. But Romney would be a junior senator among 100. Washington • Mitt Romney doesn’t want the first line of his obituary to read that he was a failed presidential candidate. And he doesn’t want to simply fade away. There are many reasons Romney may launch a 2018 bid for the Senate — and a few why he might not. But one of the driving motivations for the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and now-Utah resident to pursue a Senate seat is a sense that he still has a part to play, and, at a critical time in American politics, he doesn’t want to sit on the sideline. He yearns to serve. “At his core, that’s who he is,” says Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report, which analyzes congressional races. “He wants to be a public servant. He enjoys politics — not from the way that political junkies enjoy politics, the watching each and every political move from a strategic perspective — he’s a guy who enjoys being involved in politics because of his impact in politics.” People close to Romney say he hasn’t decided whether he will run for the seat now that Sen. Orrin Hatch says he’ll retire when his term ends early next year. But they expect that Romney will make a decision soon, and supporters are laying the groundwork should he jump in. And, so far, it appears that other potential Republican candidates, such as U.S. Reps. Chris Stewart and Mia Love, appear to be waiting to see what Romney does before making their own decision. The former Massachusetts governor has made his home in Holladay for more than four years and has been a regular, albeit inconsistent, presence in state and federal politics. Most famously, he’s been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, at one point denouncing him as “a phony, a fraud” during a speech at the University of Utah. At another, he said Trump’s actions would lead to “trickle-down racism.” But Trump and Romney have talked at least twice in the past month, with Trump encouraging Romney to run in their latest call, according to a source close to the White House. Some key Utah politicians have also urged Romney to step forward, including Hatch. Beyond the decision of whether he’ll launch a bid, the next big question is whether Romney would campaign and serve as an anti-Trump voice or whether he would try to find some middle ground with this president. “I don’t see him coming here as a way to be a thorn in the side of Donald Trump,” Walter says. “He sees it as a role to be taken seriously. He takes very seriously the separate branches of government role. His job isn’t to be a rubber stamp, but not be a gadfly either.” If Romney mounts a campaign, he’s likely to dominate the race, given his popularity in Utah, where he earned 72 percent of the vote in his 2012 presidential campaign against then-President Barack Obama. Romney would be a junior senator without the seniority to land key committee assignments, but as a nationally known leader he would instantly earn the spotlight and a megaphone. He also would be less reliant on the party apparatus or the goodwill of the president than many lesser-known senators. In a body where Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 advantage, Romney could be influential if he plays the role of his party’s moderate standard-bearer. “A good way to make a clear contrast to Trump and demonstrate leadership is to be a strong and principled conservative voice of reason,” says Doug Heye, a CNN contributor and former spokesman for the Republican National Committee. “That’s especially true today in light of Trump’s latest tweets and his fight with [former White House chief strategist Steve] Bannon. There are a lot of loud, angry voices out there at a time when we need more calm voices.” Then again, Romney may not want to deal with all of that. He has always been the boss — he was a business executive, head of the 2002 Winter Olympics, a governor and presidential candidate — whereas in the Senate he’d be one among 100. He did run for the Senate in 1994, losing to Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts, but taking on a Senate schedule would be taxing. He’d likely be flying between Utah and Washington every week and dealing with a gaggle of reporters stalking him through the halls of Congress asking him to respond to the latest presidential tweet. He won’t get to set the agenda, rather he’d be more often reacting to the proposals and ideas of others. He now has the freedom to decide his schedule and pick the issues he weighs in on and the venues where he speaks, which have increasingly been well-thought-out Facebook posts. Still, Romney may relish the chance to be in the arena in this political climate. As someone who has already run for president and served as a governor, one could definitely see Romney calling balls and strikes on policy and political issues coming out of the White House,” says Ron Bonjean, a Republican political consultant. Boyd Matheson, the president of the Utah-based Sutherland Institute who had considered but later declined to run for the Senate, told U.S. News & World Report that he spoke to Romney about a possible bid in September. Matheson says he doesn’t expect Romney, if he runs, to just be a Trump critic and that he’d make deals with the president if elected. Matheson added that Romney would be a major player. If paired with his former vice presidential running mate and now-House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the two would be a formidable duo. “Imagine Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan having a bigger influence on one end of Pennsylvania Avenue than they would have on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Imagine a Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan Congress,” Matheson told the newsmagazine. “That is a face of the Republican Party that’s very interesting.” If there is to be a Sen. Romney, he may not arrive in Washington as the Never Trump guy, though he wouldn’t be beholden to the president, either. “He is someone who is not afraid to speak out when he needs to,” says Walter, the political handicapper. And since Romney already has a big national following and stature in his party, he would be a voice people listened to on Day One. “In some ways,” Walter says, “it gives you incredible freedom.” tburr@sltrib.com']",0.0,23.0,1.9166666666666667,0.0,1023578.0,1

Tom Cotton, Nov. 19, 2017. Immigration talks between the White House, Congressional Republicans and Democrats accelerated this week as lawmakers worked toward a legislative fix on DACA, a program extending legal status to some undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children that President Trump is ending, effective March 31. The conversation about immigration has also touched on border security and some broader reforms, but it was thrown off course Thursday, when Mr. Trump reportedly made a derogatory comment about African and Caribbean nations during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers. Meanwhile, Congress had its hands full otherwise: the House reauthorized a controversial intelligence tool that allows U.S. spy agencies to spy on some foreign citizens. And lawmakers in both chambers continued working to pass a spending bill and head off a government shutdown next week. The president also granted a temporary extension of the Iran nuclear deal on Friday, and mused in an interview with the Wall Street Journal about his ""very good relationship"" with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. This Sunday on ""Face the Nation,"" we\'ll talk with Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, who has attended multiple meetings with the president on immigration throughout the past year and has proposed his own plan that eliminates the visa lottery system and cuts legal immigration by 50 percent over a decade. Cotton was in the meeting on Thursday, but he claims he didn\'t recall the president making a derogatory statement about African and Caribbean countries. We\'ll ask him about the immigration debate and the White House\'s handling of foreign hot spots such as Iran and North Korea. We\'ll also hear from Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, on the potential solutions and hurdles lawmakers face in discussions over spending and immigration reform. Gardner, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, will also weigh in on North Korea and the 2018 midterms. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, will join the program to talk about President Trump\'s remarks, the immigration debate, and the budget. Known as a lawmaker willing to work across the aisle, we\'ll ask Sen. Manchin about what areas on immigration he sees Congress finding compromise on. Ahead of the first anniversary of the Trump administration, CBS News Election and Surveys Director Anthony Salvanto will bring us a new Nation Tracker poll numbers on the state of public opinion in the country – including data on the president, the economy, race relations, and much more.

FAQ - Privacy Policy"", 'Price matters. That’s the takeaway from a look at the 10 priciest residential sales of 2017. Like years past, the list was dominated by new developments. But 2017’s most expensive deals also included several resales with major price chops. Take the Pierre’s triplex penthouse that finally sold for $44 million after asking $125 million, and the actress Demi Moore’s triplex at the San Remo, which traded for $45 million, down from $75 million. Overall, this year’s top 10 added up to $552.9 million in sales — a 6.8 percent jump from last year’s $517.4 million, largely due to this week’s $91.1 million deal at 432 Park Avenue. Before that late-in-the-year sale, however, things were looking considerably less rosy thanks to the (well-documented) slowdown in the new development market. New development sales citywide are projected to hit $8.1 billion by the end of 2017, down from $9.3 billion in 2016, according to residential brokerage CityRealty. The firm also said the average new development price dropped to $4.7 million in 2017 from a record $5 million in 2016. Still, new development buildings including 432 Park Avenue, 56 Leonard And 443 Greenwich Street logged big-ticket closings in 2017 (though, it should be noted that several of those contracts were signed several years ago). Like last year, 432 Park stood out with four of the year’s top 10 residential sales. This year’s top deal, the trio of penthouses, surpassed last year’s $87.7 million penthouse at 432 Park which is reportedly owned by Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair. And a slew of big-ticket properties that went into contract recently could boost 2018’s numbers. Earlier this month, a buyer went into contract to pay $80 million for 12 East 69th Street, the townhouse owned by Vincent Viola, CEO of Virtu Financial and owner of the Florida Panthers who was also President Trump’s first nominee for Secretary of the U.S. Army. Sources told the Wall Street Journal the buyer paid $50.5 million for Bob Diamond’s penthouse at 15 Central Park West. And two units at Zeckendorf Development’s 520 Park Avenue, each asking more than $70 million, went into contract in June. Excluding any last-minute deals in 2017, here’s a rundown of this year’s top sales. The ranking is based on The Real Deal’s analysis of data from the Department of Finance, On-Line Residential and news reports. 432 Park Avenue 1. 432 Park Avenue, #92, #92B, #93B | $91.1 million An unknown buyer stitched together three units, sprawling 11,906 square feet over the 92nd and 93rd floors of the condo tower, for $91.1 million in December. The unknown buyer had entered a contract earlier this month for the condos, which were asking a combined $120 million. The purchase price comes out to $7,651 per square foot — considerably less than other luxury pads, including ones in 432 Park, too. 2. 432 Park Avenue, #85 | $65.7 million A mystery buyer using the name Parklight LLC rang in 2017 by shelling out $65.7 million — or $8,144 per foot — for a condo at 432 Park. The sale, which closed in January, became the building’s third-priciest to date. Besides the recently sold three-condo spread, the most expensive is the $87.7 million unit reportedly snapped up by Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair in 2016. Records show Parklight LLC went into contract on Unit 85 in 2013. The full-floor condo, which never hit the market, has five bedrooms, a library and a wood-burning fireplace. 3. 432 Park Avenue, #83 | $65.2 million Hong Kong billionaire Lawrence Ho bet big on 432 Park — and snagged an 83rd-floor condo for $65.2 million in March 2017. Through a corporation dubbed Valor Dragon Limited, the CEO of Melco International Development went into contract on the pad in 2015. Ho — the son of legendary gambling executive Stanley Ho — is worth $1.7 billion, according to Forbes. Coincidentally, unit 83 is a bit of a gamble, according to a lawsuit filed in January, which claims the 83rd through 85th floors of the building were damaged in a flood. 15 Central Park West 4. 960 Fifth Avenue, #3AB | $55 million Talk about underpriced: Art dealer Robert Ellsworth’s palatial co-op at 960 Fifth Avenue sold for $55 million in May — $18 million over the asking price of $35 million. The full-floor unit has 22 rooms including four bedrooms with multiple fireplaces. Ellsworth, who died in 2014, lived at the Rosario Candela-designed building for more than three decades with his longtime companion, Masahiro Hashiguchi, a Japanese chef who was the trustee of his estate. The buyer isn’t entirely clear: Carlos Alejandro Pérez Dávila, whose family controlled beer conglomerate SABMiller, was listed in records as the purchaser. But David Millstone, co-CEO of Standard Industries and his wife, Jennifer, daughter of retail mogul Samuel Heyman, were reportedly the secret buyers of the pad, the New York Post reported. 5. 50 East 69th Street | $52 million Apollo Global Management co-founder Joshua Harris purchased the townhouse at 50 East 69th Street, listed by Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens, for $52 million. 6. 15 Central Park West, #PH40B | $50.6 million A top executive from Chinese development firm Radiance Group snagged Bob Diamond’s $50.5 million penthouse at 15 Central Park West. Records show the buyer — listed as Senza Nome LLC — paid $50.6 million, or $9,568 per foot. Senza Nome is associated with Gongwen Dong, CFO of Radiance Property Holdings Ltd., who followed up the 15 CPW purchase by buying a $33 million pad at 432 Park. Diamond, the former CEO of Barclays, bought the condo for $37 million in 2009. The 5,278-square-foot unit has four bedrooms, a 34-foot gallery, library and eat-in kitchen.

Delaware-based Uticon Investment Holdings LLC paid $6,026 per square foot for the spread, which has four bedrooms, a library, conservatory and exercise room. The jenga-like tower has been more than a decade in the making. But after stalling during the financial crisis, Alexico brought Hines on board in 2013. Closings began in 2016. The San Remo on the Upper West Side 8. San Remo, #2627C | $45 million Two years after listing her triplex at the San Remo, the actress Demi Moore sold the 17-room co-op to a buyer identified in records only as M2 Trust. The $45 million price — though well below Moore’s initial asking price of $75 million — was enough to become the building’s priciest-ever deal. Moore’s ex-husband, Bruce Willis, reportedly paid $7 million for the apartment more than 25 years ago. The actress listed the property in 2015, telling the New York Times the unit was “too magnificent not to be lived in full time.” 9. 432 Park Avenue, #84B | $44.6 million A “catastrophic flood” at 432 Park Avenue nearly derailed the deal, but tequila heir Juan Beckmann Vidal managed to close on his 84th-floor pad at 432 Park Avenue in May. In 2016, Vidal had sued Macklowe Properties and CIM Group after a flood damaged the apartment, and at the time requested his $11.6 million deposit back. Records show Vidal, whose family founded Jose Cuervo, paid around $8,227 per foot for the half-floor pad. Vidal has and his family are worth $5.6 billion, according to Forbes. 10. The Pierre, #PH | $44 million Barbara Zweig’s triplex at the penthouse was once the city’s most expensive listing, asking $125 million in 2013. After four years and multiple price cuts, buyer 795 Properties, LLC paid just $44 million (or $3,666 per foot) for the 12,000-square-foot spread. The late financier Martin Zweig purchased the 16-room triplex in 1999 for $21.5 million, a record at the time. (Zweig listed it in 2004 for $70 million, but it never sold.) The pad, which spans the top three floors of the Pierre, was once the hotel’s ballroom. It has a library, four terraces and a private elevator. 433 Greenwich Street 11. 443 Greenwich Street, #PH | $43.9 million Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton scored two private parking spaces along with the $44 million penthouse at 443 Greenwich Street, the A-list magnet in Tribeca. The triplex — originally asking $54 million — hit the market last year. Spanning 8,900 square feet, it has five bedrooms and a 3,246-square-foot terrace with a plunge pool and kitchen. The star-studded 443 Greenwich, developed by Nathan Berman’s MetroLoft, has been a magnet for celebrities like Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, as well as Jennifer Lawrence. “Suffice it to say, 90 percent of our buyers are household names,” Berman has said.

The buyer — 432 Park Joy LLC — went into contract on units 92, 92B and 93B on Dec. 4, according to public records. With a total of 11,906 square feet spread over two floors, the units were asking a combined $120 million. Until now, the priciest deal at Macklowe Properties and CIM Group’s supertall was a penthouse that traded for $87.7 million last year. Sources said the buyer was Saudi retail magnate Fawaz Al Hokair. That deal was unusual in that CIM provided a loan for $56 million, nearly two-thirds of the purchase price. Sign up for China Watch for weekly emails on Chinese real estate investments. The latest deal will combined three units — each asking more than $40 million — spread over the 92nd and 93rd floors. The Corcoran Group’s Susanna Lendrum represented the buyer. The purchase price works out to $7,651 per square foot — a relative steal compared to other big-ticket deals. Al Hokair reportedly paid $10,623 per foot for the top penthouse last year. In July, real estate executive Gongwen Dong — who also bought Bob Diamond’s condo at 15 Central Park West — scooped up an 86th-floor condo at 432 Park for $33 million, or $8,190 per foot. Douglas Elliman’s Richard Steinberg, Sabrina Saltiel, Roger Erickson and Shari Scharfer-Rollins are marketing the project for Macklowe Properties and CIM Group.

Bernard,Osher,['https://www.ptreyeslight.com/article/lecture-series-seniors-sheds-light-reconstruction'],b'771',"['Jump to navigation The Thirteenth Amendment, one of the three reconstruction amendments created in the aftermath of the Civil War, was adopted 152 years ago this week. That fact was not lost on Mick Chantler, a historian from Sonoma and an authority on the War of the Rebellion, Honest Abe and baseball. Next month he will teach a class for seniors at the Dance Palace titled “Reconstruction and Recovery: the Post-Civil War South.” The lecture series, offered through Dominican University, explores topics such as an ill-prepared Andrew Johnson following the assassination of his predecessor, carpetbaggers, the Scopes Trial and the persistence of racism. “Mississippi didn’t ratify the Thirteenth Amendment until about 20 years ago,” he said. “The fact that they held out that long is a symbolic statement, a screw-you to Yankee northern liberals. ‘We’re going to stay the same!’” Mr. Chantler is a longtime educator who ran the career center at Sonoma Valley High School for decades and now teaches through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, a program supported by the Bernard Osher Foundation that encourages adults to explore new areas of knowledge without the stress of examinations and grades. He’s taught a class at the Dance Palace—one of OLLI’s various satellite locations throughout the Bay Area—for the last five years, beginning with Abraham Lincoln and later exploring the pre-war South. He returns on Jan. 12 for an eight-week breakdown on how Southerners continued their cultural-prejudice agenda but replaced battlefields with crafty legislation. He calls the Civil War the “central experience in American history” and argues that we’re still dealing with it over 150 years later. “There really is a reason, and it’s a good one, for why people are so angry over these confederate monuments,” he said. “It’s not a case of political correctness run amok. Trump is not an accident; he grew out of what much of the country was thinking. These monuments point to something bigger and the fact Trump came out in support of them speaks volumes. That’s where half the county’s mind was at all along.” The second half of the 19th century is a period people often skip over, an otherwise gilded age characterized by Northern apathy and a misrepresentation of the past. His goal for the series is to help students better understand modern controversies. “I went to college in the 1960s,” he said. “My teachers received an education in an earlier period of time when, in a strange way, Southerners were seen as the heroes. For instance, ‘Gone with The Wind.’ Who is the hero in that movie? The rebels are made out to be brave!” Mr. Chantler is already looking ahead to crafting a class that zeroes in on the modern South while referencing contemporary movements like Black Lives Matter and Colin Kaepernick. He’s taught hundreds in OLLI courses at Dominican and Berkeley, but said there’s a certain charm in his West Marin audience. “It’s really nice to teach to a smaller group because there is an opportunity to have a dialogue with the students,” he said. “Out there, you can have that and it’s a different kind of teaching experience. And the people are so nice.”']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1031786.0,1

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 3:54 pm Jim McGrath Jim McGrath Seventh in a 12-part series. Henry Ford once said that “Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” During the 2016-17 academic year, some 1,900 area adults over the age of 50 heeded that advice through a lifelong learning program built 16 years ago by Jim McGrath. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Virginia, often called OLLI at UVa, has been offering educational opportunities and intellectual enrichment to older adults in the area since 2001, five years after UVa alum McGrath returned to Charlottesville for a retirement that quickly became all too lively. “I had intended to do some private consulting, but shortly after I moved here, I got involved with the alumni association and I became president of the local university alumni organization,” said McGrath, 85. “I really got to know a lot of people, and it was in that situation that I first began to think about something like OLLI.” “One of the few” in Manhattan to actually have been born there, McGrath got married and worked for General Electric in New York before moving to Washington to work for McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm. After about a decade with McKinsey, McGrath and his wife moved again to Philadelphia, where they raised a family in the historic Main Line region. In 1986, they moved again to North Carolina, where McGrath took a job with a company that manufactured fiber optic cables, a “very profitable business,” he noted. “I went from a business that was marginally profitable to one that was quite profitable,” he said. “That’s a very pleasant change.” A decade later, McGrath’s retirement led him to return to the home of his alma mater. An economics and history major at UVa, McGrath said he’s maintained a “continuing relationship with UVa and Charlottesville,” with all three children attending UVa for undergraduate studies and two of them going to graduate school there. Even now, the former businessman has two grandsons taking undergraduate classes at the university. After getting resettled in Charlottesville, McGrath became president of the university alumni organization, a position he held for two years. In that capacity, McGrath began looking into programs for seniors, noting that UVa did not have any lifelong learning programs in place despite a high population of seniors in Charlottesville. The College of William & Mary had a program similar to what McGrath envisioned, and he took the concept back to UVa’s alumni association for consideration. McGrath conferred with well-connected university stalwart Leigh Middleditch, who agreed that such a program could bring a host of benefits to the community. And thus, the Jefferson Institute for Lifelong Learning was born. Well, not immediately. “It takes a long time to get something like that going,” McGrath said. He had to get approval from the university, find funding, secure professors to teach the classes and guarantee the university that the program would adhere to all relevant rules and regulations. “The most difficult thing was to get faculty,” McGrath said. “I really didn’t have the contacts at the time, and we did have a difficult time for the first semester.” After some solicitation, the fledgling program was able to lock down between 15 and 18 UVa professors from a variety of disciplines, from politics to religion. When the program was preparing for its first semester in the spring of 2001, the university’s then-president, John T. Casteen III, provided the program with $25,000 in startup money to procure 17 courses for the roughly 100 students who had signed up. According to Beth Barber, the current executive director of OLLI at UVa, the procurement of those professors and that funding came down entirely to the efforts of McGrath and Middleditch. “His networking was just imperative,” Barber said. “Without [McGrath’s] energy and passion, we just wouldn’t even be here.” The difficulty in finding funding dissipated after that initial semester. In June 2007, the program received a substantial grant from the Bernard Osher Foundation, which required the program to be renamed as the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UVa, one of 120 such programs operating on campuses across the country. The local program received a second grant of $25,000 in 2013. In addition, finding new professors became easier following that first semester. “Over the years, faculty has really been the easiest part of the job,” McGrath said. “It’s amazing how many people like to demonstrate what they know.” OLLI now teaches courses both at UVa and around the Charlottesville area, as far away as Staunton. The attendance has grown to approximately 1,900 across 169 courses taught by 176 instructors over two semesters in the 2016-17 academic year, a substantial number of whom are repeat students. According to McGrath, the region is well-suited for the type of students who attend OLLI courses. “Charlottesville is benefiting by the fact that there’s always a large influx of new people — retirees — coming to this area,” McGrath said. “It’s got everything — the weather, the university, a good hospital. This is the kind of thing that a lot of people are looking for.” The objective of the classes, McGrath said, is to offer learning opportunities to anybody who wants to take them. In that vein, the costs of the courses are low, and anyone worried about affording a course will be offered a scholarship, McGrath said. The courses themselves span a range of topics — “different things for different folks.” McGrath has been involved in every aspect of the organization for the past 16 years, according to Joan H. Kammire, past president of OLLI at UVa, “from creating an impressive array of classes to obtaining funding.” “His leadership has meant that the growing cadre of older adults in our area have the means to continue challenging their beliefs and opinions and learning and growing in an environment of other like-minded, active adults,” Kammire said. “The program has enticed retirees to move to Charlottesville, and it has improved the health and wellness of the seniors who are residents here.” If you ask McGrath what possessed him to undertake the project, he remains humble, thinking only of how he could give back to the community. “I just thought I could make a contribution,” he said.

Learn more at www.olli.arizona.edu. The University of Arizona has received a $1 million endowment grant to advance the work of its Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, which provides lifelong learning opportunities to adults age 50 and older. Since 2005, the Bernard Osher Foundation has provided more than $2.4 million in operating and endowment funds to support OLLI-UA. The program currently has more than 1,200 members and offers classes in Tucson, Oro Valley, Marana, Vail and Green Valley. The Osher Foundation, the architect of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute program, awarded the UA a second endowment based on OLLI-UA\'s excellence in curriculum and programming, which represents a diverse repertoire of intellectually stimulating, noncredit courses and educational activities. The foundation\'s award was given in recognition of OLLI-UA\'s significant opportunities for volunteer engagement and leadership, the strong support from the UA, sound organizational structure and financial stability, among other criteria. The Bernard Osher Foundation supports 121 lifelong learning programs on university and college campuses across the country, with at least one grantee in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In a letter of support for OLLI-UA, UA President Robert C. Robbins, a self-proclaimed lifelong learner, reaffirmed the University\'s commitment to the program, stating, ""As the president of an institution of higher education, I certainly appreciate the importance of fostering a culture of curiosity, interest and learning that continues long after graduation and throughout an individual\'s life. ""The UA\'s program has shown significant growth ... with four active OLLI-UA campuses …. The diversity of programming is extraordinary, the level of (volunteer) participation of boards, committees and work groups is significant, and the overall program is fiscally sound. This is in no small part, of course, due to the succession of endowments and bridge grants provided by the Osher Foundation."" The UA Foundation manages the Osher endowments for the program and coordinated this recent gift. ""Three UA staff members oversee the administration of the program with an army of 500-plus member-volunteers contributing in ways big and small to make the magic of OLLI-UA happen,"" states OLLI-UA\'s program manager, Scott Aldridge. The program is representative of the UA\'s commitment to provide innovative and engaging learning experiences that transform the lives of individuals, organizations and communities. ""The OLLI-UA experience goes beyond providing quality, engaging classes and activities,"" said Meg Hovell, president of the OLLI-UA board of directors. ""We have had members say OLLI-UA literally saved their life, keeping them engaged intellectually and active socially. OLLI-UA creates new circles of friends with similar interests and a passion for life and learning. Many times our program provides a welcome respite from personal issues like caring for a loved one or recovering from loss."" Last year, OLLI-UA provided more than 430 classes across its four campuses. ""Members love it because it is truly about the joy of learning, with no tests or grades,"" Hovell said. The program also is an outlet for current and former UA staff, faculty and students to engage with the community, often leading programming in their fields of expertise. ""We recognize that the program\'s success represents the collective achievement of its excellent staff and dynamic community of intellectually vigorous members who give generously of their time and talent,"" said Osher Foundation President Mary Bitterman. ""We applaud, too, the University\'s leadership for its support of the institute and for embracing the notion that — at its best — education is a lifelong pursuit that has the power to elevate, delight, and forge our connection to one another and to a larger world.""

(NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) in Israel initiated by a recently arrived foreign CEO are raising the question of to what extent Teva is still an Israeli company. When late Teva CEO Eli Hurvitz began Teva\'s efforts to expand into the global market, he was already thinking ahead by supplying the company with a poison pill designed to prevent the company from abandoning its activity in Israel. The question now, however, is whether the poison pills are preserving the company\'s Israeli character, or whether they have wound up poisoning Teva itself. After many years of dominating the leading indices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), Teva has now fallen to second place on the Tel Aviv 35 Index, even after the TASE artificially increased Teva\'s weight on the index in order to avoid a shock to the indices. Teva is no longer considered the ""people\'s share."" It is no longer a particularly safe investment or a source of pride for an Israeli who holds it; it is just like any other company and any other share. 90% of Teva\'s shares are not held by Israelis. Of the remaining 10%, the founding families own half. The public, through Israeli investment institutions, holds only 5% with a current value of a mere $800 million. The proportion of Israeli employees in Teva\'s workforce is another element of its Israeli character. As of the end of November, Teva had 6,800 Israel employees, 12% of its 57,000 total. The acquisition of Actavis added 14,000 employees to the company, of whom almost none were Israelis. Since 2011, the number of Teva\'s Israeli employees has remained virtually constant at 6,900, while its total workforce has increased by 16%. If the company\'s cutbacks go through, reducing the number of its employees by 3,000 in Israel and by 10,000 worldwide, the proportion of Israeli employees will drop to 8%. The state of Teva\'s management is also changing. Kare Schultz is Teva\'s first CEO with no built-in sentiment for Israel. Jeremy Levin, who was criticized for bringing foreign habits with him and ending cooperation with local startups, was nevertheless a Jewish lover of Israel, who immediately moved to Israel and began learning Hebrew after getting the job. Even former chairperson Phillip Frost, who was regarded as an ""anti-Israeli force,"" was a Jew who was active in Israel, and the company he controlled, Opko Health Inc. (NYSE: OPK; TASE: OPK), was also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). Today, Teva chairperson Sol Barer is a Jew who did a lot for Israel\'s medical industry even before his appointment at Teva, but he has strong connections in the international pharma market, and Schultz lacks any affinity for Israel, as his cold manner makes absolutely clear. The names of Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) chairperson Avi Nissenkorn and MK Shelly Yachimovich (Zionist Union) mean nothing to him. The company\'s articles of association require him to live in Israel, and he is indeed spending most of his time here since his appointment, and has taken practical steps to move his residence and his wife to Israel, but he is moving to Israel because of his job at Teva, not for love of Israel. After the period of Frost and Levin, the Israeli board of directors wanted to preserve the company\'s Israeli character at all costs. That was one of the reasons why Erez Vigodman was selected as CEO. The market also welcomed his being an Israeli, assuming that this would prevent the friction on the board of directors that harmed the company\'s functioning during the Frost-Levin period. When it came time to choose a chairperson, Amir Elstein, from one of Teva\'s founding families, sought the appointment, but Frost prevented it. Elstein proposed a number of other possible chairpersons from the group identified with him. Finally, after many votes, Yitzhak Peterburg was selected as a candidate acceptable to both sides. For a while, it appeared that Teva had returned to the golden path of its Israeli management, until that management got the company into its current plight. Today, after Peterburg\'s resignation yesterday, Teva\'s board of directors includes six Israeli directors: Elstein, Galia Maor, Chemi Peres, Dan Suesskind, Jean-Michel Halfon and Murray Goldberg, who live in Israel. Including Shultz himself, who was appointed to the board of directors and is moving to Israel, seven of the 13 directors live in Israel, four of whom are regarded as part of the ""Israeli group"" that formerly dominated the company and guarded its Israeli character (on the other hand, this group was also accused of keeping the company provincial and uninvolved in the global pharma market). Teva\'s articles of association state that a majority of the board of directors must live in Israel, and the current board of directors barely fulfills this condition. The Israeli directors have the most seniority, and they will therefore be the first in line for a revote on their candidacy. This event will probably have a significant effect on the company\'s character.

In this process, Lundbeck remained completely Danish, like Novo Nordisk, where Schultz rose almost to the position of CEO before moving to Lundbeck.

(NASDAQ:OPK) has enrolled the first subject in a Phase IIb dose ranging study of OPK88004, its orally given selective androgen receptor modulator, to treat men struggling from benign prostatic hypertrophy or enlarged prostate. BPH marks as a non-cancerous problem in which an enlarged prostate tissue forces against the bladder and the urethra, limiting the urine flow. This disease affects around 50 million men in the United States. The details Opko reported that this study will register around 125 men with BPH at 30 locations in the United States to know appropriate doses administered over a 4-month treatment period to lower prostate size, the main efficacy objective of the trial. The study will also evaluate secondary objectives, including blood PSA levels and body composition parameters like fat mass and lean body mass. Interest in assessing OPK88004 as a cure for BPH is grounded on data from a 12-week trial of 350 men who demonstrated notably decreased fat mass, increased muscle strength and increased lean body mass without considerably affecting PSA levels in the population, while lowering PSA levels in men with higher PSA levels. The antagonistic and selective properties of OPK88004 seem to be well suited to prospectively lower prostate hypertrophy in BPH patients, while offering anabolic benefits like increased muscle strength and lean body mass. In previously performed dog trials, treatment with OPK88004 for six months lowered prostate weight by up to 75%, showcasing the strong antagonistic effects of “OPK8004” on androgen receptor movement in the prostate. Phillip Frost, M.D., the CEO and Chairman of Opko Health, expressed that they are thrilled to be commencing this study in men struggling from BPH, as there are no sufficient treatment alternatives for this common debilitating problem that affects men. They consider that OPK88004 possess the potential of launching a new standard of care for an ailment that impacts millions of men worldwide.

Phillip,Frost,['https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/as-israel-strikes-to-protest-layoffs-it-s-deja-vu-for-teva-a-larger-scale'],b'766',"[""Once again, with a pharma veteran at the helm, Teva is facing local resistance to its plan to lay off workers in its home country of Israel. But with the scale grander and the stakes higher, can its new chief executive prevail? That was the question on the mind of industry watchers as government offices, banks, schools, health services, Israel’s main airport and more shut down for four hours on Sunday in protest of Teva’s plan to eliminate 1,750 Israeli positions between now and the end of next year. Those cuts are part of a broader plan, announced last Thursday, to cut 14,000 jobs globally under the leadership of new CEO and experienced cost-cutter Kåre Schultz. RELATED: Teva's stunning list of cuts targets 14K jobs, $3B in costs and plants around the globe Avi Nissenkorn, chief of the Histadrut labor federation, told The Times of Israel on Saturday that the strike was meant as a warning signal to Teva that the union wouldn’t accept Israeli job cuts. “We are fighting for the workers of Teva, to save the industry in Israel and to support blue and white,” he said. “Organized labor has been enlisted and is sending a clear message.” It’s not the first time Teva has encountered resistance to plans to pare down its local workforce. In October of 2013, Israeli unions vowed to strike against 5,000 global Teva layoffs, and Teva’s worker representatives showed up at the company's headquarters in Petah Tikva. Amid squabbles with the board, Jeremy Levin, a former Bristol-Myers Squibb executive tasked with using his Big Pharma learnings to spark a turnaround, vacated the CEO’s seat not long after. RELATED: Irate Teva reps vow to strike against Israeli job cuts But while the storylines may bear some obvious similarities, this time around, there are also a few key differences, Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said in an interview. For one, the company is in “much bigger financial trouble” thanks to a disastrous $40.5 billion buy of Allergan's generics unit—and Israel knows it. Teva’s financial woes are “reasonably well understood in Israel,” Gal said, adding that it’s “pretty well understood in Israel that the entire generics industry is in big trouble.” Accordingly, the cost cuts are much bigger, too; last week’s plan includes a whopping 9,000 more global layoffs than 2013’s. Teva’s board has also undergone a transformation since that year, propelled in part by activist pressure. In 2014, then-chairman Phillip Frost added Pfizer vet Jean-Michel Halfon after pledging a smaller, more experienced director slate. Not long after, Frost announced he’d be leaving himself as part of the scale-down. More recently, under the leadership of chairman and Celgene vet Sol Barer, Ph.D., the company added former Regeneron CFO Murray Goldberg; former GlaxoSmithKline R&D official Perry Nisen, M.D., Ph.D.; Roberto Mignone, a managing partner at healthcare-specializing hedge fund Bridger Management; and Chemi Peres, a managing partner of Pitango Venture Capital, which has invested in healthcare. And one day before Teva made its restructuring announcement, Yitzhak Peterburg, who had served as the company’s chairman and interim CEO, left the board, too. Teva’s director slate has “moved away from majority Israeli with big government connections to essentially dominated by folks with industry experience” who are generally not Israeli, Gal pointed out. All things considered, he expects Schultz—with the support of a board that only recently appointed him after a months-long search—to come through with the plan, “mostly because you’ve got a prime minister who is aware economically” and a “pretty good professional team at the ministerial level.” But Gal is “far from being able to commit to that prediction.” “I do expect at least some politicians to start calling for legislation that will damage Teva,” he said, adding, “that’s what they do.” © 2018 Questex LLC.

Subscribe for Thrivin'"", ""How would you best describe yourself? No results matched your search What if we can grow fully functional skin, hair follicles and all, with just a biopsy? It’s been done successfully in large animal studies already, and one biotech firm called PolarityTE Inc. (NASDAQ:COOL) is now trying it for the first time on humans. In just a few weeks, we’ll find out if it works. The company, now a year-old $140M startup, just announced the first applications of its skin-regenerating SkinTE™ platform on its initial batch of patients. Included are those with burn wounds, surgical reconstructions, and unsightly scars. Some involved have even had their already-healed skin grafts removed and replaced with the experimental technology. It sounds like a hustle, but it’s being backed by some of the biggest names in biotech, including former Teva Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Chairman Dr. Phillip Frost who owns nearly half a million shares and Medivation founder Dr. Steven Gorlin, now part of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The system itself is actually pretty simple to understand. In the case of minor cuts and scrapes, skin fully regenerates with little to no scarring. Full skin regeneration is possible because of cells called LGR cells, or leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein cells. These cells communicate with other skin cells through chemical signaling to determine which kinds of skin cells are needed at different layers within the wound, be they dermal, subdermal, epidermal, or hair follicles. In minor wounds, LGR cells can signal across the wound for fully functional skin regeneration. But with serious injuries like major burns or large surgical scars, LGR cells cannot chemically signal across the area of the wound. The result is an area of disorganized, undifferentiated skin cells that serve as little more than a barrier. Hair is lost, sensation is dull at best, thickness, color and texture are all off. Standard skin grafts, while obviously better than an open wound, are little more than aided scarring. Partial thickness autologous skin grafts only take the upper layers of skin, and full thickness skin grafts, while more fully functional, are risky for patients and unfeasible for larger wounds. The company’s founder Dr. Denver Lough, while working at Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, discovered that the protein human alpha defensin 5 (HAD5) induces LGR cells to proliferate and migrate into wound beds, in theory enabling full skin regeneration. Basically, a biopsy is seeded with LGR cells using HAD5, grown in vitro, and then applied to the site of injury. Soon after Lough made the discovery, he resigned from Johns Hopkins to found PolarityTE, pulling along many JHU physicians along with him including the director of the JHU burn center Dr. Stephen Milner, who now serves as the Chief Clinical Officer. The same cellular mechanisms can, in theory, be applied to many tissues in the human body, with LGR cells directing the polarized regeneration of cartilage, bone, muscle, and blood vessels. PolarityTE has products in the proof-of-concept and preclinical stages for each of these applications, which could end up becoming a turnkey solution to all manner of injuries and illnesses like cardiovascular disease, muscle injury, arthritis caused by the thinning of cartilage between joints, etc. No FDA Approval Required It’s not just the technology itself, but the regulatory framework in which it operates that makes PolarityTE’s platform disruptive. There are no clinical trials required here, meaning no Phase I, Phase II, or prohibitively expensive Phase III years-long regulatory processes involved. SkinTE™ is regulated under an FDA regime that requires no pre-market clearance, save a post-market regulatory follow-up. That means SkinTE™ can go to market whenever PolarityTE’s sales team feels it is ready to do so. With the application of SkinTE™ to its first patients, that process has already begun exactly one year since the company went public in December 2016. The same minimal regulations apply to all of its regenerative products in development. Finances There is one potential weak point in the case for PolarityTE. It is low on cash, for now. As of August, the company has only $3.5 million. Though the sale of its SkinTE™ kits to burn centers across the country has already begun, we do not know the hard numbers on its sales forecasts or margins yet. Nevertheless, the company is moving forward quickly and just announced a move to a 200,000 ft2 facility to expand manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of demand. There will probably be some equity financing ahead to fund a full-scale rollout, which could dilute the holdings of current investors somewhat. Regardless, the biggest influence on the stock price going into 2018 will be results reported on the initial patient batches as data comes in. If results are positive, PolarityTE will likely refinance on the back of that news at an elevated share price in order to fund a full marketing plan. If results are negative, then this will obviously put into question PolarityTE’s entire business model, making early data a likely binary event.

Sara,Burns,['http://www.wcsh6.com/news/local/now/lessons-in-leadership-from-the-now-former-ceo-of-central-maine-power/502469617'],b'764',"[""Portland Weather Summary: 82 degrees AUGUSTA, Maine (NEWS CENTER Maine) -- Ask Sara Burns what she is most proud of and she will tell you it's the fact that she's been married to her husband the last 33 years and she has two grown sons, who are working and living in big cities. NEWS CENTER Maine spoke with Burns on one of her last days at the office at Central Maine Power. She retired from her post as Chief Executive Officer at the end of the year. She talked about her career, the lessons she learned along the way, and how her childhood likely shaped the leadership qualities she exhibits today. Burns grew up in Villanova, Pennsylvania. As one of eleven siblings, she believes coming from a large family did have an impact on her ability to lead a large company. I've always said you are kind of a survivor. You've got to stand up for yourself. So I think you do learn some skills that are necessary when you lead a company. She explained one of her siblings, a student at Bowdoin College, influenced her decision to go to college in Maine. She was in the first class of women at Bowdoin and I did visit her. I remember thinking, 'yeah this is a nice place but I'm not going to school with my sister.' So, Colby was the alternative. 1987 was Burns' first year working for Central Maine Power, to her surprise. Nine months after receiving a rejection letter in the mail claiming she wasn't qualified, she got a call back about the job. 1998 was another significant year for Burns. Not only was it the year of one of Maine's most historic ice storms, it was also her first year as President of the company. I was new in the job. A lot of people in this company would have said at that point in time, 'why did she get the job? One of the biggest parts of the job is storm and she's never run a storm and then here comes the biggest storm in our history.' At one point during the response efforts Burns, a 3-sport varsity athlete in high school, heard something any athlete despises to hear: doubt. She described one night in the cafeteria, when one of the line workers stood up and said loudly, “we are never going to get this done.” She said she responded without thinking twice about it. I looked at him and I said of course we're going to get this done. She said half of her wanted to laugh, the other half wanted to cry. Either way, she said it was a lesson in leadership. You have to stand up, you have to take ownership, you have to be the energy and optimism. You have to be the solution and you have to say, 'Hey guys we're on it. We're going to get it done.' Burns became Chief Executive Officer in 2005. The following was her response when I asked her about her thoughts as a woman in this role: There's a lot of people who would tell you I'm not the woman who is focused on women's issues and always talking about women's issues and pushing women's issues. I'm the woman focused on results, making sure this is a great company, it is, making sure we have great employees, we do, we have extraordinary employees, and I've tried to encourage growth of all of our employees. Burns says throughout her career, she's always been focused on coaching and mentoring. She tries to push others and help them grow, every day, regardless of their gender. After 30 years at Central Maine Power, she said it was time to retire. I thought long and hard about this, had lots of discussions with my husband about this. It's just the right time for me. As for her get-it-done attitude, she says that was a lesson she likely learned while growing up with ten other siblings. You're kind of a survivor. Even in retirement, Burns will continue to lead her community as an active member of several boards. She will begin serving on the Board of Directors for CMP's parent company, Avangrid, and will continue her position on the Board of Trustees for her alma matter, Colby College.""]",0.0,21.0,1.105263157894737,1.0,1017395.0,1

It also noted that ""as this storm departs on Friday bitterly cold air will arrive from Canada along with strong northwesterly winds."" AccuWeather reported that the cold wave following the storm will be ""about 5 to 10 degrees lower than the one that froze the Northeast during the final days of December and start of January."" ""After a brief moderation from the cold at midweek, more bitter cold and downright harsh air will return,"" AccuWeather Meteorologist Kyle Elliott said in a news release, adding that in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and western Maine, the Green Mountains in Vermont and in upstate New York, temperatures are likely to plummet to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below zero on Friday. AccuWeather also reported that ""the wind may be strong enough to trigger airline delays and even sporadic power outages in the region."" Elliott said the weekend cold wave is expected to break early next week, when ""an approaching storm will cause the bitter cold to retreat toward Canada, allowing temperatures to return to near-normal levels for a brief time."" Emera Maine and Central Maine Power Co. are preparing for possible power outages from a nor\'easter expected to hit the state late morning Thursday. Emera Maine is evaluating staffing needs and staging crews before Thursday\'s storm, the brunt of which is expected to hit its coverage area Downeast. The National Weather Service has forecast blizzard conditions in Hancock and Washington counties and the greater Bangor area from noon Thursday until 1 a.m. Friday. Emera Maine has 159,000 customers in Washington, Hancock, Piscataquis, Aroostook and Penobscot counties. The blizzard warning is also in effect for the entire coast of Maine, and a winter storm warning for the rest of the state, with high wind and 9 to 12 inches of snow expected. The wind is forecast to continue through Friday and the temperatures will drop into single digits on Saturday. ""Our biggest concern with this storm is the extreme cold,"" said Tim Pease, Emera Maine storm manager, in a Tuesday news release. ""While we are preparing to respond to any outages safely and quickly, we encourage customers to monitor the forecast and take necessary precautions to stay warm and safe."" The company will continue to track the storm and make adjustments as needed, the news release said. The power company is evaluating staffing needs both in the field and in the Customer Contact Center, fueling trucks, snowmobiles and ATVs, stocking up on storm kits and other supplies for field crews, and more, the company said. Emera Maine also will stage crews before the storm in case of difficult travel conditions within areas it anticipates will be hardest hit. CMP\'s storm readiness teams have been holding planning meetings, and the company is pre-positioning personnel and equipment to ensure that adequate resources are in place to restore power outages that might occur as a result of the storm, according to a Wednesday morning news release from Avangrid, CMP\'s parent company. If needed, CMP can also call on resources from the other Avangrid energy companies in Connecticut and New York, as well as contractors and regional mutual assistance partners, the release said. The company is coordinating its preparations with the Maine Emergency Management Agency and county emergency management personnel. Emera and CMP also suggested that customers plan ahead to stay safe in the storm and be prepared for outages. Safety tips during power outages include never touching a downed power line or a tree that\'s in contact with one, following manufacture guidelines on generators and heat sources, and slowing down on the roads and moving over to give room to utility crews working on downed lines. Tips can be found on Emera Maine\'s website and from the Maine Emergency Management Agency.

Bernie Sanders on ""Face the Nation,"" Nov. 12, 2017. Senate Republicans\' slim majority grew slimmer on Tuesday with Democrat Doug Jones\' surprising victory over Trump-backed Republican Roy Moore in Alabama\'s dramatic special election. Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with minors almost 40 years ago, has refused to concede despite President Trump\'s urging him to do so. Moore\'s controversial campaign is done, but the Capitol\'s reckoning with assault and harassment is far from over. Texas congressman Blake Farenthold said this week he won\'t run for reelection after recently coming under fire for alleged sexual misconduct with staffers. And on Friday, the Ethics Committee launched an another investigation into misconduct allegations against Rep. Ruben Kihuen, D-Nevada. The president, who has more than a dozen accusers of his own, lashed out on Twitter at Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, after she openly called for his resignation. Meanwhile, Republicans moved closer this week to passing a tax bill before Christmas. Senate and House leaders said on Wednesday they reached an agreement in melding their two bills. As the final language is crafted, and amid some last-minute maneuvering for votes, Vice President Mike Pence has postponed his Middle East trip to be available to cast a possible tie-breaking vote. Trump and Republicans are putting pressure on special counsel Robert Mueller\'s investigation into Russian meddling after reports of anti-Trump bias from an FBI agent who was dismissed from Mueller\'s team earlier this year. Trump has used the report to levy criticism against the bureau. Other important developments in the investigation this week included reports that Mueller\'s team and the House Intelligence Committee sought information from Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm the Trump campaign employed. This Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will talk with ""Face the Nation"" anchor John Dickerson about the final version of the GOP\'s tax bill. He\'ll identify what has and hasn\'t changed, and he\'ll discuss the administration\'s view on the bill\'s larger implications for the middle class and the deficit. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, will be on this Sunday to give his evaluation of the bill. We\'ll ask Sanders, an outspoken critic of Republican efforts, to outline his problems with the GOP\'s plan. We\'ll also get Sanders\' take on Jones\' historic win in deep-red Alabama, the looming budget deadlines, and more. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be on the program to talk about what direction his committee\'s Russia investigation might be headed and whether he feels that the administration is trying to exert influence over it. We\'ll also get Lankford\'s take on the GOP\'s last-minute tax negotiations. Wall Street Journal tax reporter Richard Rubin will join the program to break down the tax bill – what it does, who it affects, and more. Rubin, who has rigorously covered the GOP\'s efforts from the start, will help us maneuver through the weeds and clarify what this bill could mean for taxpayers. As always, we\'ll have our expert political panel to break down this week\'s round of headlines. This week we\'ll be joined by Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic Jeffery Goldberg, Slate Chief Political Correspondent and CBS News Contributor Jamelle Bouie, Publisher of The Federalist and CBS News Contributor Ben Domenech and National Editor of the Cook Political Report Amy Walter.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/can-tax-bill-unite-divided-gop'],b'747',"['The president and GOP members of Congress are like those friends of yours who have an “on-again-off-again” relationship. You never quite know if they are going strong or have broken up — again. This week the GOP couple was in the “on-again stage,"" heaping praise on one another for passage of the tax reform bill. For much of the year, however, they\'ve been in the “off-again” phase. We all remember the president personally attacking GOP House and Senate leaders after the failure of Obamacare repeal. Then there were the times when congressional Republicans criticized the president for his response to Charlottesville and his endorsement of Senate candidate Roy Moore. Will the success in passing tax legislation mark a turning of the page for the relationship between the two branches of GOP-controlled government to one that is more ""on"" than ""off""? Tucked into the always insightful NBC-Wall Street Journal poll is a question that asks 2016 Trump voters whether their vote was determined more by their support for Trump or their dislike of Clinton and/or her policies. In January of 2017, that split was 58 percent who said they voted for Trump because they liked Trump to 42 percent who voted for him because they disliked Clinton. The challenge for the new president was to find a way to woo those who were skeptical of him as a candidate to see him as one of “their own” once he became president. Think of it like this. You know the feeling you have when you first meet someone and have a bad impression? You think, this is probably not going work. But, the more time you spend with him, the better you start to feel about him. You don’t totally forget what it was you disliked about him (and some things still bug you), but it\'s not the driving factor in your relationship. By February, it looked as if those “didn’t have a good first impression Republicans” were starting to feel more willing to see Trump in a different light. The percent of those who said they voted for Trump because they didn’t like Clinton had dropped to 34 percent, with 66 percent saying they voted for Trump because they supported him. But, by April that gap had opened once again, with 44 percent of Trump voters saying their vote for him was due to their dislike of Hillary Clinton. It has remained at about this place throughout Trump’s first year in office. Moreover, the percent of the overall registered voter universe that says they voted for Trump because they liked him has remained pretty constant (around 20-22 percent), while the percent that says they voted for Trump because they disliked Clinton has risen over the year; from 11 percent in February to 17 percent in December. In many ways, this question – why did you vote for Trump? – is a better way to measure the discontent within the GOP over Trump. This doesn’t mean that these skeptical Trump voters won’t support him again in 2020. But, they do view the president and the tax cut differently (read: less positively) than those GOP voters who have been on the Trump train all along. For example, while the pro-Trump and anti-Clinton GOPers both give Trump solid job approval ratings, those in the pro-Trump category give him a 97 percent job approval rating, with 80 percent very strong approval. Among those in the anti-Clinton camp, Trump has an 82 percent job approval rating and just 33 percent strong approval. <!--//--><![CDATA[// ><!-- if(""undefined""==typeof window.datawrapper)window.datawrapper={};window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""]={},window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].embedDeltas={""100"":308,""200"":308,""300"":308,""400"":308,""500"":308,""600"":308,""700"":308,""800"":308,""900"":308,""1000"":308},window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].iframe=document.getElementById(""datawrapper-chart-J8mgS""),window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].iframe.style.height=window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].embedDeltas[Math.min(1e3,Math.max(100*Math.floor(window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].iframe.offsetWidth/100),100))]+""px"",window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(""undefined""!=typeof a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var b in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])if(""J8mgS""==b)window.datawrapper[""J8mgS""].iframe.style.height=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][b]+""px""}); //--><!]]> The good news for Trump and Republicans is that these “dislike Clinton, voted Trump” voters aren’t moving into the Democratic camp. For example, while only 37 percent of these voters think the tax cut bill is a good idea, just 6 percent think it’s a bad idea. The rest of these voters — 46 percent — are undecided. And, while just 83 percent of these not-Clinton/Trump voters say they want to see a GOP-controlled Congress in 2018, just 7 percent want to see it in Democratic hands. Another 10 percent are undecided. In other words, these GOP voters are ‘gettable’ for Trump and his party. This may be helped by the millions of dollars outside groups are planning to spend to sell the plan. “I assume we\'ll see some uptick in the next round of polling on it [tax bill],” a Democratic strategist conceded to me the other day. [T]hough most of that will be GOP coalescing behind it now that it\'s passed. BUT, I don\'t think they can shift the underlying perception on it and that\'s the more damaging part. The perception that it enriches the rich at expense of the middle class is baked in and that is their problem... even if the Favs tick up/down some.” Lots of folks think of Trump’s “base” as those folks who show up to his rallies. However, his base also encompasses those who don’t and won’t come to a rally. A fear of a Clinton presidency may have been enough to get them to vote for Trump in 2016, but will Trump’s erratic temperament and their lackluster support of the GOP’s signature policy achievement in Congress, keep them home in 2018.

The president often complains that he doesn’t get the credit he deserves, but I say the tweets often trip him up. The president doesn’t seem to appreciate press freedom, so I’m concerned that he might try to limit the press if there’s war or a national emergency.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/republicans-challenge-in-2018-sell-the-tax-bill-to-voters'],b'745',"[""Political analysis that you won't find anywhere else. PBS NewsHour PBS NewsHour Before celebrating Christmas in Florida, President Trump signed into law the country’s biggest tax overhaul in decades. Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join John Yang to discuss the Republican victory, chances of bipartisanship in 2018, the president’s targeting of the FBI’s deputy director and more. Hari Sreenivasan: But first, before heading to Florida for Christmas, President Trump signed the Republican tax overhaul into law, ending the year with a big win for the Republican majority in Washington. John Yang is here with a look back and a look ahead at this week's political news. John Yang: Hari, to talk about that and more, we are joined by our politics Monday team, Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. Tam, Amy, thanks for being here. Christmas came a little early for the Republicans, for President Trump and the Republicans. Got their tax bill last week. The president yesterday pointed out that the bill not only includes taxes, but also opens up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, and repeals the individual mandate. He said the bill brought it together as to what an incredible year we have. Tam, let me start with you. Where does this leave the Republicans as they begin 2018? Tamara Keith: Yes. This tree has a lot of ornaments on it from the Republican wish list. So, it leaves them having accomplished something. It doesn't necessarily mean that 2018 is going to be any easier. They're going to have a one-vote narrower margin in the Senate, which is going to make things even harder to get done. And what you hear Mitch McConnell saying is that he thinks he is going to have to do things in a more bipartisan way than they did in 2017. It would be hard to do things in a less bipartisan way than they did 2017. (LAUGHTER) Tamara Keith: It was an incredibly partisan year, where almost all of the accomplishments that the Republicans had were the Republicans alone. Amy Walter: That's right. And, you know, the interesting thing about where the relationship is right now between Republicans in Congress and the president, this has been an on-again/off-again sort of relationship. A lot — for earlier in the year, a lot it was an off-again type of relationship, with the president taking to Twitter to criticize his own party, especially after the failure of Obamacare. Now it's an on-again relationship with the passage of the tax bill. But where there still is work to be done now, Republicans have to get an on-again relationship with their own voters, especially congressional Republicans. Remember, at the height of sort of discontent between the president and congressional Republicans and Republican leaders, Republican voters were saying they trusted President Trump more than Congress. They thought the leaders in Congress, Republican leaders, weren't doing enough fast enough. They were blaming them for stuff not getting done. So, Mitch McConnell may want to get stuff done in 2018. The first thing you have to do is repair the relationship with the voters. And the second thing is to sell this tax bill. Remember, even among Republican voters, they may say they like it, but they're not as deeply in love with it and excited about it as some of the Republican members who voted for it, especially those who say that they voted for President Trump. I was looking through polling about this. They voted for President Trump not simply because they liked him, but more because they disliked Hillary Clinton. They are less enthusiastic about this. And I think that it's the job of Republicans now to spend a lot of 2018 getting them excited about this legislation. John Yang: And, Tam, you talk about next year, the next — the agenda for the next session of Congress. They're talking a lot about welfare reform. They're talking about infrastructure. Are there opportunities to work together on this, for bipartisanship on this? Tamara Keith: Yes, so the president talks reform. Democrats hear that and say, no thank you. The president talks about infrastructure, and the potential exists. You know, back in the old days, like 10 years ago, infrastructure was something that was bipartisan. Transportation bills sailed through with overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle. Since then, transportation bills have become quite contentious. And there is a fundamental disagreement between Republicans and Democrats about how these things should be paid for, how much of a public element there is, how much of a private element there is. The other thing is, Paul Ryan is talking about wanting to do entitlement reform, tackling Medicaid, possibly Medicare, Social Security. And then you have Mitch McConnell on the Senate side saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, we want to do bipartisan. Don't know if we really could do that. Don't know if we could do health care in 2018. So, in some ways, Republicans are going to have to get on the same page with each other as well. Amy Walter: Well, and, plus, the president, when he was campaigning, said, don't worry, no cuts to Medicare, to Medicaid, we're not touching any of those things. So, that would be a heavy haul. I think the other thing that has to come up is DACA, taking care of and dealing with this issue of the so-called dreamers. We know that, by March, if a deal isn't cut, these folks are now no longer eligible and are — no eligible to be here and are eligible for deportation. This is an issue that should be bipartisan. You look at polling, the vast majority of Americans, including Republicans, say they support some way for these folks to stay in the country. But the politics of it are more complicated. And we know that where it's going to get tied up is the issue about the border wall. And I think Democrats can move to Republicans' side on border security. On a wall, they are going to put up their hands. And so this is going to be a fascinating and more immediate fight that we're going to see. John Yang: Let's turn now. I want to turn to the Russia investigation and the president vs. the FBI. There's been a lot of talk. He's been hitting at Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI. He's been doing this since the campaign, talking about the fact that his wife ran for the Virginia state legislature, got a lot of money or got some money from Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia. He's also a fund-raiser for the Clintons. Now comes the word The Washington Post says that he is going to retire as soon as he's eligible for a pension. The president over the weekend called that racing the clock to retire with full benefits — 90 days to go, the president said. Tam, is this now — they keep saying — they keep telling us at the White House that there is no talk, no thought about firing Robert Mueller. Is this their way of getting — of discrediting Mueller, discrediting the investigation, going after the FBI now? Tamara Keith: This is certainly a way of creating a haze or a cloud or a fuzz or muddying the waters, or pick your terrible analogy, that, you know, they — President Trump and his allies are certainly sort of working the refs and making sure that if something does come out of this that there will be sort of doubt. And, you know, there are congressional investigations that are looking at, you know, should they look at the Clintons, should they look at Uranium One? There's been this growing cloud and haze that President Trump and his allies are trying to create around the investigations. Amy Walter: Yes. Not surprisingly, how you feel about Robert Mueller, how you feel about this investigation has as much to do with your party identification as anything else. It will also be interesting if the report from Mueller comes out and it does not have in it something that many Democrats believe should be in it, which is, you know, really implicating the president or those directly around him, will they accept the findings of Mueller if they don't like what's in it? And I would suspect the answer will be no. Tamara Keith: Yes, it is a fascinating thing. Mueller had sort of widespread support from both sides of the aisle when he was first appointed. And that has been eroding, particularly on the Republican side, even though he is a Republican. John Yang: Very quickly, later this week, the control of the House of Delegates in Virginia, which has been in Republican hands since 1999, is going to be decided by pulling a name out of a bowl. Amy Walter: Yes. John Yang: This is a race that, in a recount, was tied, and then a judge included a ballot that was thrown out — we have got it up on the screen now — where you see both names marked, was thrown out in the recount. Judges threw it back in, gave it to the Republican by one vote. Now control is coming down to this. We have had talk about the Russians meddling in the elections. You talk about the Republicans are now talking about the FBI meddling in elections. The White House has a commission looking at ballot integrity. And now you have got this. What does this say about where we are? Amy Walter: Well, this is actually not that unusual. We don't have ways to break a tie. Remember, they have already had a recount. And if you look at that ballot, the entire ballot was filled with Republicans. This person voted for every single Republican, then voted for this Democrat, seemingly crossed it out. But, look, we have also seen legislative races in the past decided by to coin tosses, by literally who has the short straw. The interesting thing about wherever this ends up is, the Virginia legislature is now going to have to be more bipartisan than it's ever been. Whether it's 50-50 or 51-49, the new governor is a Democrat. He's going to be working with a very evenly divided legislature. Could this be more of something to come, right, actual people working together? John Yang: Quickly. Tamara Keith: Yes. Our system is not a perfect system. And one area where it is particularly imperfect is when there are disputed elections and ties. John Yang: Tamara Keith, Amy Walter, thank you very much. Amy Walter: You're welcome. Tamara Keith: Yes.

We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. Read it here By Louis Jacobson on Wednesday, January 3rd, 2018 at 9:35 a.m. Over the past year, political professionals have been picking over the pre-election polling data to figure out whether the polls failed to predict Donald Trump’s upset victory over Hillary Clinton. In many people’s minds, the polls were flat wrong in 2016. Actually, it’s more complicated than that. When the the American Association for Public Opinion Research asked a blue-ribbon panel of polling specialists to critique the industry’s performance in 2016, they found some important oversights and misfires. But the panel also emphasized that, contrary to popular belief, the national polls weren’t that far off. After interviewing almost a dozen pollsters and experts, here are the key points we learned about how the election influenced polling, and what to look for in the future. National polls vs. state polls The panel concluded that the national polls, which had Clinton up by about 3 percentage points, were ""basically correct,"" as she won the popular vote by 2 percentage points. The problem is that the popular vote is not the one that determines the winner -- the Electoral College does. And Trump won the presidency by narrowly carrying the battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where the polling was less accurate. ""Polls showed Hillary Clinton leading, if narrowly, in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which had voted Democratic for president six elections running,"" their report said. ""Those leads fed predictions that the Democratic ‘blue wall’ would hold. Come Election Day, however, Trump edged out victories in all three."" The association pointed to several issues that led to underestimated support for Trump, such as late-deciding voters choosing Trump too late to be captured in the polling. The idea that polls in individual states were more problematic than national polls in 2016 is now widely accepted. ""The most obvious lesson of 2016 is that the national polls did well,"" said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and polling specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""The problem, as usual, was in the smaller electorates -- states and districts -- where there are small samples, infrequent surveys, and variation in turnout from election to election."" Traditional polls vs. nontraditional polls Earlier this year, Jon A. Krosnick, a professor of communication and political science at Stanford University, analyzed every publicly available poll in the closing days of the campaign for a paper he presented at the American Association for Public Opinion Research national conference. Krosnick found that polls that used the traditional method -- having live persons call telephone numbers chosen at random, and multiple times if necessary -- worked well in 2016, even for polls on the state level. This included polls run by the major networks and newspapers, as well as Quinnipiac University, Marist College and several others, Krosnick said. Other types of nontraditional polls, such as those using recorded questioners or online surveys, did less well. One polling outlet that uses traditional methods is the Arkansas Poll at the University of Arkansas. Its researchers are happy with using the traditional phone method, even if it is more expensive. ""I’m not doing anything different"" as a result of the 2016 election ""other than continuing to incrementally boost the proportion of interviews conducted by folks reached by cell phone -- we’re at 40 percent,"" said Janine A. Parry, the poll’s director. ""These are practices that have been widely used and have worked well."" Weighting for education One of the most troublesome problems in 2016 was most polls’ decision not to ""weight"" for educational attainment among a poll’s respondents. ""Weighting"" means adjusting the results so that the demographics of the sample approximates the demographics of the state being tested or, for a national survey, the country as a whole. This helps straighten out the results of a poll that happened to have an unrepresentative sample. Weighting is common for some basic factors such as race and ethnicity. But it was not commonly done for education. One of the signature aspects of the 2016 presidential race is the degree to which voters with lower educational attainment voted for Trump and voters with higher educational attainment voted for Clinton, But ""many polls, especially at the state level, did not adjust their weights to correct for the over-representation of college graduates in their surveys, and the result was over-estimation of support for Clinton,"" the association’s report found. A case in point was the University of New Hampshire Survey Center’s 2016 polling, which its director called ""the worst we ever had."" ""We did not weight by the level of education,"" said director Andrew E. Smith. ""It had never been an issue."" After the fact, Smith applied the proper weighting, and ""everything snapped back to being accurate,"" he said. ""So, going forward, we will have to include education in our weighting."" Mark Blumenthal, the head of election polling with SurveyMonkey, agreed that the industry has taken the educational weighting issue seriously. He said that his company is digging even deeper. ""We’ve always weighted by education, but our review of nearly a million interviews we conducted last year demonstrated that we should have been even more granular in our approach,"" said Blumenthal, who also co-founded the website now known as HuffPost Pollster. ""In 2016, there was an abnormal gap between the vote preferences of those with bachelor’s degrees and those with postgraduate degrees. Had we broken out these two different groups of ‘college graduates,’ our estimates would have been even closer."" Words of wisdom The experts offered some parting advice for reading polls after 2016. • Don’t cherry-pick the results you prefer. ""I’m using the same strategy today that I’ve used since I️ started in this business,"" said Amy Walter, national editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. ""Take the highest and lowest polls, throw them out, and the result will be somewhere in the middle."" • When you have a series of polls over time, ""pay attention to the trend, not the margin,"" Walter said. In other words, if a candidate is getting stronger or weaker over time in a series of polls, that’s a pattern worth watching. • ""If you see a poll from a pollster you’ve never heard of, be skeptical,"" Walter said. • Consider various scenarios for voter turnout scenarios. This became especially important in the recent Alabama Senate race between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones. With Moore an unusually polarizing figure and accused of sexual misconduct, and with Jones running as a Democrat in a state that hadn’t elected one statewide in years, the dynamics of who might turn up at the polls was unclear right up through Election Day. ""The 2018 midterms are still far away,"" said Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster who serves as a partner at the firm GBA Strategies. Given that, it’s important to consider ""different assumptions about the composition and size of the electorate."" • ""Pay attention to undecided voters,"" Walter said. ""Undecideds almost always break toward the challenger. It happened in 2016 to Trump. In midterms they break away from the party holding the White House."" In the recent Virginia gubernatorial election, she noted, Republican Ed Gillespie was at 44 percent. He ultimately took 45 percent, with Democrat Ralph Northam taking most of the undecided voters. • Don’t just look at ""horse-race"" polls -- the polls showing head-to-head matchups between candidates. ""Campaign pollsters have long argued there\'s far more to assessing a race than just the ballot question,"" Omero said. ""Awareness of the candidates, engagement and enthusiasm, candidate image, and external news events can all fluctuate and change a race."" Focus groups, she added, can also be effective in gauging voters\' feelings -- especially in less populated areas, where they are not done as frequently. The professional forecasters said they are keeping their alarm systems on alert in today’s confusing polling universe. ""I’ve always been skeptical of surveys (taken by machines rather than live callers), and I’m not sure that Internet polls at the state and local level have been perfected,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor at the Cook Political Report. ""Some public pollsters have figured out how to do it. Others haven’t. I still have great faith in polls conducted for campaigns, campaign committees and super PACs, but like most of these pollsters will admit, their job gets harder by the cycle.""

MONTPELIER, Vt. — Some entrepreneurs hoping to provide renewable energy to Massachusetts electricity customers are touting their projects in the run-up to the decision, expected in late January, about which company could be chosen to help provide clean power to the Bay State. The stakes are potentially huge for the dozens of companies that have submitted proposals, some of which are proposing major infrastructure projects that would carry Canadian electricity produced by wind or hydro power across Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine to reach Massachusetts. While there are a variety of projects vying to be chosen by Massachusetts in the current round, even if they’re not selected, it’s likely there will be other calls in the future for projects to provide more renewable power to southern New England. Last week, the backers of New Hampshire’s Northern Pass project, which would run a 192-mile transmission line from Pittsburg on the Canadian border to Deerfield, carrying enough hydropower to about a million homes, were optimistic. Despite a vow of continued pressure from people who object to the Northern Pass project, the backer of the project Eversource expects to receive final regulatory approval in both the United States and Canada, allowing it to begin construction in April. Northern Pass claims it will be ready to transmit power by 2020. “We feel we have submitted the most mature project,” said Eversource spokeswoman Kaitlyn Woods. “We are confident it will be selected.” National Grid, the backer of the project known as the Granite State Power Link, is running online advertisements promoting its project. The company announced last week it had filed for a presidential permit, the first regulatory step needed for it to bring 1,200 megawatts of power to southern New England. The project would be built alongside an existing line that enters the United States at Norton, Vermont, and connect with an upgraded power line at Monroe, New Hampshire. It’s unclear when that project could be ready for construction. “I think we’re well positioned to win because ultimately we are the best options for customers,” said National Grid’s Joe Rossignoli. In addition to the Granite State Power Link, National Grid is backing a smaller project that would bring power from new wind and solar projects from upstate New York to Massachusetts. Another proposed project, the New England Clean Power Link, would carry power 154 miles down Lake Champlain from the Canadian border and into Vermont, where it would connect to the grid and feed Massachusetts’ demand for clean power. The project is backed by TDI-New England. “In addition to meeting all the Commonwealth’s requirements, TDI-NE believes the New England Clean Power Link is the right turnkey project for Massachusetts,” said Donald Jessome, president of TDI-New England. “Our project is fully permitted, enjoys wide spread support up and down the line and offers a fixed price bid.” In 2016, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker signed a law requiring the state to solicit contracts for 1,200 megawatts of renewable energy, including hydropower, onshore wind and solar power, along with at least 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind energy. Last summer, dozens of companies filed proposals – large and small – to meet that goal for the onshore supply of power. The timeline calls for the “selection of projects for negotiation” on Jan. 25 with the contracts being approved by late April. In Maine, the utility Central Maine Power has proposed working with two Canadian energy suppliers to move Canadian electricity along more than 90 miles of existing CMP corridors and 51 miles of newly purchased rights of way in western Maine. “We think these are the two best ideas,” CMP President Sara Burns said last summer when the proposals were released.

We've received your submission. Living By Rebecca Santiago December 20, 2017 | 5:10pm | Updated December 21, 2017 | 11:37am “Good Morning America” and “Nightline” co-anchor Dan Harris knows a little bit about stress. In 2004, the 46-year-old TV journalist became the headline when he suffered from a panic attack on live TV. “I was overtaken by a huge bolt of fear and couldn’t speak. I had to quit in the middle of the broadcast. It was very embarrassing,” the Upper West Sider, who was suffering from undiagnosed depression at the time, tells The Post. Harris was willing to do anything to avoid a repeat incident — even if that meant going a little woo-woo. So he gave meditation a shot. Today, he’s one of the practice’s staunchest advocates, with his “10% Happier” book, app and podcast empire. When your inner Grinch starts to get the best of you this holiday season, turn to these beginner-friendly meditation techniques from Harris’ new book, “Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics” (Spiegel & Grau, out Tuesday). When to use it: When you need to calm down in a minute or less. “This is a good one for when your annoying uncle starts saying things about politics that you disagree with,” Harris says. How to do it: Stop what you’re doing wherever you are, and turn your attention to your breathing. The goal, Harris says, is to take “10 good breaths.” Breathe in slowly and deeply, counting each inhalation in your head. Focus on feeling your breath as it moves throughout your body. As you exhale, “imagine breathing out any tension,” Harris writes. If your mind wanders, as minds are “tragically” wont to do, simply start over. When to use it: Once you’ve set your out-of-office message, wrapped the presents and baked the ham, allow yourself to revel in some delicious, luxurious me time. How to do it: Flop down on your back somewhere comfy — the floor, the bed, the couch. Have Netflix on in the background, if you like; this exercise should feel indulgent and “slovenly,” Harris writes. Close your eyes and begin breathing deeply. Imagine yourself sinking into the ground, and “notice any feelings of rest or peace” as they float to your mind. If you get sleepy, let yourself drift off. Stay here for two minutes or two hours. It’s a “stolen moment,” Harris adds — so enjoy it. When to use it: Pull this one out when you’re about to go full-on Cookie Monster and eat “75 cookies instead of one,” Harris says. How to do it: This one’s got a handy acronym: SURF. Step 1: Stop what you’re doing as soon as you recognize the tickle of an urge. Pause, breathe, and try to “insert the tiniest space between stimulus and response,” Harris writes. Step 2: Understand — meaning, acknowledge that you have an urge, and think ahead to how you’d feel after acting on it (bad, probably). Try to physically locate the urge in your body, sit with that feeling for a minute and move onto Step 3: Relax. Focus on your breathing, and observe your urges spike and dip without judgment. If you make it through that, you’ll arrive at the final step: Freedom from having a knee-jerk reaction to the urge. Well done.

Sara,Burns,['http://www.pressherald.com/2017/12/06/cmp-touts-its-bid-to-build-transmission-line-through-maine/'],b'739',"['Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The state\'s largest utility says its $1 billion proposal is the cheapest alternative to supply Massachusetts with hydroelectricity from Canada. Central Maine Power is facing tough competition in a $1 billion bid to build a transmission line from Canada through Maine and held a news conference Wednesday to challenge its rivals and assert itself as the cheapest and most-reliable choice to supply Massachusetts with hydroelectricity. The event took place in Augusta, and was attended by Maine business leaders and municipal supporters. But the message was meant for New England media, which joined via conference call. The takeaway was: CMP’s project will save Massachusetts electric customers $600 million over two competing proposals – Northern Pass in New Hampshire and the New England Clean Power Link in Vermont. “We have great momentum,” said Sara Burns, CMP’s president, who ticked off the advantages of the company’s New England Clean Energy Connect project. Burns was joined by Bob Kump, CEO of CMP’s parent company, Avangrid Networks. “The New England Clean Energy Connect will deliver up to 20 percent more clean energy for the region’s utility customers with lower construction costs than any of the competing proposals that are interconnecting with Hydro-Québec,” Kump said. CMP-Avangrid’s claims were immediately contested by Martin Murray, manager for Eversource Media Relations in New Hampshire and a spokesman for Northern Pass. “Northern Pass is the most mature project available,” Murray said. “By being in service fully two years prior to CMP or any other conceptual project, Northern Pass will deliver hundreds of millions of additional dollars in benefits to Massachusetts consumers and earlier progress toward achieving clean-energy goals.” Murray added that Northern Pass already has fully executed contracts with all major contractors and suppliers, and labor agreements with union workers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. But neither Northern Pass or CMP mentioned the fact that large transmission projects can face public opposition, and Northern Pass already has been delayed for years over concerns about overhead lines running through scenic areas. The project now vows to bury 60 miles underground. In Maine, Burns said the CMP project has been met with support in towns along the corridor. At Wednesday’s event, she said she wasn’t aware of any organized opposition. But anti-wind activists who see the project as also having the potential to connect new wind farms in the western Maine mountains are set to fight it, if it’s approved. “This project does nothing good for Maine – it’s being built for Massachusetts utilities and shareholders of Avangrid/CMP,” said Richard McDonald, president of Saving Maine. “Destroying tens of thousands of acres of pristine landscape for corporate profit is the bottom line for this project – Maine gets used again.” Tuesday’s conflicting statements reflect the fact that a multibillion dollar competition is approaching a key deadline. Massachusetts passed a law last year requiring the state to seek long-term contracts for offshore wind farms and land-based renewable energy. The law calls for 1,600 megawatts of wind energy and 1,200 megawatts from other sources, such as hydro, land-based wind and solar. A megawatt of generating capacity provides enough energy to serve between 750 and 1,000 homes. Dozens of bids were submitted from across New England and eastern Canada, including a handful of other proposals from Maine. Initial land-based winners are scheduled to be announced on Jan. 25. Initial winners will be asked to submit long-term contracts in April. All projects will have to clear extensive environmental and regulatory reviews, as well as public hearings. But only one project involving Hydro-Quebec will be chosen, so the three competitors are trying to stand out. “This is really going to come down to, how many megawatt hours can you deliver at what price, and can you get your line permitted,” said Jeremy Payne, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. “But everybody is looking to get ahead. And CMP-Avangrid isn’t immune to the optics of showing the benefits they’ll bring to ratepayers.” The other competitors also are trying to make a public case for why they’re the best choice. In Western Massachusetts, the New England Clean Power Link announced that if it wins the contract, it will give $1 million a year over 20 years to help upgrade the energy efficiency of low-income homes. The lead sponsor, Transmission Developers Inc., plans to lay a high-voltage transmission cable under Lake Champlain in Vermont to carry up to 1,000 megawatts to the Bay State. In New Hampshire, Northern Pass is holding “job and supplier fairs” in December and January, meant to showcase the jobs, subcontractor opportunities and supplies needed to complete the 192-mile line, designed to carry 1,090 megawatts. A news release this week said Northern Pass representatives will discuss the project’s business directory, a list of local services available to the project’s many workers, including restaurants, gas stations and hotels. It noted that the U.S. Department of Energy recently issued a Presidential Permit for cross-border construction. Murray said other permits are expected to be in hand by April, making Northern Pass “the only project that will be ‘shovel ready’ early in the second quarter of 2018.” Both Northern Pass and the Clean Energy Link have stated costs of $1.6 billion. CMP-Avangrid announced Wednesday that it can do its project for $950 million. That would save Massachusetts electric customers more than $600 million over the reported costs of the two competitors, which are as much as 60 percent higher. During the news event, Burns was asked why she was announcing the figures now, since decision-makers in Massachusetts already know them. Burns replied that she’s often asked about the cost and decided it was time to release it publicly. Until now, CMP had indicated that the cost was confidential. But in fact, Burns confirmed to the Portland Press Herald in July, when the company first announced the project, that the cost would be in the $1 billion range. When a reporter asked if her strategy was to put pressure on evaluators in Massachusetts, Burns said it had become clear from what competitors were saying that CMP should talk about its advantages. The CMP-Avangrid bid is a 145-mile line that would follow a corridor it already owns, from Beattie Township, on the Canadian border north of Route 27 and Coburn Gore, through Farmington and Jay to Lewiston, where it would connect to the regional electric grid at an upgraded substation. The project will make fuller use of CMP’s recently completed Maine Power Reliability Program, a $1.4 billion power grid infrastructure investment paid for by ratepayers from across New England. That project proves CMP’s ability to build a line of this scale on time and on budget, Burns said. The total cost would be paid by Massachusetts electric customers. Maine would benefit from construction jobs, added tax revenue and anticipated savings on wholesale energy costs over the 20-year life of the power contract. It’s also possible that a similar line, being proposed by CMP and NextEra Energy in the clean-energy bidding, could carry power from new solar and energy-storage projects in western Maine, as well as wind turbines on both sides of the border.

""The NECEC is the only proposal capable of firm delivery of 1,200 megawatts of renewable energy that provides maximum environmental and energy benefits at less cost than any competing proposal,"" CMP stated in its news release. ""The transmission project has received wide support from host communities and business leaders in Maine, and is on track to receive necessary state and federal permitting reviews in 2018."" Bob Kump, CEO of Avangrid Networks (NYSE: AGR), said NECEC would deliver ""up to 20% more clean energy for the region\'s utility customers with lower construction costs than any of the competing proposals that are interconnecting with Hydro-Quebec."" In a Q&A with Mainebiz earlier this fall, CMP President and CEO Sara Burns said the company\'s proposal to tap more than 1,000MW of hydropower from Hydro-Quebec was one of three bids submitted to the Massachusetts Clean Energy RFP involving Hydro-Quebec. The two competing bidders are: Burns noted the three bids involving Hydro-Quebec were mutually exclusive. In its news release, CMP stated that at 1,200 megawatts its New England Clean Energy Connect proposal is 20% larger than TDI New England\'s 1,000MW project through Vermont and 10% larger than EverSource\'s 1,090MW project in New Hampshire. ""Given our unique advantages to control costs and to leverage recent investments in the New England grid, we can deliver the largest infusion of Canadian energy into the region\'s energy supply for everyone to share in the environmental and economic benefits,"" Burns said in the news release. In her interview with Mainebiz, Burns noted that CMP had acquired about a 54-mile right-of-way from what the utility already owned to the Maine-Quebec border and had accomplished that with four landowners. All told, the NECEC project consists of 145 miles of new high voltage direct current transmission line that would tie into the existing transmission system, as well as some upgrades to existing system. She also noted the NECEC proposal will deliver a larger volume of clean renewable energy at lower costs in part by leveraging the recently completed Maine Power Reliability Program, a $1.4 billion power grid infrastructure investment paid for by ratepayers from across New England that was completed on-time and on-budget in 2015. Issued by Massachusetts utilities and the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources on March 31, the Clean Energy RFP calls for 20-year power purchase agreements for delivered renewable energy to meet the state\'s ambitious clean energy goals. Almost 50 bids were submitted, with at least 14 involving projects located in or passing through Maine. Under the terms of the RFP, projects will only be considered if they include ""significant cost containment features"" to protect Massachusetts ratepayers and if they ""ensure that transmission cost overruns, if any, are not borne by ratepayers."" CMP asserted that its NECEC\' proposal would provide transmission services at a long-term fixed price to provide market certainty. ""Acting as \'battery storage\' for New England, NECEC will deliver firm power from Hydro-Québec, even during peak winter months when energy supply prices are most volatile and intermittent resources are not as reliable,"" CMP stated.

About seven years ago, CMP started installing new smart meters on more than 600,000 Maine homes and businesses as part of its Advanced Metering Infrastructure program. With roughly half of the AMI to be funded through a federal grant and half by customers, state regulators approved the investment because it promised a host of money-saving and other benefits. Those included automated meter-reading, saving money on human meter readers, on gas for their trucks and reducing the number of estimated meter readings. And it would help CMP remotely track outages, while sending automated texts or emails to customers about expected restoration times. Through the early innings of the windstorm that swept the state late on Sunday, Oct. 29, CMP officials say, the meters did their duty, accurately charting the climb in outages, up to some 400,000 customers through that Monday morning. And then, at midday, the AMI system stopped reporting. “About 12 o’clock, 11:57, it just sort of flatlined. It stopped climbing and it was pretty clear we weren’t getting any more information from it,” says CMP spokesman John Carroll. Carroll says that as utility poles went down in the storm, it wasn’t just power lines that got taken out — so did radio transmitters for the wireless smart-grid “mesh” that were installed at the top of the poles. Meters themselves lost power, and over time battery backup power for some components was drained. By Tuesday the network’s performance was down by more than half. “We were blind in a way we hadn’t been in a very long time, and in a way we hadn’t experienced. So we don’t really see it in any way as a failure of the system. It’s certainly a learning, something we recognized; we’d never seen it crash before,” Carroll says. CMP’s customer communication systems were significantly degraded, with customers reporting inaccurate or spotty outage information and restoration estimates on the company’s website, through the smart-meter web portal and through email or text messages. The company couldn’t “ping” meters to verify their status. But CMP officials say it did not slow the actual storm response. “Having 405,000 smart meters not talking to us when they had no power doesn’t change how we manage the storm,” says CMP CEO Sara Burns. Burns says the smart-meter system has proven a valuable tool in managing the response to smaller outages. But this time, she says, just as would have happened in any big and damaging storm — and whether or not the smart-meter network was functioning — the company relied on traditional tools to assess damage and prioritize the response: calls from customers, automated calls to customers, staff field reports and meter checks. Choices were made, trucks rolled and crews got to work in what officials say proved to be the most widespread outages seen in the company’s 118 year history. As poles were repaired, lines re-energized and electric service restored, the smart-meter network started to come back, too. By Nov. 5, CMP says its Advanced Metering Infrastructure was 95 percent functional. And it’s at 100 percent today. But CMP’s critics are far from ready to dismiss the vulnerabilities the storm revealed. “Well this was a colossal system failure,” says state Rep. Seth Berry, a Bowdoinham Democrat who co-chairs the Legislature’s Committee on Energy, Utilities and Technology. “It was a total and, until now, unrevealed failure of a system that CMP used to increase profits to its foreign shareholders and to lay off lineworkers and meter readers. Importantly, it was costly to ratepayers because just like we paid for AMI in the first place with interest, Maine residents and businesses are on the hook for the vast majority of the cleanup costs, with interest.” Berry is spearheading a legislative inquiry into the storm response by both CMP and Emera. The smart-meter system’s nonperformance, and whether that took staff away from other critical tasks, will be scrutinized, Berry says, as will the effectiveness of the utilities’ tree-trimming programs and other damage management tools. Even before that gets going, the state’s Public Utilities Commission next week formally opens its inquiry into the storm response. As part of that, the state’s Public Advocate, Barry Hobbins, says he is hiring a forensic investigator to document in detail how the response was managed. Hobbins, who has been briefed by CMP officials, cautions that it’s too early to draw many conclusions about what went right or wrong. “There was, obviously, a significant event that occurred that showed that the system failed. With the information that will be gathered through this investigation, I am of hope that this is one of the issues that will be brought into the forefront to make sure that our smart meters stay smart and don’t turn dumb when they’re not in operation,” he says. All stakeholders can be expected to consider ways to fortify the smart-meter system. Burns says there should be relatively inexpensive ways to do it. “We probably should put more solar panels up to strengthen some of our equipment. We might move some of our equipment onto towers that already have generators. Or we might put up generators,” she says. “In the end, no matter what, every customer who lost power, we lose the meter.” Many CMP customers are contending with one more effect of that loss. After almost seven years of automatic meter readings, CMP has had to estimate bills for the period when the smart meters were down. That means customers are being charged based on the amount of energy they used during the same billing cycle last year. That estimate, of course, does not account for the period when customers were without power. CMP says any overpayments will be trued up and credited in the following billing cycle.', 'PORTLAND, Maine, Dec. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Â Sappi North America, a leading producer and supplier of diversified paper and packaging products,Â today announced that Laura Thompson, Director of Sustainable Development and Policy Initiatives at Sappi, was named the 2018 Woman of Distinction by Girl Scouts of Maine.

Microsoft\'s new Insights in Excel feature uses artificial intelligence to help users find data trends that are tucked deep in their spreadsheets. Microsoft has found another use for artificial intelligence. This time, the Redmond, Wash. software giant wants to help Excel users find data and business insights that aren\'t readily apparent when they are working on their spreadsheets. Among the latest updates to Office 365, Microsoft is including an AI tool that scours Excel spreadsheets and unearths information that users may have missed. The tool, called Insights in Excel, is ""a new service that automatically highlights patterns it detects, which makes it easier for everyone to explore and analyze their data,"" blogged Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate vice president for the Office division at Microsoft. ""Powered by machine learning, Insights helps identify trends, outliers, and other useful visualizations, providing new and useful perspectives on data,"" the Microsoft executive wrote in the blog. Microsoft will begin rolling out an Insights in Excel preview to Office insiders this month. The Office Insider program, like its Windows counterpart, grants participants early access to upcoming versions of Office application and services. The Insights in Excel pane appears alongside the main interface and generates a scrollable assortment of charts that are reminiscent of the visualizations produced by Power BI, Microsoft\'s cloud-based business intelligence and analytics offering. Users can click on any chart and easily append it to their Excel files. Not everyone uses Excel, but practically all workers encounter some jargon or corporate terminology during the course of the workday. To help newcomers and even longtime workers come to grips unfamiliar terms and other business shorthand, Microsoft announced the new Acronyms feature in Word. Using machine learning, Acronyms trawls Microsoft Graph to clarify unfamiliar terms. Microsoft is a collection of APIs that uses employee and business data to provide contextual information when users interact with Office 365 applications. If users encounter some unfamiliar jargon, they can use the Review menu item to decipher what the author meant based on emails and documents where it had already been defined. However, Office users will have a bit of a wait before the Acronyms feature materializes. Acronyms will be distributed to commercial Office 365 customers sometime in 2018, the company said. Mobile Outlook users who keep tabs on their email inboxes will also have to wait for another AI-enabled feature, one that will help them avoid being late to meetings and social engagements. In December, Microsoft is incorporating Cortana, the virtual assistant technology in the Windows 10 operating system and the Harman Kardon Invoke smart speaker, into Outlook for iOS. With Cortana onboard, Outlook will be able to alert users to upcoming appointments, along with driving or mass transit directions that will get them there on time. Called Time to Leave, this feature will also be added to the Android version of the Outlook app in 2018. Lastly, users who upload their receipts, whiteboard pictures, screenshots and other visual content containing text to OneDrive and SharePoint will soon be able to quickly find information stored in those image files. A new intelligent search capability will allow Office 365 commercial users to retrieve files with a simple, text-based search by the end of 2017, Microsoft promised.

Amy,Walter,['https://cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/wave-comin'],b'723',"[""The last two weeks have seen some significant movement in Democrats favor. First, there were the impressive results from last Tuesday's elections. This week, we’ve seen two polls — one by Quinnipiac and one by Marist — that show Democrats with a congressional ballot advantage of +13 to +15. Three other recent polls — ABC/Washington Post, Fox, and NBC/Wall Street Journal — show Democrats with an advantage of anywhere from +7 to +15. These are political wave numbers. \u200b But, is it realistic to think that Democrats could retain this kind of advantage into 2018? Moreover, given the Republican structural advantage — gerrymandered seats plus Democrats’ self-sorting into urban areas — is that kind of margin even big enough to net 24 seats? My colleague David Wasserman has been digging into the question of just how big of a wave Democrats need to get in order to surf into the majority. The short answer: they need to see a generic ballot advantage of +8 or more, which roughly translates to getting at least 54 percent or more of the national House vote in 2018. The last time Democrats enjoyed a margin of +8 or more in a mid-term year was 2006. That year, Democrats won the House vote by 8.5 percent. The last time that Democrats got into the double digits was 2008 when they carried the House vote by D+11. This has led to a lots of talk that Democrats can only hit significant margins of victory in presidential elections when their base is more engaged and involved. It also helped to have a transformational candidate - Barack Obama - at the top of the ticket. Something they obviously don't have in 2018. But, there is precedent for Democrats winning the House vote by double digits in mid-term years. In the post-Watergate midterm of 1974, Democrats won by a whopping 17 points. In Ronald Reagan’s first midterm of 1982, Democrats won the House vote by 12 points. \u200b Of course our country is more polarized than it was in the 20th Century. And, redistricting/gerrymandering has gotten more sophisticated. As everyone knows by heart right now, just 23 Republicans sit in seats carried by Hillary Clinton. I don't dismiss those realities. However, I am having a nagging sense of deja vu - a feeling like I've been here and heard these same arguments before. Way back in 2006, my boss Charlie Cook was warning that the year was shaping up to be a wave year. I argued that unlike the last wave election of 1994, the party holding the White House was much better prepared. Republicans in 2006 had significant financial advantages. They had structural advantages. And, Democrats couldn’t sneak up on Republicans as Republicans had to Democrats in 1994. Obviously, my theory was wrong and Charlie was right. Lots has changed over the course of those years — the rise of SuperPACs, digital targeting, data analytics. But, there has been one important, overarching constant: a candidate can control for many things, but he/she can’t change the political mood. If it is with you, you get an extra advantage you may or may not deserve. When it is against you, even the best, most prepared candidates can lose. This was true in 1994. It was true in 2006. It was true in 2010. Getting a tax bill across the finish line isn’t going to be enough to change the mood of the country. It is going to take something much more significant to do that. A good economy is helpful to the GOP as it can cut down on some of the headwinds coming at them right now. But, it’s not clear to me that it’s enough to fundamentally alter the way voters see Congress, the GOP and the President. In 2016 we made the mistake of rationalizing away the prospect of a Trump victory. He was too unorthodox. He couldn't possibly sustain momentum through the grueling primary campaign. We should not make same mistake in 2018. Sure, a lot can change between now and next November. And, Democrats have a narrow path to 24 seats - even with a big wave or tailwind. But, do not ignore what’s right in front of us. A wave is building. If I were a Republican running for Congress, I’d be taking that more seriously than ever.

In a new analysis, Cook editor Amy Walter says she feels a similarity to a wave of Democratic congressional victories in 2006, in which the party took control of the House, the Senate and a majority of governorships during former President George W. Bush's second term. “[B]ack in 2006 ... I argued that unlike the last wave election of 1994, the party holding the White House was much better prepared. Republicans in 2006 had significant financial advantages,” Walter writes. “They had structural advantages. And, Democrats couldn’t sneak up on Republicans as Republicans had to Democrats in 1994. Obviously, my theory was wrong.” Walter argues that the “political mood” surrounding the 2018 race could shift elections in favor of Democrats. “Do not ignore what’s right in front of us,” Walter writes. “A wave is building. If I were a Republican running for Congress, I’d be taking that more seriously than ever.”The analysis follows last week's first major elections since the 2016 presidential race. Democrats gained major victories across the country, including sweeping statewide elections in Virginia and winning the New Jersey governor’s race. Last month, Cook Political Report shifted 12 House districts in favor of Democrats a year ahead of the 2018 midterms. A poll released at the beginning of November showed Democrats hold an 11-point lead over Republicans on a generic House ballot. The Washington Post/ABC News poll found that 51 percent of registered voters said they would vote for the Democrat in their district, while 40 percent said they would vote for the Republican. Democrats will need to gain 24 seats to take control of the House in 2018. View the discussion thread.

Addressing a black-tie crowd at the National Building Museum on Thursday night, Vice President Mike Pence hailed congressional progress toward what he said would be the ""biggest tax cut in American history."" As he spoke, less than a mile away the Senate Finance Committee was racing to wrap up work on a tax bill that will hand large cuts to the wealthiest while raising taxes on those earning between $10,000 and $75,000 over the next decade. That\'s according to a new analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Republicans are making rapid strides toward approving a tax package, the cornerstone of their agenda. The House passed its version of a bill with some room to spare Thursday just two weeks after it was introduced. Senate prospects are less assured, considering the party\'s narrower margin and blowback from a critical number of Republicans there, although the Finance Committee approved its plan along party-lines late Thursday night. But if internal disagreement doesn\'t stymie it first, the party\'s argument for the project is on a collision course with the nonpartisan scorekeepers\' assessment of it. From The Washington Post\'s Mike DeBonis and Damian Paletta\'s report on Thursday\'s action: ""The House bill delivers more than 80 percent of its overall cuts to corporations, business owners and wealthy families who are subject to the federal estate tax, according to estimates released by the Joint Committee on Taxation. But most middle-class Americans would see an immediate tax cut because of a lowering of individual tax rates, the near-doubling of the standard deduction and a larger child tax credit. ""But under the House bill, many households that itemize their deductions - taking advantage of write-offs for state income taxes, medical expenses and more - could see immediate tax increases. In future years, the benefits of the bill for individuals wane because of the phaseout of a key tax credit and because the bill would change how the government calculates inflation, moving them more quickly into higher tax brackets. The Senate plan has significant problems of its own when it comes to lower- and middle-income workers. To comply with the chamber\'s budget rules, the bill prioritizes permanent corporate cuts over breaks for individuals that sunset after a decade. But those at the bottom of the income scale would see tax hikes sooner than that. My colleague Heather Long explains: ""Tax increases for households earning $10,000 to $30,000 would start in 2021 and grow sharply from there, JCT found. By 2027, most Americans earning $75,000 a year or less would be forced to pay more in taxes, while people earning more than $100,000 a year would continue to pay less. The report generated intense debate on Capitol Hill. ""Most of the hit to poor and working-class Americans would come from the Senate Republicans\' push to insert a major health care change into the tax bill. Republicans are repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance or face a penalty, a move that would lead to 13 million more uninsured Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has said. Many of those people earn modest incomes and currently receive tax credits and subsidies from the government to help them afford insurance. If the Senate GOP bill becomes law, premiums are expected to rise and millions would likely opt not to buy insurance anymore, meaning their tax breaks would go away, explained Thomas Barthold, head of the JCT."" Voters may not have studied the JCT\'s distributional tables, but they certainly get the point. A Quinnipiac poll released this week showed they disapprove of the GOP tax plan by 52 to 25 percent. And by 59 to 33 percent, they think the proposals benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. Republican voters unsurprisingly view their party\'s tax agenda much more favorably than the broader electorate, approving of it by 60 to 15 percent, the survey found. That may be all Republican lawmakers care to consider as they stoke a sense of urgency behind notching a quick win on a tax package. But the Quinnipiac poll also found that Democrats have a 13-point edge over Republicans on the generic congressional ballot - a result that tracks with a recent Marist poll showing Democrats with a 15-point advantage. As the Cook Political Report\'s Amy Walter wrote Thursday, ""Do not ignore what\'s right in front of us. A wave is building. If I were a Republican running for Congress, I\'d be taking that more seriously than ever."" --- - Mulvaney for CFPB? The Post\'s Renae Merle and Damian Paletta: ""Trump is considering naming Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on an interim basis, potentially setting up the watchdog agency for a massive overhaul, according to a person briefed on the planning. Mulvaney, who once called the CFPB a \'joke,\' would replace Richard Cordray, one of the few remaining Obama-era banking regulators, who announced Wednesday that he plans to step down as the agency\'s director by the end of the month. If given the job, Mulvaney would probably lead both agencies until a permanent head of CFPB is chosen and confirmed by the Senate, said the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The offices of the OMB and the CFPB are across the street from each other in Washington."" finance-policy']",0.0,15.333333333333334,1.277777777777778,0.0,1023578.0,1

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 5:03 pm Lisa Ring, candidate for the Democratic nomination for Georgia’s 1st Congressional District, does not by any means have an easy path to Congress, should she win nomination. After Lindsay Thomas decided to leave the U.S. House of Representatives to be a part of the Atlanta Olympic effort in 1992, the Democratic nominee has only topped 40 percent once — Barbara Christmas, who ran against Jack Kingston that year. But Ring was on St. Simons Island at Castaways Lounge Friday evening looking to meet local residents and chart a new path. “When you talk about traditionally what has happened in past elections, there is no normal,” said Ring, the chairwoman of the Bryan County Democratic Committee. She noted that each election has its own different circumstances. “As far as parties go, we do have the number of Democrats we need to win a race here — it’s a matter of getting them out to vote, and that’s why we’re focused on getting to the rural areas of Georgia, and the urban areas, but talking to people who are traditionally neglected that nobody wants to talk to,” Ring said. “It’s important for us to talk to everybody — Republicans and Democrats, and especially independents, and to talk to them about the issues.” There has been some movement in recent years. Incumbent U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter ran unopposed in 2016, but his opponent pulled 39.1 percent in 2014, and Kingston’s last opponent took 37 percent of the vote, which while a far shot from 50-50, was an improvement from the 1994-2010 Democratic efforts. “What I’ve learned since I announced — it’s been about five months, back in June — is that people are ready for change, and they’re ready to talk about the issues, and it’s been very encouraging,” Ring said. “And, momentum has really been growing. I think people are ready to have a voice, to be listened to, and I think the incumbent, Buddy Carter, is exactly what people want to get away from.” With the results of the 2017 legislative and gubernatorial elections in other states, forecasting experts suggest a turn may be coming for the 2018 elections. Cook Political Report editor Amy Walter published a new analysis Thursday stating 2018 could be a Democratic wave election on par with 2006. “Do not ignore what’s right in front of us,” Walter wrote. “A wave is building. If I were a Republican running for Congress, I’d be taking that more seriously than ever.” Cook’s partisan voter index — PVI — lists the 1st District as a Republican 9-point advantage, all else being even. But that’s far from the safest GOP district in the country, or even in Georgia. For instance, the 6th Congressional District, which went down to the wire in June as Republican Karen Handel won by 3.6 percent. The Cook PVI for the 6th District is an 8-point GOP advantage. Also, South Carolina’s 5th District — a 9-point GOP advantage — went to Republican Ralph Norman by only 3.1 percent in a June special election. One of the other story lines from the 2017 results, beside Democrats winning in unexpected places, was a significant number of women both running for and winning races. Julie Jordan, who attended the Ring meet-and-greet and is a member of Women’s Voices of Glynn County, said her organization does not endorse candidates, but does encourage women to run for public office. “I think just to see strong women like Lisa run for office, is just kind of uplifting to see women step up and become a part of the political process,” Jordan said. “So, I think it’s exciting — I think women have kind of held back, worried they were not qualified enough, and now they’re coming to the forefront saying, ‘Hey, I can do this, and I can make a difference,’ which I think could be helpful.” Whenever Wes Wolfe posts new content, you'll get an email delivered to your inbox with a link.

Let us know what's going on!"", ""Published: Nov 17, 2017 9:08 a.m. ET Papadopoulos said he had bigger Trump campaign role By Some Senate Republicans believe their party’s plans to rewrite the tax code may be costlier than it appears, Politico reports. Senators including Bob Corker of Tennessee are worried Congress will extend a host of ostensibly temporary tax cuts, driving the proposal’s cost much higher than its official price, now pegged at $1.4 trillion. “There are several of us that are trying to figure out a way to make sure this doesn’t hurt us relative to deficits,” Corker said. Concerns from Corker and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake are a new threat to GOP tax plans after Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wouldn’t support the tax bill over its treatment of small businesses. The Senate Finance Committee passed its plan late Thursday. The House also approved its version Thursday. The two chambers must agree on a single measure to send to President Donald Trump. Also read: This brutal chart shows what happens when the Senate tax cuts sunset. Democratic wave seen: Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report takes a look at recent polls and finds a Democratic wave building. “If I were a Republican running for Congress, I’d be taking that more seriously than ever,” she writes after considering polls that show Democrats with a congressional ballot advantage of 13 to 15 points. She says passing a tax bill wouldn’t be enough to change the mood of the country. A good economy is helpful to Republicans, she writes, “but, it’s not clear to me that it’s enough to fundamentally alter the way voters see Congress, the GOP and the President.” Lesson from 2016: Don't ignore or rationalize away what's right in front of you. A Dem wave is building. And it's big. https://t.co/JkmyMEPFdF Adviser said he had bigger role: George Papadopoulos, a former campaign aide to President Trump, said last year Trump telephoned him to discuss his new job as a foreign policy adviser and that the two had at least one personal meeting the White House has not acknowledged. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents working for special counsel Robert Mueller. Politico says Papadopoulos made his statements in interviews with two Greek journalists during and after the 2016 election. He also said he’d been given a “blank check” to choose a senior Trump administration job, and was authorized to represent Trump in overseas meetings and at a campaign event in New York. Trump scolds Franken: Trump attacked Sen. Al Franken on Twitter Thursday night, after TV host Leeann Tweeden accused the Minnesota Democrat of kissing and groping her without her consent in 2006. Franken apologized and said he’d cooperate with a Senate ethics investigation. Trump called a photo of the incident posted by Tweeden “really bad,” and dubbed the senator “Al Frankenstien.” As MarketWatch wrote, Trump has yet to weigh in on the sexual allegations toward Alabama Republican Senate hopeful Roy Moore. And many on social media called Trump’s comments hypocritical in light of his comments to “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush about using his own fame to grope women. The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad, speaks a thousand words. Where do his hands go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6 while she sleeps? ..... .And to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women.

Nine women now have come forward with accusations against Republican Roy Moore. TINA JOHNSON: He just grabbed my behind. BEVERLY NELSON: I thought that he was going to rape me. ANDREA MITCHELL: But Moore and his supporters remain defiant. ROY MOORE: And I\'ll quit standing when they lay me in that box and put me in the ground. ANDREA MITCHELL: Are Republicans better off without Roy Moore in the Senate? Then, Democratic Senator Al Franken facing his own accusation. LEEANN TWEEDEN: He just mashed his lips against my face and he stuck his tongue in my mouth so fast. ANDREA MITCHELL: And now the country is revisiting previous allegations and denials. My guests this morning, Republican Congresswoman Barbara Comstock and Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. Plus House Republicans pass their tax plan. HOUSE SPEAKER PAUL RYAN: This is about getting hardworking taxpayers bigger paychecks, more take-home pay. ANDREA MITCHELL: Now it\'s the Senate\'s turn. SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): I just think it would be nice just tonight before we go home to just acknowledge, well, this tax cut really is not for the middle class, it\'s for the rich. ANDREA MITCHELL: Is the tax plan really for the middle class? I\'ll ask White House budget director Mick Mulvaney and Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri. Joining me for insight and analysis are Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report, Robert Costa of the Washington Post and PBS\' Washington Week, Joy Reid, host of AM Joy on MSNBC and Rich Lowry, editor of National Review. Welcome to Sunday, it\'s Meet the Press. From NBC News in Washington, the longest running show in television history. This is Meet the Press with Chuck Todd. ANDREA MITCHELL: And good Sunday morning. I\'m Andrea Mitchell. Chuck Todd is off today. When the stories about Harvey Weinstein first broke last month many thought the outrage over sexual misconduct would pass like a summer storm. Now it feels more like climate change with nine women coming forward with accusations against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, Republicans are trying to figure out whether to accept him, disown him or if necessary, expel him. Then just as Democrats were enjoying Republican hand wringing over Moore came the compelling accusation by a radio host and former model against one of their own, Senator Al Franken, of Minnesota. And if that were not enough the national revulsion towards this kind of behavior is forcing Republicans to, again, confront the fact that the president from their own party stands accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct. And it has compelled Democrats to reexamine their unwavering support for Bill Clinton, especially how quickly they once dismissed charges against him as pure right-wing politics. Still this week\'s accusations against Moore and Franken differed in degree and in their response. ROY MOORE: Yes, I have taken a stand in the past. I\'ll take a stand in the future. And I\'ll quit standing when they lay me in that box and put me in the ground. ANDREA MITCHELL: Roy Moore now facing accusations from nine women including molesting a 14-year-old, assaulting a 16-year-old and unwanted sexual advances. TINA JOHNSON: He just would grab my behind. I mean Forcefully grabbed it. BEVERLY NELSON: I was terrified. He was also trying to pull my shirt off. I thought that he was going to rape me. ANDREA MITCHELL: Moore denies all of the claims and defended by his wife says he wills say in the race. KAYLA MOORE: Even after all the attacks against me, against my family, against the foundation and now against my husband he will not step down. ANDREA MITCHELL: A Fox News poll shows Moore now trailing Democrat Doug Jones by eight points amongst likely voters, while Senate Republicans call on Moore to get out. SEN. MITCH McCONNELL (R-KY): I think he should step aside. ANDREA MITCHELL: President Trump is dodging questions. REPORTER Should Roy Moore resign, Mr. President? ANDREA MITCHELL: Leaving responses to the White House staff. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS He said if the allegations are true he should step aside. ANDREA MITCHELL: But Mr. Trump was quick to weigh in on new allegations against Democratic senator Al Franken tweeting, ""The Al Franken signed picture is really bad. Speaks 1,000 words. Where do his hands go in pictures two, three, four, five and six while she sleeps?"" The picture is this one of Franken in 2006 before he was in politics. Radio host Leeann Tweeden says he forcibly kissed her while rehearsing for a skit on tour with the USO. LEEANN TWEEDEN: He stuck his tongue in my mouth so fast. ANDREA MITCHELL: Franken has apologized. LEEANN TWEEDEN: Dear Leeann, I want to apologize to you personally. I don\'t know what was in my head when I took that picture but that doesn\'t matter. There\'s no excuse and I understand why you could feel violated by that photo. ANDREA MITCHELL: Many Democrats now calling for a Senate ethics investigation which Franken agrees to. By condemning Franken the president is also renewing a focus on allegations closer to home. More than a dozen women came forward during the campaign accusing Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct after this Access Hollywood tape surfaced a year ago. PRESIDENT TRUMP: When you\'re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. BILLY BUSH: Whatever you want. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Grab them by the (BEEP). ANDREA MITCHELL: The White House is struggling to make a distinction. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: I think in one case specifically Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the president hasn\'t. ANDREA MITCHELL: Also getting new scrutiny President Bill Clinton who held a campaign reunion of his 1992 victory in Little Rock Saturday night, two days after Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand who the Clinton\'s helped elect said he should\'ve resigned in the 1990s following the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In a radio interview Friday Hillary Clinton firing back. HILLARY CLINTON: This was a painful time not only in our marriage but in our country, as I\'ve written about. But it was investigated fully. It was addressed at the time. He was held accountable. ANDREA MITCHELL: And joining me now are two members of Congress, each of whom has shared stories that they’ve heard or experienced of sexual harassment on Capitol Hill. Republican Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Democrat Debbie Dingell of Michigan. Welcome, both. First to you, both of you, about what you’ve experienced and seen on the Hill. Debbie Dingell, you’ve talked about experiencing sexual harassment over the course of your long career. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: You know, on Friday, I wasn’t planning on going out and doing that “Me Too” moment because I know that there are consequences. And the point that I was trying to make on Friday was that there are women across the country - restaurant workers, tip waitresses, factory floors, law firms, corporations - so I don’t know a woman that doesn’t have a story, Andrea, in all places all across the country. And what are we trying to accomplish from this right now? And that is to look forward and how do we change the culture? And make this not - it’s safer for us to talk about it. But - if you’re from Hollywood or the Media or on Capitol Hill - though I got a lot of ugly comments on Monday or Friday. But also had a waitress that was 21 years old say to me, ""You spoke for me today."" A woman who told me, a 22-year-old woman, that her boss told her to close the door and get up on a table to dance. Let\'s really make this a watershed moment. That men and women across the country work together to look forward to changing the culture. ANDREA MITCHELL: Barbara Comstock, we\'ve been here before. I covered the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings. I was on Meet the Press that Sunday during that horrible weekend. And nothing has changed over these decades. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: I serve on the committee, the House administration committee, that had the hearings this week. And I shared a story that had been relayed to me anonymously. ANDREA MITCHELL: I wanted to ask you about that story. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: It was a friend of mine who told me about a victim who wanted to remain anonymous. But a current member, sitting member of Congress. I don\'t know if it\'s Democrat or Republican. I don\'t know who it is. But asked this staffer to come over, bring some papers to his residence. And then arrived in a towel at the door. Had the staffer come in and then exposed himself. She left. She then quit her job and has now moved on. But my friend relayed this story to me to understand this is going on right now. And I can tell you from the hearing that we had this week, we had a lot of consensus on the changes that need to be made. I got together with Congresswoman Jackie Speier and Congressman Byrne. And we both went through all of the items in Congresswoman Speier\'s bill and additional things that we want to put in the bill. And we\'re on the same page. And we\'re going to get mandatory training, universal, uniform anti-harassment, zero tolerance policies in place. We are not going to allow members to have any kind of fund pay for their harassment. That is universally agreed on. And we\'re also going to have better policies for the victims. So I think this is going to be a change. And I think both Debbie and I want to keep the focus on these women who are experiencing this and use our voices in this moment to change this. And we\'ve had a great response from both the men and the women on a bipartisan basis. And like Debbie said, people are coming up to us-- ANDREA MITCHELL: But one of the things that came out of your hearing, congresswoman, is that $15 million was spent over the last two decades to pay off all kinds of harassment. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: --and that\'s been incorrectly reported. We don\'t know exactly what portion of that is. Because this includes the architect of the capitol, capitol police. It includes allegations against staff. So we\'re trying to find out-- REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: And it\'s not all sexual harassment. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: --and yeah, it\'s age-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Correct. No I was going to make that point. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: --age discrimination and wage and hours, overtime. But we\'re going to clearly say any kind of member harassment cannot come out of any fund. They have to pay that themselves. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: And be transparent. You forgot to mention that. The other thing there\'s total agreement on is that if something is found that they must be transparent. We\'re going to try to find out. One of the problems that-- REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: And corporate America has been doing this for years. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: For years. We were talking about how do we make this a movement that makes it across the country? What infuriates me is these confidentiality agreements so that they go and they do the settlement and nobody can talk about it. We should be talking about it on the Hill. We should be talking about it across the country. Let\'s look at what happened in Uber in Silicon Valley. ANDREA MITCHELL: But let\'s talk about politics here. Roy Moore, nine women have now come forward. Many people say credibly reporting actions, to someone who was as young as 14, a molestation. Forced sexual attention on a 16 year old. Congresswoman, do you find these women credible? REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: Yes, I do. And last week I think I was the first woman in the House to come out and say, ""You should step aside."" I\'ve been consistent on all these matters we\'ve talked about because-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, how do you view the fact that the president refuses to even comment on it? REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: Well, I appreciate that the president actually was working with the White House and they\'ve cut off funding to him. The National Senatorial Committee is not funding it. So you\'ve seen people across the board, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee withdraw their support, say he should step aside. I still hope he will do that and do the right thing. ANDREA MITCHELL: Roy Moore was tweeting saying-- REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: For that matter, Al Franken can go hit the door with him. ANDREA MITCHELL: In fact, Roy Moore was tweeting, “Al Franken admits guilt after photographic evidence of his abuse surfaces. Mitch: ‘Let’s investigate.’” Mitch McConnell. “In Alabama,” according to his tweet, “ ZERO evidence, allegations 100% rejected. Mitch: ‘Moore must quit immediately or be expelled.’” Is there a double standard here? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: No, I don’t think that there’s a double standard. I think we’ve got to be very careful. I am going to say this: that everybody is entitled to be innocent until proven guilty. But when people come forward, there’s a large group of people, Al Franken’s going to the ethics committee, let’s see where that goes. Are there more stories? We can’t defend any of this. These gotcha questions. There is despicable, ugly behavior across the country. And men and women together - you know, here we are, a women’s panel - this isn’t going to get fixed. Men have wives, sisters, daughters, friends, families, we’ve got to fix this together and change the culture. And - by the way - it’s been going on for too long. It’s not just these men. There are a 1,000 names out there - many of them are dead now - let’s fix the problem. ANDREA MITCHELL: Is Democrat-- REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: And let\'s get the focus back on the women too. The women-- ANDREA MITCHELL: --is Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand wrong when she says that Bill Clinton should have resigned back during the Lewinsky scandal. Debbie Dingell? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: I have 1,000 thoughts on all this. And, by the way, the names we\'re talking about now, you and I both know these stories go back forever. I want to go forward because I don\'t want to make sensational news. ""Do you beat your wife?"" I think it\'s despicable. I was a Tsongas delegate. But I think that we\'ve got to focus on what the future is. Doing got you questions to people like us isn\'t going to solve the problem. And we\'ve got to start moving forward. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: Well, and I think one of the things that we\'ve talked about too is having these workplace surveys really understanding the problem. The politics is going to sort itself out. But for the women in our workplace, but also women workplaces across the country we need to make sure they are really understanding what the problem is, who are victims and we know predators target people who are weak and can\'t come forward. So we need to use this moment where those of us who are in a position to do it can come forward and get - say there\'s going to be zero tolerance. We want it enforced in Congress, same rules as everybody else. And we want the corporate world and-- REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: Across the country. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: --Hollywood, one of the things we\'re doing is saying Harvey Weinstein was running all these settlements and payments perhaps through his business. You cannot take a taxpayer deduction for that. That is going to end. ANDREA MITCHELL: We\'re going to have to leave it there. We\'ll see whether this is a change, a real change. Or whether it\'s just more of the same. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK: We are committed to getting the legislation-- REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: We all, all of us, have to bring about real change in this country. ANDREA MITCHELL: Debbie Dingell, Barbara Comstock. Congresswomen, thank you both very much. REP. DEBBIE DINGELL: Thank you. ANDREA MITCHELL: And as we mentioned, Roy Moore is digging in, refusing calls from follow Republicans that he back down and get out of the race. Moore campaign strategist, Dean Young, spoke out this week on why his candidate is keeping his campaign going. DEAN YOUNG: What\'s happening is we\'re watching a coup attempt by the people of Washington D.C., the elitist, Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham and all that type. They\'re trying to stop an election of the people of Alabama before it even happens because they have already been beaten badly after they spent $31 million trying to beat Judge Moore. ANDREA MITCHELL: And joining me now is the Republican Senator from Missouri Roy Blunt. Senator, great to see you. ROY BLUNT: Good to be with you. ANDREA MITCHELL: Thank you very much. So, Roy Moore is accusing Mitch McConnell and the rest of the Senate establishment Republicans of trying to drive him out of office. Is he correct? ROY BLUNT: Well, I don’t know if he’s correct or not, but we’re at a point now where really Alabama voters are going to make that decision and in the Senate, no matter who gets elected from Alabama or what happens with anybody else, we need to be sure that we’ve got an environment where people want to come and be part of that, where women are comfortable being part of that. My chief of staff’s a woman, my legislative director’s a woman, my press person is a woman. Wouldn’t want to have an environment where you couldn’t have the best people come, so we put together a working group, Senator Klobuchar and Senator Cortez-Masto and Senator Capito and I, Senator Shelby joined us, we proposed changing our rules so there’s mandatory um orientation toward these things. It shouldn’t happen, uh so people know what is perceived to be inappropriate and also to change the law, going back to the 1980s where it may have seemed reasonable at the time, but in the current law if uh you report harassment you’re the one that has to go into 20 hours of counseling-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Right ROY BLUNT: -- before you can decide whether you were really harassed or not. That’s just totally inappropriate. ANDREA MITCHELL: Now politically, are Republicans better off if Roy Moore wins or if he loses? If he loses the seat or whether he wins and Democrats think they have an issue going forward? ROY BLUNT: Well, you know I said that I thought the women\'s story was more credible than his response, that Alabama voters deserved a better choice. But they\'re going to have to make that decision. They know Roy Moore a whole lot better than I do. I\'ve met him once. They\'ve watched him at a pretty controversial career for 20 years. And we\'ll just have to see what they do. ANDREA MITCHELL: You say that the women\'s stories were credible. What about the women, more than a dozen, who came out during the 2016 campaign against President Trump? Were they credible? ROY BLUNT: Well, whatever whatever they had to say people heard that. And they elected President Trump the president of the United States. So at some point I think you have to let the voters have a say here. ANDREA MITCHELL: Now with Al Franken Republicans are seizing on that. The president has been silent on Roy Moore since he came back from his trip in Asia. Yet he seized on Al Franken\'s misconduct, acknowledged misconduct. Franken immediately apologized and welcomes an ethics investigation. Not to excuse what he did but the fact that the president is so quick to jump on Al Franken but is so silent on Roy Moore, of his own party. ROY BLUNT: Well, you know I think somebody I think Congresswoman Dingell just said you\'re innocent until proven guilty unless you say you did it. And Al Franken of course has said, ""I did this."" He said, ""I\'m sorry,"" for it. But he\'s also said he did it. And uh I think the president understands you can be accused of lots of things in politics. And we\'ll see what voters decide. ANDREA MITCHELL: I want to briefly ask you about your own colleague in Missouri, Claire McCaskill, has talked about the fact that she was a victim of sexual harassment when she was an intern. Your own women colleagues have experienced this as well. ROY BLUNT: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). Well, absolutely. And it\'s totally unacceptable. And back to what I said to start with, in the Congress of the United States you want to have an environment where people are comfortable, wanting to work there, saying they work there, putting on their resume in future years they worked there without feeling like there was an environment that wasn\'t open and appropriate in both seeking opinions and uh seeking the kind of advice that the country and the Congress needs. ANDREA MITCHELL: Now after event on tax reform which is the big issue facing the Senate now your colleague in Arizona, Jeff Flake, was caught on an open mic saying this. JEFF FLAKE: Come the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump. We are (UNINTEL) toast. ANDREA MITCHELL: What about the political fallout from all of this and from the impression that this tax bill is opposed by 59% of Americans right now according to the Quinnipiac Poll. ROY BLUNT: Well, you know I think your comment there after a um event on tax reform. So all these things do is they take attention if we don\'t handle the environment correctly, if we don\'t have the rules correctly because tax reform clearly is going to affect the country, it\'s going to affect our economic future. Looking at the way that um the tax bill has been reported I could understand people\'s concern about it. But when you look at the real tax bill, both House and Senate, I think it\'s designed to do two things. One is to create immediately more take-home pay for hard working families. And the second thing is at the other end of the scale do whatever we can to be sure that there are better jobs in the future for those very same families. We\'ve had eight years of economic stagnation for hard-working families. And this tax bill I think creates the opportunity to move dramatically beyond that. ANDREA MITCHELL: There\'s plenty of evidence from Republicans as well as Democrats that, first of all, the corporate taxes are permanent. The individual taxes expire in about a decade. And it blows a hole in the deficit of at least $1.5 trillion. But by many non-partisan estimates as much as $2.2 trillion if you take away the gimmicks to just get it under that budget ceiling for now. ROY BLUNT: Well, it doesn\'t take much in economic growth to uh offset both of those numbers. If we get back to the 70-year average of 3.2% growth instead of the Obama year average of less than 2, we\'re up to three already. We\'re anticipating in this bill 2.6. And every every tenth a percent of growth there makes a huge difference in federal revenue. If you believe tax policy has economic consequences you don\'t statically score that. You score that based on what those consequences will be. And I\'ve talked to lots of economists about this who are usually pretty gloomy who have been very optimistic that this bill does what we hope it would do in terms of making us more competitive all over the world. ANDREA MITCHELL: At a recent Wall Street Journal interview with Gary Cohn, of course the top economic advisor in the White House, they polled the audience, the CEOs in that group, ""Who among you would actually reinvest this tax cut into your company and raise wages?"" And only five people in this large group raised their hands. That has not been the history. Corporations don\'t reinvest this kind of money. And when have any of these projections actually proved to? ROY BLUNT: Oh, well, I think they do reinvest. And I think one of the things you do in this tax bill is you create an opportunity to bring maybe as much as $2 trillion back into our economy that\'s currently overseas because of our tax policy. You want to talk about a stimulus, we\'ve never actually even imagined a stimulus that would be $2 trillion of other money coming back to the country. I\'ve asked CEOs who have that money over there how much of it they\'d bring back. Generally the answer is all of it that we haven\'t invested there. And that\'s most of it. ANDREA MITCHELL: Is it going to pass the Senate? ROY BLUNT: I think we\'ll pass the Senate. ANDREA MITCHELL: Thank you so much. ROY BLUNT: Thank you. ANDREA MITCHELL: And then of course has to be reconciled with the House which is another whole issue. ROY BLUNT: I think these bills are very reconcilable. On the big issues there\'s some things in-- ANDREA MITCHELL: With or without the repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate? ROY BLUNT: It depends on where the votes are. I think the poor people pay that tax. 80% of the people that pay that tax have total family income of less than $50,000. It\'s one of the many fallacies of Obamacare, taxing the people that you theoretically are telling-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Of course without the mandate though you could 13 million people could be-- ROY BLUNT: Well, but the mandate-- (OVERTALK) ROY BLUNT: --all of the incentives and all of the copayments, everything else are still in there. There\'s nothing that changes in terms of people\'s ability to take full advantage of the parts of the ACA that encourage people to have insurance. It just decides you\'re not going to tax people for something that they think they can\'t afford to do. ANDREA MITCHELL: Senator, we have to leave it there. Thank you very much. Good to have you here. ROY BLUNT: Good to be with you. ANDREA MITCHELL: And a quick programming note, Monday on The Today Show Savannah Guthrie will sit down with Leigh Corfman in her first television interview since she accused Roy Moore of sexual harassment when she was only 14 years old. And when we come back much more on Roy Moore, Al Franken and our changing definition of what is unacceptable behavior. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL NOT TRANSCRIBED) ANDREA MITCHELL: And welcome back. The panel is all here. Robert Costa of The Washington Post and host of PBS\' Washington Week, Joy Reid, host of AM Joy on MSNBC, Amy Walter, national political editor of the Cook Political Report and Rich Lowry, editor of National Review. Welcome, all.First of all, I want to ask you, let\'s talk about Roy Moore. Andrew Sullivan wrote that, ""There is a moment here that no party is immune from evil. No tribe has a monopoly of good. If these bipartisan sex abuse revelations can begin to undermine the tribalism that so poisons our public life to reveal that beneath the tribes we are all flawed and human they may not only be long overdue turning point for women, they may be watershed for all of us."" Amy Walter, what do you think? We\'ve been-- (OVERTALK) ANDREA MITCHELL: --here before. AMY WALTER: We do--We have been here before. I thought it was important that you raised the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas moment where it felt like the world had changed, sort of spun on its axis. We elected more women to Congress in 1992, a year after those uh hearings. And yet it\'s now 2017. It feels like we haven\'t gone very far. I feel like where we are right now though is that the dam has broken. And yet we don\'t know what to do with all the water. Right? So we say yes it\'s there. But now what do we do with the situation that we\'re in? And I don\'t think it\'s going to be solved in one election cycle with one candidate. And I don\'t think it\'s going to be solved for the whole host of other women who aren\'t in, as Congresswoman Dingell said, powerful positions or feel like they still are without a voice. They still feel scared and vulnerable. ANDREA MITCHELL: Rich Lowry, Peggy Noonan wrote this weekend that, ""The women of Alabama are now uh being challenged."" He said, ""Roy Moore targeted the deplorables."" That was an intentional word. ""They were people with no sway, no pull. Some of them in the presidential election voted for Donald Trump. There are better conservatives in Alabama than Roy Moore. Republican women rise up and raise hell. That would be real loyally-loyalty and to those who really are your own."" What is the impact-- RICH LOWRY: Well-- ANDREA MITCHELL: --on Republicans in Alabama? RICH LOWRY: --I really think it should have been incumbent on the Republican Party to give their voters a better choice. And that would have meant fundamentally President Trump weighing in very heavily against Roy Moore and pressuring state party officials saying, ""Look, you don\'t have a future in this party unless you find some way to leverage this guy out of this race. It didn\'t happen. Now Roy Moore is running the only race he can which is saying, ""Look, all these attacks on me are attacks on you, my supporters,"" and envying against Mitch McConnell. And it really goes to the cynical demagoguery of the likes of Steve Bannon who if Roy Moore killed someone with an ax Steve Bannon would say, ""It\'s Mitch McConnell\'s fault."" ROBERT COSTA: But but -- There\'s a real challenge-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Jump in here. ROBERT COSTA: --here for Republicans because in Washington the Republicans I\'m talking to in the Senate, they feel totally boxed in. President Trump\'s not weighing in. He\'s not trying to get Moore out of the race. And they know if Roy Moore wins, the Senate--the Senate, if you\'re running next year, he becomes a huge burden.And if he somehow loses, the 52-seat majority becomes a 51/49 just as they\'re trying to pass tax reform. That\'s a very difficult situation when you have Governor Kay Ivey, a Republican woman down there, saying she\'s going to vote for Roy Moore. Mitch McConnell, the majority leader has sway. But not enough sway to change this race. ANDREA MITCHELL: He\'s viewed as part of the Washington establishment. JOY REID: But the fact that this is even a calculation, right, we\'re talking about something of such a different degree. You know you talks about all the past scandals. You talk about the Monica Lewinsky itch which was a clearly improper relationship. But we\'re talking about children. We\'re talking about multiple allegations of the abuse of children. And the fact that it\'s even a question I think speaks to the position that the Republican Party finds it\'s in morally. This should not be a question. And the fact that people are struggling with whether or not they should continue to support Roy Moore for reasons of party, politics, power and tribe is incredibly disturbing. ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, is is the president\'s silence on this, Robert Costa, according to your reporting, because of his own past? And why did he jump on Al Franken then so quickly? Because that made it inevitable that people would be talking about his own record. ROBERT COSTA: Talking to people inside of the White House and around President Trump I said, ""Why did he jump in on Franken?"" And they say, ""He could not resist. That he had to take a shot at Franken."" But he\'s reluctant because of what happened last year with Access Hollywood. He knows he was able to escape that controversy and win the presidency. But he doesn\'t want to wade into his own experiences in the past. And so he\'s trying to have the best of both worlds, they tell me. ANDREA MITCHELL: How-- RICH LOWRY: Can I say just partisan tribalism obviously affects both sides. And now all of a sudden we have a lot of liberals and Democrats are getting virtue on Bill Clinton saying things they could have said not just 20 years ago but could have said last year. And they\'re only saying it now because the Clintons are yesterday and the past of the Democratic Party. JOY REID: But they\'re yesterday. But the Republicans perennially drag them back out of the political crypt-- out of the political crypt every time they need an excuse for-- ANDREA MITCHELL: But it was Kirsten-- JOY REID: --what they\'re doing. ANDREA MITCHELL: --Gillibrand who dragged this out. JOY REID: Democrats always default to sort of self-immolation. It\'s what they do. Democrats torture themselves because it\'s part of being a Democrat. But I think uh uh the question of Franken and Trump I think is important because these two things took place one year apart.One year before that USO uh event at which Al Franken admits now and at least has attempted to repent of what he did in 2006, one year before that Donald Trump was saying, ""Because I am a celebrity,"" which Franken was, ""I can forcibly kiss women and I can forcibly grope them."" The identical behavior that he was on Twitter attacking Franken for, again, admitting and apologizing and repenting for, he was boasting one year earlier that he could do that because he was a star. ANDREA MITCHELL: We\'re going to have to leave it there for now. We\'ll have a lot more time in a moment. But when we come back I\'ll talk to White House budget director Mick Mulvaney about the Republican tax plan and what did the Democrats say about the Senate\'s tax bill to make Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah respond like this. ORRIN HATCH: What you said was not right. That\'s all I\'m saying. I come from the lower middle class originally. We didn\'t have anything. So don\'t skew that stuff on me. I get a little tired of that crap. (COMMERCIAL NOT TRANSCRIBED) ANDREA MITCHELL: Welcome back. House Republicans passed their version of a tax plan this week. And now the Senate is debating its bill. Democrats oppose the Republican approach because they say it gives big tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy while the effect on the middle class is unclear. Republicans argue that the top down cuts will spur economic growth that will create more jobs and higher wages for the middle class. That debate was at the heart of a heated moment at a Senate finance committee session Thursday between Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican Chair Orrin Hatch. SHERROD BROWN: I just think it would be nice just tonight before we go home to just acknowledge, well, this tax cut really is not for the middle class. It\'s for the rich. ORRIN HATCH: But I’m gonna just say to you that I come from the poor people. And I\'ve been here working my whole stinking career for people who don\'t have a chance. And I really resent anybody saying that I\'m just doing this for the rich. Give me a break. ANDREA MITCHELL: Joining me now is the director of the Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney. Director Mulvaney, welcome to Meet the Press. So who is going to get the break, the middle class tax cuts, the individual tax cuts, they expire in a decade. The corporate tax cuts are permanent. MICK MULVANEY: Yeah, a couple different ways to answer that question. Keep in mind, one of the reasons, Andrea, that a lot of this different pieces and parts expire during the course of the ten years is simply to force this bill into these strange rules in the Senate. We\'re using what\'s called the Byrd rule in the Senate. ANDREA MITCHELL: Right. MICK MULVANEY: We\'re using reconciliation so that we only need 50 votes in the Senate instead of 60. In order to do that the certain proposals can only have certain economic impact. And one of the ways to game the system is to make things expire. The Bush tax cuts back in early 2000 did the same thing. They supposedly would expire after nine years. What we tell folks is this is if it\'s good policy it will become permanent. If it\'s bad policy it will become temporary. That\'s just the way that it is. So this is done more to force, to shoehorn the bill into the rules than because we think it\'s good policy. ANDREA MITCHELL: Isn\'t that an admission though that it\'s a gimmick. You\'re saying it\'s a $1.5 trillion tax cut. The impact on the deficit. But in fact, it\'s, according to most analyses, $2.2 trillion. MICK MULVANEY: Well, not most analyses. ANDREA MITCHELL: Number one, because you\'re-- MICK MULVANEY: According to one analysis I think I\'ve-- (OVERTALK) ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, a non-partisan analysis. And the fact is that you\'re squeezing it into these rules. But you really do intend for it to be extended down the road which will explode the deficit even farther-- MICK MULVANEY: Well, come back to your-- ANDREA MITCHELL: --in future generations. MICK MULVANEY: --first point about the $1.5 trillion. That\'s the CBO score, the non-partisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office score. But everybody knows it\'s 100 percent static. It doesn\'t, it doesn’t consider the possible impacts on the economy of lowering taxes. It\'s sort of like saying if you sold this coffee mug last year, you sold a 100 of them for five dollars, this year you lowered them to four dollars, do you think you might sell more? That\'s dynamic scoring which is what the CBO scoring and what so many other outside groups that scored this have used. So we\'re absolutely confident that this will lead to economic growth. It\'s built into our models of the Office of Management and Budget. The Council of Economic Advisors looks as it as well. But, yeah, to the extent it\'s a gimmick, a lot of this is a gimmick. Obamacare was a gimmick to get through these rules in the Senate. And what you should really be looking at is the policies themselves. And we think these are excellent policies. ANDREA MITCHELL: Well take a look at what economists from both political parties have said in the past. We\'ve got economists such as Douglas Holtz-Eakin. He said, ""There\'s just no evidence that the tax cuts actually pay for themselves."" Jared Bernstein, a Democratic economist working for Joe Biden said, ""Cutting taxes loses revenues."" Greg Mankiw, president of Council of Economic Advisors for Bush, 43, said, ""About 1/3 of the cost of the tax cuts is recouped via faster economic growth."" Never in history have we had the kind of growth from tax cuts that pay for themselves. MICK MULVANEY: We have a tremendous opportunity here and I think one thing that gets overlooked is that the country\'s sort of operating at the new normal. In fact, it was until President Trump got elected. So for the last eight years we\'re averaging below 2% growth. You go back to that Congressional Budget Office and that\'s what they think the new normal is. That forever and ever and ever the country will only grow at 1.8 or 2% growth. Since President Trump got elected we\'re growing at 3% and we think we can sustain that. ANDREA MITCHELL: 3% only for the first quarter. That\'s not annualized. That\'s not a 3% annual growth rate. MICK MULVANEY: Actually it was three percent in the second quarter, it\'s three percent in the third quarter. We\'re looking now probably having three percent in the fourth quarter. That\'s even with the hurricanes in the middle. So we do think we\'re actually there. Now granted, we have to have additional policy changes to make that sustainable and tax reform is part of that. But the amount of money that generates not only for you, me and the ordinary American, the amount of money that generates for the government over the ten years is $2.5 trillion. ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, President Trump said that he would get nothing from this tax cut. Let\'s watch. (BEGIN TAPE) QUESTION #1: So you wouldn\'t benefit under your tax plan? DONALD TRUMP: No I don\'t benefit. I don\'t benefit. QUESTION #2: You don\'t think-- (OVERTALK) DONALD TRUMP: In fact-- Question #2: --benefit? DONALD TRUMP: In fact, very, very strongly as you see, there’s no -- I think there\'s very little benefit for people of wealth. (END TAPE) ANDREA MITCHELL: Now we only have one year of tax returns because he has failed, refused, he\'s the first president in modern history to not release his tax returns. We have the 2005 1040 from President Trump. Our independent NBC news analysis of that showed that he would, himself, he and Melania Trump would gain at least $22 million from this tax cut from the estate tax as well. His heirs would benefit $1.1 billion. So it\'s not true that the president would not benefit from the tax cut. MICK MULVANEY: Yeah, I can\'t speak to the president’s taxes. I think that was sort of litigated by the American public during the election. I will say this, listen, the president\'s going to pay much higher taxes on a lot of his properties, excuse me, because of because he has properties in high tax states. So I laugh every time I come on networks like this, they accuse us of cutting taxes on the rich. Every time I go on different networks, and you may understand who those are, they accuse us of raising taxes on the rich. So I think it looks -- depends on how you want to look at it. ANDREA MITCHELL: We\'re not taking a political point of view here. We are actually going by nonpartisan groups like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, all the impact on the exploding deficit which will impact future generations. I do want to ask you though because the president has refused to talk about Roy Moore since he\'s back from his trip. And the White House is saying that, well, he said on the Air Force One he would talk about Roy Moore in Alabama. You were a member of Congress. This debate over sexual harassment now has spread to politics as well as to every industry starting with Harvey Weinstein. Let\'s talk about Roy Moore and whether or not he should be the Republican nominee and whether he should be seated if he\'s elected. MICK MULVANEY: I do think the president has talked about Roy Moore. I think he said that he thinks the voters of Alabama should decide. I think that\'s probably the most common sense way to look at it. He doesn\'t know who to believe. I think a lot of folks don\'t. I think the way-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, nine women have come out. Many of them since the president came back from Asia. He\'s said not a word. He\'s ducked every question. MICK MULVANEY: And the allegations are very serious. And they should be taken very seriously. But ultimately these are up to the voters in the state. You and I are here in Washington D.C. To think we know what\'s going on on parts of the country, we\'re just-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, if the president has been silent, which he has been on Roy Moore, then why did he jump all over Al Franken? The minute that an acknowledged episode of this behavior before Al Franken came into politics. That, in fact, was something that the president tweeted about immediately. MICK MULVANEY: Well, I think one of the significant differences there, Andrea, is that Franken admits it and Roy Moore denies it. So I do think that puts them in two different categories. ANDREA MITCHELL: Do you believe that the women who\'ve come out against Roy Moore are credible? MICK MULVANEY: I believe they\'re credible. I don\'t know who to believe. Again, I\'m at the Office of Management and Budget-- ANDREA MITCHELL: You don\'t believe them? MICK MULVANEY: No, I said they\'re credible. I don\'t know who to believe. And I do think, as the president said, that -- ANDREA MITCHELL: Well, if they\'re credible-- MICK MULVANEY: --voters should decide. ANDREA MITCHELL: --why wouldn\'t you believe them? MICK MULVANEY: Andrea, I run the office of management and budget in Washington, D.C. You work for NBC News in Washington, D.C. My guess is we\'ve not spent that much time looking at the specifics of these allegations. You\'ve arrived at a certain conclusion because of a certain political persuasion. We\'re simply-- ANDREA MITCHELL: Not because of a political persuasion at all. I’m -- I am simply asking whether you believe that they are credible. They have been out in public. They have spoken on the record. Some were brought, some stories were brought out by Alabama journalists in the local newspapers down there, not just by The Washington Post. And I have no political axe to grind here other than to ask you whether you believe they are credible. MICK MULVANEY: I believe that the folks who vote in the Alabama election are gonna ultimately decide that. And that\'s the right folks to make those decisions. ANDREA MITCHELL: And when you were in Congress do you think that there was sexual abuse going on? Were you aware of it? MICK MULVANEY: I never saw anything like it. I really didn\'t. And maybe it was just the group of men and women that I hung out with. But I never saw anything like that. I believe folks who are saying now that, you know, they think it\'s been there, they\'ve seen evidence of it, I think actually there was some hard evidence of it that was referenced on an anonymous basis. So I have no reason to disbelieve those allegations. But I never saw it personally. ANDREA MITCHELL: Director Mulvaney, thank you very much for being with us today. And when we come back, why Roy Moore could be more vulnerable in Alabama than you might think. Stay with us. ANDREA MITCHELL: And welcome back, it\'s data download time. Could Roy Moore win the Senate seat in Alabama despite allegations of sexual misconduct against him? It\'s true, Alabama is a deep red state. Donald Trump won there last year 62% to Clinton\'s 34%. But while many view Alabama as populous Republican country, ripe for a Moore victory, the state may be home to more skeptical Republican establishment voters than you think. In the 2012 general election with Mitt Romney running for president Roy Moore was also on the ballot for Supreme Court chief justice there. Those two Republican candidates compare across the state. How did they? Well, Romney, the textbook definition of an establishment Republican won 61% of the vote for president in Alabama, while Roy Moore won 52% of the vote for chief justice. Romney even won nine more counties than Moore did. Fifty-two counties for Romney versus 43 counties for Moore. Plus, Romney even did better in Moore\'s home county of Etowah. 68% for Romney compared to 55% for Moore. And of course this all happened long before those allegations of sexual misconduct about Moore came out publicly. Sure, there are big differences between running for Alabama Supreme Court and for the U.S. Senate. But these 2012 numbers show that Moore has been a divisive figure even among Alabama Republicans for a long time. If that divide reemerges next month this could be how deep red Alabama elects a Democrat to the Senate on December 12th. And when we come back end game and what some Trump voters now say they think about the president. (COMMERCIAL NOT TRANSCRIBED) ANDREA MITCHELL: Back now with end game. Okay, taxes, a lot of confidence among the Republicans that they\'re going to win this in the Senate. Amy Walter this does- you have to believe in trickledown economics, that all of a sudden all these tax cuts are going to boost the economy and really help the middle class after all. AMY WALTER: Yeah. Well, and I think for a lot of Republicans, especially a lot of Republican voters what they think they have in a President Trump is somebody who\'s a business person. I hear that over and over again from voters, even voters who aren\'t completely complimentary of this president. Saying, ""Yeah, but at least he knows about business. That\'s why I trust him on the economy."" The challenge is that they don\'t trust Republicans right now. The approval ratings of Republicans in Congress, quite low. And the approval ratings of the tax bill itself at best, at best, is mixed and ambivalent. And Republicans are spending more time right now worrying about getting the votes in the Senate than they are convincing voters that this is the right thing for the country. That\'s going to be a bigger challenge. Forget about what the vote is. If they succeed, are they going to be able to and are they willing to spend 2018 making a positive case or will that vacuum get filled by Democrats and others that are attacking it? ANDREA MITCHELL: And at the same time we\'ve got this sexual harassment on both sides, not equivalent. But Roy Moore front and center. Robert Costa? ROBERT COSTA: Roy Moore is front and center. And Republicans are worried he could lose that race or win that race it\'s a problem for them. On taxes I don\'t buy the confidence yet based on my reporting. You\'ve got Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. ANDREA MITCHELL: They think they\'ve got him. They think they have a fix for him on small-- ROBERT COSTA: They think-- ANDREA MITCHELL: --businesses. ROBERT COSTA: --they have a fix. But, look, you talk about trickledown economics. That still remains the core of the Republican Party, that Reagan orthodoxy. But this is a change party. You look at the discussions in the Senate, they\'re concerned about how this bill adds to the deficit. They\'re concerned about being seen as too pro-Wall Street, heading into 2018. McConnell still has some work to do. JOY REID: And not only that. But it has also become a proxy health care fight again because you, again, have Republicans talking about cutting Medicare, cutting Medicaid. This would trigger sequestration. You have Republicans even in the administration admitting that they consider social security disability benefits to be welfare. And saying, ""Well, we\'re going to reform that and cut that as well."" So, you know, Democrats will go back to the playbook of reminding Americans, ""This is a rehash of trying to repeal Obamacare which, as we know, was incredibly unpopular, including with some very important--"" RICH LOWRY: But given-- JOY REID: --""Republicans."" RICH LOWRY: --how the House majority the last several years has almost been ungovernable, it\'s a stupendous achievement that they passed this so quickly and so relatively easily in the House. And it is a good bill. If you put a gun to head to Democratic economists they would admit reforming the corporate tax code is good for the economy. And on the individual side it\'s not so much a typical Republican tax cut. There aren\'t big cuts at the top rate. And the Senate change this week I think was very important, big increase in the child tax credit. That is a huge benefit to middle class families. ANDREA MITCHELL: A lot of this is going to depend on how people think about the president himself. So I want to share with all of you something that NBC News observed a 12-person focus group this week in Wilmington, North Carolina led by Peter Hart, the Democratic partner in our NBC News Wall Street Journal poll organized for Emory University. And this group consisted of seven Clinton voters and five Trump voters. Peter asked the voters just how they feel about the president one year after his election. Watch. JAMES, CLINTON VOTER: He comes out and calls your names and these types of things. I mean, what are we in the third grade again? Come on. MELISSA, TRUMP VOTER: To me it\'s like firing out these tweets, it\'s just childish a lot of times. ANNE, TRUMP VOTER: When he\'s away, he\'s great being a president. He\'s the showman. But at home he\'s kind of like two-- I can\'t imagine how they let him build a country club let alone be in one because we don\'t behave that way. ANDREA MITCHELL: It\'s very clear from these conversations that many of these people say they would still support him, Amy, but support him for reelection. But they are not happy about Twitter. AMY WALTER: They are not happy about Twitter. And he\'s not up for reelection in 2018. JOY REID: Good point. AMY WALTER: His Republican colleagues are. And they don\'t want to have to be able to defend this. A lot of these people may show up for Donald Trump. Are they going to show up in a 2018 mid-term election if they\'re feeling frustrated about the fact that things aren\'t happening on the legislative front. ANDREA MITCHELL: And how are we still talking about the Clintons? After Kirsten Gillibrand came out with the New York Times and said that at this stage she looking back would not have supported Bill Clinton staying in office after impeachment and Lewinsky. Philippe Reines who is, of course, the long-time advisor to Hillary Clinton sent a warning shot across saying on Twitter, ""Ken Starr spent $70 million on a consensual blank for Sunday morning television. Senate voted to keep POTUS WJC but not enough for you, Senator Gillibrand, over 20 years you took the Clinton\'s endorsements, money and seat. Hypocrite. Interesting strategy for 2020 primaries. Best of luck."" RICH LOWRY: Well, she is a cutting edge on this I think, Gillibrand. Because what Republicans learned in 2016, you no longer had to defend George W. Bush. You could actually attack him, as Trump proved. And I think you\'ll see the same thing playing out in Democrats in 2020. You can disagree with the Clinton sand you can even throw Bill Clinton under the bus for his appalling personal conduct. ANDREA MITCHELL: But does the president having jumped all over Al Franken bring up his own past to the point where people are going to re-ask themselves, ""How about the credibility of those women? More than a dozen women accusing him?"" ROBERT COSTA: It\'s going to haunt Republicans in the coming year because you have Leader McConnell and other senators saying, including Mulvaney in your interview, they say the women are credible in the Roy Moore situation. Does that mean the women are not credible when it comes to President Trump? These are questions Republicans are going to have to answer. JOY REID: And let\'s not forget that Donald Trump faces a lawsuit from one of the women who he called a liar. So this is going to be adjudicated in part, his credibility versus hers. And look, the bottom line is Republicans have now decided to migrate to the position that we believe women, that we are going to believe women when they make accusations. Well, Donald Trump has more than a dozen women. Well over a dozen women who have accused him of behavior that he also bragged about in that Access Hollywood tape. They cannot escape the allegations against the president of the United States. And we should discuss it. And, the world, we talked about Clarence Thomas earlier. He\'s still sitting right there on the Supreme Court. ANDREA MITCHELL: We are going to have to leave it there. Thanks to all of you. And thanks for a great conversation today, Amy, Rich, Bob and Joy. And that\'s all for today. Thank you for watching. Everyone have a great, healthy, safe Thanksgiving. Chuck Todd will be back next week because if it\'s Sunday it\'s Meet the Press. ANNOUNCER: You can see more end game and postgame sponsored by Boeing on the Meet the Press Facebook page. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * * © 2018 NBC UNIVERSAL']",0.0,102.0,8.5,0.0,1023578.0,1
Amy,Walter,"['http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2017/11/how_democrats_can_turn_a_wave_into_2018_victory.html', 'https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/the-politics-of-sexual-harassment-revelations']",b'719',"[""Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters In a new piece for the Cook Political Report called “A Wave Is a Comin’,” Amy Walter—the nonpartisan political newsletter’s national editor—writes that political junkies might be making a version of the same mistake many of us made in 2016. Last year, we doubted Donald Trump had any chance to win the presidency; this time, we might be underestimating the odds of a giant Democratic “wave” that causes Republicans to lose the House. Isaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer. To discuss 2018, I spoke by phone with Walter recently. During the course of our conversation, which has been edited and condensed for clarity, we talked about the importance of competing all over the map, why the Senate—regardless of the political environment—will be so hard for Democrats to flip, and the unknown ways in which sexual misconduct might shake up Washington. Isaac Chotiner: What about the data you are looking at makes you think people are underestimating the possibility of a huge wave? Amy Walter: I think the first place to start is to define what a wave is, especially in a midterm election year. What a wave means is that you have to take your traditional thinking about campaigns and about what normally happens in a traditional election, and you have to caveat those. So, for example, in a midterm year, if the playing field is relatively even, Republicans usually have an advantage on turnout, simply because their voters are older, and less likely to be people of color. Those are the people that come out and vote. In a wave year, that advantage no longer becomes as important because you are going to get more people voting Democratic, younger people voting Democratic, etc. So are you saying more Democrats will come out and vote, or rather that you see signs typical Republican voters might flip? If we look at Virginia, turning out and voting. They are turning out and voting for Democrats in places Democrats have won previously. And that is the argument that Republicans make, which is a fair one: If you look at Virginia, Republicans lost a lot of legislative districts, but they were in places Hillary Clinton had carried, and people had already been accustomed to voting for Democrats. That’s a lot different than winning people over in areas Trump carried. Still, a Democratic candidate did win in a district Trump carried in 2016, and which Republicans won at the congressional level. What that said to me was that Democrats are really engaged, and in those districts Trump carried, overall, Democrats weren’t putting up quite the fight they were in the Clinton districts. We don’t know if more competitive Democrats would have been able to pick up those seats. It seems like the upshot of all this is that in a wave-type atmosphere, you should try to compete in as many places as you can. Correct. That’s why they call it a wave. If you put your surfboard out in the water, not because you are the best surfer, not because you have picked just the right line, but just by being in the right place at the right time, you can get carried to shore. Another thing that defines it is that an incumbent who for years has been able to hold onto a district because they have their own personal brand—“people know me, people are comfortable voting for me,” they think they have something of a defense. You have built some sort of bulwark up against the tide. If the wave is big enough, it still knocks out those defenses. We don’t know yet, and the challenge for Democrats is seeing how big a wave they need. Just because they get a wave doesn’t mean they get a majority. What is your estimate on what the national House vote would have to be to flip it? When my colleague David Wasserman looked at the numbers, especially since 2010, and the redistricting of 2010, Democrats win fewer seats than their overall total vote by about 4 percent. So if you got 49 percent of the vote, they would only get 45 percent of the seats. So to get a bare minimum you need to hit 54 percent of the vote nationally. To feel comfortable, it would be double digits. Which is where some of the national polls have been though, right? Right. How drastically does a Roy Moore loss help the odds of Democrats winning the Senate? I don’t know is my short answer, but it does put a lot of focus on the other open seat that Republicans hold, Tennessee, and especially what kind of Democrat and what kind of Republican come out of there. Because what it suggests to me is that even in these red states, the wrong candidate on the Republican side could lose. But this is likely really wrong. Like mortal sin wrong. I know, exactly! In quote-unquote “enemy territory,” you need to have the following things: a really good candidate on your side, a really bad candidate on the other side, and a good environment. So that’s the challenge for Democrats. I don’t really have a specific question here, but you analyze politics for a living, and I was wondering if anything comes to mind about what might come of this string of sexual misconduct stories about politicians. As Slate’s resident interrogator, Isaac Chotiner has tangled with Newt Gingrich and gotten personal with novelist Jonathan Franzen. Now he’s bringing his pointed, incisive interview style to a weekly podcast in which he talks one-on-one with newsmakers, celebrities, and cultural icons. I’m glad you asked. I have been thinking a lot about this too. I first came to Washington in 1991, and it was like my third week in Washington when the Anita Hill testimony started, and you could literally feel the sea change in Washington in that time. You had a record number of women the next year win seats in the House and the Senate. They dubbed 1992 the Year of the Woman. Top Comment There's no real question that the Dems will make gains (as out of power parties pretty much always do) the question is whether the gains will be enough to flood over the gerrymander wall. More... Join In You also had someone accused of sexual misconduct win the presidency that year. Yeah, right. So you either say this feels a lot like 1991, and maybe this is what we see: More women running. But to your broader point: I don’t think we know where this goes. The Weinstein story came only six weeks [ago], and we have had much disruption and impact since then. The Anita Hill story was a galvanizing moment; this feels like we are going to have a new galvanizing moment every 15 minutes.

PBS NewsHour PBS NewsHour New sexual harassment allegations have roiled the political careers of Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Alabama's Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join Judy Woodruff to discuss why President Trump has weighed in on Franken but not Moore and reconsidering old allegations against former President Bill Clinton. Judy Woodruff: For more on the political fallout of new sexual harassment allegations and the battle over the Republican tax plan, I'm joined by our Politics Monday team, Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report. Welcome to you both. So, let's start with the story that we are coming back to tonight because of new allegations, as you heard at the top of the show, new allegations just out late today about journalist Charlie Rose of PBS, CBS, Bloomberg, and Glenn Thrush of The New York Times, sexual allegations. Amy — but I do want to ask both of you. We're here to talk about politics. Amy Walter: Right. Judy Woodruff: We have these — this new — another new allegation now against Bob Franken — I'm sorry — Al Franken. Amy Walter: Al Franken, yes. Judy Woodruff: Who has had one woman state that he sexually harassed and worse with her. Amy Walter: Right. Judy Woodruff: But now you have a new one. Does this change? Because this one involves him, Al Franken, as a senator. Does this change, in a way, what — the seriousness of all this? Amy Walter: Well, I think that, already, even at the very beginning, Democrats were — including Senator Franken, said, we need to have an ethics investigation in order to get exactly at things like this. Was this just a one-time event that happened during the USO era with this one woman or did this happen more frequently, especially while he was a senator? Now we have at least one case, one woman coming forward. An investigation would unleash more. The real question, though, is, how much time do we have before we start to see groups or individuals come out calling for Al Franken's resignation? Already, just watching Twitter today, you could see some liberal voices, some groups saying it's time for Al Franken to step down. Let's see what happens, especially in Minnesota, over the next few weeks. Is there a building cry for his resignation? Judy Woodruff: There have been calls, of course, almost immediately when these allegations came out, Tamara, from the right and the left, and Al Franken himself said there should be an ethics investigation. But how — you know, how much of a platform or leg does he have to stand on right now? Tamara Keith: An ethics investigation, how serious is that? How long does it last? Judy Woodruff: Right. Tamara Keith: And, in the meantime, what else comes out? I think that there are a lot of people in Washington and beyond holding their breath, not knowing where this goes, whether there are more names that will come out, out of Congress or elsewhere. And there's a very palpable sense that this is not the end. And we don't know if we're at the beginning or in the middle of these revelations and this cultural moment, and sort of where that ends up. And, you know, Al Franken right now is standing alone. Will he continue to stand alone? Amy Walter: Yes, I think that's a very big piece of this. Every day, we have a new name coming out in different businesses, obviously, today, a big focus on journalists. But we will have it back on onto politics soon enough. Judy Woodruff: And Jackie Speier, the congressman from California who has been out front in speaking of her own experience, just said a few days ago that there are two sitting members of Congress right now who have allegations against them. But she hasn't yet said who they are. There is a nondisclosure agreement that is signed under congressional rules. Tamara Keith: Right, but will someone go on the record? It's just — this is quite a moment that we're in. Judy Woodruff: The other name, of course, the other person we're watching is Roy Moore, the Senate candidate, Republican Senate candidate, of Alabama. Amy, the president has gone after Al Franken, but he has not said anything about Roy Moore. The White House has said, let the voters of Alabama decide. I guess, can the White House stand on that position? Amy Walter: Right. I mean, to say that the president is doing something that's contradictory is not new, right? That he's saying one thing about one person and then has another rule for another person is totally within keeping with the way the president has behaved, including the fact that, of course, one is a Republican and one is a Democrat. So, in that sense, I think, you know, we have long understood that the way that the president sees the world in terms of like putting people who are on his side and people who are on the other side — this sort of fits into that. Judy Woodruff: And, meantime, Amy, you have the allegations resurfacing — or I should say conversation resurfacing about President Bill Clinton and whether he should have done something. He should have stepped down. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York made that comment last week. A lot of pushback from the Clinton camp. Tamara Keith: Certainly, there was. But this is — when Bill Clinton was running for president, there was a different default setting. The default setting was to criticize the women, in part by — led by people who were affiliated with Bill Clinton. The default setting now is to believe the women. It's like a hashtag. The default setting has completely changed. But, in the meantime, since Bill Clinton, you had Arnold Schwarzenegger get elected shortly after there were groping allegations in California. And you had the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, get elected after some very serious allegations that remain outstanding. It's not like anyone has recanted those allegations. Amy Walter: I think there's — it's also an interesting discussions when we talk about the Clintons. If you go back to 2016 and look at how much of the Clinton legacy was already being — how many Democrats were already distancing themselves from the Clinton legacy ideologically and on issues, on trade, on the Defense of Marriage Act, on the crime bill, on welfare reform. So, it's yet one more reminder of how — a Democratic Party that is moving away of the legacy left by the Clintons, by Bill Clinton specifically. And I think this is one case where we are going to see both the party, but also society moving on from what was acceptable back then. Judy Woodruff: Well, what we know is that all of this is moving very fast and new allegations coming out. It feels to me almost hourly. Tamara Keith: Like, our phones just keep buzzing. Judy Woodruff: That's right. It's been going on certainly all day long. Amy Walter: Yes. Judy Woodruff: Yes. Amy Walter: And we still don't know how to deal with this. As I said, the floodgates have opened. There is a whole bunch of water that is flowing through. And we don't know what to do with all the water now. And that's what's going to take a long time. Judy Woodruff: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, Politics Monday, thank you both. Tamara Keith: You're welcome. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

Of the 14 lawmakers who have already announced their retirement from the House in advance of next year’s midterm election cycle, 12 are Republicans. That GOP stampede for the door will likely grow stronger in coming weeks as more members face filing deadlines and have to decide if they want to raise the required millions in donations needed to run. To date, most of the retiring Republicans have been quiet about why they’re leaving, or have stuck to talking points about wanting to spend time with their families. But one Republican, Rep. Dave Trott of Michigan, admitted this week that one of the reasons he’s leaving is Donald Trump. Complaining to CNBC in an interview that Congress isn’t productive and that the Beltway atmosphere has become “very partisan,” Trott conceded that Trump’s unbalanced behavior is a “factor” in his decision to leave Congress. “We have different styles and I sometimes don’t understand some of the things he does and says,” said Trott, who represents Michigan’s 11th district. “It’s a very partisan environment and I think that problem has been exacerbated under President Trump.” Trott cited Trump’s comments following the white nationalist riot in Charlottesville, Virginia, as being an example of how the president only seemed to make matters worse with his erratic actions. Trump said the white nationalist mob included some “very fine people” within its ranks.) The congressman also suggested Trump lacked leadership skills and pointed to his failure to get a health care bill through the Republican-controlled Congress. “I mean the president blamed the Senate. I’m not sure [Ronald] Reagan would have had a problem with the Senate,” he said. Meanwhile, with his record low approval rating for a first-year president and a legislative agenda that has yet to deliver on a single promise from his campaign platform, Trump is shaping up to be an electoral albatross for the Republicans in 2018. The GOP got a possible preview with recent losses on Election Day earlier this month, especially with statewide setbacks in Virginia. “Exit polls revealed an unmistakable anti-Trump backlash Tuesday,” Politico reported, following the wave of GOP losses. “And the stark results cast fresh doubt on the health of Republican majorities in the House and Senate, in addition to gubernatorial races in next year’s midterm elections.” Last week, the closely watched Cook Political Report shifted the status of seven congressional races, and boosted the odds of a Democratic win in six of them. (Democrats need to flip 24 seats to take control of the House next year.) Noted Cook analyst Amy Walter, “A wave is building.”"", ""News you actually want to know, and what you can do to make a difference. Welcome to your daily roundup of good news about good people, how you can help make a difference — and a picture of President Obama because you deserve it. One silver lining to come out of the storm cloud of Donald Trump’s election is that more and more Americans seem to be seeing the Republican Party for exactly the bankrupt and heartless organization it really is. Turned off by the rot within the GOP, voters are turning toward the left — as Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report put it, “A wave is building” for Democrats in the coming midterm elections. And as Philip Bump of the Washington Post noted, it’s not just the magnitude of the wave that’s notable, but how early we’re seeing it grow. Wave elections — like those in 2006, which handed the House to the Democrats, or 2010, which flipped it back — are not always obvious a year in advance. Last week, Cook Political Report released its latest assessment of the state of the race for control of the House. There are, according to that analysis, 62 seats that are leaning toward the Democrats or the Republicans and 21 seats that are considered toss-ups that could got either way. The problem for Republicans is that 45 of those 62 and 17 of those 21 seats are held by their party, meaning that they have much more to lose … There is one type of wave that telegraphs its arrival in advance. During a tsunami, as is now commonly known, the ocean recedes before rushing back into shore (and beyond). How do we extend our political metaphor to incorporate that? Well, let’s just keep an eye on how many more people announce their decision not to seek reelection, shall we? That’s about as close to the ocean receding as we’ll get — and if it keeps happening, it may be a sign that flooding is imminent. After the massive wins for Democrats on Nov. 7, and with multiple Republicans choosing retirement over vying for re-election in the Trump era, by Election Day 2018, the blue wall of that wave may be one for the record books. Indivisible said it best: This bill gets worse with every new version because Rs think there is no limit on how terrible they can make it. Let’s tell them they’re wrong.

Follow Indivisible’s links to call up your Republican or Democratic lawmaker and demand that they put millions of average Americans ahead of that sliver of the population in the highest reaches of the income brackets. Trump’s Interior Department, headed by Secretary Ryan Zinke, recently announced the surprise reversal of an Obama-era ban on importing macabre “trophies” of big game hunting, like elephant tusks. Trump has apparently (and rather uncharacteristically) had second thoughts on the issue, first noting that he was “Putting big-game trophy decision on hold” while he reviewed the facts, and later said he would be “very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show” should continue. Might have been nice to make those sentiments known to Zinke before the reversal was put down on paper, but okay. In any case, and knowing that Trump’s tweets are not always safe to take as gospel, two major environmental groups filed a lawsuit in federal court, asking a judge to declare the reversal unlawful. “President Trump’s tweets are ambiguous and beg the question of what exactly he plans to do,” noted Elly Pepper of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which filed the suit alongside the Center for Biological Diversity. And as CBD lawyer Tanya Sanerib declared, “These incredibly imperiled creatures need a lot more than vague promises.” Republicans were so busy trying to take health care away from millions of people that they also ripped it away from 9 million children when they failed to reauthorize the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in September. You know who has never and would never forget about the needs of children? The woman whom the majority of the country wanted as our president. Hillary Clinton urged everyone to pick up the phone and call their Congressperson — at 202-224-3121 — to demand that they reauthorize CHIP immediately.

Lovato brought Roem as her guest to the American Music Awards on Nov. 19, in a powerful statement of love and progress. “Demi Lovato and Danica Roem are two strong and inspirational women who embody the need for all Americans to stand together united and to take action today against any form of discrimination and oppression, said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, an LGBTQ rights organization which helped bring the two women together. Lovato said that she was “completely inspired” by Roem, while Roem championed Lovato’s stance against bullying and thanked her for the “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Plus, they looked damn good: Demi Lovato bringing the first out trans state legislator Danica Roem as her date to the #AMAs is so beautiful. 🌈✨ pic.twitter.com/C3deCI5V6S — Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) November 20, 2017 The Obama-Biden bromance memes were always a gift — even more so these days, when so many of us find ourselves thinking “Come back, Barack!” at least once or twice or 50 times a day.

Feeling like they’re actually going to be heard. Being safe doesn’t mean you’re not going to be challenged. Amy Walter: We come to the table convinced of our own views and the correctness of our own views. So just listen and ask questions in an open-ended way rather than framing them in a way that presumes you have the right answer. Basically, just watch how Judy asks questions on the NewsHour every night, and do it that way. Eddie Glaude: What we have to do is actually hear what our loved ones are saying and then be as generous as we can be. You may come to the conclusion that your mom or your brother’s vision of the world is one you simply reject. So begin a conversation about what kind of world we want to live in, what kinds of values we have as a family and how we want to see those values substantiated in the world. Eddie Glaude: The problem with our broader culture is that we can’t assume a baseline of trust. We can’t assume that people are engaging us in good faith. All of this makes it damn near impossible to have a full and genuine conversation. But during Thanksgiving, when we’re all sitting around the table, we can love each other to death and disagree with each other to death. And that’s the key: Understanding that the hard conversations are hard for a reason. They’re hard. Amy Walter: Spend time with the little ones in your life. They have awesome stories and a different perspective. Compare what you think is important to what they think is important. Amy Walter: Do you want to be right or do you want to have a relationship when the debate is over? I think you should be asking yourself that when you are in any argument. David Brooks: There’s a truism that you should never go to sleep mad. But I’m a believer that sometimes you just need to go to sleep. Get a good night’s sleep and have a conversation about something else the next day. Politics is not that important. Mark Shields: A false fire alarm is always helpful. Or announcing that the turkey is ready when it isn’t. Or just turn to Uncle Eugene who has a theory that left-handed Presbyterians are taking over the Federal Reserve and say, “You’re absolutely right! I never thought of that before, but that’s right.” Eddie Glaude: The best way to end it is to make explicit what is underneath it all: love. It’s so sticky and sentimental, but it’s not really. It is precisely: “I trust you enough to have an argument about these issues, and we love each other so deeply and profoundly that we’re able to risk ourselves in having such a conversation.” Left: Shot of a group of people stacking their hands at a dining table.

Only on one occasion in recent years, in 2010, has Waveney Valley AC’s race been cancelled due to icy roads, but the go-ahead was given this year with just puddles and slush underfoot for competitors to deal with. Early morning rain turned to sleet as the race got under way from outside Sir John Leman High School. The route then took in the country lanes of Ilketshall St Andrew and Ringsfield, before returning to the school. The winner for the third time - and the second successive year - was Joe Skipper of Team Skipper, who took an early lead which he held onto to cross the line in a time of 56:26. Second was Rob Chenery of Ipswich Jaffa in 56:56 and third Framlingham Flyer’s Jim Last in 58:10. Emma Attwood of Stowmarket Striders was this year’s winning woman in a time of 1:09.05. Second was team mate Gemma Porch in 1:10.31 and third Jessica Behan of Norwich Road Runners in 1:11.13. Framlingham Flyers were the men’s team winners and Stowmarket Striders won the ladies’ event. The fancy dress entry was again well supported and the winners were Ben Hadingham and Sarah-Jane Lumley. Host club Waveney Valley had 33 finishers, more than a dozen of them running a 10-mile race for the first time. There were personal best times by Steve Carruthers, Chris Bradford, Stuart Spurgeon, Stephanie Pimlott and Donna Milner.

Bill White provided plenty of entertainment as he finished his night by hammering the pocket 12 straight times for his ninth career 300. Bill put games of 215 and 229 in front of that 300 to lead all bowlers this week with a nice 744 set. Bill edged out Derek Gund, who registered games of 257, 242 and 243 for a sweet 742 series. Sami Jo Williams rounded out the Thursday night action as she dealt the lanes misery with games of 230, 221 and 224 to lead all the women this week with an impressive 675 series. Moving right along, Wednesday morning Queen Tumblers League provided this week’s top senior female bowler. Alice Barnes has found her way back into the paper as she fired games of 174, 181 and 214 for a 569 series. Finally the Saturday morning youth league, Stars of Tomorrow, had Brandon Bertrand staying on top of his game. Brandon stunned the lanes with games of 225, 201 and 186 for a 612 series.

Irving Middle School pre-Advanced Placement art students made the mugs for the residents. Dan Harris, center, sets up cups at Full Circle Adult Day Center. Irving Middle School pre-Advanced Placement art students made the mugs for the residents. Last week, Irving Middle School pre-Advanced Placement art students shared a little joy with Full Circle Adult Day Center clients. “We made 70 or 80 cups and we took 30 to Full Circle. We have 40 left to go, maybe,” Irving Middle School teacher Dan Harris said. “It was about making something for someone else. They were all pretty interested, but they couldn’t all do one because it is a laborious process. We had to cut it off around 70 cups.” Students dropped off the unique, handmade cups Thursday and spent a little time talking with clients. Last year, students made drawings and paintings which they donated to a nearby nursing home to brighten up their walls. A few years before, his students made teddy bears for students relocated to the Oklahoma City area after Hurricane Katrina. “I wanted to do something in our neighborhood. We drive by those nursing homes every day,” Harris said. “It was a good experience going to the nursing home last year.” Harris wasn’t originally planning on having his students do a donation project this year, but then he saw a workshop at the University of Oklahoma about how to make simple cups. He originally planned to bring the cups to a nursing home but then decided to ask if Full Circle Adult Day Center would be interested in receiving the cups. Last year’s project and this year’s project were sponsored by the Norman PTA Council. This was eighth-grader Addison Fowler’s first year taking part in something like this. Each student had the option of making two cups: one to donate to Full Circle and one to give a family member. “I thought it was really cool and a really cool idea, especially near the holidays,” Fowler said. “We started two weeks ago, so we had enough time to make everything.” Harris said he gave the students free rein to design their cups, with one caveat: they couldn’t just put words on their cup. Each student designed their own cups. Fowler said she made her cup Christmas-themed. “I tried to do simple designs mostly and nothing too crazy,” Fowler said. “I tried to think of what they would like, what would make them happy.” She has written letters to veterans before, but Fowler said this was the first time she donated something she actually made, something someone can use every day. Seventh-grader Athena Lowery said her focus was on making sure her cup, which was going to an older lady, was feminine and cute. “I thought it was really fun and a really great idea because it brings out other people’s creativity and it makes you learn stuff you wouldn’t learn anywhere else,” Lowery said. Fowler was not able to attend the drop-off, but Lowery said she loved visiting Full Circle. “It made me feel happy because I knew that someone else would use it and they would appreciate it,” Lowery said.

Daniel Harris posted a video on Facebook featuring the faces of three Labour councillors superimposed on the heads of dancing Jewish figures. The video, entitled ‘The Dancing Brighton and Hove Councillors’, featured city council leader Warren Morgan and his colleagues Anne Meadows and Caroline Penn. It is understood that two of the councillors have close family ties to the Jewish community. Mr Harris campaigns on housing issues in Brighton and Hove for Momentum, the hard-Left grassroots organisation. Labour Party campaigner Daniel Harris has been suspended after posting an allegedly anti-Semitic video of three councillors doing a Hanukkah dance wearing traditional Jewish clothes. The video counciwas branded anti-Semitic by Jewish community leaders Following a fierce backlash to the video, he has now been suspended by Labour pending an investigation into the post, which he claims was ‘a bit of fun’. Fiona Sharpe, communities consultant at the Sussex Jewish Representative Council, described the video as a ‘crass uneducated insult’. She said: ‘His depiction of three local councillors as Orthodox Jews surrounded by the Star of David is not viewed as “fun” by the Jewish community. ‘We see it as a crass, uneducated insult aimed at our community. Does Mr Harris think it would be amusing to portray councillors dressed in hijabs or turbans?’ Ivor Caplin, former Labour MP for Hove and spokesman for the Jewish Labour Movement, said: ‘The posting of that video on social media is without question anti-Semitic. ‘The JLM has submitted a formal complaint on the matter. There are people who think they can defend Dan Harris for this – there may need to be a wider investigation by the party.’ Anti-Semetic: A Labour Party campaigner has been suspended after posting an allegedly anti-Semitic video of three councillors doing a Hanukkah dance wearing traditional Jewish clothes (pictured: Warren Morgan (right), and his colleagues Anne Meadows (centre) and Caroline Penn (right) - all of whom have Jewish heritage Last night, the video had been removed from Mr Harris’s Facebook page and replaced with a different video featuring the three councillors as dancing elves. One user commented: ‘Too late. You’re a nasty piece of work, fooling no one.’ Writing in a blog, Mr Harris said he was ‘utterly devastated’ and blamed his suspension on ‘a political ploy by the Right in Labour’. He said: ‘I want to condemn all forms of racism. As a gay man who has been victim to two incidents of homophobic hate crime this year, I know full well the challenges people from minority groups face. ‘I would never take part in any form of racism. I fight for vulnerable people in the community and, as a result of being fairly vocal on issues, I believe this whole incident is a political ploy by the Right in Labour to deny working-class voices and smear the Left. Daniel Harris denied he was racist and only bought the video for £1.99 online. He added: 'Having been suspended yesterday (Thursday) by the Labour Party for an alleged antisemitic post, which I categorically deny. I am utterly devastated.' ‘Finally I want to end with an apology if my post did offend anyone, it was certainly never meant to offend. It was meant to bring seasonal joy, not more divisions.’ Under Mr Corbyn’s leadership, Labour has faced a wave of criticism over allegations of anti-Semitism. The party conference in Brighton in September included a fringe meeting at which Israel was likened to the Nazis and a panellist questioned whether the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were murdered, had happened. During the conference, council leader Mr Morgan said the party would not be welcome back in the city unless Mr Corbyn acted to stamp out anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn insists he believes in a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to the issue but has faced criticism over his own stance on Israel. Last year, Mr Harris was removed from the Brighton and Hove District Labour Party executive committee after the constituency party was suspended amid accusations of abusive behaviour and an improper ballot at the annual general meeting. The party was later disbanded and reconstituted into three separate constituency parties. Momentum now faces further claims of attempting to seize control of Brighton and Hove City Council after winning all nine places on the council’s candidate selection committee for the next election.

Here are his essential tech aids to stay fit. “I’m currently trying out Striiv and it’s been one of the best I’ve used,” explains Webster. “It tracks my activity levels 24/7 and also monitors my sleep trends which is very important to me. I’m also a fan of the reminder features – it keeps me on my toes and reminds me to drink water and take my supplements daily.” Webster swears by his smartwatch to ensure he gets the most out of his training. You can take a look at some of the best fitness watches of 2017 in our compilation here. Ben Lucas is the founder of Flow Athletic fitness centre in Paddington swears by three of his most reliable tech aids in the health game. “If you don’t sleep well, you cant train hard,” explains the ex-rugby league player of the Cronulla Sharks. “The EMFIT QS is the most complete sleep tracker on the market. With the info it provides I can zero in on the factors that lead me to better sleep and therefore better training performance.” “This free app helps me monitor and execute my hydration goals,” explains Lucas. Water consumption is vital in any fitness program let alone for keeping the body operating at its optimum levels. This particular app can help by notifying you if you’re not drinking enough water. Waterlogged is compatible with most operating systems including Apple iOS, Android, Fitbit and more. “After reading the book 10% Happier by Dan Harris, I was intrigued to learn more about meditation and its ability to assist performance (and life),” says Lucas. “This app has some great videos on the science and philosophy behind meditation and some tools on helping your meditation practice.” Get your free 10% Happier app here. You’ve got the inside word from the pros, now let us grace your fitness journey with some of the latest and greatest gadgets and tech-driven fitness aids to get the job done. It was only a matter of time before smart scales arrived on the fitness scene and the QardioBase is one of the most advanced ones on the market today. Besides weighing, it can also measure your BMI, heart rate, water percentage, body fat, bone mass and muscle mass. Once the data is retrieved, it is recorded onto an app so that users can track their stats over time. It’s pretty flexible as well with full compatibility with Apple Health, Google Fit, and Samsung S Health across iOS and Android platforms. Most importantly it can detect individual users so multiple people can track their fitness on the one scale. Wair is for those who take their cycling seriously in the big city. The engineered textile mask is designed to protect your lungs and health from common pollutants often found on common cycle ways along roads. They come in various designs too and can hook up to an app to let users know real time air quality stats. You’ve pushed your body to the limits and now it’s time to focus on sport recovery. Firefly is the latest in wearable tech which focuses on after-exercise treatment without disrupting everyday life. The strap sits below the knee where it sends painless electrical impulses to activate muscles in the lower leg to encourage blood circulation. The device has been tested by athletes including olympians and is clinically proven to assist in recovery whilst decreasing muscle soreness and swelling. The experts in audio have teamed up with one of the biggest players in sport to bring out an entirely new package in sports headphones. JBL and Under Armor’s latest UA Headphones + Wireless Heart Rate is designed for those who demand the most out of their workout audio devices. Besides the signature JBL noise, they also sport a built-in heart rate monitor which can spit out vital stats at the touch of a button. That means no looking down at your wrist of phone whilst you’re running. They’re also IPX 5 rated meaning they can withstand sweat and water. Not all fitness rollers are created equal and the Neofit Roller is proof of this. Designed in Melbourne by Seb Kipman, the intuitive fitness device can collapse down to 10cm in length (that’s smaller than a iPhone for those playing at home) and expand back up to 30cm when called upon. The rolling diameter also meets the industry standard at 14cm to ensure a full rolling experience for maximum myofascial release. Being ultraportable and rather attractive, the Neofit roller easily fits into any briefcase, gym bag or luggage. If you’re far from a gym then the Bowflex SelectTech Dumbbells is the perfect body building equipment to get the job done. The intuitive dumbbell design means that it’s an entire rack in one with weight adjustment ranging from 4.5kg right up to 40kg. In total there are 17 different weight settings users can choose and most importantly, it won’t take up a lot of space.

Fantasy Impact: Miller turned in one of his worst efforts in awhile, which was particularly surprising in light of the soft matchup with a poor 49ers rush defense. Still, 60 total yards isn't an absolute crusher, and Miller had been relatively consistent for some time, so it's hard to get too worked up over it, unless it cost you your playoff matchup.

Phillip,Frost,['http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shultz-is-reviving-levins-planned-cuts-from-2013-1001213298'],b'708',"['A public storm arose in October 2013 when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) announced a major program of cutbacks. Then managed by CEO Jeremy Levin, the company planned 5,000 layoffs worldwide, amounting to 10% of its workforce at the time, including 700 in Israel. Teva attributed the plan to the need to overcome global challenges, including price pressure and the risk of losing revenue from special products, especially Copaxone, Teva\'s most significant original drug, then at its peak in terms of revenue and profit. The plan, however, was never implemented. Levin was forced to resign less than three weeks later, following sharp differences of opinion between management, which he headed, and the board of directors, then headed by chairperson Phillip Frost. The cost of the streamlining plan presented by Levin before he was ousted was estimated at $1.1 billion. It also included the sale of the company\'s non-core assets. Had the program been carried out as planned, it would have helped Teva save $2 billion annually by the end of 2017. We are now at the end of 2017, and Teva under new CEO Kare Schultz is again putting a program of streamlining and cuts into effect. In contrast to the previous program, Teva has not yet officially announced its plans, and has not provided detailed numbers and data. It is believed that Teva will fire up to 20% of all employees at the company, including 1,000 in Israel. Last summer, Teva announced its intention to lay off 350 employees in Israel in Kfar Saba and Ramat Hovav, thereby sparking a public controversy that reached the Knesset floor (as did Levin\'s plan in 2013). The number of layoffs was eventually reduced to 230. Copaxone disaster The current program of cutbacks is getting underway in a completely different situation than the one that prevailed in 2013. First and foremost, Teva today faces a $34.7 billion debt, compared with ""only"" $12.5 billion four years ago, after having made the biggest acquisition in its history during the interim - the acquisition of Actavis for nearly $40 billion, which in retrospect has become a burden for Teva. document.write(ad_handler.google_div(article_banner_object)) Another difference between 2013 and 2017 concerns Teva\'s share price. In 2013, Teva\'s share was treading water at $40 a share, reflecting a company market cap of $33 billion. Teva\'s recent afflictions have led to another nosedive in its share price. The company\'s current share price is only $13.70, reflecting a $13.9 billion market cap. It is clear that at Teva\'s current share price, any financing round that the company conducts will require further dilution of its shareholders. Teva\'s urgent need for cutting costs also results from the fact that there is a continual decline in the cash flow that it is generating, which is making it difficult for the company to reduce its debt and leverage, as required by the lending banks (and if it wants to preserve an investment rating from S&P and Moody\'s for its debt. Fitch has already downgraded Teva to ""junk bond"" status). According to Teva\'s revised guidance, it will finish 2017 with a cash flow of $3.15-3.3 billion, compared with its previous guidance of $4.4-4.6 billion. Cash flow in the fourth quarter is projected to total $850 million-$1 billion. Following the loss of exclusivity for Copaxone, Teva is encountering generic competition for the 40-milligram dosage Copaxone used by most patients for the first time this year. This development was expected, but somehow, it appears that the timing surprised Teva when Mylan announced approval for its generic version in early October, and Teva had to lower its guidance several weeks later. Copaxone was also mentioned in 2013 when the streamlining plan was announced. The fact that the drug\'s contribution to Teva\'s profits was projected to fall (and indeed did decline even before Mylan launched its generic version) was one of the reasons why cutbacks were necessary. Teva\'s Copaxone sales reached a $4.3 billion peak in 2013. In other words, this plan was designed to take place when Teva was in a much more comfortable position than the current plan, which the company is undertaking from lack of choice and under great difficulties. Copaxone sales totaled $3 billion in the first three quarters of 2017, and profit from the drug was $2.4 billion. Mylan\'s into the market at the beginning of the fourth quarter, however, sparked an intense price war, which is of course leaving its mark on Teva\'s results. Imagination on the board of directors Despite the differences between 2013 and 2017, there are also certain similarities - some of the directors. The composition of the board has changed, and most of the directors were replaced during the subsequent period - among other things as a result of the struggle for a change in the board led by minority shareholder Benny Landa. Four of the directors who served on the board when it pushed Levin out, however, are still there. These are Yitzhak Peterburg, Amir Elstein, Galia Maor, and Dan Suesskind, who left the board, but returned to two months ago. Peterburg, who has been a director since 2012, became chairman after Frost left in 2015, and also served as acting CEO until Kare Schultz\'s recent appointment as CEO. Elstein, who is from Teva\'s founding family, has been a board member since 2009 (his second term as a Teva director). Maor, former CEO of Bank Leumi (TASE: LUMI), has been serving since 2012. No stock exchange trading took place in the US last Thursday because of Thanksgiving. On Friday, Teva\'s share began trading with a 6% jump, but the rise cooled off, and the share wound up only 1.6% ahead. Citibank estimated at the end of last week that laying of 20% of Teva\'s labor force would save the company $1.5-2 billion a year.

Last summer, Teva announced its intention to lay off 350 employees in Israel in Kfar Saba and Ramat Hovav, thereby sparking a public controversy that reached the Knesset floor (as did Levin\'s plan in 2013). The number of layoffs was eventually reduced to 230. Copaxone disaster The current program of cutbacks is getting underway in a completely different situation than the one that prevailed in 2013. First and foremost, Teva today faces a $34.7 billion debt, compared with ""only"" $12.5 billion four years ago, after having made the biggest acquisition in its history during the interim - the acquisition of Actavis for nearly $40 billion, which in retrospect has become a burden for Teva. Another difference between 2013 and 2017 concerns Teva\'s share price. In 2013, Teva\'s share was treading water at $40 a share, reflecting a company market cap of $33 billion. Teva\'s recent afflictions have led to another nosedive in its share price. The company\'s current share price is only $13.70, reflecting a $13.9 billion market cap. It is clear that at Teva\'s current share price, any financing round that the company conducts will require further dilution of its shareholders. Teva\'s urgent need for cutting costs also results from the fact that there is a continual decline in the cash flow that it is generating, which is making it difficult for the company to reduce its debt and leverage, as required by the lending banks (and if it wants to preserve an investment rating from S&P and Moody\'s for its debt. Fitch has already downgraded Teva to ""junk bond"" status). According to Teva\'s revised guidance, it will finish 2017 with a cash flow of $3.15-3.3 billion, compared with its previous guidance of $4.4-4.6 billion. Cash flow in the fourth quarter is projected to total $850 million-$1 billion. Following the loss of exclusivity for Copaxone, Teva is encountering generic competition for the 40-milligram dosage Copaxone used by most patients for the first time this year. This development was expected, but somehow, it appears that the timing surprised Teva when Mylan announced approval for its generic version in early October, and Teva had to lower its guidance several weeks later. Copaxone was also mentioned in 2013 when the streamlining plan was announced. The fact that the drug\'s contribution to Teva\'s profits was projected to fall (and indeed did decline even before Mylan launched its generic version) was one of the reasons why cutbacks were necessary. Teva\'s Copaxone sales reached a $4.3 billion peak in 2013. In other words, this plan was designed to take place when Teva was in a much more comfortable position than the current plan, which the company is undertaking from lack of choice and under great difficulties. Copaxone sales totaled $3 billion in the first three quarters of 2017, and profit from the drug was $2.4 billion. Mylan\'s into the market at the beginning of the fourth quarter, however, sparked an intense price war, which is of course leaving its mark on Teva\'s results. Imagination on the board of directors Despite the differences between 2013 and 2017, there are also certain similarities - some of the directors. The composition of the board has changed, and most of the directors were replaced during the subsequent period - among other things as a result of the struggle for a change in the board led by minority shareholder Benny Landa. Four of the directors who served on the board when it pushed Levin out, however, are still there. These are Yitzhak Peterburg, Amir Elstein, Galia Maor, and Dan Suesskind, who left the board, but returned to two months ago. Peterburg, who has been a director since 2012, became chairman after Frost left in 2015, and also served as acting CEO until Kare Schultz\'s recent appointment as CEO. Elstein, who is from Teva\'s founding family, has been a board member since 2009 (his second term as a Teva director). Maor, former CEO of Bank Leumi (TASE: LUMI), has been serving since 2012. No stock exchange trading took place in the US last Thursday because of Thanksgiving. On Friday, Teva\'s share began trading with a 6% jump, but the rise cooled off, and the share wound up only 1.6% ahead. Citibank estimated at the end of last week that laying of 20% of Teva\'s labor force would save the company $1.5-2 billion a year.

(NASDAQ:OPK) (""OPKO"" or ""the Company""), announces that the Company has enrolled the first patient in a Phase 2b dose ranging trial of OPK88004, its orally administered selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), to treat men with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) or enlarged prostate. BPH is a non-cancerous condition in which an overgrowth of prostate tissue pushes against the urethra and the bladder, limiting the flow of urine. BPH affects approximately 50 million men in the U.S. This trial will enroll approximately 125 men with BPH at 30 sites in the U.S. to identify appropriate doses given over a four month treatment period to reduce prostate size, the primary efficacy endpoint of the study. The study will also assess secondary endpoints, including blood prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and body composition parameters such as lean body mass and fat mass. Interest in evaluating OPK88004 as a treatment for BPH is based on data from a 12 week study of 350 men who showed significantly decreased fat mass, increased lean body mass, and increased muscle strength without significantly changing PSA levels in the overall population, while reducing PSA levels in men with elevated PSA levels. The selective and antagonistic properties of OPK88004 appear to be well suited to potentially reduce prostate hypertrophy in BPH subjects, while providing anabolic benefits such as increased lean body mass and muscle strength. In previously conducted dog studies, treatment with OPK88004 for 6 months decreased prostate weight by up to 75%, demonstrating the potent antagonistic effects of OPK8004 on androgen receptor activity in the prostate. ""We are enthusiastic to be initiating this study in men suffering from BPH, as there are no adequate treatment options for this common debilitating condition that affects men as they age. We believe that OPK88004 has the potential of establishing a new standard of care for a disease that affects millions of men worldwide,"" stated Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of OPKO Health. ""Given the large number of patients with BPH, we expect to complete the study and to have topline results before the end of 2018,"" added Dr. Frost. About Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy Benign prostatic hypertrophy is a non-cancerous condition in which an overgrowth of prostate tissue pushes against the urethra and the bladder, blocking the flow of urine. Prostate gland enlargement is a common condition in men as they get older. According to the Mayo Clinic, the severity of symptoms in men with BPH varies, but tend to worsen over time. Common signs and symptoms of BPH include frequent or urgent need to urinate, increased frequency of urination at night (nocturia), difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream or a stream that stops and starts, dribbling at the end of urination, straining while urinating, and an inability to completely empty the bladder. Medications are the most common treatment for BPH and include alpha blockers and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, both of which have adverse side effects such as sexual dysfunction, dizziness and retrograde ejaculation. Surgical procedures to treat males with BPH are often associated with complications and lengthy recovery times. About OPKO Health, Inc.

If she had been able to run a quick background check on a mobile app designed by a Boca Raton company, she might have known to skip the deadly meeting. RELATED: Sheriff’s Office brass to Realtors: Be careful out there Data firm Cogint Inc. (Nasdaq: COGT) in mid-October launched Forewarn, a tool that lets licensed real estate agents use mobile phone numbers to check criminal histories of clients. The product already is winning attention from the real estate industry. On Tuesday, the Greater Hartford Association of Realtors said it would provide Forewarn to its 4,000 members for two years. In an interview this week, Cogint executives said they’re negotiating with other Realtor associations, too. “The goal is nothing less than getting this in every single agent’s hands in the United States,” said Cogint Chief Executive Derek Dubner. The National Association of Realtors has 1.2 million members, and Cogint charges $20 a month for a subscription. So if 500,000 agents were to sign up for its service, the company would generate $10 million a month in revenue. Realtors routinely flirt with danger. Agents are mostly women who spend their days showing empty houses to strangers. Most times, nothing goes wrong. Sometimes, though Realtors become victims. In 2010, an Ohio agent was strangled by two men she thought wanted to see her listing. And in 2011, an Iowa agent was murdered during an open house. The 2014 murder of Carter, an Arkansas real estate agent, spurred Realtors to examine their security practices. Carter’s killers were a couple posing as out-of-town buyers interested in a house in a remote location. They “spoofed” their phone number, making their Arkansas number appear as an out-of-state phone. If Carter could have run the phony number through Forewarn, said Cogint President James Reilly, “It wouldn’t have matched who they said they were.” While the app wouldn’t have warned Carter that her life was in danger, it could have alerted her that the buyers weren’t who they claimed. Cogint is pursuing a broader strategy of compiling data from court filings, deeds and other public records to compete with Accurint and TLO, two well-established providers of background checks and other information. Its Forewarn app is available only to licensed real estate agents. By matching a phone number to the identity of the owner of that number, the tool provides a quick overview of a person’s history of criminal and civil entanglements, along with homes and vehicles registered in the person’s name. Reilly notes that Realtors who use Forewarn should keep other safety policies in place, such as meeting new clients at the office for the first time, or not showing homes alone. “This isn’t the end-all solution,” Reilly said. “We always just say it’s a yellow flag.” Cogint, which has 110 employees in Boca Raton and 90 more workers in New York and Seattle, counts Miami billionaire Phillip Frost as its largest shareholder. He owns 29 percent of the company.

(NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) four years ago, some said it proved that a non-Israeli CEO could not succeed at Israel\'s largest and leading company. Levin did whatever he could to connect with Israel: he moved his home to Israel, learned Hebrew in record time, and talked a lot about his youth on a kibbutz. He was not particularly successful, however, at getting along with the Israeli board of directors or with Phillip Frost, Teva\'s chairperson from the US, even though those people were quarreling with each other. In the end, Frost decided to fire Levin only 18 months after Levin entered his position, making his term the shortest ever for a Teva CEO. When Levin was appointed to manage Teva, the company\'s share price soared. As time went on, however, and Levin presented a relatively modest strategic plan based on small innovative acquisitions, improving existing products, and large-scale layoffs, rather than the large and rousing acquisitions to which Teva\'s investors had become accustomed to over the year, the company\'s share price began to falter. Today, many people in Teva miss Levin and his feasible and low-debt strategic plan; the cutbacks he wanted to make in the company, which now appear essential; the emphasis he planned to put on the innovative market, rather than the generics market; his understanding of the international pharma industry; and most of all Teva\'s share price during his period in office - an average of 2.5 times the current price. For his part, Levin does not miss Teva as much. In an exclusive ""Globes"" interview, he says, ""To this day, I still don\'t understand this episode (in which he was fired, G.W.), but I don\'t look back. A large proportion of the board of directors that made that decision is no longer at the company."" ""Globes"": Is there any chance that you will ever return to Teva? Levin: ""Absolutely not. I love Israel, and I gained many friends at Teva, but it\'s not a company I regard as part of me, despite my great appreciation for (chairperson) Sol Barer and (incoming CEO) Kare Schultz."" Levin has consistently refused to express his opinion of what happened at Teva after he left. Now that the picture has been revealed in all its gloominess, however, he has decided to change this, and to present his analysis of the events that have occurred, and which have brought Teva to its current plight. He sets out five reasons for the decline. ""The causes of the current decline are mostly known: the attack on Mylan, the acquisition of Actavis (at the time, when the acquisition was first made, and few dared to criticize it, Levin said cynically that the acquisition was \'excellent\' for Allergan, the selling company, G.W.), the acquisition of Rimsa, and the failure to build a significant innovative business. The fifth element is the failure to improve the generics business,"" Levin says. ""During the period of Eli Hurvitz, Israel Makov, and Shlomo Yanai, Teva relied primarily on one business plan that included the launching of generic products based on Paragraph IV (which allowed a long period of exclusivity for the first concern reaching the generics market), and later also on Copaxone. In 2011, when I joined the company, it was already clear that these two sources, which generated a lot of cash, were about to dry up. ""The drop in prices in the generics market was also expected. In a commodities market like the generics market, in which there is a lot of competition over similar products, prices always eventually fall. When I got to Teva, everything was already clear - the expected consolidation of drug purchasers and the growing competition from India and China. 90% of the prescriptions now written in the US are generics prescriptions, but in order to maintain profit margins in such a competitive market, you have to renew yourself more quickly than the market. You have to streamline your production facilities, take up automation, introduce efficient production methods, and innovate in generics research, so that your generic products will be the best. ""As Teva\'s CEO, I devised a comprehensive plan designed to cope with all of these things. I don\'t know whether it was implemented. I do know that with the acquisition of Actavis, they acquired many plants, and that immediately made them less efficient. It\'s very surprising, because it was the company\'s Israeli managers who made the decisions in this area, and they were known for having a good understanding of the generics market."" Should your plan for generics still be applied? ""I\'m not sure whether it can still be applied."" Teva was always called ""the world\'s largest generics company,"" and it seemed like this phrase was sometimes substituted for a vision for the company. Might this positioning have been too prominent in Vigodman\'s consciousness when he decided to acquire Actavis? ""I really don\'t know what Vigodman thought. Bigger, of course, is not always better. Eli Hurvitz\'s vision was a profitable and international company."" Do you support splitting the company into two: an innovative company and a generics company? ""That\'s an interesting idea, but since they\'re so deep into generics right now, they have to do their best in this sector."" What about the innovative sector? ""Success in the innovative sector is based on acquisition of a lot of small companies, each of which usually has a single product. The innovative division, which was managed by Dr. Michael Hayden (Levin\'s appointment, G.W.), acquired several good products. The product for migraines looks especially successful. No company looking for an innovative future, however, can rely on just two or three products. ""The markets at which the innovative products that Teva is about to launch are aimed, especially the migraine market, are very competitive. Fortunately, it appears that these products will be marketed by the Copaxone marketing team, which is one of Teva\'s treasures. They are the company\'s unacknowledged heroes."" One of the interesting innovations in Levin\'s plan was the focus on NTEs - products based on known molecules, but with some improvement that differentiates the product from others. Since Levin left, no one has talked about NTEs, but it is now clear that the plan was not abandoned. A source informed about Teva told ""Globes,"" ""Levin\'s NTEs plan did not go exactly according to plan. It turned out that the NTE production process was longer than initially thought, and the patents weren\'t always so strong. Nevertheless, the advantages of this plan are greater than its costs. ""The Austedo product for movement disorders, one of Teva\'s leading products, is actually an NTE, because it\'s based on a new release method for the already known molecule. This product was acquired from outside, but the company\'s original NTEs were also developed - for example, an opiate-based pain reliever with protection against misuse. The product was approved this year for marketing, and there are more products from this family in the pipeline. Teva decided to sell these products instead of marketing them, because of its debt, of course. ""Today, when Teva lacks resources, it can no longer develop these products, because they require more investment than a generic product, and their marketing is also not profitable from the very beginning, and Teva has no time. When Actavis was acquired, the official statement was that it would generate the revenue that would flow precisely for the development of products of this type, but the actual revenue was too small."" Teva has a new CEO now. Like Levin, he is not an Israeli, and comes from the innovative sector. The two men know each other well, because when Levin was a director in Lundbeck when Schultz was CEO of the company. ""Kare is an amazing leader, but he has to deal now with the results of those bad decisions, and with problems that he did not create,"" Levin says ""Together with Sol Barer, however, who has a good understanding of the field and is an excellent manager, they can rebuild the company. Initial measures have already been taken with the layoffs plan and the new organizational structure, but there\'s a long way ahead. At the end, it will be a different company."" The new organizational structure has no innovative arm ""Kare is known as a very successful manager, above all in stabilizing companies in cash flow and financially. Certainly, the first thing he has to contend with is cash flow and debt. Once he stabilizes this and makes sure that he\'s got a profitable business that is based on neither Copaxone nor Paragraph IV, he can think about strategy for the longer term. ""I wish Teva a lot of success, because it\'s an important company for Israel. It\'s an iconic company that inspires a lot of people. It\'s still a great example of how to build a company in Israel."" ""The next thing is neurology"" Levin was pushed out of Teva in 2013 by then chairperson Frost, with the support of the board of directors. After he left, the company was without a CEO for several months, until the selection committee eventually chose Erez Vigodman as the next CEO, and the rest is history. Levin has recovered from the crisis, but anyone who expected him to become CEO of a company on the same scale was disabused. Fairly soon after he left, he became a director in companies like Biocon, an Indian company that, like Teva, expanded from the generics field into directions of innovative drugs and improved generics, and ZappRX, a digital health startup. It appeared that Ovid Therapeutics, which Levin joined as chairperson, would be just another activity for him, but Levin chose it as the main focus of his activity, and as a suitable tool for him to realize his vision of a revolution in neurological medicine. Levin, who is also CEO of Ovid and holds shares in the company, says, ""When I left Teva, I was offered a position as manager of a bigger company, but they wouldn\'t allow me to develop this field. I therefore decided to build a company in this field by myself. Ovid is one of the first companies in the world built with the very specific vision of healing neurological diseases."" Not everyone remembers it, but Levin came to Teva as head of strategy and acquisitions at Bristol-Mayers Squib (BMS), where he developed the company\'s immunooncology business, which revolutionized cancer treatment. BMS brought the world\'s first immunooncological solid-cancer drug, Yervoy, for the treatment of melanoma, to market in 2011, and brought Opdivo to market in 2014. Both of these drugs came from a company whose acquisition was led by Levin. Opdivo accounted for revenue of $3.8 billion in 2016, two years after reaching the market. When Levin says that the next field will bring about a revolution, it is worth paying attention. ""Already in 2006-2007, I was convinced that the next thing was neurology,"" he says. ""When I got to Teva, I wanted to focus on this area. That\'s why I selected Michael Hayden (who left the company this week) as chief scientist. My confidence in the field only grew over the years. I saw, and I still see, that the entire field is prospering - there\'s a better understanding of the drug\'s mechanisms, new types of brain scans, and new and better models in animals. ""We\'re beginning from a very great opportunity of 100 hereditary generic diseases leading to various types of autism, epilepsy, and developmental disability. We\'re coming to the neuro-developmental field with a new understanding of a specific brain mechanism called tonic inhibition, which affects the choice between a signal and noise. If you have a prolonged disability in a movement area, you will have movement problems. If the disability is in the sleeping area, you will have a sleeping disorder, and so forth. We have found the receptor that controls disability. We have the world\'s first drug that acts on this receptor. ""We began our trials with a disease called Angelman syndrome,"" Levin explains. This syndrome features movement and cognitive disturbances. ""We\'re now in Phase II trials on adults, which will probably finish in 2018, and we\'re assessing the product for teenagers. Our goal is to get to babies, because the earliest treatment is likely to be the most effective. We\'re conducting a clinical trial in Israel, and we chose to do this because of my great commitment to Israel, and also because treatment of this disease is rare in its quality in Israel."" Angelman syndrome sufferers number several thousand children and adults in the US. In the case of the second syndrome the company is expected to attack, however, Fragile X syndrome, there are tens of thousands of patients. Trials of a treatment for this disease will begin soon. A drug for treatment of genetic epilepsy is also in Ovid\'s pipeline. ""We started an initial trial in June, and we\'ll get results in 2018. Our partner for development of the product is Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, which comes from Japan. In a very unique agreement, Takeda, which discovered the drug, transferred its development to us. We\'ll be responsible for both development and marketing, and both the revenue and the costs will be split 50-50. Development is being done with cooperation between researchers from both companies working as a single team. There\'s no other such example in the industry."" As of now, you are developing these drugs for genetic developmental diseases. Is it possible that they will be suitable for common diseases at a more advanced age, such as Alzheimer\'s disease and Parkinson\'s disease? ""We think that it\'s a definite possibility."" Ovid\'s current market cap on Nasdaq is $263 million. The company\'s share price soared immediately after its IPO, but then fell to 29% below the price in the IPO, without any negative announcements.

Published by Globes [online], Israel Business News - www.globes-online.com - on November 30, 2017 © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2017 When Jeremy Levin left his position as CEO of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) four years ago, some said it proved that a non-Israeli CEO could not succeed at Israel\'s largest and leading company. Levin did whatever he could to connect with Israel: he moved his home to Israel, learned Hebrew in record time, and talked a lot about his youth on a kibbutz. He was not particularly successful, however, at getting along with the Israeli board of directors or with Phillip Frost, Teva\'s chairperson from the US, even though those people were quarreling with each other. In the end, Frost decided to fire Levin only 18 months after Levin entered his position, making his term the shortest ever for a Teva CEO. When Levin was appointed to manage Teva, the company\'s share price soared. As time went on, however, and Levin presented a relatively modest strategic plan based on small innovative acquisitions, improving existing products, and large-scale layoffs, rather than the large and rousing acquisitions to which Teva\'s investors had become accustomed to over the year, the company\'s share price began to falter. Today, many people in Teva miss Levin and his feasible and low-debt strategic plan; the cutbacks he wanted to make in the company, which now appear essential; the emphasis he planned to put on the innovative market, rather than the generics market; his understanding of the international pharma industry; and most of all Teva\'s share price during his period in office - an average of 2.5 times the current price. For his part, Levin does not miss Teva as much. In an exclusive ""Globes"" interview, he says, ""To this day, I still don\'t understand this episode (in which he was fired, G.W.), but I don\'t look back. A large proportion of the board of directors that made that decision is no longer at the company."" ""Globes"": Is there any chance that you will ever return to Teva? Levin: ""Absolutely not. I love Israel, and I gained many friends at Teva, but it\'s not a company I regard as part of me, despite my great appreciation for (chairperson) Sol Barer and (incoming CEO) Kare Schultz."" Levin has consistently refused to express his opinion of what happened at Teva after he left. Now that the picture has been revealed in all its gloominess, however, he has decided to change this, and to present his analysis of the events that have occurred, and which have brought Teva to its current plight. He sets out five reasons for the decline. ""The causes of the current decline are mostly known: the attack on Mylan, the acquisition of Actavis (at the time, when the acquisition was first made, and few dared to criticize it, Levin said cynically that the acquisition was \'excellent\' for Allergan, the selling company, G.W.), the acquisition of Rimsa, and the failure to build a significant innovative business. The fifth element is the failure to improve the generics business,"" Levin says. ""During the period of Eli Hurvitz, Israel Makov, and Shlomo Yanai, Teva relied primarily on one business plan that included the launching of generic products based on Paragraph IV (which allowed a long period of exclusivity for the first concern reaching the generics market), and later also on Copaxone. In 2011, when I joined the company, it was already clear that these two sources, which generated a lot of cash, were about to dry up. ""The drop in prices in the generics market was also expected. In a commodities market like the generics market, in which there is a lot of competition over similar products, prices always eventually fall. When I got to Teva, everything was already clear - the expected consolidation of drug purchasers and the growing competition from India and China. 90% of the prescriptions now written in the US are generics prescriptions, but in order to maintain profit margins in such a competitive market, you have to renew yourself more quickly than the market. You have to streamline your production facilities, take up automation, introduce efficient production methods, and innovate in generics research, so that your generic products will be the best. ""As Teva\'s CEO, I devised a comprehensive plan designed to cope with all of these things. I don\'t know whether it was implemented. I do know that with the acquisition of Actavis, they acquired many plants, and that immediately made them less efficient. It\'s very surprising, because it was the company\'s Israeli managers who made the decisions in this area, and they were known for having a good understanding of the generics market."" Should your plan for generics still be applied? ""I\'m not sure whether it can still be applied."" Teva was always called ""the world\'s largest generics company,"" and it seemed like this phrase was sometimes substituted for a vision for the company. Might this positioning have been too prominent in Vigodman\'s consciousness when he decided to acquire Actavis? ""I really don\'t know what Vigodman thought. Bigger, of course, is not always better. Eli Hurvitz\'s vision was a profitable and international company."" Do you support splitting the company into two: an innovative company and a generics company? ""That\'s an interesting idea, but since they\'re so deep into generics right now, they have to do their best in this sector."" What about the innovative sector? ""Success in the innovative sector is based on acquisition of a lot of small companies, each of which usually has a single product. The innovative division, which was managed by Dr. Michael Hayden (Levin\'s appointment, G.W.), acquired several good products. The product for migraines looks especially successful. No company looking for an innovative future, however, can rely on just two or three products. ""The markets at which the innovative products that Teva is about to launch are aimed, especially the migraine market, are very competitive. Fortunately, it appears that these products will be marketed by the Copaxone marketing team, which is one of Teva\'s treasures. They are the company\'s unacknowledged heroes."" One of the interesting innovations in Levin\'s plan was the focus on NTEs - products based on known molecules, but with some improvement that differentiates the product from others. Since Levin left, no one has talked about NTEs, but it is now clear that the plan was not abandoned. A source informed about Teva told ""Globes,"" ""Levin\'s NTEs plan did not go exactly according to plan. It turned out that the NTE production process was longer than initially thought, and the patents weren\'t always so strong. Nevertheless, the advantages of this plan are greater than its costs. ""The Austedo product for movement disorders, one of Teva\'s leading products, is actually an NTE, because it\'s based on a new release method for the already known molecule. This product was acquired from outside, but the company\'s original NTEs were also developed - for example, an opiate-based pain reliever with protection against misuse. The product was approved this year for marketing, and there are more products from this family in the pipeline. Teva decided to sell these products instead of marketing them, because of its debt, of course. ""Today, when Teva lacks resources, it can no longer develop these products, because they require more investment than a generic product, and their marketing is also not profitable from the very beginning, and Teva has no time. When Actavis was acquired, the official statement was that it would generate the revenue that would flow precisely for the development of products of this type, but the actual revenue was too small."" Teva has a new CEO now. Like Levin, he is not an Israeli, and comes from the innovative sector. The two men know each other well, because when Levin was a director in Lundbeck when Schultz was CEO of the company. ""Kare is an amazing leader, but he has to deal now with the results of those bad decisions, and with problems that he did not create,"" Levin says ""Together with Sol Barer, however, who has a good understanding of the field and is an excellent manager, they can rebuild the company. Initial measures have already been taken with the layoffs plan and the new organizational structure, but there\'s a long way ahead. At the end, it will be a different company."" The new organizational structure has no innovative arm ""Kare is known as a very successful manager, above all in stabilizing companies in cash flow and financially. Certainly, the first thing he has to contend with is cash flow and debt. Once he stabilizes this and makes sure that he\'s got a profitable business that is based on neither Copaxone nor Paragraph IV, he can think about strategy for the longer term. ""I wish Teva a lot of success, because it\'s an important company for Israel. It\'s an iconic company that inspires a lot of people. It\'s still a great example of how to build a company in Israel."" ""The next thing is neurology"" Levin was pushed out of Teva in 2013 by then chairperson Frost, with the support of the board of directors. After he left, the company was without a CEO for several months, until the selection committee eventually chose Erez Vigodman as the next CEO, and the rest is history. Levin has recovered from the crisis, but anyone who expected him to become CEO of a company on the same scale was disabused. Fairly soon after he left, he became a director in companies like Biocon, an Indian company that, like Teva, expanded from the generics field into directions of innovative drugs and improved generics, and ZappRX, a digital health startup. It appeared that Ovid Therapeutics, which Levin joined as chairperson, would be just another activity for him, but Levin chose it as the main focus of his activity, and as a suitable tool for him to realize his vision of a revolution in neurological medicine. Levin, who is also CEO of Ovid and holds shares in the company, says, ""When I left Teva, I was offered a position as manager of a bigger company, but they wouldn\'t allow me to develop this field. I therefore decided to build a company in this field by myself. Ovid is one of the first companies in the world built with the very specific vision of healing neurological diseases."" Not everyone remembers it, but Levin came to Teva as head of strategy and acquisitions at Bristol-Mayers Squib (BMS), where he developed the company\'s immunooncology business, which revolutionized cancer treatment. BMS brought the world\'s first immunooncological solid-cancer drug, Yervoy, for the treatment of melanoma, to market in 2011, and brought Opdivo to market in 2014. Both of these drugs came from a company whose acquisition was led by Levin. Opdivo accounted for revenue of $3.8 billion in 2016, two years after reaching the market. When Levin says that the next field will bring about a revolution, it is worth paying attention. ""Already in 2006-2007, I was convinced that the next thing was neurology,"" he says. ""When I got to Teva, I wanted to focus on this area. That\'s why I selected Michael Hayden (who left the company this week) as chief scientist. My confidence in the field only grew over the years. I saw, and I still see, that the entire field is prospering - there\'s a better understanding of the drug\'s mechanisms, new types of brain scans, and new and better models in animals. ""We\'re beginning from a very great opportunity of 100 hereditary generic diseases leading to various types of autism, epilepsy, and developmental disability. We\'re coming to the neuro-developmental field with a new understanding of a specific brain mechanism called tonic inhibition, which affects the choice between a signal and noise. If you have a prolonged disability in a movement area, you will have movement problems. If the disability is in the sleeping area, you will have a sleeping disorder, and so forth. We have found the receptor that controls disability. We have the world\'s first drug that acts on this receptor. ""We began our trials with a disease called Angelman syndrome,"" Levin explains. This syndrome features movement and cognitive disturbances. ""We\'re now in Phase II trials on adults, which will probably finish in 2018, and we\'re assessing the product for teenagers. Our goal is to get to babies, because the earliest treatment is likely to be the most effective. We\'re conducting a clinical trial in Israel, and we chose to do this because of my great commitment to Israel, and also because treatment of this disease is rare in its quality in Israel."" Angelman syndrome sufferers number several thousand children and adults in the US. In the case of the second syndrome the company is expected to attack, however, Fragile X syndrome, there are tens of thousands of patients. Trials of a treatment for this disease will begin soon. A drug for treatment of genetic epilepsy is also in Ovid\'s pipeline. ""We started an initial trial in June, and we\'ll get results in 2018.

As of now, you are developing these drugs for genetic developmental diseases. Is it possible that they will be suitable for common diseases at a more advanced age, such as Alzheimer\'s disease and Parkinson\'s disease? ""We think that it\'s a definite possibility."" Ovid\'s current market cap on Nasdaq is $263 million. The company\'s share price soared immediately after its IPO, but then fell to 29% below the price in the IPO, without any negative announcements. How did it feel to raise capital on Nasdaq as a young company, not a big one? ""It\'s very different than as a big company,"" Levin laughs.

Phillip,Frost,['https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/arts/rafael-soriano-paintings.html'],b'705',"['Advertisement Supported by By Brett Sokol MIAMI — The 1959 Cuban Revolution and its legacy had a major influence on the life of the painter Rafael Soriano. One of the island’s rising art stars in the ’50s, he saw his career ascend higher initially when Fidel Castro seized power. But you will not find any overt nods to politics in Soriano’s work — not in his early paintings that revolve around a hard-edged geometric abstraction, nor in his later pieces made after he feared arrest and fled with his family from Matanzas, Cuba, to Miami, where he remained until he died in 2015 at 94. More than 90 of his artworks are on display in “Rafael Soriano: The Artist as Mystic,” at Miami’s Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum. His daughter, Hortensia Soriano, spoke with The New York Times about her father. The conversation has been edited and condensed. What was your father’s life like in Matanzas before 1959? The 1950s were known as the Golden Age in Cuba, and that was definitely true for my father. He had a hotbed of activity swirling around him: He’s exhibiting his work at museums, people are writing about it and he’s also a professor at the art school in Matanzas he co-founded. And then the revolution comes. Was he hopeful about it? Hopeful and enthusiastic! Everybody was! They thought Fidel Castro was going to be their savior, especially after the Batista government. My father became part of the “10 Concrete Painters” group. Because they were making a utopian form of art, they thought they’d be embraced. It didn’t turn out like that. In 1961, Castro famously announced his new cultural diktat: “Within the revolution, everything. Against the revolution, nothing.” Where did that leave Rafael? The new government did not embrace abstract painters. When I was a child I asked my father why we left Cuba. He said because he no longer felt safe, he no longer felt free, and he could no longer paint what he wanted to paint. His “Aha!” moment came when a minister from the regime told him he had to paint a series of doves. It was ridiculous! There was no figuration anywhere in my father’s work! But Fidel Castro had been photographed giving a speech with these white doves landing on his shoulder, my father was a well-known painter and they wanted him for a campaign around that. He left on April 16, 1962. I wasn’t even 2 years old yet. My mother and I followed him over to Miami on May 26, 1962. We weren’t able to bring anything except literally the shirts on our backs. How did your father adapt to Miami? He comes here, he’s a nobody, he had to start all over. He was very traumatized for about two years. He couldn’t paint. Then he had a spiritual awakening. He came home one day after work and was napping. He felt himself levitate above his bed. A figure came to him and said, “Rafael, where do you want to go?” He said he wanted to go see his little house back in Matanzas. With fantastic speed, he was suddenly standing on the feet of this great figure, looking at his house in Matanzas. At the same time, he saw a herd of wild horses galloping down the hill, and it really scared him. They were going to trample everything! He asked the figure, “Who are you?” And the figure said, “I am the Trinity.” With that, he fell back into his bed. For him it was a sign that Miami was home, this was where he was going to sink his roots. Whether or not it was a dream, it changed him. And he began to paint again. What happened to his paintings left back in Matanzas? Some are still scattered throughout Cuba. When I was in Matanzas in 2015, I visited a church and they had three beautiful paintings of my father’s hanging there. I asked the archbishop how they got there. He said, “Your father gave them to us.” Hmm. Really? My father kept a record of every painting he had to leave behind. But I’m not going to argue with the archbishop! At least they’re real. Are you seeing fake Sorianos? I think they’re being done in Cuba to sell to tourists, but they’ve begun turning up here, too. They’ll bake a canvas to make it look old. I found one where they painted on top of an old 1950s painting — if you rubbed the paint, you could see the original work underneath. Advertisement']",0.0,6.0,0.25,0.0,1053951.0,1

Museums, institutions that preserve and produce culture, walk a tightrope of accessibility and excellence. They seek to attract a steady and wide-reaching audience while presenting compelling artwork that\'s relevant to a broader conversation on art and its trends. Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the largest fine-art exhibitions in the world, only heightens the pressure on local museums to be both cutting-edge and marketable, as hundreds of tourists pour into town to view, judge, and buy art. Miami turns into something of a circus during Art Basel. Some museum events cater to the exclusive and prestigious side of an international audience well-versed in contemporary creation. But other happenings attempt to bridge the gap between what might seem elite and the everyday, colloquial art lovers and their families. The tide seems to be turning toward the latter this year, as more Miami Art Week events become reasonable for a broader audience to attend. One event that has traditionally remained free and open to the public is the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum\'s Breakfast in the Park. Guests can enjoy complimentary food and tours of the museum and the sculpture garden, as well as a lecture from guest artist Daniel Joseph Martinez. The L.A.-based sculptor has represented the United States at biennials around the globe. 9:30 a.m. Sunday, December 10, at the Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; 305-348-2890; frost.fiu.edu. At FIU\'s other art museum, right in the middle of the action in South Beach, the balance is more delicate. The Wolfsonian\'s official Art Basel VIP party is open solely to Diplomat-level museum members and VIP convention card-holders and will present Seite Zwei\'s transformation of the museum\'s lobby and façade. Emanuele Timothy Costa will be in attendance to take portraits of attendees. Though the Italian artist will spend the night snapping shots of gentile guests, his Thousand People Project will take him to the stainless-steel Bridge Tender House on the museum\'s sidewalk Monday through Thursday. The project involves the subjects of Costa\'s portraits telling stories of their lives, to be archived along with 5,000 others from all over the world. 8 p.m. Friday, December 8, at the Wolfsonian-FIU, 1001 Washington Ave., Miami Beach; 305-535-2622; wolfsonian.org. Though not directly affiliated with the city\'s largest cultural event, the Phillip & Patricia Frost Museum of Science is nevertheless involved in this year\'s events by way of the Knight Arts Challenge\'s tenth anniversary. The Knight Foundation has given more than $100 million to the arts in Miami over the past 12 years, and the Knight Arts Challenge has funded what are now major players in the cultural production of the city. To celebrate the past decade, both the Frost Museum of Science and Pérez Art Museum Miami will be open to the public, and a deluge of dance and music performances, literary pop-ups, and other diversions will flood the plaza between the museums. The kickoff to Miami Art Week champions not only the diversity of Miami\'s offerings but also the accessibility to the arts that\'s necessary to foster a community of art-makers and appreciators. 7 p.m. Monday, December 4, in Museum Plaza, 1103 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; knightfoundation.org/10. Whether by careful planning or serendipity, the anniversary party won\'t be the only instance Pérez Art Museum Miami will be accessible without an admission fee during the Basel frenzy. The museum\'s programs Free First Thursdays and Free Second Saturdays fall within the Miami Art Week window, December 7 and 9, respectively. As one of the larger cultural institutions in town, the museum caters to the influx of moneyed visitors via PAMM Presents, a swanky outdoor party with live music and drinks. Elizabet Cerviño, a contemporary Cuban artist, will present spontaneous pop-up performances throughout the week as part of the museum\'s exhibition ""On the Horizon."" PAMM Presents begins at 9 p.m. Thursday, December 7, at Pérez Art Museum Miami, 1103 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; 305-375-3000; pamm.org. You have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we\'re movin\' in! Of all these offerings, the most pointed attempt to make fine art accessible, even outside Miami Art Week, goes to the Bass, which reopened its doors in October after a lengthy renovation. As a draw for fresh blood, a new exhibition of work by Mika Rottenberg will open with a reception available to museum members. However, an initiative offers free membership to Miami Beach residents and City of Miami Beach employees. A typical museum membership starts at $50, but those eligible can register now through January 15 for their claim to free art, and the sooner the better: Membership includes access to the reception. 8 p.m. Wednesday, December 6, at the Bass, 2100 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; 305-673-7530; thebass.org. Art Week will bring new work to the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami too, with an exhibition by Swedish artist Jacob Felländer. The photographer is making his U.S. debut with a blend of installation, 3D printing, and virtual reality meant to invoke alternate dimensions. The opening reception is free for MOCA members, North Miami residents, and Art Basel VIPs; tickets for the general public cost $30. 7 p.m. Wednesday, December 6, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, 770 NE 125th St., North Miami; 305-893-6211; mocanomi.org. Finally, the Lowe Art Museum will host its annual Bubbles & Brunch, which will include a lecture by exhibiting artist Michele Oka Doner and costs only the price of museum admission, which is $12.50 for adults and children aged 12 or older and $8 for students and seniors; children under the age of 12 get in free. Bubbles & Brunch begins at 10 a.m. Sunday, December 10, at the Lowe, 1301 Stanford Dr., Coral Gables; 305-284-4545; lowemuseum.org.

Mamello Matikinca, a senior economist at FNB, said that in isolation, the October budget review was enough for the rating agencies to downgrade the local currency to Ba1 and BB+, respectively. “While the local currency ratings are the ones to watch, Moody’s may opt to lower the country’s foreign currency rating to Ba1 in line with S&P and Fitch, with both Moody’s and S&P holding the local currency rating steady until greater clarity emerges from the ANC elective conference and the Budget in February,” Matikinca said. A downgrade of SA’s local currency credit rating to sub- investment grade by Moody’s and S&P would result in the exclusion of South Africa’s rand-denominated bonds from key global bond indices such as the Citi World Government Bond Index (Wigbi). According to Citi, exclusion from the Wigbi would occur the very next month after a downgrade by both Moody’s and S&P. Citi estimates Wigbi-related outflows as upwards of R85billion. Carlos Teixeira, a research analyst at Credit Suisse, said that on a cold analysis of key macro and fiscal metrics, the sovereign’s long-term domestic debt rating should be sub-investment grade. “Recent developments - the apparent search for additional funding for tertiary education, the resignation of a key National Treasury official (supposedly in response) and Eskom’s likely need for additional funding from the Treasury - have further raised the risk that the agencies will downgrade the sovereign on November 24,” Teixeira said. Fears are that if the agencies downgrade the country’s local currency debt, the impending interest rate hike by the US Fed will act as a double whammy that will keep South Africa’s economy in prolonged doldrums. Further rate hikes Last week, Eric Rosengren, the Boston Fed president who also serves on the US Fed, said the strong US economy called for further interest rates hikes, including next month. The Fed has already raised rates twice this year. His views found support from October’s positive US inflation and retail sales figures, which solidified dominant views that the US economy was ready for further rate hikes. Asief Mohamed, the chief investment officer at Aeon Investment Management, said the expected 0.25percentage-point increase in interest rates by the US Fed was not expected to have a material impact at this stage on South African interest rates. “If the US Fed keeps on hiking rates in 2018 by 0.25% four times, then South African and emerging market interest rates, both short term and long term will most likely increase,” Mohamed said. The Reserve Bank’s last monetary policy committee meeting of the year is also expected to take centre stage, which will be preceded by the release of October’s inflation data by Statistics SA. Kamilla Kaplan, an economist at Investec, said the rand exchange rate, pending electricity tariffs and the pace of global monetary policy normalisation. meant the SA Reserve Bank would again keep interest rates on hold this week. -BUSINESS REPORT Reason for Ndaba's drastic weight loss DA slams Finance Minister Tito Mboweni over 'looney posting' WATCH: These are the people who 'looted' VBS Mutual Bank Shops shut doors as Zimbabwe financial crisis deepens Meghan's sister seeking to reconcile denied entry at Kensington Palace Sign up to receive our weekly edition of Business Report in your inbox.

Bob,Diamond,['http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-5109065/ALEX-BRUMMER-end-game-nears-RBS.html'],b'700',"['By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 16:51 EDT, 22 November 2017 | Updated: 16:51 EDT, 22 November 2017 11 View comments How remarkable that almost a decade after the financial crisis the Government still holds a 71 per cent stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland. Cowardice by Chancellors, afraid of the political fall-out if shares were sold at a loss, has left the taxpayer ever poorer. The cost of bailing out RBS is far beyond the initial injection of £45.8billion by Gordon Brown’s government. The longer the bank has been held on the Government books the higher the financing costs, now put at £12.1billion, have become. Money pit: The cost of bailing out RBS is far beyond the initial injection of £45.8bn by Gordon Brown’s government Even worse has been the political shadow of state ownership. The Government has suffered the slings and arrows of disgraceful bonus payments made to top executives and investment bankers. It also has rightly shared blame for the Global Restructuring Group fiasco which is far from over. The over-enthusiastic way in which GRG put many small firms into bankruptcy and grabbed assets for itself was highway robbery. This unedifying spectacle is about to enter an endgame. The Budget Red Book pledges to recommence the sale of shares in RBS in 2018-19. Chancellor Philip Hammond looks ready to absorb the red ink if necessary. This may be realpolitik more than anything else. To leave RBS in Government hands with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell outside Number 11 Downing Street would be an act of foolhardiness. Just as RBS is starting to purr again it would find itself in the hands of Left-wing extremists determined to turn it into an instrument of the state. I have long taken the view that RBS should have been restructured and initial tranches of shares sold, even at a loss. That would have been a small price to pay for running down the financing costs and restoring a genuine free market in the shares. The whole episode tells us why public ownership of substantial commercial assets ends up as messy as a bread and butter pudding. Brydon plot Last time the Bank of England directly interfered in governance at a City firm was when Mervyn King summoned chairman Marcus Agius and senior non-executive Mike Rake of Barclays in July 2012 and ordered the sacking of chief executive Bob Diamond over Libor rigging. The suggestion by dissident shareholder TCI that the Bank or Financial Conduct Authority step into the row at the London Stock Exchange is therefore not without precedent. The LSE sits at the heart of the City and its derivatives-clearing arm LCH Clearnet handles trillions of dollars of transactions each week. Indeed, regulatory risk was among the reasons why the burghers of Frankfurt were reluctant to support the Deutsche Boerse merger with the LSE. The pitifully slow response of the LSE to the assault on its chairman and board, and the decision to dispense with the services of chief executive Xavier Rolet clearly involve systemic risk. Letting the clock slowly tick towards a circular and an extraordinary general meeting ought not to be an option. The LSE reportedly has lined up its finance boss David Warren as a temporary replacement for Rolet. It should not be difficult to parachute in an alternative chairman, such as non-executive David Nish, to replace Donald Brydon. When the chairman of the Stock Exchange has to scare up a round-robin letter to the FT from friends to defend his position, you know he has lost the plot. Among those defending Brydon is Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail. She seems to forget that her company’s privatisation, led by Brydon, was botched and criticised by the National Audit Office. The City authorities need to give Brydon and Rolet marching orders, to end one of the ugliest City battles of recent times. Housing hero Credit must go to the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid for forcing the hand of the Chancellor on Britain’s housing crisis. Philip Hammond has been deeply sceptical of any reforms that might incur the wrath of Tory voters fearful of development in their own backyards which might destroy rural views, strain resources and potentially hurt values. The Government looks to have taken Javid’s proposals for building close to suburban transport hubs to heart. The measures may fall short of his bid for a £50billion housing fund but have set the cause on a much better trajectory. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

Bob,Diamond,['http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-bitcoin-invest-rally-price-20171129-story.html'],b'698',"['The underlying technology securing bitcoin is known as the blockchain. (Nov. 29, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) The underlying technology securing bitcoin is known as the blockchain. (Nov. 29, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Bitcoin surpassed $10,000 and $11,000 — both records — in the same day, taking this year\'s price surge to 11-fold as buyers shrugged off increased warnings that the largest digital currency is an asset bubble. By mid-afternoon, however, all those gains were wiped out before the cryptocurrency recovered, pushing its price once again to more than $10,000. The euphoria is bringing to the mainstream what was once considered the provenance of computer developers, futurists and libertarians seeking to create an alternative to central bank-controlled monetary systems. While the actual volume of transactions conducted in cryptocurrencies is relatively small, the optimism surrounding the technology continues to drive it to new highs. Bitcoin has risen by about 70 percent since October alone, after developers agreed to cancel a technology update that threatened to split the digital currency. Even as analysts disagree on whether the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is truly an asset, its $178 billion value already exceeds that of about 95 percent of the S&P 500 Index members and is driving the debate about where financial technology is headed. Before you buy bitcoin, read this » ""It feels frothy, of course,"" said Bob Diamond, chief executive officer of Atlas Merchant Capital, said in a Bloomberg television interview with Francine Lacqua. ""I think the issue here is the disruptive nature of technology"" for banks. ""Whether it\'s the application of blockchain, or their core processing, or delivery to customers or clients, financial services today is being disrupted by technology."" The rising profile of digital currencies even saw bitcoin feature in the Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday for Federal Reserve chairman nominee Jerome Powell, who\'s a current board member. Answering a senator\'s question, he said that ""cryptocurrencies are something we monitor very carefully,"" and that at some point their volumes ""could matter"" for monetary policy, though not today. ""It really is a validation of the fact there\'s real enthusiasm, real value and maybe a use case for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" said Arthur Hayes, co-founder and chief executive officer with BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency derivatives venue. ""It\'s the start of broader attention and adoption by the investing public."" There\'s no agreed authority for the price of bitcoin, and quotes can vary significantly across exchanges. In Zimbabwe, where there\'s a lack of confidence in the local financial system, the cryptocurrency has traded at a persistent premium over $10,000. Volumes are also difficult to assess. Bloomberg publishes a price that draws on several large bitcoin trading venues. It was at $10,900, up 9.6 percent, as of 12:34 p.m. London time. Why investors should be wary of bitcoin » From Wall Street executives to venture capitalists, observers have been weighing in, with some more skeptical than others as bitcoin\'s rise has grown steeper, sweeping along individual investors. The number of accounts at Coinbase, one of the largest platforms for trading bitcoin and rival ethereum, has almost tripled to 13 million in the past year, according to Bespoke Investment Group. In a move toward mainstream investing, CME Group Inc. has said it plans to start offering futures contracts for bitcoin, which could begin trading in December. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, was weighing last week whether to help clients bet on bitcoin via the proposed futures contracts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. ""This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes,"" hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz said at a cryptocurrency conference Tuesday in New York. Novogratz, who\'s says he began investing in bitcoin when it was at $90, is starting a $500 million fund because of the potential for the technology to eventually transform financial markets. The total market cap of digital currencies now sits north of $330 billion, according to data on Coinmarketcap.com\'s website. For Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online trading firm Swissquote Bank, bitcoin\'s surge harks back to the surprises of the U.K. referendum on European Union membership and President Donald Trump\'s election. ""We have underestimated the populist movements,"" he said. ""There is growing unease on how central banks and governments are managing fiat currencies. Ordinary people globally understand why a decentralized asset is the ultimate safe haven."" Bloomberg\'s Francine Lacqua and Dave Liedtka contributed.

That fact that Labour’s former chancellor Lord (Alistair) Darling has a seat on Morgan Stanley’s board (worth $383,333 in shares and pay in 2016) shows how far Labour has moved since the Blair and Brown years. Corbyn also highlighted the pay of Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman: £21.5m. Except it’s not, it’s $21.2m. We don’t have dollar-pound parity yet. Someone who might help to bring that about, Corbyn’s sidekick, John McDonnell, was chewing the fat with BlueBay Asset Management in Westminster… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most.

He has been a limited practice participant during the shortened week, which put him behind the expected schedule of preparing at ""full speed"" on Tuesday. Questionable health and a pair of games below 20 yards makes him a fringe TE1 at best if active. Engram appears to be poised to play this week, but in his first game back from a knee injury, he is a boom / bust TE2 this week. Engram is nearing a return and will immediately be a TE1, which isn\'t saying much considering the depressingly-thin status of the position overall. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com', ""If you sit close to your TV, you may want to get your eye protection on because the Falcons/Bucs game is going to produce plenty of fireworks. Winston has been announced as the starter and he couldn't ask for a better game to walk into. The Falcons defense has now lost safety Keanu Neal, linebacker Deion Jones, safety Ricardo Allen for the season and were then left without stud defensive tackle Grady Jarrett last week. It's a mess. It's also whey they've allowed at least 37 points to each of their last three opponents. We don't know if Garrett will return for this game, but it seems unlikely. The Falcons defense has allowed exactly three passing touchdowns in each of their last four games and the Bucs will come into the dome having two weeks to prepare. Winston was arguably the best quarterback in the preseason and now having more weapons than ever, he needs to be started as a rock-solid QB1. He's both cash-game and tournament viable. Winston returns to the starting lineup just in time to face the Falcons, who have allowed the fourth-most fantasy points per game to opposing passers. Tampa Bay shouldn't alter its pass-heavy plan that worked with Ryan Fitzpatrick under center, so he's Week 6's top QB streamer. Atlanta is 30th against fantasy quarterbacks and they have given up 43, 37 and 43 points in their last 3 games. Winston should be a QB1 coming off his bye week. It might be tough to buy in on Winston completely in his first start of the season, but the Falcons pass defense coupled with the Bucs even worse pass defense means he'll need to throw the ball a ton and he has some good weapons. Jameis wasn't all that impressive in the one half of football we saw from him, but he should be excellent moving forward with all of Tampa's weapons. What's more, is that he is a perfect streamer in a week where QB streamers are surprisingly difficult to come by. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com"", 'There are currently no notes for this player. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com']",,,,,,1

Thirteen years later, Harris has two books, an app, and a podcast to show for his meditation journey—and a much happier mindset. In his new book, Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics, Harris\' main goal is to get people meditating, no matter how out of reach it seems. In his extensive research, he\'s encountered one obstacle over and over again: a tendency for people to believe that their exercise method of choice—whether it\'s yoga, running, spin, the list goes on—counts as meditation. While there\'s no question that exercise is incredible for mental health, Harris finds that often people believe they don\'t have to meditate because they already exercise. ""Anything can be meditative as long as you\'re paying attention. But when you\'re in a class with the music blaring and the people screaming, it\'s hard to pay attention. It\'s a wonderful thing for your head and your body, but I don\'t think of it as meditative."" You can, however, turn your workout into a meditation—you just have to create the right conditions. ""Running or yoga can be mindfulness meditation if you do it in a specific way: as in you\'re fully paying attention, you\'re not listening to a podcast, you\'re not listening to music, you\'re not planning some invective you\'re going to hurl at your boss. If that\'s the case, it\'s fully a meditation. People mistake it because they find that running makes them feel better and calms them down, and all that is true. I run, and I\'m hugely pro-exercise, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s mindfulness meditation. It\'s a formal distinction."" What began as a 30-minute daily meditation practice has turned into a daily practice that\'s a whopping two hours long. And while that may seem intimidating, Harris doesn\'t think it\'s necessary for everyone—it\'s just something he personally feels excited about. ""I\'ve been doing that level for two-and-a-half years now. I wanted to see if I could do it, but it\'s also driven by the fact that I wanted to see what it\'s like,"" he explains. ""I hesitate to talk about it because people will hear that and say well there\'s no way I can do that. But here\'s the thing: Some people start to exercise and do a few minutes a day, other try to be triathlete. I\'m sort of trying to be a triathlete of meditation."" And if meditating for two hours a day is something you do want to try, you can always break it up. ""I spread it out throughout the day. I took the cab ride here and it was 22 minutes—and by the end of the day it needs to be 120 minutes,"" he says. ""And if I don\'t get there, I make it up the next day. Like yesterday I did three hours, because I was on a plane."" While Harris isn\'t sure upping his meditation has made him significantly happier than when he was doing just 30 minutes a day, he has noticed some other improvements. ""I\'m better at meditation than I was,"" he says. ""I sometimes sit for an hour-and-a-half per day, and my ability to stay focused has gone up,"" he says. ""Once in a while I actually feel really good in meditation. It used to suck from start to finish. I think the 10 percent happiness boost I get from meditation in general compounds annually, and your baseline happiness goes up, and you get better at enduring blows."" And where he once dreaded sitting in meditation, he finds that now that sinking feeling is nothing more than a thought. ""When you make that mental note, you can watch the thought end, and that\'s so empowering, because you see it in the rest of your life and you\'re not owned by it.""

Yet there's tantalizing upside against a Falcons defense that has yielded the fifth-most fantasy points per game to opposing wideouts. They've yielded at least one 100-yard pass-catcher in each of the last four games and 10 touchdowns exclusively to receivers in five games. He's a strong candidate to add his name to both lists. The Falcons are just 28th against fantasy wide receivers, Evans is a WR1 coming off his bye in a great matchup. Evans had been playing great with Ryan Fitzpatrick at the helm and after a bye week and then a great upcoming matchup, he should be ready to keep up the high-quality work. No. 2 WR in FAN PTS (half PPR) gets a soft landing in transition back to QB Winston with 6th-easiest schedule at WR (Weeks 6-8) coming out of his bye week © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com"", ""Injury-Based Fantasy Advice - START The Great Touchdown Drought has expanded to 10 games. Jones hasn't found the end zone since scoring twice with 253 yards against the Buccaneers last year. Their NFL-worst passing defense is even weaker for this rematch, so this is a prime spot for him to go bonkers. Even if the dubious streak continues, he's a strong bet to eclipse triple-digit yards against a team that has watched six pass-catchers reach that barometer in four games. Jones goes against a Tampa Bay secondary that is 31st against fantasy wide receivers. If Jones does not score a touchdown this week in this matchup, you have to wonder if a touchdown is in the cards. Jones is in a terrific matchup with the Buccaneers and should have no trouble putting up numbers. He's had success getting into the end zone against this team in the past and this would be a great spot for him to break out of his touchdown funk. Averaging robust 112.8 receiving yards, but still allergic to the end zone - scoreless in past 10 regular-season games (has 969 receiving yards in that span!) © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com"", ""Sanu has become impossible to ignore with WR19, 26, and 12 outputs over the last three weeks. He has converted 23 targets-just four fewer than Julio Jones-into two touchdowns during that stretch. No team has allowed more passing yards (358) or touchdowns (3.25) per game than Tampa Bay, so Matt Ryan should throw enough to satisfy all of his receivers in a massive shootout. One perceived as a boring placeholder, the overlooked wideout is a viable WR3 this weekend. Since the Falcons defense went down the tubes, Sanu has been a stud. Over the last three weeks, he's totaled 23 targets that have amounted to 14 receptions for 220 yards and two touchdowns. This isn't too crazy to those who examined the numbers last season, as Sanu posted 10 games with at least 10.5 PPR points, which was the average number of points it took to finish as a WR3 in 2017. There were just 11 wide receivers who did it more often than him. Sure, Ridley was going to cap his numbers, but knowing the pass attempts are on the rise, Sanu should continue to be a weekly consideration. Most don't realize he has more targets than Ridley through five games. His matchup against M.J. Stewart this week is a great one, as he's been targeted once every four snaps in coverage, which leads all slot cornerbacks. Why would he be targeted so often? Because he allows 2.61 yards per covered snap, which ranks as second-most among slot cornerbacks. The matchup is great, so consider Sanu as a WR3 this week, but one who should have a really solid floor. Sanu has been useful all season once again and is actually leading Calvin Ridley thus far in target share. The Falcons' offense appears to be capable of supporting three WRs so feel free to pick him up and plug him into your flex spot most weeks. © Copyright 2010-2018 FantasyPros.com""]",,,,,,1

After nearly 20 years at the helm of Central Maine Power Co., Sara Burns announced Thursday that she plans to retire at the end of the year. Burns has been with the energy company for 30 years, starting in 1987 as manager of risk management. She was promoted to president in 1998 and was named CEO in 2005. Sara Burns, President & CEO of Central Maine Power Image from YouTube video “We thank Sara for her strong leadership of CMP,” said Bob Kump, CEO of Avangrid Networks Inc., CMP’s parent company, in a news release. “She is recognized as a civic leader in Maine and a respected professional throughout the energy industry.” Business leaders in Maine described Burns as an effective business leader who has improved the lives of Mainers and helped boost the state’s economy. Maine State Chamber of Commerce President Dana Connors said Burns has excelled in her role as leader of a high-visibility company that provides essential services to residents and businesses. “During her term, she handled that with a high level of dignity and commitment,” Connors said. “I have great admiration for the way she managed with confidence as well as commitment to the people she served.” Burns also will step down from her oversight role for asset management and planning, business development and regulatory strategy at Avangrid Networks, according to the release. However, she will continue to provide strategic guidance to the company as a member of its board of directors starting in January. Burns led CMP through multiple ownership changes, first to Energy East in 2000, then to Iberdrola in 2008 and finally to Avangrid last year. She also oversaw the company’s massive, five-year, $1.4 billion Maine Power Reliability Program. The project, which began in the summer of 2010, involved clearing 290 miles of right of way and stringing 450 miles of transmission lines from Eliot to Orrington. She had just become chief operating officer in 1998 when the Ice Storm of ’98 struck, when 340,000 customers lost power in the depths of a frigid January. Most recently, she led CMP through its largest storm-related outage in the utility’s history, during which more than 400,000 customers lost power. Speaking at the state chamber’s recent annual meeting in Augusta, Burns said there were 15 towns in Maine where at least 90 percent of the residents lost electricity. She noted that across the state, local businesses stepped up to assist CMP line crews as they worked to restore power. “More than 250 restaurants fed us. More than 125 hotels put us up,” Burns said. “Without you, we could not have gotten this done.” Burns has been an active civic leader in Maine as a member of the board of directors for Colby College, her alma mater. She is also a member of the board of directors of The Mitchell Institute and the Augusta Board of Trade, as well as chair of the board of directors of Maine & Co., a business development organization. Maine & Co. President and CEO Peter DelGreco said Burns has been an “incredible mentor and guiding hand” at his organization, which helps attract businesses to Maine. DelGreco said Burns was often called upon to speak with out-of-state CEOs, leader to leader, to share personal stories about the quality of Maine’s workers and the benefits of running a company in the state. “You can see the physical, positive reactions from people who hear her stories,” he said. “Her contributions are almost incalculable. You just couldn’t ask for a better leader.” Send questions/comments to the editors.

During her tenure as CEO, she oversaw CMP\'s successful $1.4 billion Maine Power Reliability Program, a five-year upgrade completed under budget and ahead of schedule in 2015 that was the largest construction project in Maine\'s history and the most extensive bulk power project ever undertaken in New England. She was honored by Mainebiz as its 2013 Business Leader of the Year for large businesses, largely on the strength of the company\'s utility more than $500 million investment made in that project at its midway point since 2012 — supporting between 2,700 and 3,000 direct jobs and up to 900 indirect jobs, with as many as 275 Maine companies being involved in the project in some fashion. This summer, CMP submitted several proposals in response to Massachusetts\' RFP for 1,200 megawatts of clean energy, including a new transmission line between Maine and Quebec that the company says could provide $150 million in annual electricity cost savings for Massachusetts ratepayers by tapping the hydropower resources of Hydro-Quebec. Burns told Mainebiz in a Q&A interview published in October that if CMP\'s bid is successful, it is projected to save $40 million per year for Maine in annual electricity cost savings to ratepayers over the 20-year forecast period (2023-42). Winning projects are expected to be selected in January 2018.

The first time Jack-Kaspar Burzell-Knoble saw ""The Nutcracker,"" he knew he wanted to learn to dance. His goal? Perform in the beloved holiday ballet himself. ""I was mesmerized by it,"" Jack-Kaspar said of his first exposure to ""The Nutcracker,"" a performance by the InMotion Performing Arts Studio at the North Kitsap Auditorium. ""I wanted to dance."" Jack-Kaspar Burzell-Knoble (Photo: Contributed photo) Jack-Kaspar\'s parents, Bainbridge Islanders Felicia Burzell and Jim Knoble, immediately enrolled their 8-year-old in classes at InMotion (along with younger sister Karolina). First chance he got, he auditioned for their ""Nutcracker"" production, and performed in the 2015 and 2016 editions. The process repeated itself when he got an eyeful of the mother of all Northwest ""Nutcrackers,"" the one presented by Pacific Northwest Ballet each holiday season since 1983. He auditioned for and earned a place in PNB\'s school program, and subsequently landed a role in this year\'s ""Nutcracker,"" which runs through Dec. 28 at Seattle\'s McCaw Hall. He plays a party boy in Act 1. ""It\'s really amazing,"" said Jack-Kaspar, a fifth-grader at Sakai Middle School who turned 11 last week. ""I feel really proud of myself, and honored to be a part of it."" Jack-Kaspar\'s dance ability must be on a par with his vocabulary (remember ""mesmerized?"") for him to have come so far in just two years of dance. ""I really credit InMotion,"" said Felicia Burzell-Knoble. ""He had really good teachers there, especially Sara Burns Milov and Roxanne Foster, who were his main teachers."" For PNB, Jack-Kaspar has commuted to class four days a week starting in September. His schedule intensified when ""Nutcracker"" rehearsals started in October. ""I miss class every Saturday because I have shows,"" he said. The children in the show are played by two alternating groups, meaning he performs in every other weeknight show and once every day that there are both afternoon and evening shows. ""He loves it, and takes it really seriously,"" his mom said, noting that his dance career always has featured a commute — west to InMotion, and now east to Seattle. She said he was mixing in commitment to the Bainbridge Swim Club, but eventually had to give that up to concentrate on dance. Jack-Kaspar said he hopes this year\'s ""Nutcracker"" experience isn\'t a one-time thing. ""I would like to come back,"" he said. ""If I ever got to be a professional dancer, I\'d like to come back and dance as a (PNB) company member."" He\'s certainly off to a good start.

Does that mean impeachment is around the corner? It depends on whether Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, turns out to be another James McCord or another Scooter Libby. McCord was one of the Watergate burglars, whose testimony — offered in exchange for a lighter sentence — implicated senior White House officials in a conspiracy to spy on the Democratic National Committee and, subsequently, to obstruct the investigation into their criminal conduct. His cooperation materially advanced the inquiry into the Watergate scandal, which led ultimately to President Richard Nixon’s resignation in disgrace. Libby was an assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney, and he was convicted of lying to the FBI in connection with its investigation into the “outing” of Valerie Plame as a covert operative for the CIA. At the time, it was thought that Libby might somehow implicate the vice president or even the president in wrongful activity that might lead to impeachment or resignation. In fact, Libby’s conviction led nowhere. No one was ever charged with disclosing Plame’s covert status. [Collins says Trump transition team wrong to reach out to Russia over sanctions] The case that Flynn’s conviction may, like McCord’s, lead to the president’s prosecution or impeachment goes like this: Flynn lied about two conversations with the Russian ambassador that took place in the waning days of the Obama administration. In general, there is nothing unusual about communications between foreign officials and senior members of a president-elect’s transition team. But Flynn was not simply getting acquainted with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. He was trying to influence Russian policy, possibly at the direction of Trump himself. In one case, Flynn was asking the Russians not to retaliate too harshly in response to American sanctions, instituted by President Barack Obama, to punish the Russians for their election meddling. In the other, he unsuccessfully sought Russian help to defeat a U.N. Security Council resolution regarding Israeli settlements that the Obama administration wanted to see passed. In both cases, Flynn — and possibly Trump himself — was violating the Logan Act, a two-centuries’ old ban on the conduct of U.S. foreign policy by private citizens. Administration critics will argue further that Trump obstructed justice when he fired FBI Director James Comey, preventing him from investigating Flynn and other administration officials. Moreover, if Trump or anyone on his team actually conspired with the Russians, either to hack the Democratic National Committee computer system or to sway the election in some other way, Flynn may know about it, and his guilty plea to this relatively minor charge may be a sign that he is about to start implicating the president in a conspiracy to steal the election. In that case, impeachment would indeed be imminent. [Michael Flynn is key to the Russia scandal — and he may have just flipped on Trump] On the other hand, Flynn may turn out to be Trump’s Scooter Libby. In the whole history of our republic, no one has ever been convicted of violating the Logan Act, which is widely thought to be an unconstitutional dead letter. And though it is unseemly for an incoming president-elect to seek to thwart the foreign policy of his lame-duck predecessor, it is not unprecedented. And if you are appalled by the Trump team’s behavior, ask yourself this: will you be equally willing to condemn President-elect Kamala Harris for starting to undo Trump’s foreign policy, beginning on Nov. 4, 2020? As to the possible obstruction of justice charge stemming from the firing of Comey, this has always been about the politics of impeachment rather than the black letter of the law. The president plainly has the constitutional authority to fire the FBI director, for any reason or none at all. It cannot be illegal for the president to exercise his constitutionally-granted powers. On this view, Flynn is just like Libby: convicted for lying to the FBI in the course of an investigation that leads to no substantive charges at all. Who will Flynn turn out to be — McCord or Libby? That depends on whether candidate Trump really was Nixon or just a blustering reality TV star with a gift for attracting attention and driving his opponents to madness.

Randy,Papadellis,['http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/Ocean-Spray-Commits-10-Million-to-Researching-the-Cranberry-s-Health-Benefits-1008006120'],b'655',"['LAKEVILLE-MIDDLEBORO, Mass., Nov. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Â It\'s amazing what a little cran can doâ\x84¢, and for close to 90 years, Ocean Spray Cranberries has been unlocking the cranberry\'s unique health benefits through research and product development. This week the grower-owned cooperative announced that it will invest Â more than $10 million over the next five years to research the cranberry\'s antimicrobial benefits, including the role it might play in helping to combat one of the greatest challenges to public health today: antimicrobial resistance (AMR).In addition to its research commitment, Ocean Spray will launch the Ocean Spray Cranberry Health Institute in 2018. ""Ocean Spray is dedicated to finding ways to use cranberries to not only keep you healthy but also to potentially address global health issues,"" said Randy Papadellis, president and chief executive officer of Ocean Spray. ""With antibiotic resistance on track to kill more people than cancer, the World Health Organization has called on government sectors and society to take action on this serious threat to global public health. We want to be sure that Ocean Spray does our part to look at all the components of this one-of-a-kind fruit and how it can contribute to whole-body health."" Through comprehensive health research, Ocean Spray has long ensured that it delivers products that taste good and are good for you. Its Cranberry +healthâ\x84¢ juice drink product formula, for example, has been clinically proven to reduce recurrent symptomatic UTIs. It contains the highest concentration of cranberry compounds available among Ocean SprayÂ® juice products on the market. Besides helping consumers meet their recommended daily intake of fruit, cranberries may reduce the occurrence of certain infections in the urinary tract and stomach, as more than 50 years of well-documented research has shown. This is increasingly important, as scientists around the world explore alternative strategies to antibiotics, including nutritional approaches to prevent infections. ""One of the best ways to avoid antibiotic use is by preventing the infections that are no longer responding consistently to them,"" says Dr. Jennifer Berman, an author, educator and urological surgeon. ""Research shows that a glass of cranberry juice daily can reduce symptomatic urinary tract infections. This is simple but powerful information. On its own, it may be a useful strategy to decrease the worldwide use of antibiotics. But with Ocean Spray\'s announcement today, the company has signaled its intent to wring out every last drop of goodness from these berries."" The bacteria that causes many common infections is growing increasingly resistant to the strongest antibiotics used to treat them, which means UTIs could become deadly in the coming decades. Experts estimate that AMR will be to blame for 10 million deaths globally by 2050. By comparison, that is more than the 8.2 million individuals who die of cancer each year, according to the Review on Antibiotic Resistance 2014.To combat the problem, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established a goal to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use by 50 percent in the next three years. To rapidly advance antibiotic stewardship education and training, the Ocean SprayÂ® Cranberry Health Institute has formed partnerships with several expert third-party organizations, including the National Association of Directors of Nursing Administration (NADONA). As one of the initiatives of the NADONA partnership, the Institute will provide a new annual award recognizing the most progressive antibiotic stewardship program nationally and an antibiotic stewardship leader nominated by their facility. ""Antimicrobial resistance is the biggest public health crisis facing us globally,"" said Hudson Garrett, EVP and chief clinical officer, NADONA. ""For example, E. coli, the cause of many UTIs, is proving extremely resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, the most commonly prescribed treatment. Identifying near-term solutions requires dedicated public-private partnerships like the new Cranberry Health Institute."" To help the Ocean SprayÂ® Cranberry Health Institute best understand the important role cranberries can play in preventing disease and supporting health, research is already underway with a collaboration between the Broad Institute, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and Washington University\'s Center for Women\'s Infectious Disease Research.

DeCosta earned The Carl E. Nelson Sports Achievement Award for achievement in the athletic world. Boulos was honored with the C Club Person of the Year Award, presented annually to a member (or members) of the Colby family, not necessarily alumni, who have shown dedication and support to Colby athletics by their service to the College and particularly to athletics. Joe Boulos ’68 Eric DeCosta ’93 “The C Club did a tremendous job selecting this year’s award recipients,” said Jake Olkkola, Colby’s Harold Alfond Director of Athletics. DeCosta is the assistant general manager of the NFL’s Baltimore Ravens and a former Colby football player. DeCosta, fresh off the Ravens taking a 40-0 victory over the Miami Dolphins, flew to Maine with his family. He met with Colby’s coaching staff and then spoke with Colby’s football team. “Eric is one of the top minds in the NFL,” Olkkola said. “His commitment to his family, community, and profession made him an excellent choice for this year’s Carl E. Nelson Athletic Achievement Award.” Former Colby football coach Tom Austin, DeCosta’s head coach during his playing days with the Mules, was in attendance at the dinner. DeCosta also did the coin flip before Colby’s game with Bates College on Saturday, Oct. 28. DeCosta played linebacker for the Mules, was co-captain his senior year, and was selected as the Millett Award recipient for top male athlete during his four years at Colby. DeCosta started with an entry level position with the Ravens in 1996 and quickly moved up the ranks as an area scout, director of scouting, and director of player personnel. DeCosta has turned down offers for general manager interviews to remain with the Ravens and is expected to take over from current general manager Ozzie Newsome when he retires. Boulos is not only a graduate, but one of the most loyal supporters of the College. He is a life trustee and a former chair of Colby’s Board of Trustees. Boulos and his wife, Sheri, recently committed $10 million – the largest gift in their history – for the College’s new athletics complex, which is slated to open in 2020. “For Joe to be selected as the C Club Person of the Year was a perfect fit,” Olkkola said. “The Boulos family’s passion and commitment to Colby and Colby athletics has been truly remarkable.” Raised in Portland and South Portland, and well known in Maine’s business community, Boulos was a U.S. Marine pilot in Vietnam before founding CBRE | Boulos Brokerage, Asset Management and Boulos Development in 1975. He now oversees the strategic direction of the management company. Over his career, Boulos has developed and built more than 2.5 million square feet of commercial property in the Portland area. Boulos became a Colby overseer in 1991. He joined the Board of Trustees two years later and served as chair from 2005 to 2009, during which time the College conducted a $376-million campaign—the largest in Maine history when it surpassed its goal in 2010. The Bouloses’ generous support of the College has been marked by support of the existing Boulos Family Fitness Center as well as the Harold Alfond Stadium and the Colby College Museum of Art. They have contributed significantly to financial aid at Colby and beyond. They created the Boulos Family Scholarship program that has, to date, funded 310 Maine veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 with scholarships of $10,000 each. 1988 Carl Nelson 1989 Tom Whidden ’70 1990 Jan Volk ’68 1991 Curt Gowdy, Jr. ’75 1992 John Winkin 1993 Ronald Ryan ’62 1994 Eugene Hunter ’48 1995 John Simpson 1996 Jack Kelley 1997 Lee Williams 1998 Charles Holt 1999 Maureen Pine ’84, Carol Simon ’85, Carol Anne Beach ’88, Jen Holsten ’90, Katharine Cowperthewait ’91, Sura DuBow ’92 2000 Stephen Freyer ’68 2001 Elmer C.

Erika,Nardini,['https://digiday.com/media/262911/'],b'652',"[""ESPN might not be ready for the Barstool Sports’ brand, but Barstool is ready for backyard brawling. The Chernin Group-owned digital publisher has acquired the Rough N Rowdy Brawl, a local amateur boxing competition in West Virginia, with plans to launch a new live event and pay-per-view business that will span more than a dozen competitions every year. Barstool executives declined to disclose the financial terms for the deal, under which Barstool is forming a new business division called Barstool Brawl. Led by Rough N Rowdy Brawl founder Chris Smith, who is joining Barstool Sports as president of Barstool Brawl, Barstool Sports plans to produce more than 12 live boxing tournaments per year. In addition to selling tickets to these events, which will still be produced under the Rough N Rowdy title, Barstool will also produce a live pay-per-view broadcast of each one, which will stream on the publisher’s website. The decision to buy the Rough N Rowdy Brawl comes after Barstool found some success getting its audience to pay for a streaming pay-per-view the publisher produced of a tournament earlier this year. In March, Barstool produced a four-hour broadcast of the first night of the two-night boxing tournament, during which one of its employees fought a local prizefighter. Barstool was able to get 12,500 people to spend $5 on the broadcast, which was produced with only a handful of Barstool Sports staffers, including founder Dave Portnoy. “After doing the PPV, which we had never done before, I wanted to buy [the Rough N Rowdy Brawl] the second I came back,” said Portnoy. “It’s a perfect match for our crowd, and it resonated with them instantly.” Barstool has total ownership over the content and experience, Portnoy said. That’s appealing to the publisher, which — while it’s no stranger to controversy — recently saw its late-night talk show with ESPN canceled after one episode. Barstool Brawl has about 30 staffers underneath Smith, including event production, promotion and administrative staff. The number will vary slightly based on the venue and event, said Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini. Barstool Sports itself will oversee the pay-per-view video production of each event. It plans to send about three or four producers to each event to set up the live pay-per-view broadcast and produce behind-the-scenes material leading up to the event. These promotional videos will take the form of fighter profiles and other pieces meant to hype up grudges and other storylines leading up to a fight, Portnoy said. Barstool personalities will also be on hand for commentary during the pay-per-view broadcasts. Subscribe for an exclusive, inside look at what’s actually happening in the video industry delivered to your inbox weekly. All of the content will live on Barstool’s website, with the promotional material also being distributed across the publisher’s social channels. Barstool anticipates multiple ways for it to make money from Barstool Brawl events. In addition to those who shell out money for the PPV broadcast, the events themselves will be ticketed. Barstool will also sell merchandise, which Nardini has previously said accounts for more than a third of the company’s revenues. And whenever “it makes sense,” the company will look to bring in ad sponsors for the tournaments, said Nardini. “We have a very loyal and rabid fan base that supports everything we do, and events like this are ways for us to connect directly with our consumers,” Portnoy said. “We’re doing something just for our audience — there are no outside influences. So there’s nothing someone who doesn’t like us can complain about and nothing that can interfere with what we do. It puts us in a strong place where we can control our own fate.” Image via Barstool Sports Join Digiday+ and get Digiday magazine with your membership.

News Scaleups News on the UK's fastest growing startup businesses Industrial Strategy Theresa May's strategy to boost productivity of UK businesses Northern Powerhouse Coverage of the devolution of economic power to the North Inward Investment Examining foreign investment into the UK Resources Published by Correspondent Rebecca Wayman on 09 Nov 2017 Used vehicle database, Cazana.com has received investment totaling £1.75m to continue its rapid growth trajectory, with some major industry names backing the business. Robert Diamond, former managing director of the RAC, has become a key adviser to Cazana - together with Andy Homer - the former CEO of Aviva and AXA. Further investment has been secured from Origin Capital and Passion Capital, which was set up by the same investor who is behind the innovative mobile-only bank Monzo. Cazana is advised by American venture capitalist Eileen Burbidge MBE. Tom Wood, CEO of Cazana, commented: “The investment we have secured demonstrates the value that Cazana’s database provides both to the motor trade, and to consumers looking to purchase a used car. “Since our launch in 2013, we have grown at a rapid rate, and this investment will enable us to help more businesses understand vehicles better and continue to improve our platform for consumers.” This significant support comes following a successful trade visit to the US, during which Cazana’s vehicle data, machine learning and AI were demonstrated to the motor trade. Its global vehicle database has been proven to help companies reduce the financial risk of working with vehicles and the business is receiving a high number of enquiries from businesses looking to reduce the risk of working with used vehicles. The business is continuing to expand into the US following this investment, and has its sights set on key European countries too. The announcement marks a major step forward for Cazana, which was founded in 2013 by automotive fan Tom Wood, after he wanted to gain a better understanding of classic car prices using big data. Since then the business has grown exponentially, and is currently the largest car search and indexing engine for used cars on sale in the UK, with more than 600,000 cars listed for sale on the website, and records of all 37m vehicles on the road. The investment follows the announcement of respected industry figure Rupert Pontin taking the role of Head of Valuations at Cazana. © 2018 Bdaily Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bob,Diamond,['https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/300751/deutsche-bank-culture'],b'647',"['by Sarah Butcher 10 November 2017 Once upon a time, under Bob Diamond, Barclays was known for a policy of excluding jerks from getting jobs at the bank. Through a process of exhaustive interviewing, anyone with disagreeable personality traits was identified and directed to the rejection pile. This might be why Barclays is sometimes known as a comparatively pleasant place to work for even now. Under Anshu Jain and his predecessors, however, Deutsche Bank appears to adopted the opposite tack. In a long article about Deutsche\'s origins and the situation in which it currently finds itself, the Financial Times says that in the 1990s and 2000s Deutsche set out to employ people who wanted to make money, no matter what. “Deutsche always hired mercenaries into the investment bank,” one former senior executive tells the FT, “They didn’t care about ethics.” Nor did it help that Deutsche historically encouraged internal politicking by often placing two people into the same role and pitching them against one another, or that Edson Mitchell, founder of the investment bank, had ""Wild West attitudes"" to risk taking, or that Deutsche\'s U.S. business was built on the acquisition of Banker\'s Trust, which came with its own set of nefarious goings-on after staff there were caught shifting dormant customer money into the bank’s own accounts. This, suggests the FT, is both the bank and the set of bankers that current CEO John Cryan has inherited at Deutsche. While Cryan himself is ""dry-witted,"" ""plain-speaking,"" ""cultured"" and ""parsimonious"", legacy Deutsche staff - especially those who\'ve worked for the bank for over a decade, are likely to be the exact opposite. It\'s Cryan\'s job to get these leopards to change their spots. Good luck to him. Mitchell\'s ethos was that, ""If you don\'t have $100m by the time you\'re 40, you\'re a failure."" With that attitude baked into the DNA of Deutsche\'s investment bank, Cryan faces an uphill task. Separately, spare a thought for anyone married to a (male) banker. Following claims two years ago that bankers were awarding ""wife bonuses"", Quartz has a piece by a sociologist who\'s spoken to wealthy women, many of whom are married to men who work in finance. These women complain about negative perceptions and the supposition that they\'re undeserving. Many have college degrees and feel they\'re wasting their talents. Their husbands hold all the money and all the power and they\'re forced to conceal their use of paid childcare. One, who used to be a banker herself, says: ""“[I’m] well-educated. I had a career. You know, where is all that now?...There are power dynamics, where he’s the breadwinner now, and I’m really not. And yet, I do so many things for the family that you can’t put a number on it.” Javier Oficialdegui, a longstanding friend and colleague of Andrea Orcel, will now be running UBS\'s investment bank in EMEA.

Amy,Walter,['https://newrepublic.com/article/145747/republicans-nothing-better-something'],b'645',"['The Republican Congress has been in desperation mood for months. In April, The Cook Political Report’s Amy Walter told PBS that Republicans were already frustrated about the lack of progress on their legislative agenda. “You’re seeing Republican enthusiasm wane,” she said. “I talk to a lot of Republicans who say, ‘Man, we have the House, we have the Senate, we have the White House. We still can’t get things done.’” In early July, weeks before John McCain submarined the Senate’s attempt to repeal Obamacare, the Associated Press reported that Republicans were “desperate” to get something done. In early October, after Congress had pivoted to tax reform, Politico reported that donors were fed up. “I’m sick and tired of nothing happening,” one said. On Tuesday, New York Republican Chris Collins made it clear who was driving the bus: “My donors are basically saying, ‘Get it done or don’t call me again.’” This week, voters delivered a staggering rebuke of President Donald Trump and the congressional GOP, handing Democrats the governorship and a string of state legislature seats in Virginia, as well as the governorship in New Jersey. Democrats are hoping for a tidal wave in the 2018 midterms. Trump is blaming this tsunami on Republican candidates failing to embrace him. (In fact, the opposite is likely true.) Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to blame their stalled legislative agenda. Hours after Democrat Ralph Northam routed Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia, Politico reported that Ohio Senator Rob Portman was spinning the current crisis as an opportunity. Portman told conservative groups that the “results give Republicans even more of a reason to get results and get tax reform done.” Speaking to Fox News Radio’s Brian Kilmeade, Speaker Paul Ryan sang a similar tune. “The way I see it, honestly, is we’ve got to get our job done,” Ryan said. “That’s why I think tax reform is just so important, not just politically but just for the country.” This conventional wisdom is not new. In March, Trump and Ryan warned Republicans that they would face a “bloodbath” in 2018 if they didn’t start passing legislation. This may help explain why the bills to repeal Obamacare and overhaul the tax code have been so shoddy and incoherent. Republicans are rushing, privileging political concerns over policy goals. But Portman and Ryan are also reading the results in Virginia the wrong way. Passing tax reform may give them an achievement to tout on the campaign trail, and it may even win over a disaffected Republican or two. But the results in Virginia suggest that Republicans are damned if they do pass tax reform and damned if they don’t. While Tuesday’s results have accurately been interpreted as reflecting the depths of Trump’s unpopularity, they also suggest that the GOP’s donor-focused legislation, which benefits the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else, is just as unpopular. According to exit polls, four in ten Virginia voters listed health care as their most important issue—these voters supported the Democratic candidate by 55 percentage points. That’s certainly a rebuke of Trump, who repeatedly pushed Congress to take up bills that would kick millions off their health insurance. But it’s also a rebuke of the Republican Congress that has tried to pass these bills. More broadly speaking, it was a rejection of the kinds of bills that Republicans like: bills that are “mean,” to use the president’s language, and too skewed toward the rich. The House’s tax reform bill is the ne plus ultra of this kind of legislation. A new nonpartisan study reports that a quarter of all taxpayers will see a tax increase by 2027, but not the rich. This only makes the GOP’s problems more pronounced, since the bill is centered around a gigantic (and unnecessary) corporate tax cut and a series of tax breaks for the wealthy. The Senate version, which is expected to be unveiled on Thursday, reportedly will not eliminate the estate tax entirely, but it will limit its reach and wipe out deductions for upper middle class taxpayers in liberal states like New York. It’s possible that Republicans believed that they could create a kind of (un)virtuous circle, in which they pass bills that benefit their donors, who in turn pump money into campaign advertising focused on divisive social and cultural issues. In Virginia, Ed Gillespie’s campaign was a test case of this strategy: In embracing race-baiting Trumpian issues like Confederate monuments and immigration, he tried to find a Goldilocks zone between an unpopular president and the xenophobic appeals that got the president elected. But on Election Day, it flopped: Democrats were energized and, even though six in ten voters thought Confederate monuments shouldn’t be removed, they apparently cared a lot more about health care. In a different climate, Republicans could go back to the drawing board and rework the bill to lower the tax burden across the board, instead of pushing through a one percent–friendly bill for the sake of disgruntled donors. But an element of panic seems to be setting in: Republicans are operating under the delusion that if they can just pass something, anything, their fortunes will improve. Still, no matter how many times they try to spin it as a “middle class tax cut,” the bill is a giant corporate giveaway at the expense of a quarter of the country. It isn’t exactly the stuff campaign ads are made of. Doing nothing isn’t a great alternative. The election in Virginia showed not just an energized Democratic base but a demoralized Republican base. Achieving nothing despite controlling both the legislature and the presidency would be a humiliating failure, and it would likely lead to many Republicans staying home in 2018. But passing a bad tax reform bill would only further horrify Democrats, as well as those few voters who occupy the middle. Yes, Trump remains the biggest drag on Republicans heading into 2018. But it shouldn’t be overlooked just how much they’ve screwed themselves. Alex Shephard is a staff writer at The New Republic.']",0.0,18.0,1.5,0.0,1023578.0,1

While President Trump began the week with a trip to Asia to establish regional consensus on issues such as trade and North Korea, an immediate crisis had transpired back home: a mass shooting in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 and injuring more than 20. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, tax reform was front-and-center. Pressure is mounting on Senate and House Republicans to score a legislative win for the party before next year\'s midterm elections. But on their signature issue of tax cuts, Republicans have found themselves with major differences between House and Senate proposals. Democrats racked-up victories in a number of state-wide elections that have some Republicans worried about 2018. New developments emerged about Trump officials, including White House adviser Stephen Miller, campaign adviser Carter Page and long-time Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller. Page, Schiller and reportedly Miller have all been called in for questioning by investigators. Late in the week, sexual-misconduct allegations were made against Judge Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for the Alabama Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Despite calls from his party for Moore to drop out, the candidate denied the accusations and remains in the race. This Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will talk with ""Face the Nation"" host John Dickerson about the White House strategy to get tax reform passed. Will there be a tax cut for the middle class and how do Republicans respond to charges that its plan gives too many benefits to the very rich? And what are Mnuchin\'s thoughts on CBO projections that the plan eventually adds to the deficit? Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who labeled tax reform ""the issue of our time,"" will join the program in an exclusive interview to offer his point of view. He\'ll also weigh-in on the Democratic Party\'s trajectory heading into 2018. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, will also appear exclusively to discuss taxes as well as lessons his party can learn from their defeat in the Virginia governor\'s contest. To take the country\'s temperature on the one-year anniversary of Trump\'s election win, ""Face the Nation"" headed to Manchester, New Hampshire, a politically-complex city for a focus group. There, John Dickerson talked to Trump voters to learn where the President has lived-up to expectations – and where he has come up short.

Among the latest US economic data out this week are the NFIB small business optimism index and producer price index, due Tuesday; consumer price index, retail sales, Empire State manufacturing survey, Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations, and business inventories, due Wednesday; weekly jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, import and export prices, industrial production, and housing market index, due Thursday; housing starts, e-commerce retail sales, and Kansas City Fed manufacturing index, due Friday. Tuesday\'s reports on inflation and retail sales will be closely watched. ""We believe another strong retail sales report is in the cards for October,"" according to a TD Economics note. ""The August-September hurricanes that propped up spending in September, specifically for autos, grocery stores and restaurants, and building materials, have scope for a sustained tailwind into October. New vehicle sales should be only a modest drag."" Wall Street\'s slow but steady ascent to record highs stalled last week as investors worried about US tax reform proposals. For the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.5 percent, the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index declined 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index also fell 0.2 percent. ""The uncertainty over the tax reform weighs on the market, but technically the market was prone for a pause as investor sentiment has been very optimistic for quite some time,"" Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W Baird, told Bloomberg. ""I wouldn\'t expect a major surprise to the downside as long as the interest rates in the long end of the curve behave."" Today, General Electric Chief Executive John Flannery is expected to announce a cost-cutting plan in a bid to bolster profits. Shares of General Electric closed 2.5 percent stronger on Friday in New York after Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that the company is laying off sales staff and other employees in its software division. The 125-year-old conglomerate is considering job reductions across all of its businesses, the sources said, according to Reuters. It is not clear how many more jobs Flannery now plans to cut, or how quickly, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, investors will also closely watch any further progress towards a consensus between OPEC and other key oil producers ahead of a November 30 meeting, where they are expected to extend an agreement on output cuts to help ease the global glut. ""Market participants expect OPEC to extend the production cuts beyond March 2018 and stocks to decline further,"" commodities analysts at Commerzbank wrote in a note to clients Friday, according to Bloomberg. ""That said, the reduction of stocks should be sluggish even if the agreement to cut production is extended. What\'s more, the higher price level should lead to a further rise in US shale oil production. Oil is already much too expensive even if the latest developments in Saudi Arabia justify a certain risk premium on the oil price."" On Friday, Brent slipped but held above US$63 a barrel. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished Friday with a 0.4 decline from the previous day\'s close. (BusinessDesk).']",0.0,11.0,2.75,0.0,1017703.0,1

PBS NewsHour PBS NewsHour Watch Next GOP candidate Roy Moore faces new allegations, new pressure to quit Senate race Prominent Republicans have called for Roy Moore to abandon his Senate run as another woman comes forward to say he assaulted her as a teen. Can the Alabama candidate weather these accusations of wrongdoing? Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR join Judy Woodruff to discuss this latest GOP rift. Judy Woodruff: And back here in Washington, we're joined by our Politics Monday team, Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR. Welcome to you both. So, Tamara, we just heard from Alabama, what people are saying down there. What are you hearing here in Washington about this, this new accuser, a woman who came forward today in New York, is from Alabama, but also the senators? Tamara Keith: Yes, so this was — this was different. You know, the past allegations came in a newspaper article. This is live on television video of an accuser who is deeply emotionally distraught and offering very specific details about this event that happened 40 years ago. And, almost immediately, the reaction from senators was prompt. And you have Cory Gardner, who is the head of the NRSC, who is responsible for getting Republicans elected in 2018, saying that Roy Moore should step aside, and, if he doesn't, expulsion is the direction they would go, trying to expel him from the Senate. And that seems to be the way it's going. There are a lot of different scenarios that have been gamed out in Washington in recent days. But it seems like Republican senators are starting to consolidate behind that idea. And just moments ago, reporting from the hallways of Capitol Hill, I'm seeing that Luther Strange is out giving interviews. He's the current Republican senator from Alabama, temporarily, saying that he thinks a write-in candidacy is unlikely at this time. Judy Woodruff: And that is what we were hearing, Amy, from Don Dailey in Birmingham, saying that was what the word is there. It sounds like senators, the Republicans in Washington, now expect that Roy Moore could very well win this race. Amy Walter: Absolutely. Republicans have almost a no-win situation here with Roy Moore. If he wins, they have then the reality in front of them, as Tam pointed out, that many of these senators now calling for his expulsion, or at least one of the most prominent senators there, Senator Cory Gardner, saying, we will expel him from the United States Senate. If he loses, then, of course, they are now down to an only one-seat majority. They're trying to pass tax reform, which then would be the barest margin, if they don't pass it by the middle of December. And so this would put so many things in jeopardy. But, as I said, regardless, whether he wins or loses, Republicans are in a very, very difficult place. Judy Woodruff: What kind of territory are we in, Tam, when we are talking about expelling a senator who has just been elected? Do we know yet how that works? Tamara Keith: Yeah, potentially reversing the will of the voters. Judy Woodruff: Exactly. Tamara Keith: There is a process for it. And the reason that these Republican senators are even contemplating this is because this isn't just about Alabama. This isn't just about 2017. This is about 2018 and 2020. And if they were to have a fellow senator who is accused of these very serious things serving side by side with them, it would become a campaign issue in every single campaign. Judy Woodruff: So, it may be — it may be that he flies, is acceptable in Alabama, Amy, but their concern is about what this looks like for the rest of the country. Amy Walter: Absolutely. And I think you are already going to see that Democrats are going to try to attach Republican candidates and Republican incumbents to Roy Moore. They're already asking incumbents and candidates to come out publicly and say what their opinion is of Roy Moore. And so he will become in many ways sort of a poster child for the Republican Party, that is — if you are Republicans, you are worried that you are going to see this person and what he has done in campaign ads all through 2018, even if you have come out and said, I would like to see him gone. Judy Woodruff: Talk about a split Republican Party. Amy Walter: Yes. And this is a bigger challenge, I think, if you just sort of step back for a minute, which is what — the difference between what we are hearing from Alabama in the report you just had before us and what you are hearing in Washington. This has been sort of a constant under the Trump era of the divide in the Republican Party between the so-called establishment here in Washington and Republicans on the ground. The other person that is helping on the ground, of course, is Steve Bannon and Breitbart News, who are encouraging Roy Moore to stay in this race, that are discrediting the women, are trying to find ways… Judy Woodruff: Far-right extremist news site. Amy Walter: Yes. Trying to find ways to discredit the women, discredit The Washington Post. There was a time, Judy, when if a national news organization came in and uncovered serious crimes about a candidate, that would be taken very, very seriously. Now, because it came from The Washington Post, it is discredited. Same with Washington itself. There was a time when a United States senator saying it's time for to you step down would mean they would step down. Judy Woodruff: Would be the kiss of death. Amy Walter: Absolutely. That matters zero. And so it's more than just this race, Judy. It goes to show that, whether he comes here or not, there is a new world order that is coming to the way that we do politics. And it is going to reverberate far beyond this race. Judy Woodruff: Well, while all this has been going on, Tam, this has sucked a lot of oxygen out of the room, but there is this tax reform plan the Republicans are trying to get done. There is a House version. There's a Senate version. What does it look like right now? Tamara Keith: And just to talk about briefly how much oxygen has been sucked out, Mitch McConnell was in Kentucky doing an event about tax reform, when he got asked about Roy Moore and ended up making news about Roy Moore, and no one is talking about taxes. Judy Woodruff: Nobody even knows what he said. Well… Tamara Keith: Well, somebody must know. But that didn't make the news tonight. So , the House is expected this week to pass their tax bill, and — with Republican votes alone, obviously — and the Senate is working its way through it. They're marking it up. It is in committee. They — at the moment the House and Senate are on schedule with this very aggressive schedule. But there are a lot of things to work out between now and actually having something that could get to the president's desk. Judy Woodruff: A lot of things to work out, Amy, but a lot of pressure on Republicans to get this done. Amy Walter: A lot of pressure. When I talk to Republicans, they say, look, this bill may not be the greatest thing in the world, but if we don't pass it, we are doomed, because we will have completed an entire term with a Republican House and Senate and White House and have absolutely nothing to show for it. It would be a disaster. So, they're willing to take the risk on a bill that right now, at best, Judy, is polling in the mediocre territory. Voters are pretty ambivalent about it. They would rather take the chance with that than take a chance of not having anything to talk about in 2018. It's a very difficult place that they're sitting in right now. Judy Woodruff: And we're looking at that as we get ready for Thanksgiving. And we will talk about that next week. Amy Walter: Next week, exactly. Judy Woodruff: Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, Politics Monday, thank you. Tamara Keith: You're welcome. Amy Walter: You're welcome.

In all of those states, progressives celebrated election victories last week, and deservedly so. The wins were important. But do you know what else those states have in common? Hillary Clinton won them last fall, and her coalition obviously wasn’t large enough to win the White House. The more that I dug into last week’s election results, the less impressive I thought they were for the Democrats. Again, Democrats had a good night — better than many people expected. But they also made relatively little progress peeling away Trump supporters. To win big next year — to win back the House of Representatives or the Senate and to win back control of more state governments — Democrats will probably need to do better. In my column today, I lay out the evidence, as well as some thoughts about how Democrats can win more white working-class votes. Alabama Senate race. The Republican Party has a big Roy Moore problem. Either the detailed, credible accusations of child molestation against Moore may cost Republicans an otherwise easy Senate victory in Alabama next month — or Moore could win and become a national symbol of the party. And it’s not clear that party leaders can push Moore out of the race, even if they started trying harder to do so. Why does the party currently look so weak? Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report argues that Republicans are suffering from a combination of institutional weakness and voters’ strong partisanship. Party leaders once would have found a way to push out a candidate like Moore, she said yesterday, on CBS. But they no longer have the power they once did. Meanwhile, party labels are more powerful than they once were. As a result, many Republican voters will “stick with their party even though the party leaders are abandoning the person who represents the party,” Walter said. Media-criticism misfire. “Many other explosive stories about sexual assault that are well-sourced have fallen apart,” said The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway on Fox News this weekend. Hemingway was trying to cast doubt on The Washington Post’s original story about Moore’s behavior and she called the paper “part of the resistance” to President Trump’s agenda. As an example of a discredited assault story, Hemingway cited a 2014 Rolling Stone story about an alleged fraternity rape at the University of Virginia. The media, she claimed, “reflexively accepted this story, and it turned out that it was completely misreported.” She is right that the Rolling Stone piece was misreported; you can read the magazine’s retraction here. But she is wrong that the rest of the media reflexively accepted the story. The most important follow-up reporting on the U.Va. story — reporting that helped show that the alleged victim’s claims didn’t add up — came from a publication called The Washington Post. In The Times. “Mitch McConnell and other Senate leaders have the constitutional authority to prevent Mr. Moore from actually serving if he is elected,” argues Ronald Krotoszynski, a University of Alabama law professor. “The real question is whether the party’s leadership is prepared to use this authority.” You can join me on Twitter (@DLeonhardt) and Facebook.

Rosengren said he believes rates should rise because the unemployment rate is likely to drop below 4%. Any unemployment rate below 4.7% is likely to increase pressures on inflation and asset prices, he added, in a speech at Northeastern University. Market participants think a December rate hike is a foregone conclusion, putting the odds of a quarter-percentage point hike at 96.7%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The Boston Fed president has become one of the more vocal hawks on the central bank. He will not be a voter until 2019. The Fed is facing a dilemma, Rosengren said. On the one hand, current low levels of consumer inflation would most often justify more stimulative monetary policy. At the same time, the current unemployment rate of 4.1% might suggest the need for tighter policy. Read: Core CPI picks up in October, giving green light to Fed hike Rosengren said he believes low inflation is likely a temporary problem, while the low unemployment rate is likely to persist. Other indicators including jobless claims and the flow of sidelined workers moving to employment seem consistent with labor markets “being quite tight,” he said. At the same time, forecasts of Fed officials imply that low inflation is likely to be “short-lived,” he said. This justifies a “balanced approach” of continued gradual rate hikes to reach a level of the federal-funds rate closer to its longer-run value,” Rosengren said.

All Rights Reserved.', '3 Min Read NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Thursday, rebounding from a more than three-week low in the previous session, after the U.S. House of Representatives passed their version of the tax overhaul bill. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.13 percent to 93.933. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a broad package of tax cuts affecting businesses, individuals and families on Thursday, moving Republicans and President Donald Trump an important step closer to the biggest tax code overhaul in a generation. “The tax plan isn’t a foregone conclusion but it passed the lowest hurdle in the House,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “The even higher hurdle is to have something pass in the Senate. The reconciliation will be the real measure if it happens,” he said. The dollar index, which hit 93.813 on Wednesday, its lowest since Oct. 20, was also boosted by a general improvement in risk appetite across financial markets. “Some of the selling pressure on the dollar seems to have abated a little bit. We are seeing a slightly less negative mood in global financial markets,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Investors tentatively returned to stock markets around the world looking for bargains on Thursday. “We are also seeing some of the steam come out of the euro’s rally,” Esiner said. The common currency had soared this week after data showed the German economy shifted into a higher gear in the third quarter, but gave up some gains after Wednesday’s upbeat data on underlying inflation in the United States. “All things being equal, the news that we saw this week does little to change the broader outlook for the U.S. Federal Reserve to far outpace the European Central Bank in policy normalization for the foreseeable future,” Esiner said. “The outlook for the Fed should continue to keep the dollar’s pullbacks relatively short-lived.” The euro was 0.23 percent lower at $1.1764. The Canadian dollar strengthened against its U.S. counterpart as data showing a surprise rise in domestic manufacturing sales in September offset lower oil prices. The greenback rose 0.55 percent against the Swiss franc after the Swiss National Bank signalled that it remained committed to its ultra-loose monetary policy.

Sandy,Buck,['http://www.colby.edu/news/2017/11/10/carlson-named-new-buck-lab-director/'],b'619',"['November 10, 2017 Gail Carlson speaks at a Buck Lab celebration Oct. 19. Gail Carlson, assistant professor of environmental studies, brings her long involvement in civic engagement and policymaking to bear in her new role of inaugural director of Colby’s Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change. The Buck Lab, established through a gift from Trustee Sandy Buck ’78 and Sissy Buck, will connect students from many disciplines to organizations in Maine and beyond that are focused on global environmental issues. Students will conduct research on Maine’s coast, lakes, and forests, working closely with faculty to understand changes to complex systems and the far-flung effects of those changes. “As the Buck Lab director, I am excited to do my part to share with Colby students the enthusiasm and generosity of Sandy and Sissy Buck and their commitment to environmental protection and stewardship,” Carlson said. “The Buck Lab is creating transformative experiences for students from all disciplines to explore and help solve some of our most critical environmental challenges.” The former associate director of the Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and instructor in the Oak Institute for Human Rights has long incorporated community projects into her courses on environmental health issues. In 2015 her students focused on the public health impacts of arsenic, a common drinking water contaminant in Maine, and held a public hearing in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, to raise awareness and help distribute critical health information and water testing kits. This month, Carlson won the 2017 Science Champion Award from the Environmental Health Strategy Center. Actively engaged in public policy debates on environmental issues in Maine, Carlson has testified at key committee hearings of the Maine Legislature and was “especially impressive as the clear winner of a debate at a committee briefing on the health impacts of flame retardants, gaining the trust and respect of legislators on both sides of the aisle,” according to a press release from the center. “I’d like to think that not only did I have science on my side, but also common sense,” Carlson said. Already a leader in environmental education and institutional sustainability, Colby is home to one of the oldest environmental studies programs in the nation, was the first institution of its kind to declare carbon neutrality, in 2013, and has invested in partnerships to create unique opportunities for its students. The Buck Lab will connect students and faculty from the natural sciences, social sciences, interdisciplinary studies, and humanities around multifaceted environmental issues. Students may focus, for example, on public policy implications, economic factors, or global concerns. A recent grant from the Mellon Foundation for an environmental humanities program at Colby will dovetail with the Buck Lab to create a stronger presence for students pursuing arts and humanities disciplines to connect their work to environmental sustainability issues.

These are the topics that come up repeatedly when you ask senior traders, risk managers and regulators about their hopes and fears. Over the next two weeks, as part of our 30th-anniversary coverage, Risk.net will publish 10 interviews with bigwigs from the worlds of risk management, trading, market infrastructure and regulation, starting today with George Athanasopoulos of UBS – the Swiss bank’s global head of foreign exchange, rates and credit (FRC). Other interviews include Jerome Powell, governor of the Federal Reserve Board and newly nominated successor to Fed chair, Janet Yellen; Ashley Bacon, chief risk officer at JP Morgan; and Eileen Murray, co-chief executive at Bridgewater Associates. A full list of interviewees can be found at the end of this article. They come from diverse backgrounds, organisations and countries – a Chinese securities house, a US clearing house, an Australian bank, a Danish pension fund – but common threads emerge. Today, UBS’s Athanasopoulos imagines a near future in which volatility surges higher and money floods out of bullish strategies and products. In this environment, to absorb the move, the market would need active fund managers and liquidity providers with the capacity to take risk. He worries these participants will be in short supply. “I think so much money has left active investments – and also the risk capacity from banks has declined at such a pace – I’m not sure the bid will be there in the size the market will require for the fall to be shallow,” he says. JP Morgan’s Bacon shares these concerns. He theorises that markets may in future veer between two extremes: “Perhaps we end up in a bimodal situation where in good times things are especially stable and less volatile, and in bad times they may be far more unpredictable and volatile than we have seen in the past. We haven’t experienced so much of the latter in recent years, but I do have a concern that when it inevitably comes, markets may be thinner and more volatile than we used to experience.” Like Athanasopoulos, he says the current fashion for volatility selling could amplify this next break. Trend-following and short-term self-fulfilment is nothing new, he notes, but he agrees it “could be a bit more pronounced now than it was in the last cycle”. Nick Silitch, chief risk officer at the biggest US life insurer, Prudential Financial, argues post-crisis reform has focused on trying to make individual institutions more resilient and has failed to grasp the dangers of systemic market risk – potentially, even magnifying them. “If Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns had gone under as a result of an idiosyncratic event, it wouldn’t have affected the rest of the world. The fact Citi and Wachovia were going to have to take writedowns on the same assets that caused Lehman and Bear to be so deeply wounded is what made it a systemic event. The linkage for all the firms is markets,” he says. The strength of the markets has been sapped by the retreat of well-capitalised banks, Silitch argues. Nature abhors a vacuum, of course, and so do markets – a pullback by international banks should have created an opportunity for big regional and domestic banks to step up. Some have done so, only to find the gaps left by the big dealers are not worth filling under the new capital regime. Following an all-out assault on regional markets, Australia’s ANZ was left unbalanced – in 2015, its Asian and institutional business was consuming more than half its group capital, forcing it into its own retreat. Client numbers have been cut from a peak of around 27,000 to roughly 8,000 today. But the Australian bank is still expanding selectively. In Shanghai, for example, the institutional business now employs 40 people, having almost doubled in size over the past two years. As ANZ and other institutions look at China’s expanding, liberalising markets, Chinese institutions are looking outwards – take Haitong International Securities as an example. The firm’s chief executive, Lin Yong, notes Chinese securities houses now regularly top capital markets league tables in Hong Kong, and predicts further expansion geographically and by product set. Haitong already has equity research teams in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo, as well as an India presence thanks to its acquisition of Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento. The plan is to expand from research into investment and trading. But these are largely cash and light derivatives businesses, so who will fill the role once played by dealers in exotics? Denmark’s PKA is already doing so – part of a small but growing cohort of investors that has been helping dealers hedge and recycle risks they can no longer warehouse – but it’s an opportunistic player, not one the market can necessarily depend on. “Historically, these opportunistic derivatives trades have been very profitable for PKA, so hopefully we will see the exposure growing, but it is solely a function of the attractiveness of these trades,” says Michael Nellemann Pedersen, chief investment officer at the fund in Hellerup. This story – loosely, about changes in liquidity and market behaviour – is one of the bogeymen of the post-crisis period. Firms will only know whether they were right to worry when and if the low-volatility blanket finally lifts. But there are newer ideas in the Risk30 interviews as well – many of them springing from the application of new technologies. At Nex – the tech-focused firm broken out of Icap this year by its founder and chief executive, Michael Spencer – the venture capital unit has until now been focused on opportunities that are close to home, but it is now being prompted by Spencer to look at crypto-currencies. “A huge number of new currencies have launched – it has the feel of a huge bubble – but nevertheless I believe this world is here to stay, it does solve some problems in terms of the very efficient transfer of title [and] efficient transactions,” Spencer says. UBS is experimenting with its FRC central risk book – auto-hedging client trades with products that are cheap and reasonably well-correlated. Hedging costs are lower; basis risks somewhat higher. ANZ has added 20 data scientists to its institutional business during 2017, and one of their early insights has been to reveal new information about the behaviour of foreign exchange markets before and after certain economic data is released. JP Morgan’s risk function has also been exploring the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with Bacon seeing applications in anomaly and trend detection, as well as natural language processing. What does this mean for risk managers? “The risk manager of the future will be someone who knows how to deploy these techniques to the maximum benefit. That’s a mindset and skillset change that will occur – starting now and increasingly so over the next three to five years,” says Bacon.

Robert,Gelbard,['http://www.scmp.com/article/345745/closed-gas-fields-put-exxon-under-pressure'],b'616',"[""Comments: The unprecedented shutdown of Exxon Mobil's gas fields in Aceh shows no sign of ending in the near future despite a massive security operation in the rebellious Sumatran province. The prolonged closure adds yet another problem to the welter of economic difficulties facing President Abdurrahman Wahid's embattled government, including a sagging exchange rate, ballooning budget deficit, stifling interest rates and slowing growth. An Exxon Mobil Indonesia spokesman said yesterday that the United States oil and gas giant's local unit was assessing the situation daily, hoping for 'an early and safe resumption'. Exxon's stance on what it calls a 'temporary shutdown' has been unchanged since the valves were turned off and full-time staff pulled out in early March as the security situation deteriorated. However, industry insiders in Jakarta said the longer the fields were non-operational, the greater the complexity and cost Exxon Mobil would face when its staff did go in to restart work. For the government, the closure not only adds to the country's already poor image with international investors, but could drive long-term customers away from gas contracts. Head of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, Bill Fanagan, told a business audience recently that with competition for liquified natural gas (LNG) on the rise, the country could ill-afford the Aceh disruption. 'The exceptional reputation that Indonesia has built over the last 25 or more years as the pre-eminent supplier of LNG to the world, has been tarnished,' Mr Fanagan told the audience. Aceh, a staunchly Islamic province in Sumatra's far north, is home to one of Indonesia's longest-running insurgencies. Although separatist rebels from the Free Aceh Movement, known as GAM, have long targeted foreign businesses, their activities failed to make much of an impact - until now. This year's apparent escalation of GAM activities and subsequent Exxon Mobil shutdown prompted the government to agree to a vastly increased military role. Exxon Mobil is Indonesia's second-largest producer of LNG, with total output of 1.6 billion cubic feet a day. Its main Aceh customers - Korea Gas and Japan's Tohoku Electric Power - have been forced to seek alternative supplies. The protracted dispute has also drawn in the direct involvement of the US ambassador in Jakarta, Robert Gelbard. He recently visited Aceh and reportedly met with GAM commanders. While not confirming that a face-to-face meeting took place, the Exxon Mobil official did say that US diplomatic staff had been supportive of the group's bid to resume production.""]",0.0,9.0,0.42857142857142855,0.0,1011198.0,1

Yet variable transaction fees increased only 1.9%, to $65.9 million, as MarketAxess\' average transaction fee per million declined 5.5% to $190. All other revenue increased 18% to $10.4 million, mostly because of higher information services revenue and investment income. In all, MarketAxess\' total revenue rose 7.1% year over year to $96.7 million. Growth in total expenses, however, outpaced revenue growth, rising 12.7% to $49.5 million. Expenses were driven higher primarily by higher employee compensation, consulting, and technology costs. In turn, MarketAxess\' pre-tax income increased only 1.9% to $47.2 million, as pre-tax margin fell to 48.8% from 51.3% in the prior-year period. All told, net income, boosted by a lower effective tax rate, jumped 10.4% to $34.1 million, and earnings per share grew 9.8% to $0.90. ""Revenue and profitability held up well in the third quarter in spite of the continued low-volatility and low-yield environment,"" Chairman and CEO Richard McVey said in a press release. MarketAxess\' cash generation remains strong, to the tune of $96 million in free cash flow so far in 2017. The company also possesses a fortress-like balance sheet, including $376.2 million in cash and investments as of the end of the third quarter. Together, these factors are allowing MarketAxess to invest aggressively in the expansion of its international operations.

Tom’s success as a sailor and chief executive officer and part owner of the North Technology Group has earned him induction into the National Sailing Hall of Fame. (Photo courtesy of Tom Whidden ) Fill out the form below to email this story to a friend A day on the water is a good day for Tom Whidden, and he’s had a lot of good days throughout his life. Tom is one America’s most renowned sailors, most notably for his time as a tactician with Dennis Conner when they qualified to compete for the America’s Cup trophy five times, winning it in 1980, 1987, and 1988. Tom earned induction into the America’s Cup Hall of Fame in 2004 and, just recently, the Essex resident was enshrined in the National Sailing Hall of Fame. Tom also got involved in making sails when he and a partner bought a company named Sobstad Sails in 1972, starting a long career in the marine business. Now, Tom is part owner and the chief executive officer of North Technology Group, a company that owns numerous subsidiaries who work in sail making, mast making, carbon fiber technologies, and power boats. It’s through his work as both a top-notch sailor and businessman that Tom landed his spot in the National Sailing Hall of Fame. Tom competed in one of the most famous America’s Cup regattas as a tactician on The Stars and Stripes with skipper Dennis Conner. After successfully defending the cup in 1980 and then being on the first American team to lose it in 1983, Tom was part of the 1987 America’s Cup race in Australia that was aired live by ESPN in the middle of the night and watched by millions. “It’s great. I got both sides of it being on the first team to lose it in ‘83...The one we won in Australia, it was the first time that ESPN showed sailing. They partly credit it for putting them on the map. They had three million viewers watching. That’s good viewership for 2 a.m.,” Tom says. “It put us all on the map. We came back and went to the White House and met [President Ronald Reagan]. We got a key to New York City by then-mayor [Ed Koch]. We were all well-known.” When Tom started sailing as a 10 year-old in Westport, winning the America’s Cup was hardly on his radar as he loved playing baseball, soccer, and tennis at the time. It wasn’t until he attended Colby College in Maine that Tom established goals of trying to sail in the Olympics—which he did in 1972—along with competing for the America’s Cup, and making sails for a living to finance those two dreams. It took a lot of hard work, and Tom considers himself fortunate to make a living like he does. “I’ve been lucky. The luckiest thing is I was able to make a business out of it,” says Tom. “I didn’t have to just be a professional athlete. I put a bunch of guys around me who are way smarter than I am, and they’re fantastic.” The criteria for being inducted into the National Sailing Hall of Fame goes beyond outstanding performances at the pinnacle of the sport. Tom and his fellow inductees have given back a lot to the sailing world, and that also played a heavy hand in them being selected. During Tom’s time with North Sails, the company has come to dominate the sport at the highest level. Every America’s Cup boat—both defenders and challengers—have raced using the company’s sails since 1988. Tom has learned that it takes a lot of the same qualities to lead a business as it does to be part of a successful sailing crew. In both endeavors, he’s realized that a cohesive effort from everyone is needed to succeed. “It’s shockingly similar. The discipline it takes to win at that level is same in a company,” he says. “You have to spend your money wisely. You have to use your time efficiently. You have to motivate your team...The irony is you work just as hard to have a poor result as to have a good result. It’s about how well you work. It’s what your attitude and culture is around it.” Tom has built a strong culture at North Technology Group. Chief Operating Officer Richard Lott says that Tom lives sailing and constantly influences the people around him. “He takes a day off, then goes sailing. He’s still keen on the water. He’s just turned 70, and you’d pick him at 50,” says Lott. “He’s one of the most energetic people at the company. He travels 150 days a year. He works 6 a.m. to 10 at night with a smile on his face. The reality is that he’s genuinely been involved in the business since it was really small.” Tom also enjoys introducing sailing to younger people in an effort to give back to the sport that’s given him so much. “I try to grow sailing and be supportive of the sport. I try to get more young people involved at the community level for people who wouldn’t have the money or the access,” Tom says. “I feel like I owe it a lot. I am trying to grow it and give back, absolutely.” In the end, Tom feels that he’s just someone who followed his dream at an age when he had the opportunity to do so. The advice that Tom has for everyone, especially youngsters, is to find your dream and go after it. “Young people should follow their dreams, at least for a while. When you get older, it’s harder to do that, because the pressures become bigger. It’s the time to take a chance,” says Tom, who thanks his wife Betsy, as well as his family and friends. “I got to spend a life doing something I love doing. My son is an investment banker. He introduces me to his friends saying that, ‘This is my dad, and he’s done pretty well for a guy who has a full-time summer job.’” Love Local News? Congratulations to the 2018 Beacon Award Winners!

The event, now in its fifth year, was presented by J.P. Morgan. The conference brought together leaders in finance, biotech, gaming and entertainment, health care and politics to share actionable, money-making insights with the 600-person audience. Since its inception in 2013, the event has raised $21 million. One hundred percent of ticket sales go to fight poverty in New York City. ""For 20 years J.P. Morgan has stood with Robin Hood in the fight against poverty,"" said Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management. ""Five years ago, we started the Robin Hood Investors Conference and joined forces financially so that every dollar raised can go directly to Robin Hood programs, which include some of the most effective soup kitchens, homeless shelters, schools and job training programs in New York City."" The two-day conference was organized by Robin Hood Board members Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management; Lee S. Ainslie II, founder and Managing Partner of Maverick Capital Management; Joel S. Marcus, chairman, CEO, and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc./Alexandria Venture Investments; Barry S. Sternlicht, founder, chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, as well as Daniel S. Loeb, founder and CEO of Third Point LLC. The conference\'s agenda included ""fireside chats"" featuring Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Ken Langone of Invemed Associates LLC, Paul Tudor Jones II of Tudor Investment Corp., Barry Rosenstein of JANA Partners LLC, and Elaine Chao, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. Additionally, Anthony Bozza of Lakewood Capital Management, Debra Fine of Fine Capital Partners, Rodolf Bohli of RBR Capital, Alexander Klabin of Senator Investment Group, Larry Robbins of Glenview Capital Management, Alex Sacerdote of Whale Rock Capital Management LLC, Steve Mandel of Lone Pine Capital LLC, Scott Ferguson of Sachem Head Capital Management, and Samantha Greenberg of Margate Capital Management LP presented their best investment ideas. The pinnacle of the two days was Jones\' discussion with Andrew Ross Sorkin on the 30th anniversary of the 1987 market crash. In the wake of the crash, Jones gathered a group of friends to discuss what they could do to help those who would ultimately be most impacted by the fallout. Robin Hood was born from that conversation. Today, Robin Hood helps reduce barriers to opportunity for New Yorkers by keeping families stably housed, providing emergency food, educating thousands of children and much more. ""We\'re so grateful that for more than 20 years, J.P. Morgan has been a close partner in this fight against poverty in New York City,"" said Wes Moore, CEO of Robin Hood. ""From our world-class Investors Conference to so much more, we\'ve been able to stay steadfast in the poverty fight standing shoulder-to-shoulder with J.P. Morgan.""

ENERGYbits “Shark Tank” Update 2018: Still Working on the Dream Ring’s CEO Jamie Siminoff: Facts to Know about the Entrepreneur’s Family & Wife By: Brent Chittenden - Published: November 1, 2017 at 11:39 am Photo: Jason Merritt/Getty Images Lara Spencer’s life has been an interesting story. Born in the suburb of Garden City, Long Island, she attended Pennsylvania State University on an athletic scholarship. What many Good Morning America viewers might not realize is that Spencer was once a nationally ranked competitive diver! It is in part due to her background as an athlete that she keeps in such good shape today. She completed her schooling with a degree in broadcast journalism. From there, Spencer started her career in television as a page at NBC. This was followed by a number of smaller scale jobs at stations like WDEF-TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and News 12 in Long Island, before making her way to WABC. It wasn’t too long after that Spencer got a correspondent gig with Good Morning America, which eventually resulted in her co-hosting job. In August 2016, Spencer’s athletic life caught up with her as she needed to have hip surgery to repair the damage, which kept her away from her desk for a month. Lara Spencer’s husband was a man named David Haffenreffer, He was a former CNN journalist and the two married on September 30, 2000, at St. Andrew’s Dune Church. The couple have two children: Kate and Duff. After over a decade of being together, Lara Spencer’s divorce to Haffenreffer came in June 2015. The two remain on very good terms and Haffenreffer occasionally shows up in Spencer’s Instagram. With her busy schedule and two kids, Spencer still managed to find the time to date. Who is Lara Spencer’s boyfriend? While we haven’t had an update in a while, her current boyfriend appears to be a man named Rick McVey. He is a Wall Street financier who is the Chairman and CEO of the online bond trading company, Marketaxess Holdings Inc. Guessing by his reported $13.5 million salary and bonuses last year, he does very well for himself. Before Marketaxess, McVey was the managing director of JPMorgan. We don’t know when the two began dating, but they were first spotted together on a date in New York City in January 2017, where the two cuddled up at Lure Fishbar restaurant. Since then, the couple has spent a large amount of time together with vacations to places like Nantucket and France. There are often selfies of Spencer and McVey in her Instagram account, and the two always seem to be smiling and generally look they are having a good time together.

Currently, the couple does not appear to be engaged and both lead very busy lives in their careers. But given how big the smiles are when they are photographed together, it looks like they will be together for the foreseeable future!

Peter,Lunder,['http://www.pressherald.com/2017/10/20/colby-college-launches-750-million-campaign/'],b'609',"['Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Several donors who have already made a large dent in that goal are lauded at Friday\'s ceremony. WATERVILLE — Colby College launched a $750 million fundraising campaign Friday night and announced it has already raised more than $380 million toward that goal. More than 800 Colby trustees, alumni, donors, administrators, faculty, students, Waterville city officials and others turned out at the Waterville Opera House for the announcement, which officially led the fundraising campaign into its public phase after just a year of a private leadership phase. The campaign will enable Colby to introduce transformational initiatives, build on already strong academic programs, improve access to a Colby education for deserving students from around the globe, provide new facilities that support a multidisciplinary approach to learning and connect the college to the community beyond its campus, according to college officials. Construction of a new performing arts and innovation center also will be built as part of the effort. Campaign funds will enable Colby to continue to redefine the liberal arts, offering distinctive programs to connect students to a rapidly changing world and prepare them to solve the most vexing issues of our time, Colby officials said. The campaign theme, “Dare Northward,” reflects the bold and unprecedented nature of the initiatives and priorities it will support, they said. Eric S. Rosengren, chairman of the Colby board of trustees and a 1979 Colby graduate, said Dare Northward refers not just to the current upward momentum of the college but also to its remarkable history, starting with its founders who sailed up the Kennebec River in a sloop aptly called The Hero, to charter the school in 1813. “In 1877, Colby admitted women, more than 100 years before many of our peer institutions,” Rosengren said. Rosengren said Waterville residents raised $107,000 to buy land on Mayflower Hill in 1930 for the college, as the survival of Colby was in question, financial institutions were failing and unemployment was rising. It was a daring move, according to Rosengren. Just as the country fell into the Great Depression, Colby’s leaders were willing to take a significant risk to secure the future of the college. Colby is working with civic, philanthropic and art leaders to help revitalize downtown Waterville. Colby invested $5 million to renovate the former Hains building, a historic bank building on Main Street, and is building a $25 million mixed-use development that will open in the fall of 2018 and house 200 Colby students and faculty and staff members working in civic engagement. Colby also plans to build a hotel and restaurant next year on Main Street that would serve the Waterville community and visitors. Colby’s total investment in Waterville is expected to exceed $45 million, with significant additional resources being committed by private investors, according to college officials. Colby officials Friday night announced two new major commitments to the campaign, including a gift from Colby trustee and campaign co-chairman Bill Alfond, a 1972 Colby graduate, and his wife, Joan, to name the residential and mixed-use complex that Colby is building downtown at 150 Main St. Colby President David Greene said no family has shown a greater commitment to the partnership between the city and Colby than the Alfonds, and he announced that the mixed-use residential complex will be named for Bill and Joan Alfond. “This building is the bridge that reconnects Colby and Waterville,” he said. Bill Alfond, who received a standing ovation as he arrived on stage, said he and Greene share a vision of building community, and a courageous Colby board gave authority and the budget for Greene to go ahead with that vision. Alfond said he grew up in Waterville, spent part of his professional career here and comes back because it is home. “Colby’s investment in downtown demonstrates a true commitment in shortening the distance between Mayflower Hill and Waterville,” Alfond said. “Soon there’ll be no gap.” Greene announced a naming gift from trustee Michael Gordon, a 1966 Colby graduate, for the new Colby center for arts and innovation that will include a concert hall, theater, and dance studios and serve as a creative laboratory for students and faculty members across disciplines. The announcement, and Gordon, received a standing ovation. More than 10,000 donors have contributed to the campaign so far, and Colby has received 32 contributions of $1 million or more, according to a news release the college issued in conjunction with Friday’s event. Campaign co-chairman Robert E. Diamond, a 1973 Colby graduate and former chairman of the board of trustees, said that when Greene was inaugurated three years ago, the new president said: “This is Colby’s moment. This is Colby’s time.” “Today, as we publicly launch this campaign already well on our way toward our audacious goal, we can see how right he was,” said Diamond, who received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby in 2008 and is the parent of a 2012 Colby graduate. “Colby is truly an extraordinary institution, and now, with the support of our alumni and friends, we will be able to take this great college to the next level, to the very top tier.” Major gifts to the campaign include more than $100 million to establish the Lunder Institute for American Art, which was launched this fall. The campaign commitment from Overseer Peter Lunder, a 1956 Colby graduate who received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1998, and his wife, Life Trustee Paula Crane Lunder, who also received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1998, included nearly 1,150 new works by artists including Maya Lin, Joan Mitchell, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. The Lunder commitment established Colby as the only liberal arts college with both an innovative art museum dedicated to cross-disciplinary study and a global research center for American art. The Lunders stepped onto the Opera House stage Friday night to a raucous standing ovation. “Welcome, everybody,” Peter Lunder said. “Why Colby? We love Colby.” He said that for 65 years, he and his wife have been involved in Colby and five great Colby presidents, including Greene. “We’re happy and we’ll continue to support Colby as long as we’re breathing,” he said, “and after that, we hope our family does the same. Colby has a superstar president that operates on 12 cylinders – eight isn’t enough – and to all those who have supported David and his dreams, we applaud you.” Amy Calder can be contacted at 861-9247 or at: [email protected] Send questions/comments to the editors.

Paula,Lunder,['http://colbyechonews.com/6635-2/'],b'608',"[""Each fall, studio art and art history majors have the opportunity to take a networking trip to a city of the faculty’s choice, generously endowed by Alan Mirken ’51. This year’s trip was to New York City and took place over fall break. The nine students were accompanied by three faculty members, Ankeney Weitz of the art history department, Bradley Borthwick, a professor of sculpture, and Anna Fan ’15, the Assistant for Special Projects at the Colby College Museum of Art. Socrates Sculpture Park is home to many weather-friendly art pieces such as Tanda Francis’ Take Me With You (2017) as part of their annual exhibition Art history major John Egner ’18 said, “It was an engaging and insightful trip that allowed us seniors to get a glimpse of all the possible avenues for an art world career.” New York’s bustling art economy was evident in the passionate art professionals the students met with over the four days in the city. Some highlights of the trip included a chat with Katherine Gagnon ’11, an artist and gallery director on the Upper East Side, a visit to the Noguchi Museum in Queens, a tour of Peter Soriano’s P’16 studio in Long Island City and a meeting with Maria Bowe ’15 at Christie’s auction house. Students also had the opportunity to visit the conservation lab at the Whitney Museum for American Art in Chelsea. There, students also had the chance to speak with head conservator Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, along with other members on the staff working exclusively with the Whitney’s collection to repair and preserve works of art. Mancusi-Ungaro said she actively pulls from three categories in day-to-day operations – equal parts chemistry, artistic talent and art history knowledge. This was a side of the art world that many students had never been exposed to before. Students had the added benefit of being able to step inside the Peter and Paula Lunder lab where works are physically washed, adjusted and matched for pigments. Nora Hill ’18 said of this portion of the trip, “This was definitely my favorite meeting, in large part because I’ve read a number of articles for different courses about some of the creative and theoretically challenging conservation work they’ve done there in recent years.” The students also had the chance to wander around the museum beforehand, exploring several exhibits of note such as “Calder: Hypermobility” and “An Incomplete History of Protest: Selections from The Whitney’s Collection, 1940-2017.” Another avenue that students explored were careers in art law and arts communications. They first stopped at the office of Goldman Sachs to meet with Meg Dodge ’08, Senior Vice President of Estate Services. Dodge discussed her decision to pursue law after graduating from Colby with a dual degree in Art History and Government, and how her job now perfectly embodies how she had hoped to incorporate art into her career. Directly following this meeting, the students headed back to Midtown to meet with two employees at Polskin Arts, an art communications firm representing cultural institutions such as the Colby College Museum of Art. These two intriguing yet different visits offered the students ideas of art related career paths that are outside of the box, or atypical compared to strictly museum work. Katie Ryan ’18, another art history major said of the trip: “The Mirken trip was a great experience and opened my eyes to so many different careers in the arts.” She went on to say, “All of the alumni we met with were so willing to talk with us and help us figure out our next steps after graduation.” For an “off ” day on Sunday, the students along with their professors were given a private tour of the High Line, a 1.45-mile-long park raised up above street level. The students delved deep into the park’s history as told by a fiery New York City native/tour guide. This space, formerly a railroad, had been completely reimagined in the late 1990’s to serve as an integration of nature and art. The tour guide mentioned that all the art along the High Line is curated by a single woman with weather-friendly artworks in mind – all works woven into the High Line were specifically designed to be in a garden setting. From the perspective of a studio art major, Rachel Bird ’18 said, “The Mirken trip was a lot of fun, but it was also useful in that it opened my eyes to the huge variety of career paths that are open to students with an art background. Growing up, I had thought that the only ways to have art involved in a career was to be an artist, but in this trip we met with people in professions ranging from estate lawyers to arts marketing specialists, and they all found ways to focus on art and incorporate it into their careers.” She continued, “The trip as a whole definitely helped relieve some of the post-grad ‘will I get a job’ anxiety a lot of us were feeling, and for me personally it was also inspiring to see all the different options.” The trip ended on a positive note: mingling and networking with alumni, parents and friends of the art department at Galerie Lelong. The Associate Director Liz Bower ’08, another Colby alum, offered yet another glimpse into a New York City art world position. On view was work by Lin Tianmiao’s work, a contemporary Chinese installation artist, whose embroidery work filled the space in a unique way, allowing participants to walk in and on it, interacting intimately with it. Overall this trip was an excellent opportunity to make valuable connections within the Colby-New York network, but as a residual effect, it was reassuring to many students who are becoming increasingly anxious about securing a job post-grad. Hill reflected this sentiment by noting: “For me, the most valuable aspect of the trip was the wide range of professions we encountered – I feel like we got great exposure to the many different opportunities we’ll have after graduating with a degree in art.” I want to personally thank the family of Alan Mirken who provided this wonderful opportunity, as well as Leslie Rubin and Jane Zenker, daughters of Alan Mirken who joined us for the last day of the networking trip. Without them and the guidance of our professors, this trip would not be possible.

Rocco,Landesman,['https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/nyregion/knight-landesman-artforum-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html'],b'607',"['Advertisement Supported by By Alan Feuer Knight Landesman, a longtime publisher of Artforum magazine and a power broker in the art world, resigned on Wednesday afternoon, hours after a lawsuit was filed in New York accusing him of sexually harassing at least nine women in episodes that stretched back almost a decade. In a prepared statement, the magazine’s three other publishers said that Mr. Landesman had “engaged in unacceptable behavior and caused a hostile work environment.” “We will do everything in our ability to bring our workplace in line with our editorial mission, and we will use this opportunity to transform Artforum into a place of transparency, equity, and with zero tolerance for sexual harassment of any kind,” the statement said. Mr. Landesman’s resignation was the latest shocking turn in the wave of accusations that have inundated powerful men in Hollywood, politics and the literary world in recent weeks. Earlier this month, The New York Times and The New Yorker published articles describing decades of sexual predations by the film producer Harvey Weinstein. Two weeks later, women in the California Statehouse began making public their own experiences with sexual harassment. On Tuesday, The Times published an article in which Leon Wieseltier, the former literary editor of The New Republic, admitted to committing “offenses” against his female colleagues. For decades, Mr. Landesman, 67, had been a pillar of the international art scene, a man-about-town known from the galleries of Manhattan to the Art Basel fair in Switzerland for his primary-colored suits and deep connections in the industry. The brother of the renowned Broadway producer Rocco Landesman, who once served as the head of the National Endowment for the Arts, he started at Artforum in the 1980s and until Wednesday had run the magazine with his three co-publishers, Anthony Korner, Charles Guarino and Danielle McConnell. The lawsuit that preceded his departure was filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and included accusations that he had harassed nine women, groping them, attempting to kiss them, sending them vulgar messages and, on occasion, retaliating against them when they spurned his advances. The accounts were from both former employees at the magazine and women Mr. Landesman met at art events, all of whom said he took advantage of them at “the start of their careers” when they were “economically and professionally vulnerable.” The suit also accused the owners of Artforum, one of the art world’s premier publications, of being aware of his behavior but doing little to stop it. The only named plaintiff in the suit is Amanda Schmitt, a New York curator who started working at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21. Shortly after Ms. Schmitt took the job, the suit contended, Mr. Landesman “singled her out for unwelcome sexual attention,” subjecting her to questions about her sex life while “touching her, uninvited, on her hips, shoulders, buttocks, hands and neck.” Ms. Schmitt left Artforum in August 2012, but two weeks later, after she had started a new job in sales, Mr. Landesman sent her an email, reviewed by The Times, in which he praised “brown nosing” as a sales technique before veering off into a different — and sexually explicit — description of the practice. Not long after, Mr. Landesman invited Ms. Schmitt to tea, ostensibly to discuss her career, and grabbed her by the shoulders, trying to kiss her, the suit said. It also cited another incident in which Mr. Landesman is said to have told Ms. Schmitt that she needed to be “more open to physical contact to succeed” and demonstrated by running his finger down her body. In December 2012, while both were attending Art Basel Miami, Mr. Landesman barraged Ms. Schmitt with text messages asking that she meet him alone and kiss him for “three seconds,” the suit claimed. When Ms. Schmitt refused, Mr. Landesman sent an email saying: “Give yourself to me! ALL of you = to all of me.” Although Ms. Schmitt tried to cut off contact, Mr. Landesman continued sending notes, asking if she was making herself “climax” and was “ready to make it a bit physical.” Over the next two years, when he saw Ms. Schmitt at art events, the suit said, he would often whisper to her about masturbation and spanking, and touch her without consent. In May 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with Mr. Landesman, pleading with him to stop. But according to the suit, he responded by reaching his shoeless foot out to caress her. The following month, Ms. Schmitt sent him a text message saying: “You have been sexually harassing me since 2012 and continue to do so. I want it to stop.” Mr. Landesman wrote back promising “professionalism in the future,” but then asked if they could “get on the same page,” adding, “I’d like to be an ally.” On June 15, 2016, Ms. Schmitt met with two of Artforum’s other publishers, Ms. McConnell and Mr. Guarino, showing them some of the messages Mr. Landesman had sent. That same day, Mr. Guarino sent Ms. Schmitt an email promising “he was taking action to insure that whatever may have transpired never happens again.” But according to the suit, Mr. Landesman continued sending messages, and Artforum stopped inviting Ms. Schmitt to its events. Then in May, the suit said, Mr. Landesman accosted Ms. Schmitt at a restaurant while she was eating with her romantic partner and an art critic. Sitting at the table uninvited, Mr. Landesman claimed that Ms. Schmitt had “unfairly accused” him of harassment and demanded she discuss it with him in front of her guests, the suit contended. Ms. Schmitt walked off, but then returned and “listed for Landesman his many acts of harassment.” Three months ago, Ms. Schmitt’s lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, sent Artforum a letter detailing those acts as well as the accounts of other women who claim Mr. Landesman harassed them. The letter demanded that the harassment stop and that Artforum pay Ms. Schmitt’s legal and therapy bills. Negotiations broke down last week, Ms. Reisbaum said, partly because Artforum demanded that Ms. Schmitt not speak to the media. Her lawsuit includes the other women’s accounts, although none of them joined it as plaintiffs. While their stories suggest a pattern of harassment, it remains unclear if they can be considered as corroborating evidence since some of the accusers never worked for Mr. Landesman. One of them, Elisabeth McAvoy, did work at Artforum — on and off from 2010 to 2013 — and described how Mr. Landesman often subjected her to “unwanted touching.” Ms. McAvoy, who was in her 20s then and shared a bedroom with her sister, said that Mr. Landesman once encouraged her to get her own apartment so that her sister could masturbate herself to sleep. Jordana Zeldin, a former Manhattan gallery owner, met Mr. Landesman at an art opening in 2012 and said that when he saw her boyfriend giving her a back rub, he began to pressure her for back rubs in a series of emails over the next several weeks. When Ms. Zeldin finally put her foot down, Mr. Landesman sent her an email saying she should ask for forgiveness. “How about a small apology,” the email said. “‘Knight I feel a little guilty that somehow I may have lead you on into thinking I’d give you a great backrub.” Valerie Werder, who worked in a gallery, said that Mr. Landesman groped her after introducing her to one of her favorite art writers at an industry gala last year. Another gallery worker, Alissa McKendrick, said he did the same to her at the Whitney Biennial in 2012. In an interview this week, Ms. Schmitt said that she never wanted to sue, but that she did so not just to protect herself, but also “the countless young men and women starting out in the art world.” “I had no power and no voice then,” she said. “I don’t feel that way anymore.” Advertisement']",0.0,4.0,0.4444444444444444,0.0,1013073.0,1

James,Forese,['http://theenterpriseleader.com/citigroup-to-hire-bankers-as-it-returns-to-saudi-arabia/'],b'605',"['Posted by Marion Hillson on Oct 31st, 2017 // No Comments About 20 bankers are set to be recruited by Citigroup in Saudi Arabia after the bank received a license to operate in the Kingdom earlier in the year. Citigroup intends to begin operations before the year ends. The American lender will be returning to Saudi Arabia after an absence of 13 years. In 2004 Citigroup lost its license following the sale of a stake in held in a Saudi financial institution known as Samba Financial Group. Citigroup has previously made two unsuccessful efforts to return to Saudi Arabia – in 2006 as well as in 2010. The Middle Eastern country is emerging as an attractive destination for foreign lenders in the wake of efforts by the kingdom to overhaul its economy. A public listing of Aramco, the state-owned oil giant is in the works for instance. Local advisory work Citigroup intends to ensure that 50% of the investment banking team has been put in place before the year ends. And in next year’s Q1, the lender intends to have filled all the positions according to Carmen Haddad, Citi’s country officer for Saudi Arabia. Once it begins operations in the kingdom, Citigroup intends to engage in local advisory work such as takeovers in cases where the target company is Saudi Arabian. Citigroup will also pitch for advisory work involving initial public offers. According to the president of Citigroup, James Forese, numerous opportunities exist in Saudi Arabia and this includes privatizations. There are also preparations by foreign investors to put their money in Saudi Arabia’s stock market. “The equity market now is on the global map and is going to have more companies listed. The market capitalization will be larger and a lot of investors are starting to look at individual companies,” said Forese. Bond offerings Last year Citigroup played a lead role last year in the kingdom’s bond sale worth $17.5 billion that was a record for the Middle Eastern country. Citigroup also participated in an Islamic bond offering worth $9 billion. But without a license from the CMA, banks encounter restrictions with regards to working on deals which are inked in the kingdom or with takeovers where the target firm is based there. Other financial institutions which already have investment banking licenses and operations in Saudi Arabia include HSBC Holdings, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase. Standard Chartered is currently in talks with regulators with a view to understanding the requirements necessary for obtaining a banking license.

William,Rouhana,['http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/chicken-soup-for-the-soul-sure-but-served-in-a-bowl/article19985184.ece'],b'604',"['Spreading warmth:William Rouhana Jr., the head of the Chicken Soup for the Soul company, with his wife, Amy Newmark, who runs its book series.NY TIMESNYT In early 2008, William J. Rouhana Jr. closed a deal to buy Chicken Soup for the Soul, a company known for a series of inspirational books, with the goal of expanding the brand into a host of other products. The popular line of books was started by Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen in 1993, but the company had also ventured successfully into calendars, greeting cards and even pet food. Today, Mr. Rouhana, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, can catalogue the brand’s attempted expansions — even a line of soups, including chicken — that have failed in the last nine years. The company tried different approaches in the digital space, where, Mr. Rouhana admitted, “we’ve had our most colossal failures.” He added, “We thought a big motion picture would be helpful to the brand.” Mr. Rouhana almost had a movie until the studio providing financial support backed out, citing losses from a blockbuster movie that cut into its budget for smaller films. Yet he has expanded the brand again, and is more optimistic this time. Entrepreneurs are idea-generating machines, and the urge to extend a brand is natural. Yet even the biggest companies in the world regularly fail when adding new products. So what chance does an entrepreneur have? An entrepreneur has to be sure the brand tells consumers what to expect, said Kelly Goldsmith, associate professor of marketing at Vanderbilt University. Making the link “Häagen-Dazs tells you to expect high-quality ice cream,” she said. “It’s a blessing and a curse. It sets expectations for quality and everyday luxury. But it limits you, because the ice cream association is always there.” Imagine, she said, Heineken popcorn or Exxon ice cream. The dissonance between the brand and the new product is too strong to let the new product work. Most ideas for brand extensions are bad ones, said Tatiana J. Whytelord, president and founder of Intelligent Brand Extension. “It’s not just ‘I’ve just launched a vodka and it’s working very, very well, and now I’m going to go do a gin,’” she said. “Vodka and gin are very different worlds — different consumers, different ways of production, very different images. The fact that you were successful in making a vodka doesn’t mean you’ll be successful in making a gin.” In that example, she said, it may make more sense for the company to try branded barware instead of another spirit. Why Chicken Soup for the Soul struggled to sell soup would seem baffling, but the problem turned out to be a bad partnership. Mr. Rouhana said he had worked with a company, Daymon Worldwide, that made generic products. The soup sold well, but not well enough. When problems arose with the partner, Mr. Rouhana said, he knew he could not continue the line on his own. “I didn’t have the capital or the expertise to fix it,” he said. But the pet food, which the company now produces itself, is thriving. “The pet food clearly succeeded because of their emotional message, which appeals to a segment of dog owners who think of their animal as their child,” said Edward M. Tauber, president of Brand Extension Research. Another risk is going too fast. When a brand is doing well, entrepreneurs want to expand it quickly, but sometimes they do so before getting the original product right. “In order to extend your brand, you have to have a brand first,” Ms. Whytelord said. “It’s not just that you trademarked a name. It’s that you have an existing product or service that has goodwill in it and value and is selling in good volumes.” One step at a time One of the cautionary tales in rapid brand expansion is Pierre Cardin, the fashion designer who was once synonymous with French luxury style. But then he expanded the brand too quickly and broadly. What was once a prestigious name is now a mass-market brand. It’s better for entrepreneurs to go deeper into what they already do, brand consultants say. This is what Chicken Soup for the Soul has done with its books. Amy Newmark, publisher and editor-in-chief of the books and Mr. Rouhana’s wife, said there were about 180 titles when they bought the brand but that only 150 conformed to the series’ format, containing 101 inspirational stories. As part of the acquisition of the brand, the company started publishing the books in-house. Ms. Newmark redesigned the books they had, cut the ones that did not conform to the format and created new titles. The key to this, she said, was changing the titles of the books. Under Canfield and Hansen, the pattern was “Chicken Soup for the Fill-in-the-Blank Soul.” She simply branded the books Chicken Soup for the Soul at the top and then gave each book the appropriate title without the old constraints. The line now has some 300 titles.NY TIMES Sign up to receive our newsletter in your inbox every day! Please enter a valid email address.

For now, however, the boys are going to have to just stick with Saturdays. “Barstool Van Talk,” an adaptation of Barstool Sports popular “Pardon My Take” podcast hosted by Dan “Big Cat” Katz and PFT Commenter, was canceled after just one episode. ESPN president John Skipper issued a statement on the decision, claiming that although they knew Barstool had a less than stellar reputation, especially toward ESPN’s own female reporters, they believed they would be able to “distance [themselves] from the Barstool site and its content.” This, if anything, is an understatement of the risk of partnering with Barstool. A site known for misogynistic posts, promotion of binge drinking and frat boy ideology, ESPN would have never been able to get rid of the Barstool reputation. Most notably, Barstool was literally in the name of the show as per demand by Dave Portnoy, the founder and chief of content of the website. Portnoy was outspoken over the issue, posting an unofficial press conference to Twitter from Barstool’s headquarters in New York City, criticizing ESPN for the decision. While many claimed ESPN did the right thing, especially the women journalists who had been previously attacked, it is easy to forget that Barstool Sports feeds off controversy. They have constantly been the underdogs and looked down upon as just a bunch of former frat guys in their late twenties who miss having college as an excuse to party. Barstool’s new CEO, Erika Nardini, has had to come to the defense of the website multiple times whenever they are accused of sexism. Right before this incident, a copy of Barstool’s contract was leaked to Twitter, highlighting a clause that states employees cannot be offended by content posted on the site. Nardini noted that the clause was meant to protect their employees and that the content was aimed at 18- to 34-year-old men. While Barstool has every right to put that in their contract, the lack of respect toward women on the site is tough to grasp, as it promotes a male dominated view of popular culture. With this being said, ESPN are no saints themselves. Barstool and their devoted followers, “Stoolies,” were quick to point out flaws in the people that came out in support of the show’s cancellation. Within hours of the show being dropped, there were screenshots of tweets sent as far back as six years ago from ESPN employees that were demeaning and sexist toward women. The tweets ranged from comments on sexual assault victims to the appearance and physical attributes of other female broadcasters. The most interesting aspect about this is the simple fact that “Barstool Van Talk” had all their jokes cleared by ESPN beforehand and the controversy had to do with Barstool, not the show itself. The show was a normal sports-talk segment, with had nothing sexist or even controversial occurring during the broadcast. While Barstool has a reputation for promoting problematic frat culture, it is a rapidly growing media company. The fact that ESPN even considered a show based on content from the website speaks volumes, and they learned the hard way that they could not shake Barstool’s controversial reputation. No matter what ESPN tried to do, Barstool was always going to stick to their roots and be a rallying cry for, you guessed it, the boys. hpatsko@ramapo.edu UMass coach suspended following offensive comment By William Feola NFL officials under fire after controversial rulings By William Feola Yankees move onto ALDS after 7-2 win By Nicholas Ospina Food pantry opens to Ramapo community By Scott Yunker © 2018 College Media Network, a Uloop company College News Newspaper Info Business Services Employers can list job opportunities for students Housing Providers can list available housing Post your own housing listing on Uloop and have students reach out to you!""]",,,,,,1
Bill,Rouhana,['http://www.greenwichtime.com/business/article/Chicken-Soup-acquires-media-company-in-perfect-12336018.php'],b'602',"['By Macaela J. Bennett Caption Close In a deal Chicken Soup for the Soul’s chief executive described as “perfect” on Monday, the Greenwich-based entertainment company acquired Screen Media Ventures last week. “Screen Media is a really meaningful acquisition,” Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment CEO Bill Rouhana said in a Monday morning investors’ conference call for the company that began trading publicly in August. “Strategically, it’s a dead-on acquisition. ... It’s the perfect transaction for us.” Screen Media consists of two main business elements that Rouhana cast as directions he’s been looking to point Chicken Soup’s entertainment division. For one, Screen Media is an international media distribution company with “one of the largest independent film libraries that exists,” he said, which is valued “in excess of $25 million.” In addition, it hosts several streaming media platforms under the name Popcornflix, which Rouhana touted as having 15 million active users. “It’s a perfect platform for us to build a significant direct-to-consumer online video business that’s advertising supported,” he said. Since Chicken Soup Entertainment’s IPO, the company has been debt-free, Rouhana reminded investors Monday, and it retains about $15 million in liquidity. “The company is in great shape,” he said. Friday’s “opportunistic” acquisition, which includes assets estimated at a value of more than five times what Chicken Soup paid, will only boost its performance, Rouhana said, adding that he eliminated all of Screen Media’s roughly $40 million in debt when the deal closed. “This is clearly an acceleration of years for us in our business plan,” he said. “For this acquisition price, we decided to just leave the adjectives out and let it speak for itself. This, of course, sets us up for a 2018 that will be significantly different than we thought, and by that, I mean better.” The recent acquisition, which several investors lauded during the conference call, aligns with Rouhana’s stated vision for the company when he took it public over the summer. In the weeks leading up to the entertainment division’s IPO, Rouhana told Hearst Connecticut Media that he planned for its video platform to be structured similar to Netflix’s on-demand streaming. At the time, he said he wasn’t sure whether the platform would be monetized through selling advertisements, subscriptions or both, but he told investors Monday that he plans to stick with Popcornflix’s ad-sponsored model for now. In the future, he would consider adding a parallel service that’s subscription driven, he added. While Rouhana was traveling the country this year in efforts to drum up investor support for his company’s public offering, he was frequently asked how he could execute his vision without amassing debt, he said Monday. “I said we were confident that we would find ways to launch this business that wasn’t going to cost us a lot of money,” he said. The Screen Media deal helped Rouhana deliver on that promise. “I say all of this with so many superlatives, because it’s really hard to believe what we paid for this company,” Rouhana said. Chicken Soup has been eyeing New York City-based Screen Media for years, he said, but everything fell together quickly and resulted in a deal that closed within three weeks. “We had to move rapidly to get this deal done,” he told investors. “That’s part of why we were able to get it done on such favorable terms. ... We were able to take advantage of a situation that doesn’t come along very often.” Contact the writer at mbennett@greenwichtime.com; Twitter @Macaela_']",0.0,16.0,1.3333333333333333,0.0,1014393.0,1

CSS Entertainment said the deal will help it to achieve its “ambitious growth plans”. It puts it in charge of Screen Media’s content library of over 1,200 TV series and feature films and the Popcornflix on-demand service. The cash-and-stock deal included a cash payment by CSS Entertainment of US$4.9 million and the issuance of 35,000 shares of CSS Entertainment’s Class A common stock, and was completed after the market closed on November 3, 2017. “We are extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to acquire Screen Media’s valuable assets at a significant discount to their appraised value, intrinsic value and replacement cost,” said William Rouhana Jr, CSS Entertainment’s chairman and CEO. “We had been following Screen Media closely and were patient in waiting for an attractive opening to acquire these assets. Given our familiarity with Screen Media, our strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and no debt, we were well positioned to move forward quickly with the purchase.” Popcornflix is available in 56 countries and currently has the rights to more than 3,000 films and some 1,500 TV episodes over 60 series. CSS Entertainment claims that the Popcornflix app has been downloaded some 24 million times on iOS and Android smartphones and other devices, and for the year ending September 30 had 15 million active users. Screen Media’s content library of films and TV series is also distributed around the world via theatrical, home video, pay-per-view, fTV and online deals. CSS Entertainment said that Screen Media is expected to generate approximately US$12 million in revenue and approximately US$5 million in EBITDA for the full year 2017. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment claims to provide positive and entertaining video content that brings out “the best of the human spirit”. As of September 30, the company had in excess of US$15 million in liquidity and no debt. Scott Seaton, CSS Entertainment’s vice chairman and chief strategy officer said: “We now expect our Q4 2017 Adjusted EBITDA to substantially exceed US$10 million.” <!--//<![CDATA[ var m3_u = (location.protocol==\'https:\'?\'https://servedby.informatm.com/ajs.php\':\'http://servedby.informatm.com/ajs.php\'); var m3_r = Math.floor(Math.random()*99999999999); if (!document.MAX_used) document.MAX_used = \',\'; document.write (""<scr""+""ipt type=\'text/javascript\' src=\'""+m3_u); document.write (""?zoneid=1724""); document.write (""&amp;tags=chicken-soup-for-the-soul-entertainment%2Cpopcornflix%2Cscreen-media-ventures%2Csvod%2Cwilliam-rouhana-jr""); document.write (\'&amp;cb=\' + m3_r); if (document.MAX_used != \',\') document.write (""&amp;exclude="" + document.MAX_used); document.write (document.charset ?
