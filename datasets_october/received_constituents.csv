The rally in Salem was part of a series of rallies around the country hosted by Students for Life of America, a youth organization dedicated to abolishing abortion in their lifetime. The organization, which considers themselves a ""post-Roe organization,"" also provides education on abortion and promotes student leadership at a local and national level. Rallies around the nation were either organized by a regional coordinator or student leaders. Nichole Bentz, the Pacific Northwest regional coordinator for Students for Life of America and Salem rally organizer, said the purpose of Saturday\'s event was to show Oregon Senators Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) that there is support for Kavanaugh in the state. ""We\'re organizing this rallies to call Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed because he is a solid court nominee,"" Bentz, 24 of Corvallis, said. ""He has a strong record on religious liberty, free speech and protecting the pre-born."" Kavanaugh is President Trump\'s second Supreme Court nominee, following Justice Neil Gorsuch who was confirmed in 2017. Kavanaugh\'s confirmation could change the direction of the court to a more conservative side for decades. Bentz spoke at the rally, along with Jessica Stanton, a public affairs official from Oregon Right to Life, and Marcos Sanchez, a student leader for Students for Life of America. ""After Justice Neil Gorsuch was placed on the Supreme Court, we could only dream of another opportunity to have such major influence for the pro-life movement,"" Stanton said. ""We must show our support and raise our voices for our U.S. Senators to confirm the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh."" Abby Luschei can be reached at aluschei@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6747.

Const. Sara Burns, 43, is shown in this undated police handout photo. HO/The Canadian Press In the middle of raising three boys, Sara Burns decided to go back to school and chase her dream of becoming a police officer. At 35, the Fredericton native decided to get a criminology degree, and then leave her husband and sons for six months of intensive training at the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. The driven recruit arrived in 2015 with a maturity that was uncommon among her 60 or so peers – most of whom were about 21 years old – and she was soon named the leader of the cohort for that year, according to Edgar MacLeod, who retired in January as the academy’s long-time executive director. Story continues below advertisement In an interview at the time with the Journal Pioneer, a local PEI newspaper, Ms. Burns explained her reasoning for joining law enforcement. “[Policing] is something that I think challenges you physically, mentally and socially; you need to be aware of those components. It’s a really challenging field and to survive you need to keep all of those in check,” she said. “To do well, you obviously need to maintain a certain standard, and here at the school they provide a lot of the theory and the skill to do that.” Mr. McLeod, a former president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, remembered her as physically capable and in possession of all the skills needed to enforce the law in dangerous situations. “But, beyond that, we also want to train our police officers to be compassionate and understanding of people, be patient with people – that sort of thing – and boy, she had that part down in spades,"" he said. “You could tell she would treat everybody with respect, not a showboat, she didn’t have an edge.” On Friday, friends and colleagues mourned Constable Burns after she and a fellow officer were killed in a quiet residential neighbourhood of Fredericton. Two civilians were also killed and a 48-year-old local man was in police custody on Friday evening with serious injuries. In 2016, soon after graduating from the academy, Constable Burns was hired by her hometown force, of which she had been an auxiliary member. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Earlier this year, Constable Burns narrowly missed being struck by a knife that was thrown out the window by a man at the scene of a domestic incident, Fredericton news outlet The Daily Gleaner reported.

Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was charged Saturday morning with the deaths of two Fredericton police officers and two civilians, according to a news release from Fredericton police. The officers, identified Friday, are Const. Sara Burns, 43, and Const. Robb Costello, 45. Police confirmed the identity of the other two victims Saturday morning: Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Robichaud and Wright were in a new relationship, according to his cousin, Sean Callahan. He said they had just gotten together at the beginning of August. Callahan said there was “nothing bad you can say about” Robichaud. “When I got a message yesterday asking me if Donnie got shot, I was like, who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?” he told the Star in an interview. Callahan said he joined Robichaud’s mother and other family members at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital on Friday morning. An RCMP officer confirmed with them around 6 p.m. that Robichaud was one of the victims, Callahan said. Robichaud, a father of three, lived alone on Brookside Dr., according to his cousin. The shooting occurred at that address around 7 a.m. Friday. Just 12 hours after a shooting that shocked the city of Fredericton, more than 100 people packed into a local church Friday night to mourn the victims. St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church is less than a kilometre away from the site of the shooting. Citizens of the small New Brunswick city gathered to sing hymns, sit in silent prayer and light candles. “I’m so sad,” said Mei Yong, who brought her 2-year-old son, Nova Lin, to the vigil. Yong said she was there to show her support to Fredericton police, who helped her in a time of personal need. Even though she didn’t know the two officers who were killed, she said she was grieving with those who did. Costello, 45, had served for 20 years with Fredericton police. “He loved being a police officer and he lived for being a police officer,” his common-law partner, Jackie McLean said. “He is the only police officer who I have ever known who could write someone a ticket and have the person thank them after.” Burns, 43, was with Fredericton police for the past two years as an officer, and two years before that as an auxiliary officer. Fredericton is a city of less than 60,000, and its residents are tightly connected. One of those residents, retired United Church minister Brian DeLong, began getting calls just after 4 p.m. Police had just released the names of the officers — the first to respond to the call — who had been fatally shot, and people were badly rattled by the news. One of the victims, Const. Burns, was the daughter-in-law of two members of his congregation. “People from my congregation called me and said, ‘Did you know?’ ” DeLong said before the vigil. He rushed to join the vigil at St. John the Evangelist, where he read a scripture in dedication to Burns’ family, and all those grieving. The vigil was open to the whole community, its doors propped open to let in the evening breeze as the sun began to set. Fans moved the air around in the small gym where people gathered, but it remained hot after another stifling summer day.

Moore faces an Oct. 2 court date after being cited on Interstate 77 earlier this month for doing 113 mph in a 65 mph work zone. “F---- that car is moving,” Trooper H.L. Bautista wrote in his report of the stop, which occurred after Moore and his teammates returned to the city after a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills in New York. Moore, 21, was charged with speeding, and speeding in a work zone at over 80 mph. He was pulled over at 2:52 a.m. on I-77 north near the intersection of N.C. 24, according to Bautista’s report. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. The trooper said Moore’s 2017 white Mercedes came up on him from behind and that Bautista followed Moore’s car for about a mile before pulling him over. The trooper described traffic conditions at the time as “light.” In his report, Bautista described Moore as “polite and cooperative,” and that the player told him the team had just landed at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and of him “wanting to get home.” According to the address included on the trooper’s report, Moore lives near the intersection of I-485 and Prosperity Church Road, east of Northlake Mall. “When it all happened, D.J. came to us right away and explained the situation. He was very remorseful. He understood,” said Panthers coach Ron Rivera. “We chastised him obviously. And he’s moving on. And it’s an opportunity to learn for him and for the other young guys. ‘Hey, you have a responsibility to the community.’” Hours earlier, Moore played an instrumental role in the Panthers’ 28-23 win over Buffalo. The rookie from Maryland was the team’s leading receiver, catching four passes for 75 yards. Reporter Jourdan Rodrigue contributed to this story. Panthers newest wide receiver D.J. Moore talks about being drafted in the first round by the Panthers, his playing style, talking with Cam Newton, being complimented by Steve Smith Sr. and what D.J. stand for.

Johnson Matthew Polenzani (with Nadine Sierra) sings the title role of Mozart’s “Idomeneo” October 13- November 2 at Lyric Opera. Photo: Marty Sohl / Metropolitan Opera 2018-19 is shaping up as one of the least adventurous seasons on Chicago’s classical scene since CCR launched nearly a decade ago. It almost seems as if many of the large organizations and presenters are engaged in a private tournament to see who can provide the most familiar and least interesting repertoire. Sad! Fortunately, the local music beat is varied and expansive enough that one can still come up with intriguing Critic Picks for this season. The following nine events stand out amid the sea of safety-first programming. The Collaborative Works Festival. September 5-7 The landscape for serious vocal recitals is even more barren than usual in Chicago’s upcoming season. Fortunately, the Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago is once again expertly filling the void with its Collaborative Works Festival. Vocal artists this fall include CAIC cofounder, tenor Nicholas Phan, soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano and baritone Tyler Duncan. The festival’s 2018 rep casts an even wider and more adventurous net than usual: a commissioned world premiere by Missy Mazzoli, alongside song cycles by Brahms, Schoenberg, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Leos Janácek. caichicago.org Handel’s Serse. Haymarket Opera. September 29-October 2 Haymarket Opera has gone from strength to strength in its recent productions of Ariane et Bachus and L’Orontea, and the time is right for the company to finally tackle an evening-length Handel work with Serse. Mezzo Suzanne Lommler takes the title trousers role of the amorous King of Persia, backed by a cast of company regulars including Angela Young Smucker, Erica Schiller, Ryan de Ryke and David Govertsen. One of Handel’s richest works, the three-act serio-comic opera contains much indelible music, not least the celebrated “Ombra mai fu”—the most beautiful aria ever sung to a tree. haymarketopera.org Mozart’s Idomeneo. Lyric Opera. October 13-November 2 Matthew Polenzani is at the top of his game these days and having the American singer tackle the solo part in Mozart’s greatest tenor role is self-recommending. With Andrew Davis conducting and a supporting cast that includes Erin Wall and Janai Brugger, this is easily the best bet at Lyric Opera this season. lyricopera.org Charpentier’s Acteon and Rameau’s Pygmalion. Opera Atelier. November 15-16 In a bounteous fall for Baroque opera, the Toronto-based Opera Atelier makes its Chicago debut at the Harris Theater with a double bill of French Baroque masterworks. These performances will be sumptuously staged with a corps de ballet, and the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra in the pit. harristheaterchicago.org Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. Music of the Baroque. November 25-26 Declan McGovern, Music of the Baroque’s new executive director, has a stated goal of bringing new audiences into the hall for MOB concerts. In his first programmed season, that populist outreach is evident: MOB will make its Pritzker Pavilion debut on Sept. 12 with a program of excerpts from favorite Baroque and Classical works; and the fall season contains ample box-office bait, like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, Bach’s Second Orchestral Suite and the Mozart Requiem. MOB’s best bet for 2018-19 is Bach’s epic Christmas Oratorio (complete). After music of Mozart, Jane Glover is at her best in large-scale Baroque vocal works such as this. baroque.org Jake Heggie’s “Moby-Dick” will have its Chicago premiere April 25 and 28 at Chicago Opera Theater. Photo: Dana Sohm Massenet’s Cendrillon. Lyric Opera. December 1-January 20, 2019 A wild card pick since Andrew Davis has tapped Siobhan Stagg, a virtually unknown Australian soprano, to make her company debut in the title role of Cinderella. Massenet’s gorgeous, neglected score seems to finally be waltzing in from the shadows with a well-received Met production last year, which will travel here. Alice Coote is Prince Charming and Marie-Eve Munger, the Fairy Godmother. These holiday-new year performances mark Cendrillon’s belated Lyric Opera premiere. lyricopera.org Strauss and Bartok. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor. March 28-April 2 Esa-Pekka Salonen’s concerts with the CSO are invariably season highlights. The Finnish conductor is only booked for a single week this season but his program promises to be a striking one: Richard Strauss’s brilliant tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra, and Bartok’s bleak, atmospheric opera Bluebeard’s Castle with soloists Michelle De Young and John Relyea. cso.org Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick. Chicago Opera Theater. April 25 and 28 For many, Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick is the finest American opera of recent decades; kudos to Chicago Opera Theater for bringing this important, belated Chicago premiere to local audiences. Heggie’s tightly wrought setting of Herman Melville’s sprawling, complex novel manages to hit all the book’s high points as well as the lurking subtexts in music that is memorable and theatrically effective. Thomas Studebaker takes on the role of the obsessed Captain Ahab, with Aleksey Bogdanov as Starbuck, Vince Wallace as Queequeg, Andrew Bidlack as Greenhorn and Summer Hassan as Pip. Lidiya Yankovskaya conducts, with a well-received production from Utah Opera. cot.org Verdi’s Aida. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Riccardo Muti, conductor. June 21-25 Riccardo Muti’s concert performances of Verdi operas have been consistent high points amid the repetitive, Eurocentric programming that has largely characterized his CSO tenure. These season-ending concert performances of Verdi’s Aida promise to be in the same grand tradition with Krassimira Stoyanova in the title role, Francesco Meli as her lover Radames, Anita Rachvelishvili as Amneris, and Kiril Manolov as Amonasro. cso.org Posted in Articles Message:', 'Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has died at the age of 80; he served as the seventh secretary-general, for two terms between 1997 and 2006, NPR noted.

A man in India has confessed to chopping his same-sex lover into pieces after they had sex, PinkNews reported. The 29-year-old murderer, who lives in Tamil Nadu in the south of the country, invited a 68-year-old French tourist to his home in the village of Avikottai, where the pair had sex before the victim was killed. According to The Hindu, the murderer was named Thirumurugan and the victim was named Pierre Bernard Robert Rene. A 27-year-old man was sentenced to two years in prison ( six months conditionally suspended ) for attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault by the court in Amsterdam, NLTimes.nl noted. He was part of a group of four who attacked two gay men on the Damrak in Amsterdam in June 2017. The three other perpetrators in this attack were tried and sentenced in March; two of the other suspects were sentenced to three years and four months, and two years and four months in jail. After facing intense scrutiny regarding hundreds of alleged child sex-abuse cases involving priests in Pennsylvania, Washington Archbishop Cardinal Donald Wuerl has pulled out of a scheduled appearance in Ireland, Fox5DC.com reported. Wuerl was supposed to deliver a keynote address at the Vatican-organized gathering at the World Meeting of Families, a Vatican-organized gathering in Dublin. Wuerl has now withdrawn his appearance after a report from a Pennsylvania grand-jury report that detailed more than 300 priests sexually abused more than 1,000 children. The Rainbow Laces campaign recently returned to English cricket to celebrate LGBT players and fans at every level of cricket, ICC-Cricket.com noted. Run by the English Cricket Board ( ECB ), professional and amateur clubs nationwide sported rainbow laces for the second consecutive year. Malaysian police have raided a gay bar in the country\'s capital of Kuala Lumpur\x97an act that authorities have said was carried out to ""mitigate the LGBT culture from spreading into our society,"" PinkNews noted. National newspaper Berita Harian reported that authorities raided The Blue Boy club. It is reportedly the first time the club has been raided in its 30-year history. Singer-songwriter Ariana Grande broke down in a recent interview when she opened up about the impact of the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, PinkNews noted. In an emotional interview, the star discussed the background to her new song ""Get Well Soon,"" which she said is partly about the terrorist attack, to Ebro Darden on Beats 1 Radio. Grande, 25, has previously said that she has suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder since the terrorist attack. In Canada, Trinity Western University will stop making students promise not to have sex outside of an opposite-sex marriage, DailyXtra.com noted. Trinity Western\'s proposed law school ran into difficulty after several law societies said they would refuse to accredit the university\'s students because of the community covenant. The covenant will still apply to university staff, however. Stormy Daniels\x97the adult film actress and nemesis of U.S. President Donald Trump\x97pulled out of a British reality-TV show at the last minute after a dispute with producers, a USA Today item noted. Daniels was due to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, which locks contestants in a house under constant surveillance.
