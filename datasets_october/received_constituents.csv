The rally in Salem was part of a series of rallies around the country hosted by Students for Life of America, a youth organization dedicated to abolishing abortion in their lifetime. The organization, which considers themselves a ""post-Roe organization,"" also provides education on abortion and promotes student leadership at a local and national level. Rallies around the nation were either organized by a regional coordinator or student leaders. Nichole Bentz, the Pacific Northwest regional coordinator for Students for Life of America and Salem rally organizer, said the purpose of Saturday\'s event was to show Oregon Senators Ron Wyden (D) and Jeff Merkley (D) that there is support for Kavanaugh in the state. ""We\'re organizing this rallies to call Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed because he is a solid court nominee,"" Bentz, 24 of Corvallis, said. ""He has a strong record on religious liberty, free speech and protecting the pre-born."" Kavanaugh is President Trump\'s second Supreme Court nominee, following Justice Neil Gorsuch who was confirmed in 2017. Kavanaugh\'s confirmation could change the direction of the court to a more conservative side for decades. Bentz spoke at the rally, along with Jessica Stanton, a public affairs official from Oregon Right to Life, and Marcos Sanchez, a student leader for Students for Life of America. ""After Justice Neil Gorsuch was placed on the Supreme Court, we could only dream of another opportunity to have such major influence for the pro-life movement,"" Stanton said. ""We must show our support and raise our voices for our U.S. Senators to confirm the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh."" Abby Luschei can be reached at aluschei@statesmanjournal.com or 503-399-6747.

Const. Sara Burns, 43, is shown in this undated police handout photo. HO/The Canadian Press In the middle of raising three boys, Sara Burns decided to go back to school and chase her dream of becoming a police officer. At 35, the Fredericton native decided to get a criminology degree, and then leave her husband and sons for six months of intensive training at the Atlantic Police Academy in Prince Edward Island. The driven recruit arrived in 2015 with a maturity that was uncommon among her 60 or so peers – most of whom were about 21 years old – and she was soon named the leader of the cohort for that year, according to Edgar MacLeod, who retired in January as the academy’s long-time executive director. Story continues below advertisement In an interview at the time with the Journal Pioneer, a local PEI newspaper, Ms. Burns explained her reasoning for joining law enforcement. “[Policing] is something that I think challenges you physically, mentally and socially; you need to be aware of those components. It’s a really challenging field and to survive you need to keep all of those in check,” she said. “To do well, you obviously need to maintain a certain standard, and here at the school they provide a lot of the theory and the skill to do that.” Mr. McLeod, a former president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, remembered her as physically capable and in possession of all the skills needed to enforce the law in dangerous situations. “But, beyond that, we also want to train our police officers to be compassionate and understanding of people, be patient with people – that sort of thing – and boy, she had that part down in spades,"" he said. “You could tell she would treat everybody with respect, not a showboat, she didn’t have an edge.” On Friday, friends and colleagues mourned Constable Burns after she and a fellow officer were killed in a quiet residential neighbourhood of Fredericton. Two civilians were also killed and a 48-year-old local man was in police custody on Friday evening with serious injuries. In 2016, soon after graduating from the academy, Constable Burns was hired by her hometown force, of which she had been an auxiliary member. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Earlier this year, Constable Burns narrowly missed being struck by a knife that was thrown out the window by a man at the scene of a domestic incident, Fredericton news outlet The Daily Gleaner reported.

Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was charged Saturday morning with the deaths of two Fredericton police officers and two civilians, according to a news release from Fredericton police. The officers, identified Friday, are Const. Sara Burns, 43, and Const. Robb Costello, 45. Police confirmed the identity of the other two victims Saturday morning: Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Robichaud and Wright were in a new relationship, according to his cousin, Sean Callahan. He said they had just gotten together at the beginning of August. Callahan said there was “nothing bad you can say about” Robichaud. “When I got a message yesterday asking me if Donnie got shot, I was like, who in the hell would want to shoot Donnie Robichaud?” he told the Star in an interview. Callahan said he joined Robichaud’s mother and other family members at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital on Friday morning. An RCMP officer confirmed with them around 6 p.m. that Robichaud was one of the victims, Callahan said. Robichaud, a father of three, lived alone on Brookside Dr., according to his cousin. The shooting occurred at that address around 7 a.m. Friday. Just 12 hours after a shooting that shocked the city of Fredericton, more than 100 people packed into a local church Friday night to mourn the victims. St. John the Evangelist Anglican Church is less than a kilometre away from the site of the shooting. Citizens of the small New Brunswick city gathered to sing hymns, sit in silent prayer and light candles. “I’m so sad,” said Mei Yong, who brought her 2-year-old son, Nova Lin, to the vigil. Yong said she was there to show her support to Fredericton police, who helped her in a time of personal need. Even though she didn’t know the two officers who were killed, she said she was grieving with those who did. Costello, 45, had served for 20 years with Fredericton police. “He loved being a police officer and he lived for being a police officer,” his common-law partner, Jackie McLean said. “He is the only police officer who I have ever known who could write someone a ticket and have the person thank them after.” Burns, 43, was with Fredericton police for the past two years as an officer, and two years before that as an auxiliary officer. Fredericton is a city of less than 60,000, and its residents are tightly connected. One of those residents, retired United Church minister Brian DeLong, began getting calls just after 4 p.m. Police had just released the names of the officers — the first to respond to the call — who had been fatally shot, and people were badly rattled by the news. One of the victims, Const. Burns, was the daughter-in-law of two members of his congregation. “People from my congregation called me and said, ‘Did you know?’ ” DeLong said before the vigil. He rushed to join the vigil at St. John the Evangelist, where he read a scripture in dedication to Burns’ family, and all those grieving. The vigil was open to the whole community, its doors propped open to let in the evening breeze as the sun began to set. Fans moved the air around in the small gym where people gathered, but it remained hot after another stifling summer day.

Moore faces an Oct. 2 court date after being cited on Interstate 77 earlier this month for doing 113 mph in a 65 mph work zone. “F---- that car is moving,” Trooper H.L. Bautista wrote in his report of the stop, which occurred after Moore and his teammates returned to the city after a preseason game against the Buffalo Bills in New York. Moore, 21, was charged with speeding, and speeding in a work zone at over 80 mph. He was pulled over at 2:52 a.m. on I-77 north near the intersection of N.C. 24, according to Bautista’s report. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. The trooper said Moore’s 2017 white Mercedes came up on him from behind and that Bautista followed Moore’s car for about a mile before pulling him over. The trooper described traffic conditions at the time as “light.” In his report, Bautista described Moore as “polite and cooperative,” and that the player told him the team had just landed at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport and of him “wanting to get home.” According to the address included on the trooper’s report, Moore lives near the intersection of I-485 and Prosperity Church Road, east of Northlake Mall. “When it all happened, D.J. came to us right away and explained the situation. He was very remorseful. He understood,” said Panthers coach Ron Rivera. “We chastised him obviously. And he’s moving on. And it’s an opportunity to learn for him and for the other young guys. ‘Hey, you have a responsibility to the community.’” Hours earlier, Moore played an instrumental role in the Panthers’ 28-23 win over Buffalo. The rookie from Maryland was the team’s leading receiver, catching four passes for 75 yards. Reporter Jourdan Rodrigue contributed to this story. Panthers newest wide receiver D.J. Moore talks about being drafted in the first round by the Panthers, his playing style, talking with Cam Newton, being complimented by Steve Smith Sr. and what D.J. stand for.

Johnson Matthew Polenzani (with Nadine Sierra) sings the title role of Mozart’s “Idomeneo” October 13- November 2 at Lyric Opera. Photo: Marty Sohl / Metropolitan Opera 2018-19 is shaping up as one of the least adventurous seasons on Chicago’s classical scene since CCR launched nearly a decade ago. It almost seems as if many of the large organizations and presenters are engaged in a private tournament to see who can provide the most familiar and least interesting repertoire. Sad! Fortunately, the local music beat is varied and expansive enough that one can still come up with intriguing Critic Picks for this season. The following nine events stand out amid the sea of safety-first programming. The Collaborative Works Festival. September 5-7 The landscape for serious vocal recitals is even more barren than usual in Chicago’s upcoming season. Fortunately, the Collaborative Arts Institute of Chicago is once again expertly filling the void with its Collaborative Works Festival. Vocal artists this fall include CAIC cofounder, tenor Nicholas Phan, soprano Jennifer Johnson Cano and baritone Tyler Duncan. The festival’s 2018 rep casts an even wider and more adventurous net than usual: a commissioned world premiere by Missy Mazzoli, alongside song cycles by Brahms, Schoenberg, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Leos Janácek. caichicago.org Handel’s Serse. Haymarket Opera. September 29-October 2 Haymarket Opera has gone from strength to strength in its recent productions of Ariane et Bachus and L’Orontea, and the time is right for the company to finally tackle an evening-length Handel work with Serse. Mezzo Suzanne Lommler takes the title trousers role of the amorous King of Persia, backed by a cast of company regulars including Angela Young Smucker, Erica Schiller, Ryan de Ryke and David Govertsen. One of Handel’s richest works, the three-act serio-comic opera contains much indelible music, not least the celebrated “Ombra mai fu”—the most beautiful aria ever sung to a tree. haymarketopera.org Mozart’s Idomeneo. Lyric Opera. October 13-November 2 Matthew Polenzani is at the top of his game these days and having the American singer tackle the solo part in Mozart’s greatest tenor role is self-recommending. With Andrew Davis conducting and a supporting cast that includes Erin Wall and Janai Brugger, this is easily the best bet at Lyric Opera this season. lyricopera.org Charpentier’s Acteon and Rameau’s Pygmalion. Opera Atelier. November 15-16 In a bounteous fall for Baroque opera, the Toronto-based Opera Atelier makes its Chicago debut at the Harris Theater with a double bill of French Baroque masterworks. These performances will be sumptuously staged with a corps de ballet, and the Tafelmusik Baroque Orchestra in the pit. harristheaterchicago.org Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. Music of the Baroque. November 25-26 Declan McGovern, Music of the Baroque’s new executive director, has a stated goal of bringing new audiences into the hall for MOB concerts. In his first programmed season, that populist outreach is evident: MOB will make its Pritzker Pavilion debut on Sept. 12 with a program of excerpts from favorite Baroque and Classical works; and the fall season contains ample box-office bait, like Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, Bach’s Second Orchestral Suite and the Mozart Requiem. MOB’s best bet for 2018-19 is Bach’s epic Christmas Oratorio (complete). After music of Mozart, Jane Glover is at her best in large-scale Baroque vocal works such as this. baroque.org Jake Heggie’s “Moby-Dick” will have its Chicago premiere April 25 and 28 at Chicago Opera Theater. Photo: Dana Sohm Massenet’s Cendrillon. Lyric Opera. December 1-January 20, 2019 A wild card pick since Andrew Davis has tapped Siobhan Stagg, a virtually unknown Australian soprano, to make her company debut in the title role of Cinderella. Massenet’s gorgeous, neglected score seems to finally be waltzing in from the shadows with a well-received Met production last year, which will travel here. Alice Coote is Prince Charming and Marie-Eve Munger, the Fairy Godmother. These holiday-new year performances mark Cendrillon’s belated Lyric Opera premiere. lyricopera.org Strauss and Bartok. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor. March 28-April 2 Esa-Pekka Salonen’s concerts with the CSO are invariably season highlights. The Finnish conductor is only booked for a single week this season but his program promises to be a striking one: Richard Strauss’s brilliant tone poem Also Sprach Zarathustra, and Bartok’s bleak, atmospheric opera Bluebeard’s Castle with soloists Michelle De Young and John Relyea. cso.org Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick. Chicago Opera Theater. April 25 and 28 For many, Jake Heggie’s Moby-Dick is the finest American opera of recent decades; kudos to Chicago Opera Theater for bringing this important, belated Chicago premiere to local audiences. Heggie’s tightly wrought setting of Herman Melville’s sprawling, complex novel manages to hit all the book’s high points as well as the lurking subtexts in music that is memorable and theatrically effective. Thomas Studebaker takes on the role of the obsessed Captain Ahab, with Aleksey Bogdanov as Starbuck, Vince Wallace as Queequeg, Andrew Bidlack as Greenhorn and Summer Hassan as Pip. Lidiya Yankovskaya conducts, with a well-received production from Utah Opera. cot.org Verdi’s Aida. Chicago Symphony Orchestra; Riccardo Muti, conductor. June 21-25 Riccardo Muti’s concert performances of Verdi operas have been consistent high points amid the repetitive, Eurocentric programming that has largely characterized his CSO tenure. These season-ending concert performances of Verdi’s Aida promise to be in the same grand tradition with Krassimira Stoyanova in the title role, Francesco Meli as her lover Radames, Anita Rachvelishvili as Amneris, and Kiril Manolov as Amonasro. cso.org Posted in Articles Message:', 'Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has died at the age of 80; he served as the seventh secretary-general, for two terms between 1997 and 2006, NPR noted.

A man in India has confessed to chopping his same-sex lover into pieces after they had sex, PinkNews reported. The 29-year-old murderer, who lives in Tamil Nadu in the south of the country, invited a 68-year-old French tourist to his home in the village of Avikottai, where the pair had sex before the victim was killed. According to The Hindu, the murderer was named Thirumurugan and the victim was named Pierre Bernard Robert Rene. A 27-year-old man was sentenced to two years in prison ( six months conditionally suspended ) for attempted manslaughter and aggravated assault by the court in Amsterdam, NLTimes.nl noted. He was part of a group of four who attacked two gay men on the Damrak in Amsterdam in June 2017. The three other perpetrators in this attack were tried and sentenced in March; two of the other suspects were sentenced to three years and four months, and two years and four months in jail. After facing intense scrutiny regarding hundreds of alleged child sex-abuse cases involving priests in Pennsylvania, Washington Archbishop Cardinal Donald Wuerl has pulled out of a scheduled appearance in Ireland, Fox5DC.com reported. Wuerl was supposed to deliver a keynote address at the Vatican-organized gathering at the World Meeting of Families, a Vatican-organized gathering in Dublin. Wuerl has now withdrawn his appearance after a report from a Pennsylvania grand-jury report that detailed more than 300 priests sexually abused more than 1,000 children. The Rainbow Laces campaign recently returned to English cricket to celebrate LGBT players and fans at every level of cricket, ICC-Cricket.com noted. Run by the English Cricket Board ( ECB ), professional and amateur clubs nationwide sported rainbow laces for the second consecutive year. Malaysian police have raided a gay bar in the country\'s capital of Kuala Lumpur\x97an act that authorities have said was carried out to ""mitigate the LGBT culture from spreading into our society,"" PinkNews noted.

Singer-songwriter Ariana Grande broke down in a recent interview when she opened up about the impact of the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017, PinkNews noted. In an emotional interview, the star discussed the background to her new song ""Get Well Soon,"" which she said is partly about the terrorist attack, to Ebro Darden on Beats 1 Radio. Grande, 25, has previously said that she has suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder since the terrorist attack. In Canada, Trinity Western University will stop making students promise not to have sex outside of an opposite-sex marriage, DailyXtra.com noted. Trinity Western\'s proposed law school ran into difficulty after several law societies said they would refuse to accredit the university\'s students because of the community covenant. The covenant will still apply to university staff, however. Stormy Daniels\x97the adult film actress and nemesis of U.S. President Donald Trump\x97pulled out of a British reality-TV show at the last minute after a dispute with producers, a USA Today item noted. Daniels was due to take part in Celebrity Big Brother, which locks contestants in a house under constant surveillance.

Uptown, there were supercilious academics and hallowed institutions for whom classical music was sacrosanct. Downtown, there were ragtag punks and rockers doing whatever they wanted. The trio was somewhere in the middle; classically-minded musicians who liked to play electric guitars and experiment with screechy body percussion. Bang On A Can All-Stars in performance.Credit:?Stephanie Berger Photography. All Rights Reserved. So they rented a SoHo art gallery and put on a 12-hour marathon of new music, including performances by Steve Reich and John Cage, with a name that made them laugh: the first annual Bang on a Can festival. But it turned out many others were looking for the zone the trio occupied between rock, jazz, classical and folk; a zone where new forms of music could be explored and enjoyed. Where a classical violinist could collaborate with an Appalachian fiddler or an electronic DJ. Where audiences could listen to Afrobeat drumming one minute and be floored by a choral oratorio the next. Members of the Bang On a Can collective. ""In the beginning, we were aware our college friends would go see new dance or experimental film, but they weren\'t crossing the divide to the world we came from,"" Wolfe, 59, said as she sat at a sun-drenched table in her Tribeca loft. ""We welcomed these people in thinking if we had this good experience with this piece of music anybody could and that worked. In the first year ... about 400 people crowded in."" Three decades on, Bang on a Can has snowballed from an annual concert into a global movement. The New Yorker said they had redefined what a composer can be in the 21st century. The San Francisco Chronicle called them the ""country\'s most important vehicle for contemporary music"". The collective comprises a record label, a summer camp, an All-Stars sextet that performs around the world, a marching band, a commissioning fund for composers and a program to help under-privileged communities create global music. At its heart is still the annual marathon festival, like the one they will headline in Sydney on Saturday. The Bang on a Can All-Stars, formed in the 1990s to take the group\'s music on the road, will perform as part of Extended Play at the City Recital Hall, a 12-hour mini-festival traversing new music in every format. From noon to midnight, 20 local and international artists will transform each corner of the venue into a hub of sonic exploration. That such concerts are being staged by others – this one by Australian composer Lyle Chan – is a testament to Bang on a Can\'s impact. The group has spawned alumni collectives, including a solid Australian network (Australia is the biggest Bang on a Can base outside the US, they say) and has seen genre-bending experimental ensemble music become almost mainstream. Wolfe won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2015 for Anthracite Fields, a haunting choral and instrumental composition about the coal mining community of her native Pennsylvania. And while the boundaries around genres may have blurred, the group is tackling some cultural and geographic barriers that have replaced them. Their concerts have welcomed diverse groups such as a percussion ensemble from Uzbekistan and have often prioritised local input. The Melbourne performance will include a piece by local musician Kate Moore, while all three Australian shows will present Anabiosis, a piece by Australian singer and composer JG Thirlwell (of Foetus and Zola Jesus fame), part of a program stretching from Lang\'s 1995 percussion riot Cheating, Lying, Stealing to Gordon\'s 2012 composition Gene Takes a Drink. ""Some of what we did was that polemic ... we really wanted to break down those [genre] barriers,"" Lang said. ""The big question with music now is who can participate. The world of classical music needs to go through this kind of soul-searching about how it makes itself part of the general musical spectrum. It\'s lived this long by building a bunch of walls around it."" He hopes the spark of exploration and optimism they lit in the 1980s still burns strong. ""When we were young composers, people told us, \'this is the size of the world that you\'re going to live in\' and we didn\'t like that,"" Lang said. ""I don\'t think young composers or performers feel that. They think the size of their world is boundary-less and we hope we have been a part of that.""

SIGN UP NOW > Senior News Corp journalist Phil Rothfield reported earlier this week the Roosters are set to make a big play for the 23-year-old State of Origin and Kangaroos star. North Queensland is believed to be keen on luring Munster “home” to Townsville if they fail in their pursuit of Valentine Holmes, and the Broncos have been rumoured to be interested. But all those clubs face a stiff fight from the Storm, who are no doubt prepared to fork out plenty of cash to retain their premiership talent. Brennan is well aware the Titans will struggle to compete with the money on offer from Melbourne and the Roosters.

With Billy Slater about to retire and Cameron Smith’s future in the game unknown, the Storm will have plenty of money to entice Munster to stay in the southern capital beyond 2019. Adding to his value is the fact he can play in the halves and at fullback just as effectively. With the Titans likely losing veteran custodian Michael Gordon after next season, Brennan knows the club will have at least one spot in the spine to fill. He said Munster could slot in at five-eighth or at fullback with ease, completing a spine that already boasts young stars Ash Taylor and AJ Brimson. The Titans are also on the verge of extending hooker Mitch Rein’s contract. Rein is currently off contract but has an option to extend, and will do so in the coming weeks.

Sheik Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan is part of the ruling Abu Dhabi family and was said to have met Liverpool\'s owners Fenway Sports Group over a period of months in late 2017. He was then said to have proposed a huge £2billion takeover of the club, according to the Daily Mail. That deal would have made it the most expensive takeover in the history of football. The report goes on to say he was ready with a £2billion valuation - taking on a minority Chinese investor and more money from a hedge fund. This valuation was placed on the club before the reached the Champions League final. Liverpool are adamant that the club is not for sale, although they ARE looking for a similar investment deal to the one Manchester City made with Chinese consortium CMC. That investment was for £265million and bought CMC a 13 per cent stake in City. However it seems the deal broke down when a £25m down payment on the proposal was not paid last December - with Liverpool way of a lack of funds. The club released a statement and insisted the deal broke down before Sheik Khaled and FSG\'s majority shareholders John W Henry or Michael Gordon met. It read: ""FSG have been clear and consistent: the club is not for sale. ""But what the ownership has said, again clearly and consistently, is that under the right terms and conditions we would consider taking on a minority investor, if such a partnership was to further our commercial interests in specific market places and in line with the continued development and growth of the club and the team."" Sheikh Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan established Bin Zayed Group of Companies in 1988, a leading conglomerate of business. While not having the billion dollar wealth of the likes of Sheik Mansour, he is said to be a leading entrepreneur in the region. He is a member of the World Economic Forum, Vice Chairman of Human Appeal International and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Dubai Economic Council. Last October Liverpool owners reportedly turned down a £1.5billion offer to buy the club from a consortium led by Amanda Staveley. Staveley and here PCP Capital Partners Group have been heavily linked with a takeover bid for Newcastle United in recent weeks. But this was only after FSG turned down a bid for the Reds. Reports in Dubai say that they were involved in negotiations with FSG for more than a year, according to The National.

Students at the college have made ‘significant gains’ on last year’s set of results with many subject areas reporting an improvement in their rates of progress. The number of students achieving five grades between nine and four in subjects including maths and English rising to more than 60 per cent – this is among the highest rates the college has ever achieved. Two thirds of all students taking their GCSEs also achieve a grade four or higher in English and maths. College principal Andrew Davis said: “I am extremely proud of these results which reflect both the amazing hard work of the students and the dedication, skill and commitment of both teaching and support staff at the college. “The results represent a major step forward from last year in many areas.” Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.

Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titan linebacker Andrew Davis (33) brings down an R-S Central runner while teammate Johan Ayala (40) joins the play during last week\'s 22-7 win in the season opener. Davis led the Titans with 12 tackles. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. The McDowell Titans’ 22-7 win over the R-S Central Hilltoppers in last Friday’s season opener was plenty convincing. But after looking at the film, Titans head coach Andy Morgan said it could have been a lot worse. “We moved the football until we got in the red zone,” said the third-year head coach. “But I felt like we left at least 21 points and maybe 28 out there. I was a little disappointed with that, but that was as much my fault as anything else.” Other than coming up short of the end zone a few times – four possessions as deep as the R-S Central 28 produced no points – there was little with which the coaching staff could find fault. The Titans put up 362 yards of offense while limiting Central to 181 yards and nine first downs. McDowell forced four fumbles and an interception on defense. Their top five tacklers were linebackers or defensive linemen, a stat indicative of the fact that Central didn’t break many big plays. Meanwhile, the Titans had seven plays of 26 yards or longer. Senior inside linebacker Andrew Davis led the way with 12 stops, two tackles for loss and a caused fumble. Linebacker Johan Ayala (9 tackles, 2 TFL, 1 sack, 1 caused fumble) also had a big game. Nick Ivy (7 tackles, 1 sack, 2 TFL), Tice Edwards (7 tackles, fumble recovery) and Cedric Biddle (6 tackles, TFL, fumble recovery) rounded out the top five tacklers. On the other side of the ball, the Titans got a huge performance from senior quarterback Adam Randolph, who threw for 298 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 65 yards and another score. Receiver Andruw Randolph caught seven passes for 120 yards and a score, while tailback J.C. Olivo had two catches for 109 yards and a TD. Randolph’s 298 yards represent the second-highest single-game total in school history, and only once before had the Titans produced a pair of 100-yard receivers in the same game. But not everything went according to plan. As in every game, there was some adversity. In this case, Olivo was disqualified from the contest late in the first half and his absence was noticeable in the Titans’ running game. But Morgan said he was happy with the way the team responded. “I felt like after J.C. was disqualified, we blocked some things really well but just didn’t hit the holes correctly,” he said. “But when things went south for us a little bit, they didn’t let it affect them one bit. Defensively, we were where we were supposed to be most of the time, and the thing is, they just played so hard. I thought late in the game, we were still strong.” It’s safe to say the Titans’ performance in the opener earned a passing grade, but Morgan said it would take another solid outing tonight when McDowell plays its first road game in Newland against the Avery Vikings (7:30 kickoff). The Vikings (0-1) are coming off a 50-7 thrashing by Ashe County in Week 1, but Morgan said that score is deceiving. Ashe is a solid club with five, three-year starters on the offensive line and a 215-pound tailback. Ashe held Avery to nine nets yards rushing while rolling up 514 yards of offense. “Ashe is pretty dang good,” said Morgan. “Avery is real young, but they play hard. Their quarterback, Sam McCollum, is extremely talented and has great speed. Their inside linebackers are not bad and they attack downhill, and they’ve got a great big nose guard. We’ll have to play well.” The Titans have done just that in recent years against Avery. McDowell has taken three in a row from the Vikings, including a 43-6 win last season in the first game on the Titans’ new artificial turf. McDowell holds a 7-4 lead in the all-time series between the two. Notes: Olivo will return to the lineup tonight. He was the Titans’ leading returning rusher with 832 yards and four TDs a year ago…Senior running back Evan Cable suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee last week and will miss the remainder of the season, Morgan said…Linemen Cameron Griffith and Jon Kelley are sick and listed as doubtful for tonight’s game.

Republicans currently hold a 235-193 advantage in the lower chamber of the US Congress. But some Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s low approval rating and strong enthusiasm among its grassroots supporters, they can flip the 24 Republicans they would need to retake control in the November midterm elections. Speaking to his supporters in Michigan at a rally he held in preference to attending the White House correspondents’ dinner in Washington, Mr Trump said it was vital to retain control of the House. “We have to keep the House because if we listen to Maxine Waters, she’s going around saying, ‘We will impeach him, we will impeach him’,” he said. “But then people say, ‘He’s done nothing wrong’. But she says, ‘Oh that doesn’t matter. We will impeach the president’.” Congresswoman Waters of California is among those Democrats who frequently call on Mr Trump to resign or face impeachment. The Hill pointed out that, at the recent Time 100 gala in New York, she urged Mr Trump: “Please resign.” “So that I won’t have to keep up this fight of your having to be impeached, because I don’t think you deserve to be there,” she said. “Just get out.” However, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has warned against Democratic efforts to impeach Mr Trump, saying it would end up harming the party before the midterms. “On the political side I think it’s a gift to the Republicans,” she said on Thursday. “We want to talk about what they’re doing to undermine working families in our country, and what we are doing to increase their payrolls and lower their costs.” A Quinnipiac poll released last Thursday showed that if Democrats win control of the House, more than 70 per cent of their supporters want them to begin impeachment proceedings. Yet for all the talk of a Democratic wave in November, it is far from clear they will get the votes to seize the House. Many observers believe there is a better chance to take control of the Senate. Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report recently wrote: “If a so-called ‘blue wave’ is about to hit in 2018, why isn’t the generic ballot showing a bigger margin for Democrats? “The latest Real Clear Politics average shows Democrats with a 6.5 per cent lead. The FiveThirtyEight.com average has Democrats with a 6.9 per cent lead. If Democrats are cruising to victory in the fall, why does the generic not look more like it did over the summer when it showed Democrats with a double-digit lead?” Ms Walter believes that while some Republicans may feel disgruntled with Mr Trump, many are “coming home” to the party and will vote Republican in November. “Even in a terrible year for the GOP, they are not going to perform much worse in the national vote than 43-44 per cent,” she wrote, saying a deciding factor could be independent voters. In Michigan, Mr Trump cited several Democrats who he believes will lose their seats in November – among them was Democratic senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. After saying Ms Stabenow was standing in the way of protecting US borders and had voted against tax cuts, Mr Trump said: “And you people just keep putting her back again and again and again. It’s your fault.” Earlier on Saturday, Mr Trump had tweeted criticism of Democratic senator Jon Tester of Montana over his role in the failed nomination of White House doctor Ronny Jackson to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, calling for Mr Tester to resign or at least not be re-elected in November. It was reported that Mr Trump railed against the allegations Mr Tester aired against Mr Jackson, and suggested that he could take a similar tack against the senator. He added: “I know things about Tester that I could say too. And if I said ’em, he’d never be elected again.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

Paul Wells is led to hidden drugs in in the community room during a demonstration of WPD Police Dog Fox’s tracking prowess for Lippitt students May 2. [CREDIT: Rob Borkowski] WPD Ptlm. Paul Wells introduces his partner, Fox to Lippitt student May 2. Wells spent about 20 minutes explaining the unique relationship he and Fox share, as the dog is simultaneously his partner, his pet and, in many respects, is considered a law enforcement tool. Wells explained Fox and all dogs in K-9 units are sent into harms way ahead of their human partners. Often, the situations police dogs lead the way on involved people who want to fight an arrest. “He’s going to take some punishment from somebody,” Wells told the students. Wells referenced the recent death of Yarmouth K-9 Officer Sean Gannon, who was shot and killed by Thomas Latanowich, 32, of Somerville while attempting to serve an arrest warrant in Barnstable, MA, April 12. The man also wounded Gannon’s police dog partner, Nero. Usually, Wells said, it’s the dog that bears the worst of the violence. “It’s tragic. It’d break my heart if someone ever hurt my dog like that,” Wells said. Wells also told the students how dogs use their sense of smell to detect the hair, dandruff and skin that everyone leaves behind in an invisible to the eye cloud of particles he likened to the debris that emanates from the Peanuts character Pig Pen. Fox can often tell if someone is in the next room, he said, and also uses his sense of smell to track and discover illegal drugs. Searching for the contraband is like a game to Fox, Wells said. He and Fox demonstrated as he used Fox to search the room for a hidden package, quickly tracking it to a wall-mounted cabinet. Fox and Wells also demonstrated the dog’s apprehension tactics, with the help of a fellow officer who donned a padded sleeve so Fox could show off how he bites and holds fleeing or fighting suspects. The students were led on the visit by Lippitt teachers Judith Monzack and Kim Casacatenla, and escorted on the rest of the tour by Officer Alfred Mallucci, the Veterans Jr. High School resource officer, and Officer Jill Marshall, the school resource officer at Winman Jr. High School. The trip was the children’s first field trip with the school.

(Gena Murph photo) Crenshaw Manor residents united May 19, for their 4th annual block party by focusing on emergency response and safety awareness. The afternoon event, which attracted more than 300 people, featured presentations and information from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Department and Water and Power, Kaiser Permanente, ADT Security Services and the EANET, PC law firm. L.A. City Council President Herb J. Wesson, whose 10th District office donated tables, chairs, a stage and port-a-potties, was also on hand to greet constituents, listen to concerns and perform a few dance steps. In addition, Crenshaw Manor neighbors contributed a range of food and desserts and former resident Darius Farrelly, founder of NPO Youth Entertainment League, provided the music. The party’s emphasis on safety and preparedness stemmed from suggestions by two residents who had participated in the Community Emergency Response Training (CERT) offered by Wesson’s office, said Aneetha Rajan, event co-organizer along with Earlene “Cookie” Anderson. “We thought it was really important for neighbors come together to learn about safety prevention and what to do in the event of a natural disaster,” explained Rajan. “So, we applied for a grant from the West Adams Neighborhood Council and they approved our application, which gave us to raise enough money for [emergency response] backpacks and to hire students from the Dorsey High School Culinary Arts Program to work the tables and register people who attended.” Students from the Dorsey High School Culinary Arts Program serve the wide range of food donated by Crenshaw Manor residents. (Gena Murph photo) Everyone who registered was entered in a drawing offering gifts courtesy of retailers from the Crenshaw Baldwin Hills Mall and local businesses. Other supporters included Watt Companies, Community Health Councils, City National Bank, Fred Leeds Properties, RING and DF Enterprizes. Crenshaw Manor is a small community bordered by Crenshaw Blvd. on the east, Potomac on the west, Exposition Blvd. on the north and Martin Luther King Blvd. on the north. The complexion of the area has changed considerably over the last 10 years, leading Wesson to remark, “Take a moment and look in the faces of your neighbor and the people on the stage. Aren’t we just a wonderful variety? “We look like the way the world is supposed to be, where people are not judged by the color of their skin. They’re judged by their deeds and their actions.” Sharing similar comments, resident Bridgette Flewelen said, “It’s actually amazing because the diversity of the community has changed so much. “But, it’s great that we can get together and realize it’s everyone’s neighborhood and we have to learn how to live together,” Flewelen added. “I think that’s really important moving forward.” Stay up to date by getting the lastest LA Sentinel News and Alerts sent to your email inbox.

The 27-year-old supporter of the Islamic State militant group, appeared by video for a brief hearing from his bed in Bellevue Hospital, where he was recovering from injuries he suffered when his homemade bomb ignited but failed to detonate on Monday. Akayed was covered with a white blanket and remained largely expressionless as Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker told him that he had a right to an attorney and did not have to make any statements. Assistant US Attorney Shawn Crowley asked that Akayed be detained without bail. Akayed\'s court-appointed attorney, Amy Gallichio, did not dispute the request, meaning her client that will not be released on bail. In addition to Akayed, three people suffered minor injuries when he attempted to detonate a pipe bomb secured to his midsection in a pedestrian tunnel under the sprawling Port Authority Bus Terminal transportation complex, where many commuters from New York\'s suburbs arrive on buses and transfer to local subways. ""I did it for the Islamic State,"" Akayed told police after the blast, according to papers filed by federal prosecutors. Akayed, who has lived in the United States since 2011, began his self-radicalization in 2014 when he started viewing pro-Islamic State materials online, prosecutors said. He carried out his attack because he was angry over US policies in the Middle East, they said. Inside Akayed\'s passport, which was recovered from his home, were handwritten notes, including one that read, ""O AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE."" The charges he faces include providing material support to terrorists, use of a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a place of public use. The attack was the latest inspired by militants to hit the United States\' biggest city by population. In October, an Uzbek immigrant killed eight people by racing a rental truck down a bike bath. Also in October, an Afghan-born US citizen was convicted of planting two bombs in New York\'s Chelsea neighbourhood in 2016, one of which exploded and wounded 30 people.

Shawn,Crowley,['http://www.kolotv.com/content/news/473970453.html'],b'7178',"['NEW YORK (AP) — A New Jersey man who set off small bombs in two states, including a pressure cooker device that blasted shrapnel across a New York City block, was sentenced Tuesday to multiple terms of life in prison by a judge who repeatedly called it a miracle nobody was killed. Ahmad Khan Rahimi, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, was criticized by a prosecutor for failing to show remorse and was scolded by a victim for not apologizing to the 30 people he injured. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman in Manhattan said it was hard to reconcile the ""reasonable enough"" man he saw in court with the terrorist who tried to kill as many people as he could when he left his home early the morning of Sept. 17, 2016, with two pressure-cooker explosives and a bag full of smaller bombs. ""You sound like most people and yet your actions are totally at odds with your voice,"" Berman said. ""We saw videos,"" he said, referencing multiple videos at his fall trial that showed Rahimi dragging bombs in two suitcases and a backpack through Manhattan streets, setting one down a half hour before it exploded in the upscale Chelsea neighborhood and another a few blocks away that was discovered and disabled before it could explode. ""It\'s really hard to square the way you appear in court to that other behavior,"" Berman said. Regardless, the judge said, Rahimi deserved multiple life prison terms. One life term was mandatory but the judge exercised his discretion by imposing life sentences for counts that Rahimi\'s defense lawyer said deserved only a 15-year sentence. He also ordered $562,803 in restitution. Berman called Rahimi, 30, a ""clear and present danger"" and said it was too big a risk not to impose a life sentence, especially after Rahimi offered ""not an ounce of justification"" for his crimes. The Chelsea explosion happened just hours after a small pipe bomb exploded along a Marine Corps road race in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, frightening participants but injuring no one. The bombings triggered a two-day manhunt that ended in a shootout with police in Linden, New Jersey. Rahimi was shot several times but survived. Police officers also were injured. Given a chance to speak, Rahimi, shackled at the ankles, portrayed himself as a victim, saying he came to America as a 7-year-old boy with no hatred for anyone and was raised by a father in a household where there was no mention of what his father experienced during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He described how his father went to law enforcement on multiple occasions to report suspicious behavior he had seen in his son, but ultimately felt let down. ""I don\'t harbor hate for anyone,"" Rahimi said before describing how he believed law enforcement targeted him once he became a practicing Muslim. Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley immediately followed Rahimi, saying he had just ""blamed everyone else"" after causing so much destruction through crimes ""fueled by hate."" ""He has shown no remorse,"" Crowley said. ""He\'s proud of what he has done."" She described Rahimi\'s efforts to radicalize fellow prisoners at the federal jail in New York where he has been imprisoned since his arrest. Rahimi, prosecutors said, gave inmates copies of terrorist propaganda and jihadist materials, including speeches and lectures by al-Qaida founder Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric who inspired attacks on America and was killed in a U.S. airstrike in September 2011. Rahimi also allowed some inmates to view materials on his laptop or provided electronic copies as he spread ""The Book of Jihad,"" bomb-making instructions and various issues of a propaganda magazine. Defense attorney Xavier Donaldson called it ironic that his client had once aspired to be a police officer and worked as a security guard after studying criminal justice at a community college. He urged a sentence not based on what people think terrorists might inspire or the fear they may cause. After the sentence was announced, Berman invited several victims watching the proceedings to speak. Pauline Nelson, 48, of Brooklyn, stepped to the podium. She was hospitalized when the car she was driving was jolted by the explosion. She\'s still being treated for muscle spasms in her back. ""You never apologized to anyone in the courtroom,"" she said, staring at the bearded Rahimi, who sat at the defense table, shackles on his ankles. ""You have no remorse for what you did.""

She’s still being treated for muscle spasms in her back. “You never apologized to anyone in the courtroom,” she said, staring at the bearded Rahimi, who sat at the defense table, shackles on his ankles. “You have no remorse for what you did.” Get Morning Report and other email newsletters', 'Rahimi, widely known as the “Chelsea Bomber,” was convicted on eight counts including using a weapon of mass destruction. One of the bombs he set off during his attack was intended to kill participants in a Marine Corps charity race in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, but the carnage he planned was averted when the race schedule was changed. It is also fortunate that one of the bombs he set in Chelsea failed to detonate, and that he did not get a chance to use the six pipe bombs he had ready to go. Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley said it was a “miracle” no one was killed by his attacks. Prosecutors said Rahimi imbibed jihadi propaganda, including the writings of al-Qaeda leaders Anwar al-Awlaki and Osama bin Laden, and actively sought to recruit other inmates while in prison. Somehow he got his hands on an impressive terrorist library in prison, because prosecutors accused him of providing other inmates with Awlaki and bin Laden speeches, instructions for making bombs, books about jihad, and copies of al-Qaeda’s magazine Inspire. In a letter to an associate in Germany, he said American hands are “drenched with Muslim blood.” His journal was filled with praise for Islamic terrorists. His own father called him a terrorist and criticized the FBI for not detecting and arresting his son sooner. Nevertheless, Rahimi took no responsibility for his actions at his sentencing, instead accusing the authorities of persecuting him because he is Muslim. His father claims he said, “Thank God I didn’t kill anybody, that’s good news for me,” which is not exactly a statement of remorse. “I don’t harbor hate toward anyone,” Rahimi insisted at his sentencing. “You have no remorse. God forgive you,” said one of his victims, Pauline Nelson, who was present for the sentencing. Rahimi’s attorney described him as a “complicated person” and said he intends to appeal the two life sentences plus 30 years he was given. The attorney also sent a letter to the judge indicating that Rahimi has been studying “business, entrepreneurship, and drama” while in prison and asking that he be “allowed to avail himself of any educational opportunities” in the future. Rahimi was sentenced to pay over half a million dollars in restitution to his victims, which he could theoretically earn by working in prison. The court was asked to incarcerate Rahimi in or near Virginia to make family visitation easier. “Rahimi’s conviction and sentencing are victories for New York City and our nation in the fight against terror,” declared U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S.

Shawn,Crowley,['https://www.courthousenews.com/trial-date-set-for-port-authority-bombing-suspect/'],b'7176',"['MANHATTAN (CN) – Suspected Port Authority bomber Akayed Ullah will stand trial on Oct. 29, just a year shy of the botched explosion in which Ullah sustained the only injuries from the pipe bomb strapped to his chest. In addition to scheduling the 27-year-old’s trial at a hearing Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan set a deadline for July 17 for Ullah’s attorneys to file any motions. Defense attorney Amy Gallicchio estimated that she has to review 263 hours of video from Ullah’s files. “We have really just scratched the surface,” she said, referring to the evidence, which will require Arabic and Bengali translation. Making the trial preparation more difficult, Gallicchio said, is her client’s detention in a special housing unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where inmates are typically held in solitary confinement. Assistant U.S. Attorney Shawn Crowley revealed that the footage includes “dozens” of videos related to the Islamic State group and the “Hereafter” series by Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric who inspired several convicted terrorists. Awlaki and his son were killed in a 2011 predator drone strike in Yemen. Prosecutors also say they have surveillance video showing Ullah attempting to detonate the bomb on Dec. 11, 2017. Ullah faces up to life imprisonment if convicted of charges that include supporting a foreign terrorist organization, using a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, destroying public property and using a destructive device in a crime of violence. Gallicchio said that she would consider filing motions to suppress statements Ullah made after her arrest. While she did not specify which ones, prosecutors claim that Ullah told investigators: “I did it for the Islamic State.” After being treated for his injuries at Bellevue Hospital, Ullah went to federal court in January, where he said he would plead “at this moment, not guilty.” Ullah’s defense attorneys may also consider filing a motion to change the venue from the Southern District of New York.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1023224.0

Bringing the legal system to light. Our weekly newsletter sheds light on the lawsuits, people, and organizations that continually clog the legal system in Louisiana. Terms of Service Wednesday, October 10, 2018 Join Our Newsletter Join Our Newsletter | Get the App By Glenn Minnis | May 16, 2018 NEW ORLEANS — The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana has granted a motion for default judgment in a case brought by a man who claimed he was injured by a forklift that was operated by an employee of the company that was named as the defendant in the suit. In June 2017, Shawn Crowley, a vacuum operator for Associated Wholesale Grocers Inc., claimed he was injured while working at AWG’s warehouse when he was struck by a forklift operated by a driver employed as a subcontractor by defendant LMS Intellibound LLC. Crowley claimed that he suffered a severe left leg injury, including a large laceration from his heel up to the back of his knee. Court records show that he also alleges that he to “continues to suffer from various medical issues as a result of this incident.” Roughly two months after the incident, Crowley filed suit, arguing that LMS Intellibound should be held liable for its driver. Crowley then filed a motion for default judgment, claiming that LMS Intellibound never filed a responsive pleading within the legally allotted timeframe and failed to request an extension of any kind. In rendering its verdict, the court found that Crowley had legally satisfied all the requirements needed to be granted a default judgment in his favor, including the standard of vicarious liability. “First, there are no material facts in dispute because [the] defendant failed to file an answer or Rule 12 motion,” U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier wrote in the court\'s decision, adding that ""the court is not aware of any facts that would lead it to set aside the default judgment if challenged by the defendant.” Crowley’s award of $932,145.32 included $450,000 for general damages and $260,855 for future lost wages. “Considering the extent and severity of [the] plaintiff’s injuries, his subsequent hospitalization, extensive treatment, the development of bilateral lymphedema, his residual foot and leg disfigurement, his sensory loss, deviated gate, impaired mobility and significant weight gain, the court concludes that $450,000.00 is an appropriate amount for [the] plaintiff’s pain, suffering and disability based on the foregoing testimony and evidence presented,” Barbier said.

Rainfall possibly over one inch. Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:25 pm Sports Editor The Hiwassee College Lady Tigers returned home to Rudy Youell Gymnasium on Saturday to host Judson College, and the Lady Tigers dominated in every phase of the game and 14 different players scored en route to an 87-33 win over their guests from Judson. “It’s a great day when you win by 50, man,” Lady Tigers coach Meagan Price said. Madison Cade opened with a 3-pointer for Judson, but Hiwassee quickly took over the game. Aaliyah Pitner answered with a trey of her own and Hailey Browning, Valerie Cheek, and J’Lynn Majors each added a bucket to put together a fast 9-3 lead for the home team. A handful of Lady Tigers, including Cheek and Shominique Pearson, chipped in baskets the rest of the first quarter, while the visiting Lady Eagles made just three shots from the field, and Hiwassee led by 18 after one quarter. Hiwassee opened the second quarter on a 15-0 run with five different players chipping in points before a second Cade 3-pointer sank through the net to stop the run. The Lady Tigers jumped right back into defense, however, and didn’t allow another field goal in the first half. “It’s so funny- when we got back from Thanksgiving break, we played really poor defensively against Alice Lloyd at their place, and when we got back I said ‘guys, we’re not getting out a basketball, we’re working on defense for three straight days’,” Price said. “And so they came in and put in hard work, and it was constant, working on close-outs, contesting, working on being in help side. They really bought in and it paid off tonight.” Meanwhile, Crystal Ealey and Pearson worked hard inside and came away with points and rebounds and the pair helped Hiwassee to a 51-11 halftime lead. Judson and Hiwassee traded 3-pointers to kick off the second half, but the Lady Tigers continued to pull away with an 11-0 run, highlighted by a Cheek 3-pointer and two baskets by Ealey. Cade, Haley King, and Libby Whitlen all made shots for Judson in the third quarter, but it was not enough to whittle down the Hiwassee lead and the Lady Tigers took a 50-point lead heading to the final stanza. Pearson came up big again for Hiwassee in the late moments, racking up 6 points in the final quarter. Kathaleen Alomar added two free throws and Cheek and Kendra King nailed late baskets to send Judson home with an 87-33 loss. “It’s nice to have both (Pearson and Cheek),” Price said. “Valerie Cheek is a sophomore and Shominique Pearson is a freshman and I feel like taking both of them and building off of that, our team is getting better being disciplined and showing up. If one person doesn’t show up, the other person does the next night, so it’s nice to have them to build on that when we have such a young group and that group has so much talent.” 14 Lady Tigers scored at least 2 points in the win. Cheek led the way with 18 points, including four 3-pointers, and Pearson added 14. Browning was the only other Lady Tiger in double figures with 10 points, and Ealey and Ny’Asia Holmes added 7 apiece in an effort that saw offense come from all sides. “We’ve been working on making the extra pass and working on our zone offense more, and getting more movement out of it and not trying to score on the second or third pass, cause I told them you can always get a good shot at the beginning but we want a great shot near the end of the shot clock,” Price said.” Cade and Whitlen led Judson with 11 each, and no other player scored more than 5 for the Lady Eagles.

Kendra,King,['https://hypepotamus.com/companies/how-we-work-sapientrazorfish/'],b'7170',"['April 19, 2018 by Muriel Vega This is part of our How We Work series, which focuses on how successful southeastern tech companies are developing authentic work cultures. In late 2016, digital agencies SapientNitro and Razorfish merged to form one global entity: SapientRazorfish. The agency helps companies reposition their branding and business model to be more customer-centric, concentrating their efforts where its most valuable to optimize relationships — and profits. At the helm of efficiently merging these two formerly-competing agencies was Kendra King, VP, Strategy and Consulting Lead for the south region. King created and oversaw the programming behind obtaining feedback from the merging teams, as well as collaborated with the culture and people experience team to create a new work culture that both companies could embrace. Now with more than 12,000 employees and 70 offices around the globe, SapientRazorfish has to be intentional about recruiting the right people to fit into their service-oriented agency. By promoting a feedback-based culture through multi-day onboarding sessions, King and the team add a personal touch to an often-faceless process. “Sometimes you don’t even get to speak to someone, you’re uploading your resume on a portal and then you get an email six months later to let you know you didn’t get the job,” says King. “That’s not okay. The idea that you’ve taken the time to interview with us means we’re going to make it more personal and provide feedback.” Here, King shares more about how the two agencies came together under one mission after being competitors, building a collaborative and feedback-based culture, and how their onboarding process provides immediate colleagues to new employees. How did you start building the new culture surrounding this new integrated team? Prior to the merger, SapientNitro had a culture and people experience team that was tasked with managing things just like this. It’s all about how are we going to build a culture locally. We assembled various teams, with one team dedicated specifically to thinking about the actions and behaviors that we wanted to co-create. We also looked at how do we relate to each other as people? And that was focused on community building. We don’t use the terminology ‘legacy’ — that’s the Legacy RazorFish or the Legacy SapientNitro. One of the things we did here — and all the offices have their version of it — but in our region we had a campaign called “Better Together.” The idea that you can’t have peanut butter without jelly. And so if we’re better together, then we don’t think of ourselves separately — of course we recognize that we came from two very strong organizations, but now we’re together. There was a lot of focus on the mechanics behind the merger, but then there was also a great focus placed on how are we going to work together as people and how are we going to move forward as once competitors, now toward the same goal. Once leadership got on the same page, how did you encourage feedback from employees? We wanted to make sure that everyone’s voice was heard. We conducted focus groups at that time; we had town halls in both offices, giving people the opportunity to voice any concerns and ask questions. In focus groups, people could speak if they wanted to, but to help those that maybe did not want to vocalize their feelings we did a collage-building exercise and gave people the opportunity to pick images and phrases from magazines that really showed how they felt. We had these collages that were focused on the past, recognizing there was a past, how we may feel now and then where we want this to go quickly. One of the insights that came out of it was pretty cool. Before, if we were a movie we would be ‘Batman v. Superman’, and then the future state of what we wanted to be was ‘The Avengers.’ We shared the results at a town hall meeting and then we had various task forces, one focused on communication, making sure that everyone knew what was going on. We had formal communication that would come out from leadership, but then we also had managers make themselves available and give people bite-size information. That’s something that came out of the research that was really helpful — just a cadence of communication. Now as SapientRazorfish, how do you approach recruiting? I learned pretty quickly that we, as one company, have a process that reflected both organizations. We’re pretty thorough, so that’s one thing that I take pride in. We take a lot of care in terms of finding the people who are going to help our organization grow. We will find diverse candidates at a career fair, marketing event or through a referral. We learn about the prospective employee and see if they would be a good fit. They would be vetted by a recruiter for a phone screening. If you don’t pass the phone screening then you would get a follow-up email and feedback about your interview. If you did pass the screening, the employees would go through interviews at the local office with feedback at every step of the process. We approach recruiting from a macro to micro perspective. It’s not unusual for people to have to give a case study review. It could be a project we’re currently working on — we want to know if this person would be complementary to the team or provide some input that we wouldn’t have considered. Getting people more into real-life situations early on is helpful. If not chosen as a candidate, you mention that you still give feedback to the candidate on why they weren’t a good fit? We are a feedback culture. Because sometimes you don’t know how people are perceiving you — this isn’t just in the interviewing process, this is in general. At meetings, we always say before we adjourn, I want feedback, and this could be from the CEO, this could be from the president. It doesn’t matter about your rank in the organization. People want to know how something could be improved and this transfers over to the recruiting process. We think it’s only fair that if someone has taken the time to sit and interview with us that we give them feedback in terms of how the interview went. How does your JumpStart program for new employees help them feel more comfortable as the new kid in the office? We educate new hires in a week-long, in-depth onboarding program. This is designed for all employees. You could be a junior associate that’s sitting next to a senior executive. Again, that’s another theme you’ll see throughout our organization is that we really appreciate diversity in different capacities including rank. Everyone has a say. We mix everyone together and all employees begin with this on day one. During JumpStart, which moves around offices, you will have the opportunity to mix and mingle with some of the people in the local office. As a new employee you get to understand a wide range of topics, from the purpose of our company, to how you can grow individually, to expense reporting. You have a good sense of how to maneuver in your local office, but then also within the broader organization. Everyone that starts at a particular JumpStart program will meet people from different locations, not necessarily in the same region. All of the sudden you already know people, which is important for our organization because while we have regional opportunities and local offices, you have the opportunity to work across the U.S or even globally if that’s what you desire. Those connections really come in handy. Why is it important to sponsor diversity within the company? How does it benefit the clients once you’re working on the projects and the team? You can look at diversity different ways, but regardless it’s about mixing things up. Innovation is not possible if you continue to do the same things that you have always done. And so having lots of different voices and perspectives and experiences at the table, being vocal in helping to construct new ideas, helps our clients make decisions. To help create what we don’t even know is possible is done, in my opinion, through diversity. That could be diversity of age, race, gender, or experience. One thing that I have really appreciated being on the digital side is the fact that you have such varied talent at the table. So, yes, you have your people who may be in communications and advertising, but you’re sitting at the table with a technologist or with a consultant who has financial or healthcare experience, and bring all of those experiences together. It’s pretty cool when we start to make the magic happen because you have people being able to push you in different directions and really challenge you to be the best you can. I think diversity is extremely important for the employee personally, but then to our clients. How does SapientRazorfish prioritize outreach within the community? We are very supportive of different industry events. We’re doing quite a bit of outreach. We are participating in the 3% conference, a movement promoting women creative directors. We are there with the American Advertising Federation in support of their multicultural student program that occurs annually; Women Who Code as well. These are things that are really important to our people and something that the company gets behind and supports. It’s important for prospective employees to know that this is a place that is really committed to developing our talents, but then also trying to create an environment where everyone feels valued.

Competitors head to the finish line in the 50-meter run during Special Olympics at Eastern Illinois University in Charleston on Friday. CHARLESTON -- Eight-year-old athlete Owen Figgins\' family members were easy to spot in their matching ""Owen\'s Fan Club"" T-shirts on Friday during the Special Olympics spring games at Eastern Illinois University. Owen\'s mother, Kendra King of Windsor, said he likes the matching T-shirts that are part of his older brother Ben\'s baseball games, so her family decided to get ""Fan Club"" shirts for Owen\'s debut as an athlete in the spring games. She said Owen was previously in the Special Olympics Young Athletes sport and play program for three years. ""We just wanted to show our support,"" King said, as she wore her ""Owen\'s Fan Club"" T-shirt with ""Mom"" in big, bold letters on the back. During the area\'s annual spring games on Friday at EIU\'s O\'Brien Stadium, Owen competed in the 50-meter run and the tennis ball throw as part of the team from Franklin School in Mattoon. King said Owen practiced his sports at school and at home, where he played baseball with his brother Ben. Owen said he likes ""running fast,"" throwing the ball overhand, and hanging out with his friends in the Special Olympics program. ""I just love (Special Olympics) because the kids get the opportunity to be like every other kid for a day,"" King said. The spring games were projected to draw more than 400 athletes from a 12-county area. The athletes competed in adult and youth divisions based on ability level in 18 sports. Don and Lisa Loney of Sullivan turned out to watch their niece, 18-year-old Madison Moll, compete in the 50-yard dash and softball throw events as part of the Sullivan school district\'s team. Don Loney said he appreciates that each athlete at the spring games wins a medal of some kind. Lisa Loney said the athletes are always so proud of getting their medals. They said Madison has been a gold medalist in the past and served as a torch bearer at the Special Olympics games at Millikin University in Decatur. Lisa Loney said Madison practiced hard in preparation for the spring games at EIU. ""She said last night she was outside running with her head lamp on,"" Lisa Loney noted. Those who won gold medals during Friday\'s games qualified for the state Special Olympics summer games, which will take place at Illinois State University in Normal and Illinois Wesleyan University in Bloomington from June 15-17. Zach Plummer, 21, of Charleston said he felt good about winning a gold medal in the softball throw at the spring games, especially considering that this was his first time as a Special Olympics athlete. He also was preparing to compete in the long jump event as part of the team from CCAR Industries in Charleston. Zach\'s cheer section included his parents, Dan and Kari Plummer. ""We are pretty proud of him,"" Kari Plummer said. Dan Plummer said they tried for several years to talk Zach into competing in Special Olympics. He said their shy son decided to give the games a try after he recently started working at CCAR. Dan Plummer said he was impressed to see so many volunteers ""chip in"" to make the spring games possible. A small army of volunteers helped check in the athletes, guide them through the games, and serve up refreshments for them. Friday\'s opening ceremonies featured a parade of athletes who recited the Special Olympics oath of ""Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt."" Also during the ceremonies, Consolidated Communications, Inc. President Dick Lumpkin received the area Special Olympics\' Midge McDowell Lifetime Service Award. Lumpkin partnered with McDowell to create the annual Special Olympics Family Festival in 1984. This festival hosted by Consolidated Communications continues to be held every year at Lake Land College in Mattoon.

The Virginia Department of Education’s Profile of a Virginia Graduate is a framework for new standards aimed at aligning high school curricula with the economic needs of the state. A law approved by the 2016 General Assembly and signed by former Gov. Terry McAuliffe directed the Virginia Board of Education to develop and implement the Profile to help high school students be successful in the global economy as it is shaped by new technologies. According to a draft of the Board of Education’s revised standards of accreditation, “stakeholders have asked that graduates be prepared with skills and attributes such as critical thinking, creative thinking, communication, collaboration, and citizenship in order to be prepared to be successful in life and competitive in the work world.” The new standards proposed by the VDOE would allow students to take fewer Standards of Learning tests to earn their diplomas. Advanced and standard diplomas would each require five verified credits instead of the nine currently required for an advanced diploma and six for a standard diploma. Kendra King, director of student services and achievement for the city school division, said the Profile of a Virginia Graduate still is being revised to ensure it complies with the federal Every Students Succeeds Act. “The VDOE continues to define the Profile of a Virginia Graduate; the dust has not settled,” she said. “Our state department is waiting for next steps from the federal government to determine the direction of their continued development of the Profile.” VDOE officials have said the department hopes to allow students who do not pass SOL tests to receive a limited number of “locally awarded verified credits” from their school boards. This option currently is only available to special education students. Instead of an SOL test, students could earn a locally awarded verified credit by completing an “authentic assessment,” consisting of a task or project that would be graded on a rubric. “That is in discussion, and we all got very excited about it, ... but we are unable to do that until we get the approval [from the state],” city Superintendent Rosa Atkins said. “We do not want to hand out any of those details until it is approved.” The new standards also would require high schools to expand opportunities for students to gain work experience through internships and externships, and to attain workforce and career readiness and industry credentials. School Board member Amy Laufer asked if the school division had identified businesses where students could be placed for internships. “I don’t think there is a road map to developing the curriculum [the VDOE] is asking us to provide,” Laufer said. Atkins said students would also be able to develop workforce skills in their school, or through virtual experiences. “The reality is, we don’t have as many businesses in this community as could house each of our students,” Atkins said. “I applaud [the VDOE] for thinking outside the box and giving us some leeway,” she said. Eric Irizarry, principal of Charlottesville High School, said CHS students already have opportunities to complete capstone projects in engineering, photography, urban farming and other subjects, sometimes in partnership with local companies and businesses. Teachers for Tomorrow, a statewide program for recruiting high school students into the teaching profession, is a new addition to the high school’s program of study for 2018-2019. “Teachers for Tomorrow helps students develop skills in leadership areas with a focus on teaching,” Irizarry said. “We would love for more of our students to enter the education field and come back here.” Atkins and Irizarry said Charlottesville City Schools’ latest strategic plan, adopted by the School Board in 2017, was designed with the Profile of a Virginia Graduate in mind. “Our strategic plan was built around the Profile,” Irizarry said. “We knew this was coming. It’s just a matter of putting the pathways in place for our students.” Charlottesville City Schools has been relatively quiet about its preparation for the new state standards in comparison with the neighboring Albemarle County school system. In 2016, Albemarle County Public Schools launched High School 2022, an initiative to redesign the county’s high school curriculum and to plan for the modernization and construction of high school facilities. Albemarle laid the groundwork for High School 2022 at four School Board meetings and a division-wide community meeting in 2016 and 2017. Additional community meetings were also held at middle schools throughout the county. This fall, Albemarle’s high schools will introduce a required freshman seminar on social and emotional development concepts. The county school division also is expected open a small student center to support internships and project-based learning in leased space at the Seminole Place industrial facility. © 2005-2018 Charlottesville Tomorrow All Rights Reserved', 'Please purchase a subscription to continue reading.

David,Fernandez,['https://www.villarrealusa.com/2018/5/23/17348748/this-was-the-season-that-was'],b'7165',"['The season is concluded, and Villarreal have qualified for Europe again, finishing in fifth place in La Liga. Considering: (1) Bruno Soriano played exactly ZERO minutes this season, (2) Cedric Bakambu was sold in late December after playing 15 games in the league, (3) we fired Fran Escriba and replaced him with a coach, Javi Calleja, who had just started coaching our B team in the Segunda B, I’d say we did pretty well. Highlights of the season included doing the double over Valencia and winning in the Bernabeu for the first time ever, and a home win over Atletico Madrid courtesy of super-sub Enes Ünal. And of course the emergence of Rodrigo Hernandez, though we only got to enjoy him for this season. Lowlights? Escriba’s last match (4-0 drubbing by Getafe) and home losses to Sevilla, Alaves, and Bilbao come to mind, the Sevilla one especially bad since we led 2-0 before giving up three goals. And, yes, we had an unlucky draw coming up against Lyon in the round of 32, but this would have been a good year to have progressed far in the Europa League. Meanwhile, in La Liga: ....There are four Basque Country-based teams in La Liga. Athletic Club has finished bottom of the four; that’s never happened before. And Eibar—little Eibar—finished ahead of the other three!! Well done, especially considering that early in the season they looked dreadful (5 points from their first 9 matches). ....Athletic Club can blame sticking with a meh coach (Ziganda) too long for a large part of their problems, but they’re not the only ones. Real Sociedad and Levante ended the season on hot streaks: Imanol Aguacil replaced Eusebio Sacristan in mid-March and immediately went 5-2-2, 17 points from 9 matches, after 9-5-14 under Sacristan; while Paco Lopez revitalized Levante, going 8-1-1 after predecessor Muñiz could only manage 3 wins in 31 matches!! ...with no fewer than nine teams between 43 and 53 points, and those in positions 9 through 17, it seems as though the (relatively) more equal TV revenues in La Liga may be having an effect. That is, the middle of the league has gotten better relative to the top (excluding the top two or three). It didn’t help the bottom three, though—Deportivo, Las Palmas and Malaga—who finished thirteen points adrift (or more) from the rest. To realize how amazing that statistic is, you have to go back to the 2002-03 season—to find when the difference between 17th and 18th was more than five points (it was seven that year). And—of course—we bid farewell to some iconic players. Andres Iniesta, Fernando Torres, Xabi Prieto are the first that come to mind. Coaches, too, at least with their current clubs: Asier Garitano is leaving Leganés, Juan Carlos Unsué departs Celta, Paco Jémez leaves Las Palmas, and Quique Sanchez Flores was fired by Espanyol in April. And David Fernandez Borbalán has retired as a La Liga (and UEFA) referee after 14 years. In recent years he managed to infuriate both Real Madrid (against Atleti this season) and Barcelona (especially in a Copa match against Athletic Club in 2017). I’ll remember him best for being the ref in the tempestuous Madrid-Villarreal match in January 2011 (the Cani ‘water bottle’ incident). Any particular players I didn’t mention who are retiring?']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

I have been with the NAB for many, many years and like to do my banking face to face. I don\'t like travelling into Warrnambool especially the centre of the city. I will certainly be reviewing where I bank. Alan Parker, Toolong With only minutes warning, on St Patricks Day, we experienced fire driven by 100km/h winds, which launched embers at amazing speed towards our property. The comments (The Standard, April 28) made by Cr Meade of Moyne Shire, and Cr McArthur and Cr Illingworth of Corangamite Shire, regarding roadside vegetation facilitating ‘funnels of fire’ are contemptuous, and demonstrate ignorance of fire ecology and fire behaviour. The vitriol reserved for trees highlights their anti-environment sentiments in proposing clearing roadsides of native vegetation as a fire-prevention strategy. In the fire we lost trees, but we also lost hectares of pasture, kilometres of pine post fencing, machinery, and hundreds of rolls of hay and silage. We lost plastic things, wooden things and metal things. All fuel. All burned. Our home, still standing, is testament to careful and considerate landscape planning, that, amongst other things, incorporates vegetation and trees for fire protection. It is shameful that some of our civic leaders should use this tragic event to fuel their own political agenda, but it is also hurtful to us who are still recovering from and coping with the events and losses of that night. Irwin Lowe, Naroghid I would like to add my comment to the debate on horses working on beaches. I once worked in the racing industry and used the beaches and never had a problem with people and our horses because we used common sense. People used to love watching us work and swim our horses on the Killarney beach. We always respected that not everyone appreciated it and when someone made the comment we would not continue using that area where they were. But in saying that we are now in different times. I believe Warrnambool Racing Club should move with the times and build a state of the art training facility where they have an uphill sand track and a salt water wading and swimming pool.. they want better trainers, then you need better facilities. Barbara Maher, Sebastopol Recently, Premier, Daniel Andrews announced Regional Roads Victoria (RRV). This will be a ""new division"" of VicRoads and will be based in Ballarat with ""staff in regional centres"" across the state, ""focused on building safer roads."" Unfortunately the end result of this will be far worse than the present situation. A new division of VicRoads (RRV) would mean a name change, more staff, more vehicles, more buildings, squandering road funding and taxpayers money. We already have VicRoads staff in regional centres across the state. We do not need extra staff to “focus"" on building safer roads. We actually require roads to be upgraded and maintained. Unfortunately under present legislation, irrelevant of which political party is in power, only a small percentage of road funding actually finds its way to maintaining the road. VicRoads really needs to be replaced with a council-run System. VicRoads has been audited, VicRoads has failed to be responsible, there is an inquiry into VicRoads happening at the moment and a state election coming up later this year. It is not a funding issue, it is a management problem. If common sense were to prevail, then government would replace VicRoads with a council-run system, with all state road funding calculated to x amount per kilometre, then directed to each council. Every state road runs through either a city or shire council. On average, every city or shire council would only need to upgrade 10 km and resurface 20 km each year for 10 years, to maintain every state road throughout Victoria, with a fraction of the present cost. Wallace Hill, Macarthur For over 50 years, The Salvation Army and the Australian community have united to bring hope where it’s needed most through the annual Red Shield Appeal. The Red Shield Appeal is the lifeblood of The Salvation Army. It ensures that we can continue to support the women and children who are fleeing domestic violence, the people trapped in drug and alcohol addiction, the youth who are sleeping on our streets, and so much more. It is the Salvos’ main fundraiser, helping keep the doors open to our many support services. But with more and more people from all walks of life turning to us for assistance, this year we will need as much help as we can get. So we are calling on community groups, sporting clubs, workplaces, families and individuals to get on board and volunteer for the Red Shield Appeal during the month of May. And we are asking people across the country to please donate to this year’s appeal. Even just a small contribution can make an immeasurable difference in someone’s life. Every day, the Salvos live, love and fight for the needs of our community. We can only do this because, year after year, Australians come together to give hope where it\'s needed most.

His previous record, “Bury My Heart,” is an audacious, moving evocation of the Dee Brown’s survey history of the clearing of America’s original population through broken treaties and genocidal war. “ToNow” focuses on a much more constrained conflict, the nine-month protest of the routing of the North Dakota Access Pipeline through the watershed of the Standing Rock Reservation. The band is Scott’s long-running group, with bassist Cameron Ralston, trumpeter Bob Miller, saxophonist Jason Scott, and guitarist Alan Parker, extended with Chicago guitarist Tobin Summerfield. As in the previous record, there are moments of sylvan contemplation balanced with churning intensity. As with “The Dark Side of the Moon”/”Wizard of Oz” synchronicity, the record pairs well with the grainy footage from the actual event.

He chose quite a year for his Cannes baptism. The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the festival had “a record number of attendees” that it estimated at about 35,000 and said the increased population led to “crushing crowds, celebrity mob scenes and hot tempers.” On the other hand, THR was happy the crowd included big Hollywood names including James Stewart (who presented the Palme d’Or to Emir Kusturica’s When Father Was Away on Business); Farrah Fawcett (who got knocked on the head by a camera during the chaos when she arrived); and Cher (who shared the best actress award for Mask and in her acceptance speech went out of her way to thank the screenwriter — but couldn’t remember Anna Hamilton Phelan’s name). As for Birdy, THR had mixed feelings. Though it lauded director Alan Parker’s courage in adapting a novel centered on a schizophrenic Vietnam War veteran who hears voices and wants to become a bird, the review said, “There is some material that is so formidable and forbidding that tackling it makes you doubt the filmmaker’s sanity.” (Parker, who has written about the difficulties he had making the movie, would probably agree.) THR also enjoyed the film’s afterparty, where four white doves were released from a massive cake while Peter Gabriel’s Birdy theme played. The Cannes jury, headed by Milos Forman, liked the drama, but not enough to give it the Palme d’Or. Birdy received the lesser Special Grand Jury prize. This led to a minor post-fest scandal. When it premiered in England, the ads noted Birdy was the “grand prize winner” at Cannes, a tricky way of using the word “grand,” but not exactly accurate.

Noakes, whose portrait of the Queen graces Prince Charles’s wall, explains: ‘Judi was impossible to pin down to do the sitting and now when her portrait is unveiled in Mall Galleries she tells me she won’t be there because she has to go to hospital for an eye appointment. ‘That is why I portrayed Judi with three arms, showing her in a rushed state.’ Irish model Vogue Williams, who is engaged to Pippa Middleton’s brother-in-law Spencer Matthews, says her pregnancy is the reason clients have not renewed her contracts. ‘A couple of brands that I loved working with, and was contracted to work with for another year, dropped me,’ she says. ‘It just felt like, it’s hard enough to be a woman without having to put up with this s*** too.’ Tory Mp and Brexiteer Ian Liddell-Grainger, right, is challenging the Duke of Wellington to a kippers at dawn duel Tory MP and ardent Brexiteer Ian Liddell-Grainger is so angered by the Duke of Wellington’s anti-Brexit shenanigans in the House of Lords that he is challenging the Duke to a duel. Liddell-Grainger, a cousin of the Queen, happens to be distantly related to the 9th Duke. ‘I am going to challenge him to a duel on a lawn with seconds and all that,’ he says. His weapon of choice? Kippers. 'They can smack each other round the face with the smoked fish. Like an increasing number of Tories, Liddell-Grainger now backs substantial reform or abolition of the Upper House. So even if the Duke wins the duel, he might still be a smelly herring politically. There is a downside to sharing your name with someone in the eye of a media storm. Just ask film director Sir Alan Parker. He says that he gets confused with the other Sir Alan Parker, the former chair of Save The Children, who resigned from the charity amid claims of a cover-up of sex abuse allegations against two of his friends. ‘When I try and make a restaurant reservation they say: “Is it the Alan Parker?” Now with all the news reports about him I’m worried that I’ll never get a table again’.

YOU may hear faint echoes of “La La Land” and “Chico & Rita” in Pawel Pawlikowski’s music-based tragicomedy, in that it charts the on-off relationship of a talented male pianist/composer and a magnetic female performer. But the Polish-British writer-director of “My Summer of Love” and the Oscar-winning “Ida” has composed something unique. The best entry so far at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, “Cold War” is a moving and gorgeously shot period romance which recreates the mid-20th-century in flawless, unshowy detail, and which asks which siren song calls most seductively: art, love, freedom or home. Mr Pawlikowski doesn’t play a single bum note. In its opening scenes, it looks as if “Cold War” is going to be an Eastern European answer to Alan Parker’s “Fame”. The film’s rakish, middle-aged hero, Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), is forming a state-sponsored folk-music ensemble in 1949. His job is to gather 20 or 30 singers and dancers from all over rural Poland, install them in a tumbledown stately home, and arrange and rehearse their peasant songs until they are ready to put on prestigious concerts, thus selling a tidied-up version of the nation’s cultural identity both to the wider world and to war-damaged Poland itself. In short, he has to make music which is Polish, but with polish. Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks. It’s up to the viewer to judge how seriously Wiktor takes his assignment. Unlike his right-hand woman, Irena (Agata Kulesza, possessor of the hardest hard stare since Paddington), he has learnt to keep his opinions to himself. But as his students hone their heartbroken laments and their vigorous, stompy dances, Wiktor is drawn to Zula (the terrific Joanna Kulig), a tough blonde singer who has more ambition and more secrets than any of her peers. She is drawn to him, too, not least because the tall and wolfish Mr Kot would have been cast as James Bond if he had been born in Britain. “Are you interested in my talent, or in me in general?” asks Zula during one flirtatious singing lesson. Well, we all know the answer to that one. Unfortunately, Zula has also caught the piggy eye of a Communist Party stooge (Boris Szyc) who thinks that the ensemble’s repertoire should include some catchy numbers about Stalin’s agriculture reforms. The lovers are tempted to defect whenever they perform in or near western Europe. But how would they fare as exiles in other countries and with other musical genres? As fraught as their life in Poland may be, would they be as suited to the smoky jazz clubs of Paris as they are to the concert halls of Warsaw? And, considering that they’re not exactly the cheeriest or most effusive people in the world, could they be happy anywhere? (Zula and Wiktor were inspired by Mr Pawlikowski’s parents, he has said. “They were both strong, wonderful people, but as a couple a never-ending disaster.”) One of the film’s many intoxicating pleasures is how unpredictable it is. The auditions and rehearsal scenes—that is, the “X-Factor” /“Poland’s Got Talent” section—are left behind with surprising haste, and from then on “Cold War” never stops moving. Every so often, Mr Pawlikowski cuts to a black screen, and when the picture returns, you never know how many years will have passed, or which city Wiktor and Zula will be in, or whether or not they will still be an item. Wherever or whenever they are, though, “Cold War” is always a spikily funny yet deeply sympathetic study of its conflicted characters, and it looks fantastic. Like “Ida”, the film is shot by Lucasz Zal in crisp black and white, with contrasts as stark as they are on a page of sheet music; the blacks are “none more black”, as Spinal Tap would say, and the whites are luminous. It’s one of those rare films that you could pause at random at any moment, and have an image that’s striking enough to put on the poster. It is also shot in narrow “Academy format”—ie, the screen is almost square—which is appropriate for a film with the economy and immediacy of a foot-tapping pop hit. Mr Pawlikowski’s ambitious saga spans several years and visits several countries. But as sagas go, it’s short and to the point, with much left unexplained and unspoken, and a brisk 84-minute running time. Yet however far “Cold War” ranges, it stays focused on Wiktor and Zula and the sweet music they make together. You may well have the urge to rewatch it as soon as it’s finished, just as you’d want to listen to a favourite record again straight after the last track has faded. by N.B.

David Wood, who was parachuted in to replace Mark Newton-Jones just weeks ago, will lay bare the challenge the chain faces at Mothercare’s annual results on Thursday. A consensus of City analysts forecast the group will post a 95% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to just £1 million in the year to March. The figure compares with a profit of £19.7 million last year. It will come alongside an update on Mothercare’s refinancing progress, with the group having mandated KPMG to help it secure additional cash from its lenders HSBC and Barclays. Rothschild is also working with the group to secure outside funding. Since taking the helm in April Mr Wood – who joined from US grocery and pharmaceuticals giant Kmart – has said his “immediate priority” is to ensure Mothercare returns to firmer financial ground. To this end, he is expected to announce an acceleration of its store closure programme, with speculation rife that this will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – a move which would allow it to close loss-making shops and secure rental discounts. Mothercare clearly faces a number of challenges at this time but retains an excellent and still relevant brand in our view Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital Despite its travails Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, struck an upbeat tone. “Mothercare clearly faces a number of challenges at this time but retains an excellent and still relevant brand in our view,” he said. “The new senior management team is now focused upon the previously announced refinancing initiatives whilst also seeing through the ongoing business transformation.” Mothercare also recently announced the departure of its chairman Alan Parker, who “retired from his position” after six years. He has been replaced by Clive Whiley as its interim executive chairman with immediate effect. Retailers across the board have been battered by weak consumer confidence off the back of soaring Brexit-fuelled inflation. They have also had to contend with surging wage costs and eye-watering business rate hikes. Since January, Toys R Us and Maplin have filed for administration, while fashion retailers such as New Look and Select have embarked on radical store closure programmes.

Here we are again. The time has come for an all-new edition of Now Stream This, your number-one source for streaming recommendations on the plethora of streaming services. This edition is loaded with films from several different eras – the ’60s, the ’80s, the ’90s…even the terrible 2000s make an appearance. We have a David Lean masterpiece, a near-perfect neo-noir, an undervalued hard boiled horror movie, one of Christopher Nolan‘s less-talked-about movies, a goofy sci-fi action flick, and more. These are the best movies streaming right now. Let’s get streaming. Release Date: 1962 Genre: Historical epic Director: David Lean Cast: Peter O’Toole, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, José Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, Claude Rains, Arthur Kennedy, Omar Sharif Let’s get this out of the way: watching Lawrence of Arabia on a TV will never compare to seeing it on the biggest screen possible. That said, David Lean‘s historical epic is so masterful that even if you do stream it via FilmStruck, you’ll still be getting a great experience. Lawrence tells the tale of British Lieutenant T.E. Lawrence (Peter O’Toole) as he journeys to Arabia during World War I. Lawrence is supposed to serve as liaison between Arabs and the Brits in the fight against the Turks, but soon goes against his orders to embark on a dangerous adventure. This film is epic in every sense of the word – the scope is huge, the runtime is exhausting, and the story itself feels so heavy that it almost weighs you down. But Lean’s direction and that stunning cinematography elevate it all. The real secret ingredient to making it all work is editor Anne V. Coates, who died this week at the age of 92. Coates finds cohesion in all this story, and also is responsible for creating the best match cut in film history. For fans of: The Bridge on the River Kwai, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Kingdom of Heaven, camels. Release Date: 1997 Genre: Neo-noir Director: Curtis Hanson Cast: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito Few films approach perfection. But Curtis Hanson‘s L.A. Confidential is as near-perfect as any film can hope to get. Hanson and co-writer Brian Helgeland boil down James Ellroy‘s sprawling crime saga into an air-tight neo-noir about violent men in a violent world. The story focuses on three very different cops – ultra-violent hot head Russell Crowe, smug by-the-book Guy Pearce, and showboating Kevin Spacey* – who all get caught up in a murder mystery that goes deeper than first appearances suggest. L.A. Confidential is a master-class in plotting – each scene is in service of the next. If you’ve somehow avoided seeing this, or haven’t seen it in years, I strongly urge you to catch up with it on Netflix. It remains pristine. *Note: Yes, Kevin Spacey is in this. And he’s excellent. But Spacey is also a very toxic personality now, and I felt I would be remiss to not at least provide fair warning here. If the very presence of Spacey is enough of a trigger for you as a viewer, you should probably skip this, since he has a substantial role. For fans of: The Untouchables, Chinatown, American Gangster, Russell Crowe snapping the backs of chairs with his bare hands. Release Date: 1987 Genre: Horror-mystery Director: Alan Parker Cast: Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro, Lisa Bonet, Charlotte Rampling Alan Parker deftly blends horror and mystery with Angel Heart. Think of this as The Big Sleep meets Hellraiser, and you’ll be half-way there. Mickey Rourke is a private eye who gets hired by a super-creepy Robert De Niro to track down a missing singer. The case gets Rourke’s character mixed-up in voodoo and falling deeper into a pit of Satanic mystery. Often employing an abstract approach – long shadows, close-ups on blood splashes on walls, disembodied sounds – Parker conjures up a feeling of dread from the get-go. There’s a twist here that you might see coming, but it doesn’t matter. Angel Heart is so stylishly put together and so engaging that its obviousness is an afterthought. Release Date: 1981 Genre: Extra sweaty neo-noir Director: Lawrence Kasdan Cast: William Hurt, Kathleen Turner, Richard Crenna Solo: A Star Wars Story screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan helms this steamy, sweaty flick about sex, murder and everything in between. William Hurt is a weak-willed lawyer who gets mixed up with ultra-hot, ultra-dangerous dame Kathleen Turner during a blistering heat wave. Body Heat is a throwback to 1940s noir, and as a result, Kasdan attempts to blend eras – not always successfully. The story is set in 1980s, but everyone acts like they’re from three decades earlier. No matter: Body Heat is a hoot, and Turner sizzles on the screen as she gets Hurt mixed up in a plot to off her husband (Richard Crenna). Is there plenty of smooth jazz music? Yes, there is. To people pop-open their shirts one button at a time to reveal glistening skin? Oh boy, yes they do. Is there art deco everywhere? Absolutely. It’s a blast. For fans of: Double Indemnity, The Postman Always Rings Twice, Red Rock West, William Hurt’s mustache. Release Date: 2002 Genre: Thriller Director: Christopher Nolan Cast: Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan, Nicky Katt, Paul Dooley Insomnia doesn’t get brought up as much as Christopher Nolan‘s other films, but it should. Nolan’s film is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film, and while Nolan’s take on the material isn’t as hauntingly bleak as the original, it’s still a worthy successor. Al Pacino is a weary cop who ends up in an Alaskan town where the sun is perpetually out. Pacino is trying to solve a murder, and he actually solves it pretty quickly, coming face to face with the killer – played by Robin Williams. Unfortunately, Pacino accidentally shot and killed his partner while trying to catch Williams, and now he’s trying to cover it all up. Nolan brings his usual artistic chilliness to the film, conveying the weariness of Pacino’s character via blurry, over-lit shots. Pacino is an actor who tends to go big and broad in his later years, but his performance here is refreshingly subdued. The real draw, though, is the late Robin Williams. Williams may have been primarily known for his comedy, but he might have actually been an even better dramatic actor. Here, he brings a shocking, unsettling cold-heartedness to his calculating killer character. For fans of: Memento, One Hour Photo, Following, a good night’s rest.

Analysts are expecting the embattled retailer to post a massive 95 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to £1 million, down from £19.7 million a year earlier. Woods, who was drafted to succeed Mark Newton-Jones after he was forced out last month, is expected to update shareholders and creditors on its refinancing progress.

Just weeks later, non-executive chairman Alan Parker jumped ship from Mothercare, with Clive Whiley filling his shoes on an interim basis. It has enlisted the help of KPMG to help it secure more funding from its lenders HSBC and Barclays, as well as Rothschild to secure further funding from other sources. Although it has not yet confirmed its emergency turnaround strategy, it is understood that a CVA is the most likely option, which could see it close up to a third of its estate and secure rent reductions on dozens more. “Mothercare clearly faces a number of challenges at this time but retains an excellent and still relevant brand in our view,” Shore Capital’s Clive Black said. “The new senior management team is now focused upon the previously announced refinancing initiatives whilst also seeing through the ongoing business transformation.” Click here to sign up to Retail Gazette‘s free daily email newsletter New CEO arrives, books lots of dodgy provisions, profits appear to collapse, after a year of tenure reverses provisions, profits appear to recover, he must be a genius give him a huge bonus, etc etc As a retailing Executive Director with fifty years of experience and major fan and previous shareholder of Mothercare, I am not at all surprised by their demise. They NEVER have the right items in stock at the right time and their staff although willing, really don’t know enough to be able to boost sales to customers at ground-level to make the all-important difference to their profits. With new grandson arrived, I tried THREE times in the past three months to buy from Mothercare. First, it was a Car Seat, which I bought from Halfords, because they had it in stock and it was £20 cheaper. Second was a Stairgate, where Mothercare had none in stock, so it was purchased from Tesco’s. Finally, a simple “pelican” bib was needed and again, they had tons of stock, but ALL the wrong stuff. Change the Buyers, I say, and micro-manage the Stores and train the staff properly. Doesn’t ANYONE know ow to run a Retail Store any more ?

Weber who gave a captivating presentation about “Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.” He gave a revealing explanation about the wide range of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons that are currently being produced and stored around the world. Weber explained his career trajectory to foreign service. After graduating from Scarsdale High School in 1978, he attended Cornell University and now holds a Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) degree from Georgetown University, where he also taught a course on Force and Diplomacy for eight years. Weber dedicated thirty years of his life to working with the US government, including five and a half years as President Obama’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense programs. In addition, he was an essential part of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction efforts to remove weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan and Georgia and nuclear-capable aircrafts from Moldova, reduce biological weapons threats, and destroy Libyan and Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles. He was also on the US leadership of the international Ebola response for the State Department. He is now an independent consultant and a strategic advisor for IP3 International and Ginkgo BioWorks. Weber serves on the Board of the Arms Control Association and the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation studies International Advisory Council and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. League President Janice Starr opened the event by describing the League’s importance to the community and recognizing elected officials present including Benjamin Boykin, Amy Paulin, Dan Hochvert, Arlene Katz, Jane Veron and candidate for Congress Jonathan Lewis. Cindy Dunn then introduced Weber. Weber’s stories sounded like the scripts of films, and indeed, his work removing uranium form Kazakhstan is now being detailed in a movie script. Weber explained, that while serving his thirty years in the US government, he worked on the Nunn-Lugar Project to dismantle weapons of mass destruction (WMD) lying dormant throughout the Soviet union. While returning from assignment in Germany in 1992 he saw an ad in a newspaper that stated: “Looking for diplomats who find Paris a bore”.Former and Current Presidents of the League of Women Voters He answered the ad, and in 1993, he traveled to Kazakhstan, which was the fourth largest supplier of WMD’s at the time. He collected samples of water, soil, and plants to check radiation levels from former nuclear testing. But while in Kazakhstan, he was also approached by a car salesman, who asked if he wanted to buy any uranium. Intrigued, he met the factory director of the plant holding the uranium, who took him on a hunting trip to gain his trust. Weber learned that the factory held 600 kg of weapons grade uranium left over from former Soviet projects. With the cooperation of the Kazakhstan government, Project Sapphire was organized to safely transport these nuclear materials away, as they were poorly secured and at risk of being sold to construct nuclear weapons. Weber explained that transporting these materials was extremely dangerous, as the roads were covered in black ice. The materials were eventually taken to a C5 galaxy aircraft which flew nonstop to Oak Ridge, CA, where they material was converted to energy to be used at a power plant. Thanks to Project Sapphire and similar denuclearization efforts, the world went from having 50 countries with enriched uranium/plutonium to only 20 countries with enriched uranium/plutonium. Similar to nuclear weapons, Weber oversaw the elimination of biological weapons. He visited another factory in Kazakhstan which had ten four story high fermenters of anthrax, with 300 tons in total. Thanks to the Nunn-Lugar program, he worked with the Kazakhstan government to dismantle the factory, which is now a field of grass. He also traveled to Renaissance Island, a former territory of the Soviet Union used to test biological weapons on monkeys to determine their effectiveness. They found 100 tons of buried anthrax, and worked with the government of Uzbekistan to eliminate the cultures. While the Nunn-Lugar program has helped significantly reduce the worldwide number of biological weapons, Weber’s fear moving forward is the role technology will play in creating advanced biological weapons that could be drug resistant. Weber also warned of the necessity to eliminate chemical weapons. In 1997, all but four countries (Israel, Egypt, South Sudan, and North Korea) ratified a convention to eliminate the use of chemical weapons. In 2014, he oversaw the destruction of the last of Gaddafi's chemical weapons in Libya, mainly mustard gas. The UN also oversaw the destruction of 1,300 tons of Sarin and VX Nerve gas in Syria. Weber noted that Assad has been mostly using chlorine gas on civilians in Syria, and still has a small amount of Sarin. He also mentioned that Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid painkiller, is also a chemical weapon, and was used in 2002 by Russian forces to clear a theater occupied by Chechen terrorists, but inadvertently killed innocent theater-goers. He cautioned that despite the convention, chemical weapons are still a significant threat, as North Korea contains over 5,000 tons of chemical weaponry and leaders such as Assad have shown zero hesitation in using these weapons on civilians. Scarsdale Mayor Dan Hochvert With Two FriendsBesides chemical weapons, Weber advocated to stop the production of new nuclear weapons. The world currently has 15,000 nuclear weapons, and creating more could lead to another arms race that would further destabilize the world. President Trump departed from forty plus years of foreign policy to reduce nuclear capabilities, and instead has decided to spend trillions on the production of more nuclear weapons moving forward. He has taken on a policy similar to Putin, which is to create smaller nukes that are “more usable”. Policies such as these have lead for the doomsday clock, a measure of global stability, to only be two minutes to midnight, or doomsday. Factors included when calculating how many minutes the world is to midnight include nuclear threats, climate change, biosecurity, bioterrorism, and miscellaneous threats. Weber specifically noted that Trump’s funding for two new nuclear cruise missiles, which are guided to their targets via a computer, are especially unnecessary. Weber has been working for an arms control agreement throughout the world to eliminate this dangerous class of cruise missiles. Locally, Weber said that Representative Nita Lowey and Senator Gillibrand have specifically supported the defunding of new nuclear weapons, and hopes that young people will take a similar stand. He ended by encouraging young people to pursue a career of public service, and quoted President Carter “We must not let these weapons of the 20th century darken the skies of the 21st century.” Weber began to take questions from the audience, and addressed the recent outbreak of Ebola in the Congo, and how the Soviets had developed Ebola as a chemical weapon. Luckily, he mentioned that this outbreak can be contained more gracefully than recent cases. Weber was the former Deputy Coordinator for the Ebola Response at the U.S. Department of State. In this position Weber was responsible for leading diplomatic outreach efforts to ensure a speedy, effective, and global response to the crisis. He was part of an effort with 70 countries to control the outbreak. A vaccine has been developed and licensed, something that they did not have access to at the beginning of the last crisis. He noted that this vaccine is now available and very effective; if deployed quickly enough they can stop the outbreak before it becomes a major epidemic. In his time in the US government, they set up a new office devoted to combating global disease. However, since President Trump has taken office, National Security Advisor John Bolton has eliminated this office. Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still dedicated to eradication global diseases, Weber remarked “We need leadership but its not there… this was a really unfortunate mistake.” One lesson he has learned in his thirty years in US government is that the US cannot do anything on its own and relies heavily on its partners, for example the Ebola crisis and eliminating uranium from Kazakhstan and Syria were all team efforts with other nations. Unfortunately, he said, “there is a leadership vacuum, there is no one inline behind the US to lead on these important issues.”The Current Board of the League of Women Voters On the advancements of new technologies, Weber spoke on what precautions nations must take. “Technology is a blessing and a curse,” he warned. His biggest concern of new technology is that nations must understand the dangers of technology and globally there has to be an established norm, how nations use and control it. He is mainly concerned about the norm against WMDs which are now being used in Syria and North Korea; a norm against use of these weapons which used to be very strong now seems to be breaking down, which in Weber’s view is a “very scary prospect.” When a member of the audience asked if there is good will on both sides to establish a norm, Weber responded optimistically. He pointed out that there used to be five rouge states the US had to worry about, and now there are only two. With North Korea, his theory of dictators is they can move and change direction easily, there is no congress or legislation they have to worry about, however, the best way to get through to these leaders is talking to them directly. Already, world leaders have met with Kim Jong Un, including an upcoming meeting between Kim and President Trump. Kim has already agreed to close his testing sites for nuclear weapons and will stop missile launchings. Weber pointed out that Kim has seen economic prosperity in other nations, to Weber this means that Kim will potentially realize he is in a strong position to negotiate peace and even opening up trade. Weber acknowledged that this will be a very long road but the US has experienced this type of negotiation before in Russia and Kazakhstan. These first steps have shown promise to Weber. Another way to reduce risk of nuclear war pointed out by Weber is to increase decision times. In his opinion, decision times are too short and anything that can be done to increase this time would lessen the risk of nuclear war. He also noted that both Putin and the US are using smaller nuclear weapons in regional exercises which increase the probability of a misunderstanding. A suggestion to curb this risk, Weber mentioned, is for Trump to sit down and talk to Putin; this is the only practical way to walk ourselves back from this arms race. Trump's nuclear weapons plan would cost $1.7 trillion over the next three years; Weber believes the government must evaluate spending and focus on other priorities rather than spend and exorbitant amount on nuclear weapons. On Iran, Weber hopes that Europe, Russia, and China can keep the Iran agreement on life support without the United States. The agreement allowed for 98% of uranium to be removed from the country, the nuclear reactor to be filled with concrete, a majority of centrifuges to be taken offline, and underground facilities to close. Many of these terms, including the removal of Uranium, could never have been done militarily.

Weber who gave a captivating presentation about “Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction.” He gave a revealing explanation about the wide range of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons that are currently being produced and stored around the world. Weber explained his career trajectory to foreign service. After graduating from Scarsdale High School in 1978, he attended Cornell University and now holds a Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) degree from Georgetown University, where he also taught a course on Force and Diplomacy for eight years. Weber dedicated thirty years of his life to working with the US government, including five and a half years as President Obama’s Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense programs. In addition, he was an essential part of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction efforts to remove weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan and Georgia and nuclear-capable aircrafts from Moldova, reduce biological weapons threats, and destroy Libyan and Syrian chemical weapons stockpiles. He was also on the US leadership of the international Ebola response for the State Department. He is now an independent consultant and a strategic advisor for IP3 International and Ginkgo BioWorks. Weber serves on the Board of the Arms Control Association and the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation studies International Advisory Council and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. League President Janice Starr opened the event by describing the League’s importance to the community and recognizing elected officials present including Benjamin Boykin, Amy Paulin, Dan Hochvert, Arlene Katz, Jane Veron and candidate for Congress Jonathan Lewis. Cindy Dunn then introduced Weber. Weber’s stories sounded like the scripts of films, and indeed, his work removing uranium form Kazakhstan is now being detailed in a movie script. Weber explained, that while serving his thirty years in the US government, he worked on the Nunn-Lugar Project to dismantle weapons of mass destruction (WMD) lying dormant throughout the Soviet union. While returning from assignment in Germany in 1992 he saw an ad in a newspaper that stated: “Looking for diplomats who find Paris a bore”.Former and Current Presidents of the League of Women Voters He answered the ad, and in 1993, he traveled to Kazakhstan, which was the fourth largest supplier of WMD’s at the time. He collected samples of water, soil, and plants to check radiation levels from former nuclear testing. But while in Kazakhstan, he was also approached by a car salesman, who asked if he wanted to buy any uranium. Intrigued, he met the factory director of the plant holding the uranium, who took him on a hunting trip to gain his trust. Weber learned that the factory held 600 kg of weapons grade uranium left over from former Soviet projects. With the cooperation of the Kazakhstan government, Project Sapphire was organized to safely transport these nuclear materials away, as they were poorly secured and at risk of being sold to construct nuclear weapons. Weber explained that transporting these materials was extremely dangerous, as the roads were covered in black ice. The materials were eventually taken to a C5 galaxy aircraft which flew nonstop to Oak Ridge, CA, where they material was converted to energy to be used at a power plant. Thanks to Project Sapphire and similar denuclearization efforts, the world went from having 50 countries with enriched uranium/plutonium to only 20 countries with enriched uranium/plutonium. Similar to nuclear weapons, Weber oversaw the elimination of biological weapons. He visited another factory in Kazakhstan which had ten four story high fermenters of anthrax, with 300 tons in total. Thanks to the Nunn-Lugar program, he worked with the Kazakhstan government to dismantle the factory, which is now a field of grass. He also traveled to Renaissance Island, a former territory of the Soviet Union used to test biological weapons on monkeys to determine their effectiveness. They found 100 tons of buried anthrax, and worked with the government of Uzbekistan to eliminate the cultures. While the Nunn-Lugar program has helped significantly reduce the worldwide number of biological weapons, Weber’s fear moving forward is the role technology will play in creating advanced biological weapons that could be drug resistant. Weber also warned of the necessity to eliminate chemical weapons. In 1997, all but four countries (Israel, Egypt, South Sudan, and North Korea) ratified a convention to eliminate the use of chemical weapons. In 2014, he oversaw the destruction of the last of Gaddafi's chemical weapons in Libya, mainly mustard gas. The UN also oversaw the destruction of 1,300 tons of Sarin and VX Nerve gas in Syria. Weber noted that Assad has been mostly using chlorine gas on civilians in Syria, and still has a small amount of Sarin. He also mentioned that Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid painkiller, is also a chemical weapon, and was used in 2002 by Russian forces to clear a theater occupied by Chechen terrorists, but inadvertently killed innocent theater-goers. He cautioned that despite the convention, chemical weapons are still a significant threat, as North Korea contains over 5,000 tons of chemical weaponry and leaders such as Assad have shown zero hesitation in using these weapons on civilians. Scarsdale Mayor Dan Hochvert With Two FriendsBesides chemical weapons, Weber advocated to stop the production of new nuclear weapons. The world currently has 15,000 nuclear weapons, and creating more could lead to another arms race that would further destabilize the world. President Trump departed from forty plus years of foreign policy to reduce nuclear capabilities, and instead has decided to spend trillions on the production of more nuclear weapons moving forward. He has taken on a policy similar to Putin, which is to create smaller nukes that are “more usable”. Policies such as these have lead for the doomsday clock, a measure of global stability, to only be two minutes to midnight, or doomsday. Factors included when calculating how many minutes the world is to midnight include nuclear threats, climate change, biosecurity, bioterrorism, and miscellaneous threats. Weber specifically noted that Trump’s funding for two new nuclear cruise missiles, which are guided to their targets via a computer, are especially unnecessary. Weber has been working for an arms control agreement throughout the world to eliminate this dangerous class of cruise missiles. Locally, Weber said that Representative Nita Lowey and Senator Gillibrand have specifically supported the defunding of new nuclear weapons, and hopes that young people will take a similar stand. He ended by encouraging young people to pursue a career of public service, and quoted President Carter “We must not let these weapons of the 20th century darken the skies of the 21st century.” Weber began to take questions from the audience, and addressed the recent outbreak of Ebola in the Congo, and how the Soviets had developed Ebola as a chemical weapon. Luckily, he mentioned that this outbreak can be contained more gracefully than recent cases. Weber was the former Deputy Coordinator for the Ebola Response at the U.S. Department of State. In this position Weber was responsible for leading diplomatic outreach efforts to ensure a speedy, effective, and global response to the crisis. He was part of an effort with 70 countries to control the outbreak. A vaccine has been developed and licensed, something that they did not have access to at the beginning of the last crisis. He noted that this vaccine is now available and very effective; if deployed quickly enough they can stop the outbreak before it becomes a major epidemic. In his time in the US government, they set up a new office devoted to combating global disease. However, since President Trump has taken office, National Security Advisor John Bolton has eliminated this office. Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still dedicated to eradication global diseases, Weber remarked “We need leadership but its not there… this was a really unfortunate mistake.” One lesson he has learned in his thirty years in US government is that the US cannot do anything on its own and relies heavily on its partners, for example the Ebola crisis and eliminating uranium from Kazakhstan and Syria were all team efforts with other nations. Unfortunately, he said, “there is a leadership vacuum, there is no one inline behind the US to lead on these important issues.”The Current Board of the League of Women Voters On the advancements of new technologies, Weber spoke on what precautions nations must take. “Technology is a blessing and a curse,” he warned. His biggest concern of new technology is that nations must understand the dangers of technology and globally there has to be an established norm, how nations use and control it. He is mainly concerned about the norm against WMDs which are now being used in Syria and North Korea; a norm against use of these weapons which used to be very strong now seems to be breaking down, which in Weber’s view is a “very scary prospect.” When a member of the audience asked if there is good will on both sides to establish a norm, Weber responded optimistically. He pointed out that there used to be five rouge states the US had to worry about, and now there are only two. With North Korea, his theory of dictators is they can move and change direction easily, there is no congress or legislation they have to worry about, however, the best way to get through to these leaders is talking to them directly. Already, world leaders have met with Kim Jong Un, including an upcoming meeting between Kim and President Trump. Kim has already agreed to close his testing sites for nuclear weapons and will stop missile launchings. Weber pointed out that Kim has seen economic prosperity in other nations, to Weber this means that Kim will potentially realize he is in a strong position to negotiate peace and even opening up trade. Weber acknowledged that this will be a very long road but the US has experienced this type of negotiation before in Russia and Kazakhstan. These first steps have shown promise to Weber. Another way to reduce risk of nuclear war pointed out by Weber is to increase decision times. In his opinion, decision times are too short and anything that can be done to increase this time would lessen the risk of nuclear war. He also noted that both Putin and the US are using smaller nuclear weapons in regional exercises which increase the probability of a misunderstanding. A suggestion to curb this risk, Weber mentioned, is for Trump to sit down and talk to Putin; this is the only practical way to walk ourselves back from this arms race. Trump's nuclear weapons plan would cost $1.7 trillion over the next three years; Weber believes the government must evaluate spending and focus on other priorities rather than spend and exorbitant amount on nuclear weapons. On Iran, Weber hopes that Europe, Russia, and China can keep the Iran agreement on life support without the United States. The agreement allowed for 98% of uranium to be removed from the country, the nuclear reactor to be filled with concrete, a majority of centrifuges to be taken offline, and underground facilities to close. Many of these terms, including the removal of Uranium, could never have been done militarily. The agreement also allowed for intrusive inspections that would never allow Iran to pursue a nuclear weapon. By pulling out, the US risks losing access and knowledge to Iran’s nuclear capabilities.

The Austin teachers\' union had called on Pace to resign over the texts, which included harsh language toward members of the education community and efforts by the district to close the achievement gap. Here\'s a breakdown of Kendall Pace\'s controversial text messages. ""I realize my work is done here,"" Pace said at Austin ISD\'s headquarters today. ""I decided I will press for change on the outside."" Pace apologized for the crudeness of the messages, but defended her tenure on the board, saying she often asked ""uncomfortable questions with an honest and open heart."" Pace cited the board\'s approval of its facilities master plan last year, district efforts to pass a multimillion-dollar bond to improve AISD properties and her efforts to change the names of district-owned properties that honored Confederate figures as successful efforts to increase student equity during her tenure. Pace said her texts were borne out of frustration with ""one-sided screamers"" who disagreed with her assessments of the district. In the texts, she suggested the district could establish a charter school with the help of a state grant and ""ignore the special interest groups and crazy ignorant community activists and poverty pimps."" Pace said her tone reflected her frustration from the district\'s ""lack of urgency"" to help low-income students and students of color do better academically. She said she hopes her language won\'t be the focus of the public\'s attention going forward. ""The headline should be: We are failing consistently our low-income students of color,"" she said. Trustee Edmund ""Ted"" Gordon called Pace\'s comments ""unfortunate,"" but said Pace did champion academic achievement as president. He said the controversy surrounding her texts was a distraction from district efforts to address racial equity and academic performance. ""Unfortunately this whole brouhaha is a distraction that changes nothing of substance,"" Gordon said. ""The achievement disparities remain unchanged."" Pace\'s term was up in November. The board voted to replace Pace with Trustee Geronimo Rodriguez as president. He was previously the board’s vice president. KUT\'s Claire McInerny contributed to this report. Education Austin, the union for Austin ISD\'s employees, called for the resignation of School Board President Kendall Pace after inflammatory texts she sent to another board member surfaced. The texts to Julie Cowan include name calling and harsh language toward others in Austin\'s education community, which was one reason the union called for her resignation. But there\'s a lot in the texts that require context to understand. The Austin teachers\' union is asking School Board President Kendall Pace to resign after she sent an ""offensive"" text message to another board member.']",0.0,13.0,0.65,0.0,1047627.0

Former Michigan State Spartans wide receiver Keith Mumphery has filed a lawsuit against MSU in federal court, claiming it violated his right to due process when it expelled him and banned him from campus in 2016.(Photo: Andrew Weber, Andrew Weber-USA TODAY Sports) EAST LANSING - A former Michigan State University football player is suing the university for dismissing him from the school over what he called false allegations of sexual misconduct by a female student. In a suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, Keith Mumphery said he is unable to play professional football or finish his graduate degree because of MSU\'s actions. Mumphery was expelled from his graduate studies program and banned from campus in 2016 for violating the school\'s relationship violence and sexual misconduct policy. He was not charged with a crime. It\'s the second time that MSU has been sued for its handling of a 2015 sexual assault claim involving Mumphery. More: Keith Mumphery expelled in 2016 for MSU sexual misconduct violation More: Prosecutor: 3 MSU football players to face sexual assault charges The woman who claimed he had assaulted her is suing the university in federal court, claiming it allowed Mumphery to attend two university-sponsored events after he had been banned from campus, including a 2016 golf outing, without her being notified. The suit said she was ""terrified"" when her friends told her Mumphery had been spotted on campus and around East Lansing. More: MSU sued for handling of 2015 sex assault claim against ex-football player An MSU spokeswoman did not immediately respond to email and telephone messages left for her by the State Journal on Tuesday night. Mumphery\'s 55-page lawsuit names MSU, its Board of Trustees and former MSU President Lou Anna Simon as defendants, along with three other individuals. It alleges the university violated his constitutional right to due process, among other claims. ""There were repeated failures to give (Mumphery) proper notice of the proceedings,"" the suit says. ""There was no proper hearing, there was no cross-examination; there was no sworn testimony ..."" The suit said Mumphery was cut by the Houston Texans a day after a report in a Houston newspaper questioned why the Texans signed a player who had been expelled from college for sexual assault. Since being cut, he has been unable to find a job in professional football, the suit says. Moreover, because he was banned from MSU\'s campus until the beginning of 2019, he can\'t finish his graduate degree in communications, according to the suit. Mumphery ""will likely be barred"" from other universities because of his ""improper dismissal"" from MSU, it says. According to the lawsuit by the woman who claimed Mumphery assaulted her, the university initially determined that Mumphery did not violate MSU policy but decided to expel him after the 90 days the university sets for investigations. In an effort to end a federal investigation into the university\'s handling of sexual assault and harassment reporting, MSU reached an agreement that required it to review past Title IX cases. The complaint involving Mumphery was among those reviewed, the suit says. In his suit, Mumphery claims that no new evidence was found to substantiate the woman\'s claim. ""Upon reconsideration of the initial finding, and to placate (her), Michigan State changed its original position and determined that (the woman\'s) story was true and that Plaintiff was guilty,"" the suit alleges. ""The findings of the initial Investigative Report were merely re-interpreted in (the woman\'s) favor.""

HP10 9TY|3223515|Registered in England & Wales"", 'Wednesday 10 October 2018 By Ravender Sembhy, Press Association City Editor May 13 2018 8:00 AM The new Mothercare chief executive is set to update the market on the troubled retailer’s store closure plans this week, with the group also tipped to report a sharp fall in profits. David Wood, who was parachuted in to replace Mark Newton-Jones just weeks ago, will lay bare the challenge the chain faces at Mothercare’s annual results on Thursday. A consensus of City analysts forecast the group will post a 95% fall in underlying pre-tax profits to just £1 million in the year to March. The figure compares with a profit of £19.7 million last year. It will come alongside an update on Mothercare’s refinancing progress, with the group having mandated KPMG to help it secure additional cash from its lenders HSBC and Barclays. Rothschild is also working with the group to secure outside funding. Since taking the helm in April Mr Wood – who joined from US grocery and pharmaceuticals giant Kmart – has said his “immediate priority” is to ensure Mothercare returns to firmer financial ground. To this end, he is expected to announce an acceleration of its store closure programme, with speculation rife that this will be carried out through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – a move which would allow it to close loss-making shops and secure rental discounts. Mothercare clearly faces a number of challenges at this time but retains an excellent and still relevant brand in our view Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital Despite its travails Clive Black, analyst at Shore Capital, struck an upbeat tone. “Mothercare clearly faces a number of challenges at this time but retains an excellent and still relevant brand in our view,” he said. “The new senior management team is now focused upon the previously announced refinancing initiatives whilst also seeing through the ongoing business transformation.” Mothercare also recently announced the departure of its chairman Alan Parker, who “retired from his position” after six years. He has been replaced by Clive Whiley as its interim executive chairman with immediate effect. Retailers across the board have been battered by weak consumer confidence off the back of soaring Brexit-fuelled inflation. They have also had to contend with surging wage costs and eye-watering business rate hikes. Since January, Toys R Us and Maplin have filed for administration, while fashion retailers such as New Look and Select have embarked on radical store closure programmes.

In fact, we have two. After all the years (Queen\'s Bohemian Rhapsody project was announced back in 2010). After Sacha Baron Cohen-gate. After all the rumours and the wild speculation... we finally have an idea about what the finished Queen movie is going to look like. It\'s released in the UK this month. And this is what the trailers made us think. 1. Is that Freddie\'s voice? Brian\'s guitar playing? If it\'s not, hats off, and Rami Malek might just be the most gifted impersonator in the history of the cinema. Although, let\'s face it, there\'s not much competition for this title. Val Kilmer was brilliant in The Doors\' movie, but the film itself was 24-carat hokum. 2. That accent, though... Despite this being Freddie\'s story, it\'s 52 seconds into the first trailer before we hear Malek speak a short sentence, while the only other time he says anything (at 1\'12""), he sounds half-drunk, half-Dutch. Anyone remember Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker\'s Dracula? 3. Malek does all the classic Freddies There\'s Live Aid Freddie. There\'s leather catsuit Freddie. There\'s harlequin leotard Freddie. Red leather trouser Freddie. Fur coat Freddie. Be-crowned Freddie. White jumpsuit Freddie with angel wings. It\'s astonishing how many of these costumes are indelibly burned into the memory. 4. At first glance, the first trailer plays down Freddie\'s homosexuality It\'s all longing glances from hot, flaxen-haired girls. So far, so seventies. 5. But not totally Blink and you\'ll miss it, but 31 seconds in that all changes. 6. It\'s difficult to get a handle on the story being told, but... Writer Peter Morgan has previous form when it comes to gritty/funny real-life dramas set in the 70s/80s. He was the guy who turned David Peace\'s Brian Clough novel The Damned United into a screenplay, as well as Frost/Nixon (about the David Frost/Richard Nixon interviews) and Rush, about the rivalry between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. And the movie\'s Instagram account suggests that they\'re not going to fall down on attention-to-detail. Getting the details. #rogertaylor #brianmay @benhardy1 #liveaid #queen #bohemianrhapsody #Repost @bryanjaysinger ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" The Movie A photo posted by @bohemianrhapsody_themovie on Jan 21, 2018 at 2:06am PST 7. They\'re like episodes of a Classic Albums documentary brought to life All those isolated vocals, shots of reel-to-reel tape rewinding and gorgeously lit studios. Who doesn\'t love this stuff? 8. How did they film the Live Aid section? The recreation of Live Aid looks like real Live Aid, but it can\'t be - the footage has a crisp, high-res feel. How do you cram 90,000 extras into a studio? 9. There\'s a cat And there\'s very little in life that can\'t be improved by the addition of a cat. 10. It looks like a film we want to see Let\'s face it: most music biopics are awful. From the torpid John & Yoko: A Love Story to Made-For-TV\'s very own Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story, rock pics have often been a byword for shamefully fabricated history and acting of the sort you\'d expect at a badly-received school nativity play. But this looks – dare we day it – good. That\'s not all: the film was produced by Brian May, Roger Taylor, Queen manager Jim Beach and Robert De Niro. De Niro was also the producer of the Queen musical, We Will Rock You. Director Dexter Fletcher has previous musical experience as the director of Proclaimers musical Sunshine On Leith (90% on Rotten Tomatoes), and as an actor: his first role was in Alan Parker\'s classic kids\'n\'custard-pies gangster movie Bugsy Malone. Little known fact: he was also in, uh, Kylie Minogue\'s Some Kind of Bliss video, the song co-written by Manic Street Preachers James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore. The right people are involved.

He says that he misses the golden era of the film fraternity when everyone stood by each other. THE MAVERICK SPEAKS Often I hear acquisitions that Satyajit Ray and I marketed India’s poverty to win international awards and encomiums. Nothing amuses me more than this. We have always depicted reality and life as it is in the nation through our films. What does one mean by selling poverty? Is it a commodity to be marketed at a price? Neither Ray nor I believed in depicting larger than life situations or characters which box-office-oriented popular cinema does. To us, life is larger than art. If art is honest, life follows it. I really miss the golden ’50s, ’60s and ’70s when the film fraternity was tied together in an affectionate bondage. Eminent filmmaker Ajay Kar approached me to pen a script for him. I obliged him by writing the script of Kanch Kanta Heera. He transformed it into a memorable film. There were master filmmakers then, like V Shantaram, Ritwik Ghatak, Tapan Sinha, Asit Sen and Shyam Benegal. For me, the first three names in Indian cinema are Ray, Ray and Ray. Have you ever heard me speaking of myself as a political filmmaker? I’ve never done that. In all my films, I’ve taken up social issues rooted in the soil of my country. The political upheaval of the early ’70s formed the backdrop of my Calcutta trilogy. Besides Bengali, I also directed Hindi and Telegu cinema to reach a wider audience. Like Ray, I never believed in chairing or being a part of the National Awards Jury. I have been a jury member in almost every international film festival outside India. I shared good vibes with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. Similarly, I had differences of opinion with Alan Parker whom I hold in high esteem. If Charlie Chaplin is a cinematic idol to me, I highly appreciate the works of Ingmar Bergman, Stanley Kramer and Akira Kurosawa. Cinema is never the same without them. CONTEMPORARIES SPEAK ABOUT MRINAL SEN Ranu Mukherjee My father, Hemanta Mukherjee, composed the haunting song Neel Akasher Neeche for Mrinalda’s film of the same name in the middles ’50s. I still get goose pimples when I see the sequence. A shattered Kali Banerjee, walking the streets of Kolkata at night. The song brought out the pathos of the city after partition. Each of the shots canned to picturise the song was meaningful. Mrinalda proved his mastery over the language of cinema. Simmi Garewal After working with Satyajit Ray in Aranyer Din Ratri, it was another honour for me to have worked with Mrinal Sen in Padatik. I was not being able to give the right Bengali diction and was faltering in saying, “Ekta Poisa.” Initially Mrinalda wanted to dub my voice. Later, he decided to take a bold step and experiment with me. He did so with care and effectively. Mrinalda’s handling of actors is unique. He is disciplined, uncompromising, yet very affectionate. Govind Nihalani The grand trio of Ray, Ghatak and Sen are my mentors in cinema. I still marvel at the use of freeze shots by Mrinalda in Akash Kusum. The jump cuts in Calcutta 71 and Interview are so well executed. I personally supervised and restored Khandahar frame by frame at the National Film Achieves at his request. A sheer poetry on screen, Khandahar was highly applauded at Cannes Classic Section in 2010.

The musical - which runs at Loughborough Town Hall until Saturday, May 19 - is not without conflict as we encounter broken hearts, bruised egos, dyslexia and drug abuse along the way but it is the exciting dance routines and powerhouse vocals that hold this musical together and there you have it in a nutshell!

There are some strong performances among the principals, newcomer Yvette Healey dispels attitude and confidence as the sexy and sassy Carmen while Gemma Landers is convincing as the slightly dippy Serena who is love with serious Nick beautifully underplayed by Jonny Painting and his solo ballad ‘I Want to Make Magic’ was emotive and believable. Joe Harrison, as streetwise but dyslexic rap dancer, Tyrone is one of the stand out performers, his vocals and dancing are faultless especially when he struts his stuff in ‘Dancin’ on the Sidewalk’. The comedic element is injected by Chris Wilson as hapless Joe and his delivery of ‘Can’t Keep it Down’ plus his marching (echoing John Sergeant’s plodding in the Paso Doble in Strictly Come Dancing) sequence was hysterical. There were occasions, however, when the vocals became strained rather than controlled in particular when some singers were attempting reach a higher register and some of the lyrics were lost as a result. But it is musicality that makes up for the lack of serious plotline and in terms of dance Fame is a choreographer’s dream and the ensemble dancing was fast paced, energetic and spectacular. Fame is a musical that youngsters can relate to and the predominantly young audience cheered wildly at the final show-stopping scene.']",,,,,

""However, what is important in 2019 and beyond is that Oxfam rebuilds and renews in a way that is most relevant for the future and so continues to help as many people as possible around the world build better lives.” Dear Mark, I want to share my sadness and deep sense of loss.

Your commitment to challenge suffering & poverty has been unwavering.You have my highest respect and admiration.We will miss you terribly! The charity has been rocked since a leaked internal report published by The Times newspaper in February revealed that several members of staff had been dismissed or allowed to resign over safeguarding breaches, including paying women for sex, in Haiti. Deputy Chief Executive Penny Lawrence resigned shortly after the story emerged, and the charity announced a slew of reforms in an effort to address the issue, having already strengthened safeguarding policies following the 2011 incident. Goldring himself came under fire for comments made during an interview about the scandal with the Guardian newspaper, for which he later apologized. Goldring joined Oxfam as chief executive in 2013, having previously worked for the charity in the 1990s. He has also served as chief executive officer of Mencap and Voluntary Services Overseas. Caroline Thomson, chair of Oxfam, said February’s revelations presented the “test of a lifetime” for Goldring, and that he “rose to the immense challenge, and his leadership has been invaluable through it. It is testament to his integrity and humility that Mark will see through the next few difficult months.” He will continue to lead Oxfam GB until a successor is recruited and in post, the charity said. The announcement comes after the resignation of Alan Parker, chair of Save the Children, last month, following a separate sexual misconduct scandal at that charity.']",,,,,

The firm’s sales and profit have been hammered by intense competition from supermarket groups and online retailers in its main UK market as well as by rising costs, resulting in what it called on Thursday “a perilous financial condition.” It reported a loss before tax of 72.8 million pounds ($98.2 million) for the year to March 24, on group sales down 2 percent to 654.5 million pounds. Mothercare’s shares had lost 83 percent of their value over the last year but rose as much as 34 percent on Thursday after the firm detailed a 113.5 million pounds refinancing, including a planned 28 million pounds equity fundraising, and said Mark Newton-Jones would return as CEO. Newton-Jones was ousted as CEO on April 4 by then chairman Alan Parker. Parker himself abruptly retired on April 19. Newton-Jones’ replacement as CEO David Wood, a former Tesco executive, will become group managing director. Mothercare said it would seek creditor approval for so-called company voluntary arrangement (CVA) proposals that would enable it to shut 50 stores and secure rent reductions on 21 others. As many as 800 jobs could be lost. The firm currently trades from 137 UK stores, having had nearly 400 a decade ago. The new plan would see it trade from 78 UK stores by 2020. The CVA route, which allows firms to avoid insolvency or administration, has already been taken this year by fellow UK retail strugglers - fashion chain New Look, floor coverings group Carpetright and department store group House of Fraser. Brutal trading conditions for store groups - with pressure on UK disposable incomes compounding intense competition - are also partly responsible for the collapse of Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality. Shares in Mothercare were up 5.4 pence at 25.4 pence at 1420 GMT, valuing the business at 46 million pounds. “The recent financial performance of the business, impacted in particular by a large number of legacy loss making stores within the UK estate, has resulted in an unsustainable situation ... meaning the group was in clear need of an appropriate resolution,” said interim executive chairman Clive Whiley. Analysts at Peel Hunt said Mothercare’s measures looked sufficient to get the UK business back to breakeven. “The wider challenge is to complete the process of making Mothercare’s proposition more compelling, which will require a sharper view on pricing,” they said. In addition to the proposed equity issue, Mothercare has secured revised committed debt facilities of 67.5 million pounds, 8 million pounds of new shareholder loans and a new facility of up to 10 million pounds from a trade partner. Creditor meetings to vote on the CVA proposals are expected on June 1, with the process projected to complete in July. The equity issue is conditional on the CVA going through. Mothercare also trades from 1,131 stores overseas. It said international markets remained challenging, but it saw some recovery in the Middle East towards the end of its 2017-18 year. $1 = 0.7414 pounds Editing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter All quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The only generous interpretation is that ministers didn’t know what they doing when they set maximum stakes at £100 and spin speeds at 20 seconds. The main game on the machines is roulette, which even irregular casino-goers know is a properly nasty game. The addictive quality lies in the high 97% return rate to the player. Yet the house’s edge is mathematically certain and, over time, a player can only lose. From the operators’ point of view, it’s the perfect product. Allowing four roulette machines to be placed in every bookmaking shop was grossly naive. Yes, as far as possible, we must all be free to lose our money as we wish, but the fallout from problem gambling hits others, not least social services. FOBTs are not the only cause of problem gambling, of course, but the high rates of addiction to the machines are undeniable. Fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) are machines, found largely in bookmakers and betting shops, that allow customers to stake up to £100 every 20 seconds on digital versions of games such as roulette. The UK has 33,611 FOBTs, each of which take more than £53,000 from gamblers per year. Critics of FOBTs say they are particularly addictive, allow gamblers to rack up huge losses within a few hours, and are concentrated in deprived areas. They have also been linked to money laundering. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, deserves huge credit for facing down the bookmakers and opting to limit stakes to £2 on the grounds that FOBTs are “a social blight”. He still has to find a way to tackle the online problem but imposing a sense of moderation on the high street is a good place to start. Perhaps Hancock, as a horseracing man, could see what New Labour didn’t: that roulette isn’t real gambling, and inevitably involves gouging the vulnerable when offered in souped-up electronic form on the high street. As for the bookies, they consistently refused to acknowledge the difference between a casino game and a flutter on the 4.30 at Ripon. Maybe that is why their lobbying was so poor. It is certainly a reason why they deserved to lose this fight. Well done, Mr Hancock. When the Ocado chief executive, Tim Steiner, said 15 months ago that “we expect to sign multiple deals in multiple territories in the medium term”, he provoked guffaws. He’d been making similar promises for three years and had nothing to show. Nobody’s laughing now. Ocado’s technology deal with Kroger in the US is as eye-catching as they come. Kroger has 8% of the world’s biggest grocery market – it is second only to Walmart in the US – and the idea is to open 20 distribution centres in three years. For context, Ocado, under its own steam and via a partnership with Morrisons, currently serves the UK from just three warehouses. The Kroger alliance follows deals with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA in Sweden – all big players on their home patches. The “multiple territories” boast has been met and the “medium term” promise exceeded. How did it happen so quickly? Ocado’s kit has clearly impressed a lot of people but the new factor may be the fear Amazon caused in boardrooms around the globe when it paid $13.7bn (£10.1bn) to buy Whole Foods Markets in the US last year. That takeover was a firm signal that Jeff Bezos, in between saving civilisation with his space projects, plans to colonise the grocery market on Earth. Ocado’s technology is now seen as anti-Amazon device for traditional supermarkets in distress. It’s not a bad marketing pitch. It is still hard to believe that ol’ Ocado, after the astonishing 44.4% pop in the share price, can be worth £5.3bn. Since outsiders don’t know the terms of the licensing deals, the valuation is taking an awful lot on trust. The sale of £183m-worth of new shares to Kroger, in exchange for a 5% stake, gives comfort that Ocado can handle the upfront capital costs, but the City’s long-term profit projections are basically guesswork. Still, Ocado is plainly now a serious grownup company, not the “charity” that Sir Terry Leahy used to call it when he was he was running Tesco a decade ago. Indeed, even if Ocado’s American adventure turns out not to fulfil the highest hopes, it can’t go as badly as Tesco’s expensive flop. What’s got into the baby milk at Mothercare? Last month, a board chaired by Alan Parker ousted chief executive Mark Newton-Jones and appointed a new boss. A couple of weeks later Parker retired. Now Newton-Jones has been reappointed under the new chairman, Clive Whiley. Maybe the independent non-executive directors who oversaw the firing and rehiring of Newton-Jones can explain their thinking. Or do they just do whatever this week’s chairman tells them to do?', '', '']",,,,,

OR OR International Edition', 'The re-instated boss of Mothercare has taken a 22pc pay cut to rejoin the embattled baby chain, but will still earn more than the executive parachuted in to replace him. Mark Newton-Jones - who was sacked in April - will see his base salary slashed from £618,000 to £480,000 as he returns to the fold as chief executive. However, he will pocket more than former Tesco executive David Wood, who was brought in as chief executive when Mr Newton-Jones was fired. Mothercare announced this week that Mr Wood, who is on a base salary of £430,000, would be shifted to the role of group managing director to make way for Mr Newton-Jones. The troubled company revealed a far-reaching rescue package on Thursday that will see it put 800 jobs at risk, axe 50 stores and pull together £113.5m funds to revive the business. The push to bring down its 137-strong UK store estate to around 87 stores and secure rent reductions on a further 21 sites will be pursued through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency process which helps firms cut costs. Mr Newton-Jones owns around 733,576 shares in Mothercare worth £197,918. He spent four years attempting to turn the business around, but was ousted by non-executive chairman Alan Parker who retired last month. The Telegraph understands that investors and lenders had expressed their desire for Mr Newton-Jones to be reappointed when interim executive chairman Clive Whiley sounded them out over the issue. It is understood that Mr Wood will now focus his attention on delivering the CVA, while Mr Newton-Jones will take overall charge of restoring the retailer’s fortunes. Mr Whiley, who was the driving force behind securing the rescue package, is understood to be on a nine-month contract and will be tasked with pinning down a permanent replacement once the retailer shows signs of stabilising. It comes as Mothercare laid bare the monumental challenge facing the board on Thursday, with UK losses before tax ballooning to £79.4m, in contrast to a loss of £9.7m for the year before. Focusing on the wider group, adjusted pre-tax profits crashed 88.3pc to £2.3m as worldwide sales fell by 4.8pc to £1.16bn. A spokesman for Mothercare said: “In recognition of Mothercare’s financial position and the support for the restructuring and refinancing given by multiple stakeholders, Mark has taken a significant pay cut. “Mark has a major role as part of the team to return to Mothercare to a more stable footing, accelerate the transformation of the group and drive it towards a viable and sustainable future.” © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2018 We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.

This will hopefully contribute to cleaning up the banking system, but the big public question is why has Chanda Kochhar, MD & CEO of ICICI Bank, being left off the hook? Why has she not put in her papers yet? Are there different standards for different scams? CONFLICT OF INTEREST A quick recap of the conflict of interest issue at ICICI Bank: In 2012, ICICI Bank had advanced a loan of Rs 3,250 crore to Videocon, 86 per cent of which remains unpaid today and has been declared a non-performing asset (NPA). Six months before that loan was given, Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon, had lent the ICICI Bank’s chief’s husband, Deepak Kochhar, Rs 64 crore to develop a solar power business. He then inexplicably transferred the lending entity to Mr Kochhar later for just Rs 9 lakh. Is the CBI probing if there was a quid pro quo between the two transactions? Bungling and corruption has brought the Indian banking system to its knees. The public credibility of bankers and banks has never been lower. Last week, after PNB reported a fourth quarter loss of Rs 13,400 crore, the bank scrip tanked 12 per cent. ICICI Bank too reported a drop of nearly 45 per cent in the consolidated net profit to Rs 1,142 crore for the quarter. Bad performance and plunging credibility has eroded values in the banking sector as never before. Over the last six months, the government and the public have lost some Rs 1.29 lakh crore in wealth held as equity in banks. In the same period, the publicly listed state-owned banks have seen their stock prices fall between 16 to 60 per cent. In this climate, those of doubtful integrity, even if yet to be proven, should be cast aside. The ICICI Board has backed Chanda Kochhar, and publicly stated that they had found no wrong doing. Legally, there is nothing proven against husband Deepak Kochhar yet, it is argued. These arguments will not wash. When there is an obvious conflict of interest and the bank has lost money in the loan transaction, the best practice is to step aside, even if the matter is still being investigated. INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE Around the same time the ICICI Bank crisis came to the fore, Martin Sorrell, Chairman and CEO of the world’s largest advertising company WPP, put in his papers in London after lawyers of the company launched an investigation into possible personal misconduct by the boss. The fact that Sorrell had built the company from scratch over 33 years to a make it a $21 billion Goliath did not matter. In another case, Save the Children international chair Alan Parker resigned after Britain’s Charity Commission opened a statutory inquiry into the handling of complaints of sexual harassment of staff by directors at the charity’s British arm. The ICICI Bank board has probably worked out a deal to save face. Kochhar is in her second five-year term, which ends on March 31 next year; she may be allowed to complete her term with no bids to be allowed for another extension. This deal is not acceptable. Here we have the head of the second largest private bank virtually in hiding. Deepak Kochhar is being investigated by both CBI and the income tax department. In this scenario, keeping pretences will further damage the bank. It is not legality but good Corporate Governance that should be in command now. What are the RBI and the Finance Ministry doing? It almost seems the government is waiting for the crisis to blow over. UTI, LIC and some other government bodies between them hold nearly 30 per cent equity in the bank. Except some postures like the LIC nominee on the Board not attending a Board meeting, precious little has been done to nudge Mrs Kochhar to put in her papers. How can the RBI and the Finance Ministry lecture state-owned banks on cleaning up, while tolerating unethical practices at ICICI Bank? It is time the double talk ended, and Chanda Kochar quits. Face-saving bid Chanda Kochhar is in her second five-year term, which ends on March 31 next year; she may be allowed to complete her term. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

The charity's former chairman Sir Alan Parker denied being able to shut down a story and told MPs the legal fees had been needed because trustees felt 'a duty to protect' the organisation's reputation. He said that inaccurate reports of the story could be 'terribly damaging and ultimately it can take away real money from the children who need it most'. Sir Alan Parker (pictured) said Unicef was not told about the investigation into Justin Forsyth because it was not a 'formal disciplinary process' It came after Sir Alan, who founded PR firm Brunswick, was asked why the charity had hired law firm Harbottle & Lewis to send the media 'aggressive' letters. Pauline Latham, a Conservative MP on the international development select committee, asked him why money donated by the public had gone to lawyers. The committee has now requested that Save the Children provides an accurate legal bill in writing, reported The Times chief reporter Sean O'Neill. It comes as Sir Alan yesterday admitted he failed to disclose sexual misconduct allegations against its chief executive. Sir Alan said Unicef was not told about the probe into Justin Forsyth, conducted by an independent law firm, because it was not a 'formal disciplinary process'. Alan Parker with Samantha Cameron and Justin Forsyth at the Save the Children's Secret Winter Gala in 2014 Sir Alan, who stepped down from StC earlier this year after the aid sector sex abuse scandal broke, also said he and other directors vetoed a £20,000 bonus awarded to Mr Forsyth while the investigation was under way. Mr Forsyth quit his role as deputy executive director of Unicef in April after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female members of staff emerged during his time at Save the Children, where he was chief executive between 2010 and 2016. Sir Alan told MPs in the International Development Committee that the charity had spoken with a third-party headhunter about Mr Forsyth but that it was StC policy 'not to mention things if they have not been the subject of formal disciplinary process'. He added: 'It wasn't a lucid formal process. It was a process but it didn't formally trigger a formal disciplinary process which would have been marked, which would have been kept.' Asked whether it should have been flagged up, he added: 'When I look back, there are a number of things we would have done differently. Parker's sudden departure followed the revelation that during his time as head of the charity, two senior male employees — chief executive Justin Forsyth (left) and policy director Brendan Cox (right) — left their jobs after a number of female colleagues complained about their conduct 'I think we would have done it in a way that would have settled it at each time more appropriately and I think very clearly there were quite specific HR failings in this, which I have to take on board as I was chairman at the time.' A leaked 2015 report from the charity suggested that Sir Alan's 'very close' relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. At Tuesday's hearings he rejected a claim by Ms Latham that a formal written warning was not sent to Mr Forsyth 'because he was a friend of yours', insisting the letter should have been in his file. Sir Alan also revealed that Brendan Cox, the widower of murdered MP Jo Cox, would have been suspended by the charity if he had not resigned. Mr Cox admitted earlier this year that he made 'mistakes' and behaved in a way that caused some women hurt and offence when he was working at the charity. Sir Alan said: 'Of course Mr Cox at the time of his resignation, was still fully denying everything, and in his resignation letter was saying very clearly he felt this was unfair, he would not get proper justice, he was very very robust on this, and literally just left. 'But from the moment we received the report on Brendan Cox - he was away at the time - we then moved to suspend him. He never returned to the building once during that process.' Actress Helena Bonham Carter and Sir Alan Parker at a Save the Children event in 2016 Sir Alan Parker is a remarkably well connected PR mogul who can claim allegiances across the political divide. The son of a former British Rail chairman, he is reputed to be worth £130 million thanks to the success of Brunswick, the UK's biggest financial PR firm, which he founded in 1987. Before turning his hand to public relations, Sir Alan worked on an oil rig and managed rock bands. A rebellious teenager, his anti-Establishment attitude meant he was denied a place at Oxford despite an excellent academic record. His unconventional approach to business is said to persist in his tendency to kick off his shoes during meetings. Sir Alan, 62, started Brunswick in his parents' front room in 1987, but the firm now boasts many high-profile clients, including EMI, Pearson, Reuters and Time Warner. It is thought to have advised more than a quarter of FTSE 100 listed firms. Said to be a natural Labour supporter, Sir Alan was involved in attempts to rebrand Gordon Brown's public image during his ailing premiership. Mr Brown is godfather to Sir Alan's son, William. But the PR guru has also holidayed with David Cameron. He and the former Tory leader were pictured hitting the beach together in South Africa. Samantha Cameron is an ambassador for Save the Children. Sir Alan later lent one of his properties – a £16.8 million seven-bedroom townhouse in Holland Park – to Mr Cameron and his family after they left Downing Street. The PR mogul was among business leaders who accompanied Mr Cameron on a trade mission to China in 2013 before being knighted for services to business, charitable giving and philanthropy. In 2001, Sir Alan's 24-year marriage to Caroline, an artist, ended in divorce. In 2007, he married Jane Hardman, who had worked at Brunswick. Both Mr Cameron and Mr Brown were guests at the wedding. One of Sir Alan's siblings is Nathaniel Parker, the actor best known for playing Inspector Lynley in the BBC crime series. His other brother Oliver is a respected director. He is said to have use of a chauffeured Bentley and collects art by Sir Henry Moore as well as rare books. A keen angler, he owns half a £1.8million salmon beat – a stretch of river with fishing rights – on the Tay in Scotland. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

In a speech last night at the launch of the centre-right think tank Onward she said her party was seen as “too dour, too joyless and too authoritarian.” The canny Ms Davidson covered her criticism with an attack on Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party was a “cocktail of nostalgia and rage”, she said. The same jibe could have been levelled at the Brexiteers in the audience, which you suspect Ms Davidson was fully aware of. Standing next to her was Michael Gove who can be relied upon to gatecrash any Tory gathering where someone may arbitrarily say the word ‘modernisation.’ Gove’s presence was a reminder of the challenges the Tory moderates face if they want to refashion their party. The Environment Secretary can hand every puppy in the country a free doggy treat, personally pick up every bit of plastic on Camber Sands and embrace his inner wokeness but he will forever be contaminated by Brexit. A generation of young people will want more than a discount meal at Nando’s before they can forgive the Brexiteers. Gove’s call for a more liberal immigration policy was merely rubbing salt in the wounds. Nor did he help himself by making a speech in which showed all the social graces of a butcher at a vegan conference. He talked about Megham Markle’s “exotic” background and likened his alliance with Ms Davidson to Ike and Tina Turner, apparently unaware that was an abusive relationship. This was the dilemma few in the Tory Party wish to confront: how can it rebuild its reputation and speak to a modern generation when it is inextricably the party of leave? Tony Blair enters the Brexit fray again today. This time the former Prime Minister is directing his comments at Labour. He argues Jeremy Corbyn’s policy of deliberate ambiguity which aims to keep remainers on board while not upsetting voters in leave areas has run its course. Blair claims Labour is in worst of all possible worlds with remainers losing faith in the party’s willingness to stop Brexit and leavers sceptical the party is really in favour of leaving. Certainly, the leadership is looking increasingly out of step with its membership as illustrated by the selection in Lewisham East of a candidate who wants to remain in the single market. The risk for Jeremy Corbyn is not another speech by Blair, that plays into the hands of his supporters, but a showdown at the annual conference where the membership with union support demands a more resolute position on Brexit. The resignation of Ken Livingstone was not before time. Perhaps if had quit earlier it might have helped Labour at the local elections early this month. Many believe it was Labour’s failure to take Barnet, north London, which may have persuaded Jeremy Corbyn to cut loose his long-time ally. Livingstone’s remarks were offensive and inexcusable. His initial refusal to accept the offence caused marked a sad end to what had been a controversial but at times impressive career. As London mayor he oversaw two major projects, the congestion charge and the Oyster card, that were delivered on time and on budget. He helped deliver the Olympics, cut bus fares and introduced the free bike scheme. His response to the London bombings was pitch perfect. He made plenty of enemies but none worse than himself.

By Esther Webber, Richard Morris and Ryan Brown All times stated are UK Mark Devenport BBC News NI Political Editor Mark Devenport BBC News NI Political Editor Jeremy Corbyn says he is not asking or advocating for a border poll but would ensure the GFA is implemented. What happened? House of Commons Parliament An urgent question on branch closures by Marks and Spencer had MPs from across the house stating their concern at job losses in their constituencies. M&S announced earlier this week they would close 100 shops by 2022. The company says the changes are ""vital"" for their future. Future business in the Commons was announced, with MPs still not receiving news of dates for further EU legislation, this caused annoyance from Labour MPs, who accused the government of leaking dates to the Sky News political editor, Faisal Islam. The Commons returns on 4 June for Home Office questions, followed by the second reading of the Ivory Bill. The Brexit select committee criticises the lack of agreement on trade arrangements. Ahmadiyya Muslims debate House of Commons Parliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says that while MPs have focused on Pakistan, ""the UK is not immune to this scourge of religious intolerance"" and he apologises to the community. He says it is worrying that ""minorities worldwide"" are increasingly being targeted. It is not acceptable for any organisation or individual to incite violence, he states. ""All religious persecution in whatever form it manifests itself is abhorrent and deplorable,"" he adds. The government is responding to extremist influences with a ""cross-government, joined up approach"", he finishes. With that, the Commons adjourns for Whitsun week, and will return on 4 June. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament Shadow foreign office minister Liz McInnes says that Ahmadis believe that they are Muslims, yet in 1974 the Pakistani government amended the constitution to declare Ahmadiyya Muslims as non-Muslim. There are concerns that there are not fair trials offered to those accused of being an Ahmadiyya Muslim under the blasphemy laws in Pakistan, she adds. Ahmadis are effectively denied the right to vote under current electoral laws in the country, she states. She says many Ahmadi Muslims have fled to Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Thailand, and Ahmadis have been declared as ""deviant"" in Indonesia, she adds. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament The SNP\'s Patrick Grady says the SNP ""are deeply disappointed"" that the Pakistani government ""continues to condone"" the work of those who are critical of the Ahamadi community. He says there are laws in Pakistan which are supposed to tackle ""blasphemy"" but instead are used to tackle other religions ""by name"", adding that these practices have ""gone on for decades"". In order for people to complete a Pakistani passport application, people must denounce the founder of the Ahmadi movement, he states. Stephen Walker BBC News NI Political Correspondent Stephen Walker BBC News NI Political Correspondent MPs say it is \'highly unsatisfactory\' that ministers have yet to detail post-Brexit trading arrangements. Committee tweets Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament Liberal Democrat Sir Ed Davey says that in his constituency ""it has been one of the joys"" to get to know the Ahmadiyya community. He says there is a need to speak to the communities in both the UK and in Pakistan to encourage more tolerance. There is a concern that persecution of the community is becoming ""endemic and deep rooted"" in Pakistan. He finishes by saying there is consensus for the UK government to tell the Pakistani government that the current situation is ""unacceptable"". Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament Conservative Justine Greening says that the establishment of the Ahmadiyya community in her constituency led to the first mosque ever built in London in 1926. The Ahmadiyya community ""got everybody together after the 7/7 bombings many years ago,"" she states. She refers to literature which is put out in areas such as Ealing which may encourage shopkeepers not to serve people of the Ahmadiyya community. This is ""totally unacceptable"" on our own doorstep, she says. Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament Siobhain McDonagh takes the House on a ""global tour"" of the persecution of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, focusing on Pakistan and then turning to the hate ""overspill"" into the UK. The Labour MP says revealing oneself as Ahmadi can make one a ""magnet"" for persecution. Ms McDonagh says that the world\'s largest Ahmadiyya community exists in Pakistan and that perpetrators of persecution are given ""free rein"" there. In the country the sect is not legally allowed to call itself Muslim. The MP says persecution in Pakistan is faced ""from cradle to grave"". She says that they have effectively been denied the right to vote in the country for 40 years. Ms McDonagh gives example of persecution in the UK including the murder of an Ahmadi Muslim in the UK which was ""celebrated"" by some on social media. She also speaks about problems on student campuses. She ends her speech by telling the house that the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community are a ""vital part"" of her constituency. Competition and state aid debate House of Lords Parliament Lib Dem Lord German responds to Baroness Noakes\' earlier criticism of the subcommittees, saying their ""primary purpose is to scrutinise"". Brexit is the ""one show in town and it\'s perfectly appropriate to do that scrutiny"", he adds. He says on the report under discussion that the UK has a robust competition framework and ""continuing that robust regime is very important"". Ahmadiyya Muslim debate House of Commons Parliament Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh has tabled a debate on the persecution of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The Ahmadi follow the teaching of the Koran but they do not believe that Mohammed was the final prophet sent to guide mankind. For this reason it is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical. The Anhmadiyya community takes its name from its founder Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born in 1835 and was regarded by his followers as the messiah and a prophet. Last year, the BBC reported claims of discrimination against Ahmadi Muslims in Cardiff. Members of the sect said they had been shunned by other Muslims in the city with one member claiming to have lost his job. Northern Ireland Committee Report Debate House of Commons Parliament Dr Andrew Murrison introduces his committee\'s report Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland. The chair of the Northern Ireland Committee recommends that the Northern Ireland Secretary restarts devolution talks and says there is a ""sense of drift"" where important decisions are not being made. The Northern Ireland Executive collapsed in January 2017 when the deputy first minister resigned. Northern Ireland has had neither an Executive nor a functioning Assembly at Stormont for well over a year. The report concludes that ""that little would be achieved by holding yet another election"". The committee identifies a number of ""wide reaching"" decisions that need to be taken immediately, a list that is ""growing every day"". Dr Murrison identifies problems such as a lack of a Northern Ireland Policing Board meaning that senior police appointments cannot take place. Committee tweets Carillion Statement House of Commons Parliament The Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, tells MPs that the taxpayer and the the public ""deserve"" to know what happen to Carillion. She says the committee identified ""clear and compelling problems"" with the business in the months before its collapse. The chair says there is ""great secrecy"" around government contracts and that they are ""skewed"" to the contractor rather than service user. Ms Hillier warns that ""secrecy leads to a cosy relationship"". The committee found in November 2017 that a provisional black rating of Carillion was recommended but following representation from the company the cabinet did not confirm the designation. Carillion collapsed less than two months later. She tells the government, there may be information the committee may put into the public domain at later date. BBC political editor tweets Competition and state aid debate House of Lords Parliament Conservative Baroness Noakes says Lords EU subcommittees have produced ""over 30 reports entitled Brexit this or Brexit that"" and due to the tight timeframe for Brexit this ""scrutiny has little or no meaning"". She continues: ""I question whether we should be working in this way - is it reasonable and proportionate?"" She also says the fact that ministers have ""dealt with [the number of reports on Brexit] in good heart is a tribute to them"". Carillion Statement House of Commons Parliament The Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier is making a statement on Carillion. The select committee published its report: Government risk assessments relating to Carillion yesterday. The report includes a number of risk assessments relating to Carillion. Papers show that it was not until after Carillion issued a profit warning on 10 July 2017, that the government downgraded the company to a red rating. Previously it had been rated amber for a number of months due to its performance against contracts with the defence and justice ministries. Carillion collapsed in January under a debt of £1.5bn. It employed 43,000 people, around 20,000 of them in the UK, thousands of whom lost their job. The construction company held numerous public contracts, such as the maintenance of schools and prisons, all of which had to be brought under government control, at a cost to the taxpayer.

MERRY JANE has a new show on Facebook Live, broadcasting every Tuesday & Thursday at 4:20pm ET, on the dot. We’ll be bringing you guests from the worlds of cannabis and culture to just kick back, relax, talk life and blow some dro with our editor-in-chief Noah Rubin. We’ll also be taking questions from our lit audience, so get ready to roll your favorite herb and chill with us for an online smokeout. On our first episode of the new year, we’re joined by very special guest (and newly minted recreational cannabis provider) Dr. Dina. Hollywood's marijuana maven tells us about her first time smoking a joint (the result of some very persuasive peer pressure from Snoop Dogg), expanding Kathy Bates’ cannabis palate, and what it’s like to open the doors of her 16-year-old medical marijuana dispensary to adult-use shoppers — and that’s all before the dabs! After busting out the first set of cannabis concentrates on our humble internet talk show, Dina talks us through Jeff Sessions’ latest assault on America’s cannabis industry and opens the newly state-compliant childproof packaging on the Weekend Box. For more good vibes from the Southern California cannabis queen, be sure to check out the second half of season one of Netflix’s dispensary sitcom Disjointed, on which Dina served as a cannabis consultant, and stop by one of her two SoCal dispensaries, both of which now serve all customers over 21. Time flies when you’re having fun, but there’s a lot more coming down the pipe. Tune in every Tuesday & Thursday at 4:20pm EST to MERRY JANE’s Facebook page to catch all the ganja-fied glory, and follow us on Instagram to find out who’s joining our joint sessions. We’ll see you there! Published on January 11, 2018 MERRY JANE is based in Los Angeles, California and is dedicated to elevating the discussion around cannabis culture. State officials closed the case against dispensary chain Sweet Leaf after a long investigation, leaving the company’s owners banned from the Colorado pot industry for 15 years. We crawled our way through the world’s largest cat convention to give you the scoop on litter boxes, celebrity cats, fur-covered rappers, and more. The Mexican Supreme Court can overturn the country's cannabis prohibition laws by issuing five consistent rulings on the matter, and a team of lawyers have already won three such rulings. Canadian police are training with U.S. “drug recognition experts,” while provinces establish rules for in-vehicle cannabis possession and roadside sobriety tests. The Great White North will open its adult-use cannabis industry across the country next week, but experts are already preparing for sold out products and the threat of a persistent black market.

Porn providers, including independent “cam girls,” often pay outrageous fees for hosting and payment processing, keep only half of their total gross, and are often even denied banking. “The porn world is a magical place,” said porn actress Janice Griffith in a Medium post. “It has rules and politics of its own creation, but it still falls victim to all of the struggles the ‘real’ world faces.” One struggle porn actresses share with the cannabis business and, until recently, Bitcoin and the blockchain itself, is the inability to get banking services, never mind loans for expansion, insurance and bonding. As a result, most porn actresses run a cash-only business, leading to usurious fees and interest. They are vulnerable to theft, robbery, and violence. SpankChain aims to change all that. “Our belief is that payment channels are the key to near-term cryptocurrency adoption, and the adult industry is a perfect testing grounds for creating parallel economies that transcend the inefficiencies of legacy banking institutions,” wrote the founders under the name Spanktoshi Nakabooty, a pseudonym. “Our immediate goal is to disrupt the adult cam industry by charging only a 5% fee instead of the 50% industry standard and become the dominant cryptocurrency payment platform for the adult industry.” SpankChain’s board includes software engineer turned blockchain founder Ameen Soleimani, software developer James Young, software developer James Wolever, plus a couple more engineers and salespeople. Fittingly, there are also a couple of porn actresses, the talent, on the board of advisors. Spankchain sets its self apart by way of several policies. It only charges 5% to 10% of a performer’s fees rather than the porn industry standard of 50%. Viewers also can tip performers directly and develop a more patron-artist relationship via micropayments, monthly payments, and large payouts based on smart contracts. Spank Chain also improves on the Ethereum protocol by eliminating the need to spend tokens every single transaction. Ethereum’s fee mechanism, gas, is only charged when users open a new payment channel or exits a payment channel. Otherwise, users can make as many transactions as they want. SpankChain seems ahead of other Ethereum developers, such as Raiden or FunFair, who have been working on building useful payment channel technologies for the blockchain for some time. If SpankChain can crack the micropayment challenge it may revolutionize the entire gig economy. SpankChain also will offer a wallet and a preview game called CryptoTitties, a pun of the insanely popular cat breeding Ethereum application CryptoKitties. The concept is simple: Performers post an image of their cleavage on the site with an Ethereum address and fans will tip the images they find most appealing or arousing.

Janice,Griffith,['https://www.gq.com/story/how-porn-handles-consent-janice-griffith-interview'],b'7134',"['Subscribe Now Get the Magazine 1 Year for $15 Adult film star and director Janice Griffith drops some knowledge. In the time of #TimesUp and #MeToo, and as the culture of holding men accountable for their abuses of power strengthens, it’s becoming apparent that beyond a simple yes or no, people do not fully understand consent or know how to have an honest conversation around it. Which is why there’s a lot to learn from the adult film world, where performers are arguably the most adept at navigating sex’s social contract. The adult industry has always been on forefront of technological innovation—porn helped pioneer everything from online payments to streaming video—and moving the needle on interpersonal communication during intercourse isn’t any different. While on set with adult film star and director, Janice Griffith, I witnessed the most rigorous discussion on consent I’ve ever seen. Everything from likes and dislikes to firmness of touch to how many fingers are allowed in which holes is openly addressed—and everyone agrees that, yes, sex will be happening. “Even if you are hiring an escort to have sex, you discuss what you’re going to do beforehand,” said Griffith. “Honestly, sex workers are on the forefront of this discussion.” The conversation isn’t sterile, or a mood killer: Consent does not need to feel like a legally binding agreement between two vendors. It simply needs to be clear and thoughtful. We sat down with Griffith to discuss how those of us outside the industry can have healthy, proactive discussions about consent. Fostering healthy communication starts with being able to make it clear what you want from the situation. “Think about what you want to happen. Do you want future dates? Are you thinking about having sex? On that sort of spectrum it’s reasonable to ask people what they want, too,” Griffith said. Then shift the focus away from yourself. “If you are interested in this person, you should be taking hints about their behavior towards you, and their attitude from the very beginning of the interaction. Are they being friendly? Are they being flirty? Do you understand social cues? Some people don’t, and that’s okay, but know how to ask. I think a lot of people are scared to ask things.” Keeping the conversation colloquial can help. “There are light, conversational ways to bring up plans or intentions early in the night. Asking what they’re up to later or what they want to do can get the conversation started,” said Griffith. Don’t stop there: Consent isn’t a one-time thing. It’s an ongoing exchange, like a series of checkpoints. “The reason that I’m scared to say no or be disagreeable is directly correlated to how you’ve treated me throughout the course of knowing you,” said Griffith. “Even if it’s just one night, the way you speak to me forms my idea of how you’re going to respect my wishes.” Making sure a woman isn’t scared to say no is easy if you allow her to feel like you’ll accept her decisions. You need to reassure her that you won’t be peeved if her needs or wants differ from yours. Make it clear that if she doesn’t want to have sex, you’re cool with that—and then actually be cool with that. “Just because someone doesn’t want to have sex with you, doesn’t mean that they aren’t interested in you,” Griffith said. “It doesn’t mean they hate you. It doesn’t mean that they don’t love you. It means that right then, they don’t want to have sex with you.” Pay attention to physical signs and body language, too. “Important non-verbal cues include mouth involvement. If you kiss someone and if they aren’t kissing you back, if they are not actively engaged in your kiss, if they tense up and start to pull away, those should all be things to indicate, ‘Hey, let’s chill out, let’s take a minute and reassess.” There’s a long history of violence against women from rejected men, so be aware that your partner may not be comfortable saying no outright. This is on you: If you are getting “I don’t knows” and “I’m not sures”, you need to make the decision to stop on your own. “I don’t know” does not equal yes. It means they do not know. Consent requires a yes, and “I don’t know” is not yes. In that case, added Griffith, “I think it would be best to back off physically. Put some space between you and the person. Ask them if they are okay. Ask them how you could make them more comfortable and then express your desires or needs and how you can make them comfortable, too.” Don’t use a bargaining chip like blue balls to attempt to sway someone to engage in physical intimacy with you. It’s lazy and corny! A great way to find physical relief after you agreeably and graciously accept a “no”is to jerk off when you part ways. “Your boner is not my problem,” Griffith lamented. Sex should not something that is done to women, it should be something women actively participate in. Judgmental men make discussions around intimacy, and consent in particular, very difficult. “‘Stuck up bitch’. ‘All girls are prudes.’ ‘Girls that want to have sex are whores.’ ‘You can’t rape a whore.’ ‘Girls that don’t want to have sex are prudes,’” said Griffith. “It creates a weird binary where it’s hard to sort of toe this line and exist as a healthy sexual being and have these conversations up front.” While it may feel harmless, don’t neg as a form of flirting. It creates a toxic space for communication, which is a surefire way to get unclear answers on wants, desires, and consent. As Griffith laid it out: “Consent is about logic. It’s being careful based on what’s going on around you. If you can’t be concerned about how someone feels, think about going to jail. If that’s what motivates you not rape, I don’t respect you, but I’ll take it.” Subscribe now and get a FREE weekender bag and the GQ Style Guide. © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Janice,Griffith,['https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d354qw/spankchain-reward-for-congressmen-politicians-who-supported-fosta-sesta'],b'7133',"[""Image via Shutterstock An Ethereum startup is offering $25,000 to the first 10 sex workers who come forward with information about clients who were also members of Congress who voted to pass the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). The campaign is run by SpankChain, which had its ICO in October, and is one of several recent startups for sex on the blockchain. The company is attempting to break into the often expensive, discriminatory world of adult industry payment processing using the blockchain. Ninety-seven senators voted to pass FOSTA-SESTA in March. It will become law if the president signs it this week. FOSTA-SESTA is a mashup bill that incorporates parts of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), and was framed by supporters as an anti-sex trafficking measure. Open internet activists and sex workers warned it would endanger people more, instead of helping actual victims of trafficking, by making websites more liable for what their users do and say on their platforms. In less than a month since its passage, there have already been repercussions on the industry and beyond—including the shutdown of Craigslist personals and stricter enforcement of Google Drive’s policies on sexual content. Janice Griffith, co-founder of SpankChain and an adult performer, told me in an email that the company hasn’t yet decided what it will do with the information it gathers from this campaign. Whether the information is published will involve a “mutual decision” between SpankChain and the person coming forward, she said. Read more: From SpankChain to Bigboobscoin, Startups Keep Trying to Get People to Pay for Sex on the Blockchain “We hopefully plan to utilize information gathered for leverage against elected officials whose political motives are hypocritical and selfish; pushing legislation that endangers instead of protecting–outlawing and putting the same people they purchase services and time from at risk,” Griffith said. Many lawmakers have resigned because they’ve preached conservativism to their constituency and pass laws that hurt women while simultaneously practicing the behavior they speak out against. But sex worker-rights advocate Kate D'Adamo told me that SpankChain’s idea could further harm the industry. She said in an email that at first glance, it seems like SpankChain is “capitalizing on the stigma of the sex trade and using it to shame someone, while not caring about the collateral damage that this kind of thing does to sex worker rights.” D’Adamo compared it to the kind of political reward-money stunts pornograher Larry Flynt used to pull in the 90’s: “This is entirely about being angry about the bill and nothing to do with sex worker support.” SpankChain says it plans to pay people who do come forward in either USD or Ethereum, whichever the sex worker prefers. “We want to expose the hypocrisy and corrupt representation that exists within our government, working not to serve the people but attack them for their choices and allow lives lost as collateral damage under a charade of well-intent,” Griffith said. “SESTA does not serve to actually end sex trafficking or forced labor of any kind, rather it pushes consensual workers out of places they have created for themselves and criminals further underground.” Sign up for Motherboard Premium.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1010590.0

This week’s RAW brought to you by Janice Griffith and Riley Reid!!! Video package for The Greatest Royal Rumble starts RAW off. We are in Canada, so cue in the “Bizarro World” comment from the commentary crew. Double time said cue as they boo like crazy the minute Roman Reigns’ music hits. They boo louder the minute we hear his name. and that took less than 6 minutes…Montreal is “different.” Coach is back. Reigns says he’s not going to make any excuses, but the crowd doesn’t care. They boo him. Reigns says we’ve seen the footage and read the tweets, and we are looking at the REAL Universal Champion. ROMAN SUCKS chant. Reigns says he should be the Universal Champion, but he’s not…yet. BOOOOO. Reigns says people doubted him, lost faith in him, but he is a man of his word and he kept his word; he beat Brock in that cage (but he lost…). He will never lose faith in himself. He would tell this to Brock, but we all know he’s not here, so he’s going to turn his attention to another man 0 JOE IS ON THE SCREEN! Joe says Reigns is assuming any of us had any faith in him to begin with. He told Reigns he’d lose to Lesnar, and this Sunday at Backlash, he puts Reigns downward spiraling career to sleep. Reigns is snickering in the ring. The music of Jinder Mahal hits, and out comes the Modern Day Macarena. Jinder says there’s one thing he can’t stand, and it’s someone who makes excuses for their shortcomings. Jinder has a legit excuse cuz Jeff Hardy cheated, but you don’t hear him complaining. Reigns lost to Brock fair and square. At Backlash, he’ll lose to Joe. Tonight, Reigns will lose to Jinder. The music of Sami hits, and the crowd goes wild for the first time of the night! They sing loudly along with his song. I love it. Sami gives a shoutout to Montreal, and speaks some French. Sami wants to get down to business. The two of them are complaining about the Royal Rumble, when due to an injury, Sami wasn’t even able to go. He caught a very serious case of Vertigo. He’s feeling a lot better tonight, though.

Owens stays at the top of the ramp. Owens cuts himself a little French promo then gets a FRENCH YES Chant!!! haha Owens says he knows that Sami can beat Roman Reigns, but he thinks that tonight, people want to see Kevin Owens vs Reigns.

He’s not that important, guys… Shock above all shocks, we get the official announcement of a six man for later tonight. Elias has a question for everyone here tonight. Elias says he is a gift, truly, and sometimes he gets so lost in his own thoughts that he forgets how special it is for us all to see him. He wonders who watched the Greatest Royal Rumble, and talks about eliminating all of the big names. He is reaching a new level of fame that no one can comprehend, definitely not Bobby Roode. When he tells everyone to hold their applause, everyone claps. haha. Elias starts paying, and the crowd claps along. Eli insults Roode a bit, and I just love how into it this crowd is.

They scream in a different language after, to really hammer home that they are heels because they are foreigners. we return to RAW with another self-fellatio of the Greatest Royal Rumble. Seth Rollins is here to give us a history lesson starting with his win of the IC Title and culminating him being here live in Montreal. He calls the crowd wild and he’s not wrong. We get an OLE chant from the crowd. Seth takes in the cheers for a while. It takes a long while, but the crowd finally gets on the same page with a YOU DESERVE IT chant. Seth tells the crowd thank you in French, and it gets a huge pop. OUI! Chant!!! Seth says that he doesnt want to be anything like Brock Lesnar. Seth even brings up the fact that Roman’s feet hit first. He doesn’t want to only show up when it’s convenient or when the price is right. He wants to be a fighting champion. He wants to be out here every Monday Night… Finn Balor is here to interrupt in French. He introduces himself then heads into the ring. He says the flight was long enough for him to rewatch the ladder match and see just how close he came to becoming the champ. Hats off to Seth because he beat Finn by ‘this’ much. The way Finn sees it is that they have had four singles matches. Seth has won 2, and Finn has won 2. This makes them even. Seth is out here talking about being a fighting champion, but how about he shows everyone. Seth says he has The Miz this Sunday for the title. But…. Finn: “I Like that Butt!” Seth will leave it up to the crowd. The crowd is down. Seth says he’s on. We got two people that disagree with this match. The Miz’s music hits, and out comes his former entourage. Didn’t they ditch Miz? Why play his music? They are still officially going by The Miztourage. Axel says not to worry about what these people want. Worry about themselves. Bo tells them that they shouldn’t be fighting each other, they should all be fighting together. Last week, they made a mistake of approaching them separately, but what they should have done was have a group conversation. They reveal shirts with all four of their faces on them. Bo tells Finn to forget about The Balor Club and The Shield. Look at what Bo sees. FOUR…..The Four Horsemen of the WWE. Axel tries to goad it on with some eh and huhs. Seth talks it over with Finn a little bit aways from the guys. Finn shakes his head adamently. Seth turns, says no, sorry. Finn drops the hand signal down and BO says fine and they don’t need it. LOSER CHANT. BO and Axel attack! Well, they try to. Superkick to Bo. Slingblade to Axel. Finn and Seth smile. Finn with the 1916! Nice. The Riott Squad’s music sounds like a bonus level of Sonic. We get an interview with Sasha Banks before her match. Charley wonders if Sasha attempted to work things out with Bayley so that she could be in her corner. Sasha says no, she doesn’t know what’s going on with Bayley – she hasn’t heard a word from her. The Riott Squad is trying to take over, and Bayley’s ok with that. If Ruby wants a Riot, she can Bank on one…. Man, who writes this shit… Match 3: Ruby Riot (w/ The Riott Squad) vs Sasha Banks Lockup to start. Ruby gets Sasha into the corner. Ref breaks it up.

We never know when a bully could strike. It could happen any time. It happened to her. At Disneyworld. Nia spent the entire day making fun of her height and asking the employees if Alexa was tall enough for the teacup ride. It’s a cup….you just sit….in a cup….(Sad face). Then at lunch, Nia insisted on giving a kids menu to Alexa. Nia thought it was hilarious. Alexa can still see it; turkey leg in each of her hands. Just laughing. Nia turned the happiest place on Earth into the saddest day ever. But at Backlash, no matter what nasty tricks or ridicule Alexa may endure, she will win back her title. She won’t let the bully win. Beautiful. We get Titus in the backstage with Renee who tries to cover up his fall, then readily admits to falling. He says what’s important is that you get back up. He hopes that this inspires people to —– Titus is interrupted by Baron and says what Renee should have asked was if Titus knew what would have been more impressive and inspirational – if Titus hadn’t fallen in the first place. Baron doesn’t know why Renee is wasting her time with this guy. He then walks away. Titus says it’s ok. We shift gears to Matt and Bray. Bray is reading his favorite Non-Fiction story of all time. Of course, our story has always been told. The vessels known as Bray and Matthew have forever transcended time and space. Matt then takes us on a history lesson. They were there at the beginning, at history’s greatest triumph. But nothing can compare to their greatest victory. Apparently, they were there for the moon landing. The light goes out, and Matt looks to his partner, Bray, who is holding both titles. He says that they are the darkness and the light. They will continue to consume everything. Behold – the Deleters of Worlds. We go back to commentary where Michael no-sells this all. We go back to last week, specifically the ten woman tag team match up. COle brings up Rousey.

Titus has two left feet and has made a career of looking stupid and playing the fool. His opponent is no different in No Way Jose. This nonsense makes him want to puke. He came here to make money, and he doesn’t make money trying to make each of us laugh. Thats’ why no one is on his level. Tonight, he puts an end to the nonsense.

Janice,Griffith,['http://knau.org/post/scott-thybonys-canyon-commentary-harvey-girl-turns-cattle-rustler'],b'7131',"['It’s time for Scott Thybony’s latest Canyon Commentary. Today, we hear the story of Cecil Creswell, a former Harvey Girl and the only known female cattle rustler in the 20th century. Scott takes us to a stark, desolate landscape where Creswell lived alone on land she homesteaded. She sat alone at night in a two-room house built with her own hands, reading Shakespeare by the light of a lantern. Her paintings of Southwestern landscapes covered the walls, and stored in a box were a few hand-written manuscripts. She had arrived in Arizona when she was 17-years old and went to work at the Harvey House in Winslow, wearing a starched white pinafore over a black dress. But now she no longer owned a single dress, and all she had to eat was meat stolen from other ranchers. The Harvey Girl had turned cattle rustler. The story of Cecil Creswell has brought me to the site of the ranch she homesteaded. Walking about the wreckage of her home, I think about a woman living alone on the edge of a dry river and the hardships she endured. Like many of the Harvey Girls she soon married, but unlike most she soon divorced. Her second marriage ended badly when she discovered her husband was already married. During an argument in a Winslow corral he drew a knife and stabbed her. And he kept stabbing. Despite being badly wounded she was able to grab a rock and knock him out cold. Eventually she filed a homestead claim on a barren quarter-section of land outside town. The Harvey Girl became a hardscrabble rancher and worked the place alone. She dug a cattle tank by hand and headed into the mountains to trap mustangs, breaking them single handedly. She wore men’s clothing and a cowboy hat pulled down to her eyebrows. Riding into town she would tie her black stallion to a parking meter and trade for groceries, having no money. And when her food ran out she began rustling cattle. She rode over the grasslands with her rifle always handy, and during a feud with a neighbor shot the horn off his saddle while he was sitting on it. Those who knew her said she wouldn’t have missed if she was aiming at him. “I know you are a crack shot with that rifle of yours,” the judge told her, “but I cannot tolerate you shooting at your neighbor with the darn thing anytime you chose.” Cecil had to surrender her guns for six months. “All of the men feared her because she had nothing to lose,” said Winslow historian Janice Griffith. “She’d just as soon shoot them as anything, and they knew it. She had been mistreated too many times to entirely trust men, but just because she didn’t trust them doesn’t mean she trusted women either. She wanted everybody to leave her alone.” An investigation into missing livestock ended in the winter of 1954 when the sheriff and his deputy drove out to her place to serve a warrant. They were joined by livestock inspectors who discovered stolen calves in her holding pen. Before taking her to jail, the deputy let her go into the house alone, and suddenly the men heard what sounded like a door slamming. It was a single rifle shot. The sheriff and his deputy found her body inside, and continued searching the house. They were surprised by how spotlessly clean she had kept the place, the way a Harvey Girl might. Over time Cecil Creswell had grown more reclusive as the loneliness and isolation set in. In her final years, she rarely spoke more than a few words to anyone. In this place of solitude she was left with little more than an endless sky pressing down. I head back to town the way I came, leaving the land to keep its own. View the discussion thread. The azure western bluebird and noisy red-breasted nuthatch are among the most common and beloved birds on the Colorado Plateau. But, will they and others still live here as the Southwest’s climate warms and dries? Our national parks may be a deciding factor. This weekend, managers at Glen Canyon Dam will begin a first-of-its-kind experiment to release water that benefits bugs, which play a vital role in the Colorado River ecosystem. KNAU’s Melissa Sevigny reports. The water we drink when we’re at Grand Canyon National Park comes from a deep aquifer that channels it through a series of caves and sink holes inside the canyon walls. Three British tourists killed in a fiery helicopter crash at the Grand Canyon earlier this year died of smoke inhalation and burns that covered their entire bodies, according to autopsies released Wednesday. Firefighters are working under favorable weather conditions to control a blaze south of the Grand Canyon.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1010590.0
Amy,Walter,['https://sandtonchronicle.co.za/200986/a-friend-in-need/'],b'7130',"[""11°C | 28°C In January, Grade 10s and 11s of Crawford College Sandton were invited to submit applications to become a peer counsellor at the school. A peer counsellor is a schoolchild that assists his/her fellow peers to solve their own problems by listening, supporting, educating and by being a role model. Often when people experience difficulties, frustration and worries, they turn to a friend for help and support, according to the school. Friends always seem to be more approachable, as they usually share the same interests and concerns. The applicants who were accepted attended a workshop to train as a peer counsellor. The aim of this workshop was to allow the counsellors to become a team, be trained in basic counselling skills and to plan for this year. The new counsellors were able to interact with the counsellors from the previous year and to learn what they had experienced, both the highs and the lows. Nicola Pereira, a counsellor at Crawford College Sandton and teacher in charge of the peer counsellors said, “The aim is to create an environment where people are free to feel safe, comfortable and confidentiality is maintained. “Authentic integration of feelings, words and actions, such as having respect for peers and their ability to solve their own problems is essential in building trust and security.” The following Grade 10 and 11s were appointed as counsellors: Charlotte Abrahams, Courtney Sibanda, Amy Cho, Riov Ramdhaney, Ammarah Hoosen, Erin Serman, Amy Walter, Zoe Neuhaus, Owethu Mbele, Bhavaniya Moodliar, Raquel Mitchelson, Kaisha Naidoo, Eva le Touze, Rinya Singh, Chloe Brayshaw and Adam Kirsch.

Amy,Walter,['https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunday-warner-meacham/'],b'7127',"['Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., joins Senate intelligence committee chair Richard Burr, R-N.C., on October 4, 2017 to update reporters on their inquiry into Russian election interference. After ten were killed in an attack on a high school south of Houston on Friday, Washington mourned another mass shooting in America. ""This has been going on too long in our country,"" President Trump said at the White House, ""too many years, too many decades now."" The assault was the nation\'s deadliest such attack since the massacre in Parkland, Florida that sparked a movement for stricter gun control laws. Also this week, President Trump ramped up his attacks on ""the Obama FBI,"" suggesting federal authorities may have planted a spy into his 2016 presidential campaign. The president\'s alarm came as the special counsel\'s Russia probe rounded the corner on its first year, decried by the president as ""the greatest Witch Hunt in American History."" However, Mueller\'s team is not the only investigation probing Russian election meddling. The Senate Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages Wednesday from its inquiry into a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer. And the Senate intelligence committee announced it had finalized its review, concluding that Russian President Vladimir Putin intervened in 2016 to help then-candidate Trump. On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders were dealt a blow Friday as opposition from Democrats and the conservative House Freedom Caucus scuttled a bill to renew popular farm subsidies and tighten work requirements for food stamp recipients. The Freedom Caucus is demanding a vote on a conservative proposal to curb legal immigration and support President Trump\'s promised border wall with Mexico. In a controversial move Friday, the Trump administration proposed reviving a Reagan-era policy that abortion rights supporters have pilloried as a ""gag rule"" on federally funded family planning clinics. The move comes as Democratic enthusiasm grows for this year\'s congressional midterm elections, when the party hopes to flip crucial seats. And next week, South Korean President Moon Jae-in will fly to Washington to consult with President Trump over his planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Despite a spat over comments by key White House security aide John Bolton, the Trump administration is forging ahead with the meeting some hope will make history denuclearizing the peninsula. This Sunday, join Margaret Brennan (@margbrennan) for a discussion of all these issues and more on ""Face the Nation"" (@FaceTheNation). Don\'t miss our interview of Larry Kudlow (@larry_kudlow), U.S. National Economic Council director. We\'ll hear from the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, Virginia Sen.

The day before that, Democrats’ lead on the generic ballot dipped to its smallest level of Trump’s presidency. The one remaining benchmark was for Dems to reach their own low-water mark on the ballot. That would be 44.3 percent, which they touched at the very beginning of Trump’s term and then once in February of this year. Yesterday they were at 45.0 percent, seemingly in no danger of bottoming out. Today? 44.2 percent, a new 16-month low. Not only that, but their lead is also at a 16-month low — just 4.0 points. As recently as two months ago the Democratic lead was more than double that. There’s a catch, though. The RCP average is based on the most recent national polls taken. Those polls cycle in and out, obviously: When Gallup or Quinnipiac, say, publishes a new one, it replaces the oldest of the ones currently being used to calculate the average. The newest poll in the average today is … Reuters, which has Democrats leading on the generic ballot by one thin point, 38/37. Reuters is the *only* major pollster, though, to have the Dems below 40 percent. Most have them at 42 percent or better. Today’s data may well be an outlier. Nor is this the first time recently that Reuters has found an unusually low number for Democrats. Last week it had them at 39 percent at a moment when other respected pollsters like Pew and Monmouth had them at 48-49(!). None of that is to say that Reuters is wrong, but for whatever reason their surveys recently do seem to have a much, much higher of people saying “don’t know” when asked which party they prefer compared to other pollsters. Odds are very good that as we get a fresh batch of new polling from others early next week, Reuters will cycle out of the RCP average and the Democratic generic-ballot share will rise again. This may, in other words, be the low point for Dem polling for awhile, with nowhere to go but up. There are other reasons to keep midterm expectations “realistic,” shall we say. Polls only tell you how people choose when they’re forced to choose. They don’t tell you who’ll get off the couch in November to go wait on line to vote. Certainly it’s Democrats who have the advantage in enthusiasm. Or do they? Amy Walter: [T]here are some signs that GOP voters may be catching up with Democrats on the measure of intensity. Well-respected GOP pollster David Winston (an expert on all things House), wrote recently: “New surveys — private and media polls — seem to show that the enthusiasm gap, which has plagued the Republican base for the past year, might, at last, be closing. In our April 28-30 Winning the Issues survey, we asked voters to tell us how likely they are to vote in November on a 1-9 scale, with 1 meaning a voter was not planning on going to the polls and 9 meaning they absolutely would. What we found was good news for Republicans. Both parties are at parity when it comes to self-reported likelihood of voting. Conservative Republicans came in at 8.22 with Republicans overall at 8.16. Democrats, whose enthusiasm for voting had previously topped Republicans, are now at 8.12, with liberal Democrats at 8.20.” Part of the reason for the increase in enthusiasm is the fact that Republicans now have something around which to rally – specifically an improved economy and tax cut law. It also helps that the president and the GOP-controlled Congress are not currently at war with one another as they were during the health care debate. Back then, congressional Republicans not only lacked substantive accomplishments, but the president was actively calling them out on Twitter as incompetent. That’s reason for optimism, notes Walter, but tempered optimism. After all, the generic ballot tells you about the overall mood of the country but nothing about swing districts, which is where the House will be won or lost. And Trump’s job approval, while considerably better now than it was late last year, is still pretty stinky. When he was at 37 percent last winter, the GOP was staring at a “red wedding” scenario this November. Now that he’s at 43.6, the risk of a wipeout is much reduced — but not gone. Clinton and Obama were both in the mid-40s approval-wise before their own first-term midterms, notes Walter, and each ended up drowning in Republican waves. “That’s what this new Democratic Party is about” You can shut the barn door, but the horses are long gone “Are you the moderator or the host, or arguing a liberal talking point?” “That is the usual process, and my folks assure me that the usual process was followed.” “the Tea Party is little more than a weird and disorderly mob” Every time you think the world has changed, it really hasn’t Shutout? Kavanaugh effect? It’s a poor carpenter who blames his tools “Today’s Democratic Party is for open-borders socialism.” Trending “It’s like the land of the living dead.” Why people hate the media, Chapter MMCCCLXXXII. “He showed himself to be too biased to be impartial.”']",0.0,13.0,1.0833333333333333,0.0,1023578.0

Andersen with partner Holden Evers took on fellow Salinas High School players Bryce Zinani and Joseph Russo in the match. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Salinas >> Adam Hidas hasn’t tasted defeat all year, except in challenge matches in practice with teammate Henry Chen. The Stevenson School sophomore had challenged Chen for the No. 1 spot as recently as last week, falling for the second time this year to him 6-1, 6-1. “When Henry is in a rhythm, he’s tough,” Hidas said. So is Hidas, who put together arguably his best match of the season Wednesday in upsetting Chen 6-4, 6-3 at the Monterey Bay League Singles Tennis Championships at Chamisal Tennis Club. “I wasn’t expecting to lose,” said Chen, who is from Taiwan. “But being upset about it won’t change anything. I just have to redeem myself at the section tournament.” Both Hidas and Chen will advance to the Central Coast Section singles tournament in two weeks, as will the MBL champion doubles team of Bryce Zinani and Joseph Russo of Salinas. The two seniors and cousins combined their talents to knock off freshman teammates Holden Evers and Brayden Andersen 7-5, 5-7, 6-0. Hidas, who was 12-0 in league playing No. 2 singles, served well and put the ball in places that had Chen on the run. “I don’t want to take anything away from Adam,” Chen said. “He played a bit higher than his level and I played a bit lower than mine.” While Chen didn’t want to cast blame on his racket, he was forced to play the championship match with a teammates’ racket after he broke the strings in all three of his racquets Tuesday. “It makes a difference,” Chen said. “I string my own rackets in my dorm. But because I was out here all day on Tuesday, I had to focus on my homework. This is a lesson in being better prepared.” Chen, who was 15-0 going into the tournament, had dropped just one first set all season, that coming in Tuesday’s quarterfinals. And while Chen engaged in numerous rallies with Hidas, it was his understudy who was finishing the rallies with a wicked cross court shot. “I think the most important reason I won today is I kept my composure,” Hidas said. “I didn’t lose focus when things didn’t go as expected. And I kept him out of his rhythm.” Hidas used a hard flat serve to put Chen on his heels, then relied on his forehand to drop balls deep on the back baseline, some of which were unreturnable. “I was able to mix my shots,” Hidas said. “My cross court rollers were good. And at times I served well. I see myself as an underdog. I’ll go into CCS flying under the radar.” Up until a week ago, Zinani and Russo were singles players for the Cowboys, who qualified for the CCS tournament as a team for the first time in over two decades. Yet, the pair put their efforts together as a doubles tandem with the thought of winning a title and moving on to the CCS tournament. “We’ve only played together for this event,” Russo said. “It felt really weird.” And while the pair had breezed through the first three rounds to reach the finals, Russo and Zinani found themselves down 5-2 in the first set to their teammates. “At that point, I’m thinking I’m a senior,” Zinani said. “Make this count.” Zinani and Russo got locked in and went on a run that enabled them to win the next five games to win the first set. “This is our last year,” Russo said. “It was important to encourage each other and stay positive.” Yet, the pressure mounted when the pair couldn’t maintain the momentum, falling 7-5 in the second set, forcing a tiebreaker set. “Sure there was pressure,” Zinani said. “We’ve never been in this position to have a chance to win a title.” That encouragement Russo spoke of got contagious in the third set as the dynamic duo looked like a pair who have played together for more than a week. While Evers and Andersen engaged in lengthy rallies with Zinani and Russo, they couldn’t match the intensity that their teammates picked up. “We had good communication,” Russo said. “We focused on each game.” The pair didn’t lose a game in the third set, needing 13 minutes to close out the two freshmen, who also qualified for the CCS tournament. “I thought we served well,” Zinani said. Russo offered a different perspective. “It feels good to be over with,” Russo said. John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337. Sign up for email newsletters']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1016936.0

Even state Supreme Courts have received some coverage in the wake of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s takedown of state GOP’s unconstitutional gerrymandering. This year, 32 states are holding state Supreme Court elections, with a total of 74 seats up for election. If the blue wave sweeps judicial offices as well as Congress in November, the ideological composition of our state judiciaries could shift left for decades. Unfortunately, even with increased awareness of the importance of the judiciary, the limited media coverage of state Supreme Court races has focused on swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin. (We actually spoke with Michigan Supreme Court candidate Sam Bagenstos on the podcast last month.) But there are Democrats running for state Supreme Court seats all across the country, even in red states like Texas, where three Republican justices are up for re-election. With a grand total of zero Democrats sitting on the Texas Supreme Court bench, these three races are monumental if Texas Democrats want to take full advantage of a blue wave so powerful it could even send a Democrat, Beto O’Rourke, to the Senate for the first time in Texas since 1988. The seat most likely to flip is that of Jimmy Blacklock, who was appointed to the Supreme Court by Governor Greg Abbott in January. With far less of an incumbency advantage than fellow Republican justices John Devine and Jeff Brown, Blacklock is potentially vulnerable to Democratic challenger Steven Kirkland. Kirkland is a Harris County Judge and community activist running to represent the people of Texas, not the far-right agenda of the nine Republicans currently on the bench. Kirkland’s background proves that he is the judge to serve the diverse and changing demographics of Texas. He has made no secret of his past struggles with alcoholism, which include a history of several arrests for alcohol-related incidents. He also teaches in the University of Houston’s School of Communications, teaching law and ethics to non-law students, showcasing his ability to excite and illuminate those outside of his chosen field. Finally, as a gay man, Kirkland offers a diverse perspective on the complicated issue of law. If elected, he would become the first openly gay Supreme Court Justice and LGBTQ statewide official in Texas history as well as the thirteenth openly LGBTQ Supreme Court Justice in United States history. (Notably, the United States nearly saw its first openly Chief Supreme Court Justice, but Connecticut Republicans successfully blocked the nomination of Democratic Justice Andrew McDonald in an act of obstruction reminiscent of the Senate GOP’s blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland.) Steven Kirkland joined us on the podcast to discuss the right’s takeover of the judiciary, the difficulty of running for public office as a former alcoholic, and why he believes civil rights are protected by the Texas Constitution.

(Terrell Lloyd - San Jose State Athletics) San Jose State’s Michael Carrizosa punts the ball against Utah. SJSU Michael Carrizosa waits to see action as a walk-on in 2014. (Nhat V. Meyer - Bay Area News Group file) Conversations with complete strangers have been more about Michael Carrizosa’s background than his punting. It’s part of evaluating potential NFL talent. Carrizosa hasn’t made any past tweets that could come back to haunt him or exhibited any poor judgment for that matter. If anything, his compelling past speak to his character. “Most NFL scouts are just trying to get a good read on me as a person and a little bit about my life,” Carrizosa said. “I want them to see that I can offer more than just being a football player.” Obstacles aside, it’s what Carrizosa has done on the field over the last four years as San Jose State’s punter that has provided those conversations with several of the NFL’s 32 teams over the last couple of months. “I know I’ll get my chance,” the Palma School alum said. “I don’t care what team I go to or when I get picked up. When the opportunity comes, I’ll run with it. No team will be sorry.” It’s open for debate whether Carrizosa will be drafted. Last year marked the first time in 19 years that a punter wasn’t drafted. Yet, four punters were selected in the 2016 NFL draft, none earlier than in the sixth round of a seven round draft. “I have high hopes to get drafted,” Carrizosa said. “It’s a dream. But I just want an opportunity. It is all about teams’ demands. I know a lot of teams struggled with their special units last year.” Carrizosa, a former walk-on who lost his mother to cancer two years ago, will graduate in May with a degree in Criminal Justice. In between cramming school work and talking with NFL scouts, he has spent more time working on technique over the last month, as well as pinning balls in corners with long-time kicking coach Doug Saucedo. “We’ve been focusing on how high he kicks, not how far,” said Saucedo, who has worked with kickers at Palma for 20-plus years. “I’m pressing for more hang time. He’s getting around 4.8- to 5.2-second hang time. No one is returning that.” While he wasn’t invited to the NFL Combine last month, the 22-year-old made an impression at the NFL Players Association Collegiate Bowl in Pasadena in January. “I got a lot of exposure with my performance,” Carrizosa said. “I interviewed with 15 teams and got some face time to show them what I’m about.” Despite being named a finalist for the Ray Guy Award as a sophomore two years ago — it’s given to the nation’s best punter — Carrizosa has flown under the radar while at San Jose State. While duplicating his school record 47.5-yard punting average was a tall order, Carrizosa averaged nearly 45 yards a punt over the last two seasons and finished with a career school-record average of 44 yards per punt. “I like to stay positive and keep good energy,” Carrizosa said. “I’m just enjoying the process with my friends and family.” Originally, Carrizosa was brought in by San Jose State as a kicker after the coaching staff saw video of him kicking a 63-yard field goal at a camp. But when the Spartans asked him to move to punter, he turned to Saucedo to get reacquainted with the position’s intricacies. “He’s (Saucedo) like family,” Carrizosa said. “He’s a big reason I’m where I’m at. If I can’t make it down, he’ll come up and work with me at San Jose State. I owe him a lot.” When Carrizosa returns to Palma to punt with Saucedo, sending balls skyrocketing 70 yards in the air gets the attention of those on the field. “We brought him up to punt for us as a sophomore,” recalled Palma coach Jeff Carnazzo. “I made the statement then to some of the kids that this is an NFL leg, what an NFL punter looks like.” Carrizosa wasn’t just a punter for the Chieftains. He kicked field goals and also started as a senior as their nose guard before dislocating his knee against Monterey. “The doctors popped it back in,” Carnazzo said. “But he was done as a lineman. We were backed up in the shadow of our goal posts and Michael said I can punt. He saved us on three occasions that night.” Carrizosa, who has dropped more than 30 pounds since graduating from high school, is SJSU’s all-time and single-season record holder in punting average. “Obviously as a kid I always wanted to be a pro athlete,” Carrizosa said. “I was blessed to get an opportunity at the collegiate level. I got myself in the best shape I could. I’m still living the dream.” One that has seen Carrizosa take part in the 49ers and Raiders’ Pro Day camps the last two weeks, as well as one at San Jose State. The Raiders are currently looking for a punter after releasing Marquette King, whose agent is also Carrizosa’s. “It was nice to get both those Pro Days before the draft,” Carrizosa said. “The Pro Day at San Jose State went real well. All 32 teams were there. It was a good day for me.” Not only is Carrizosa’s leg strength an attraction, but he also kicked off last year for the Spartans and served as a holder on extra points and field goals. In addition, Carrizosa served as an emergency kicker for San Jose State for field goals. “I’ve filled out all the questioners,” Carrizosa said. “All these teams know I can kickoff as well, if needed.” For all the positive feedback Carrizosa has received from NFL teams, he has no idea what teams are seriously interested, although a dozen have called in the last 48 hours making sure his contact numbers are correct. “My agent says that’s a good sign,” Carrizosa said. “I know I’m on the radar. The anxiety is starting to come down. You never know what people think. I don’t want to speculate. I’m trying to stay positive and let God do his work.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

Graham didn't walk a batter and struck out eight Seneca Bobcats en route to the Wildcats' 2-0 Region 4 victory. Northwestern (3-4, 3-3) assured Graham his rare feat in dramatic style. Seneca's only two base runners reached on errors. The second was with one out in the top of the seventh inning. However, the Wildcats' Jacob Alexander made a diving catch in center field for the second out and then threw to first base to double off the runner for a game-ending double play. Cash Platz accounted for each Northwestern run. He scored on a wild pitch and drove in the second with a bunt single. Seneca (0-6, 0-5) lost even though pitcher John Devine limited Northwestern to four hits and struck out nine.

The Daily Mail has reported that the Magpies have been keeping close tabs on Asoro, 19, this season with scouts reporting that the Sweden Under-21 international is better than any of the strikers similar to his age at St James’ Park. It is understood that the young forward will enter the final year of his contract at the Stadium of Light in the coming months and Sunderland have offered him a new deal in the hope that he stays. However since that was reported, the Black Cats’ relegation from the Championship has been confirmed and while it was claimed that Chris Coleman has warned the teenager that his development will stall if he quits Wearside, there’s a good chance that he will be on the move. Newcastle fans believe that they should be the club to snap up Asoro in the coming months and they piled onto Twitter on Friday night in the wake of his brilliant goal against promotion-chasing Fulham. One Magpies supporter claimed that the club should “pick at their carcass” to rub salt in their rivals’ wounds. Here is a selection of their tweets: Sunderland look like they’ve got some decent younguns we should go and take a couple …. pick at their carcass just for the hell of it #NUFC — Paulc (@paulc02) April 27, 2018 Good goal that. He’ll be canny in the #NUFC squad next season when we buy him for £50k. #FulSun — Micky Campbell (@MickyCampbell72) April 27, 2018 I’ll have Joel Asoro please.

(David Royal — Herald Correspondent) Julia Rhie, the women’s winner, ran most of the marathon alongside men. (David Royal — Herald Correspondent) Adam Roach and Jorge Maravilla ran neck-and-neck most of the race until the 21-mile mark. (David Royal — Herald Correspondent) Julia Rhie of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, crosses the finish line to win the women’s title. (David Royal — Herald Correspondent) Carmel >> Adam Roach was locked in. Even with Jorge Maravilla in his ear for 21 miles, he never lost his focus. “I was so in a zone,” Roach said. “Sometimes your mind can wander during the course of the race. I was so focused for the entire race.” The Pebble Beach resident decided at 21 miles to cease talking and asserted himself Sunday over the final five miles to capture the 33rd annual Big Sur International Marathon. The 34-year-old Roach, who has won five of the last seven Big Sur Marathons, covered the sunny and at times damp 26-mile, 385-yard grueling course in 2 hours, 29 minutes and 25 seconds. “He was really focused,” said Maravilla, who was clocked in 2:31.49. Maravilla picked up his toddler son with 20 meters to go and carried him across the finish line. Julia Rhie of Chapel Hill, North Carolina held on to defeat Jennifer Berry of Denver to capture the women’s race in 3:01.12. Berry became the first women to run Boston and Big Sur in a combined time of under six hours. Roach, though, stole the spotlight, crossing the final line with his arms in the air as a slight drizzle fell. “The rain at the end of the race felt nice,” Roach said. When Roach started his morning run 26 miles away, it was sunny with a slight headwind. And there was Maravilla, who spent most of the race talking with anyone willing to listen. “He’s a fun guy,” Roach said. “He’s a crowd pleaser.” And it helped pass the time as the pair ran side-by-side for over 21 miles, with reigning champion Michael Wardian unable to maintain the pace after two miles. “I felt good yesterday,” said Wardian, who has jury duty Monday in Arlington, Virginia. “But not today. I thought if I was conservative, I would be able to pull back up. It didn’t work.” While Wardian and Maravilla both competed two weeks ago at the Boston Marathon, Roach did not. It was evident he was stronger over the final five miles. And while Roach didn’t mind listening to Maravilla, he clearly had a vision when the pair got to the 21-mile mark of the race, and the weather did an about-face. “Chatting a little helps ease the nerves,” Roach said. “Jorge is a very outgoing guy. It makes the race move along. But it felt like a fast race.” Wardian won last year’s race in 2:30.29, and the course record is 2:16.39, set by Brad Hawthorne in 1987. Roach averaged 5:42 per mile, running confidently up the hills and relaxed coming down, fighting the headwind early in the race. “I felt strong the entire way,” said Roach, who promised to be back next year to defend his title. Maravilla, who immigrated from El Salvador as a child, fed off the crowd throughout the race. “Part of running is having fun,” said Maravilla, who now lives in Mill Valley. “I feel when I talk to the crowd, it gives back energy. It allows me to value and appreciate the sport.” Wardian, who finished over eight minutes behind Roach, had crept to within 40 seconds of the pair at the mid-point, but was never able to pose a threat. “I just didn’t feel it in my leg movement,” Wardian said. “I just kept grinding, thinking maybe I could catch them. I didn’t have the turnover. This is a tough course. It will eat you up.” You won’t get an argument from Rhie, who was running in her first Big Sur Marathon, realizing it would be the most challenging marathon she has ever competed in. “When I saw the overview of the course, I thought who designed this?’’ Rhie said with a smile. Rhie never ran with another female during the race, taking an early lead, at times running alongside male runners to push herself. “I had to be careful,” Rhie said. “I didn’t want to go too fast up the hills. I told myself get up the hill and grind it out coming down. I’m not a hill runner. Maybe I should reconsider that.” The hard part for Rhie was figuring out where she was in the race. While she knew she was leading, she didn’t know who she was pacing herself with. “It was hard to keep track with all the relay competitors and other races going on,” Rhie said. “It was a little windy. But expectations were met.” Although the finish might have been a little closer than Rhie wanted or expected. In fact, she had no idea that Berry was closing in on her at the finish line. “Wow, I didn’t know she was that close,” said Rhie, after glancing at the results. “I might have pushed it a little harder had I known.” Berry didn’t get a glimpse of Rhie until about the 23-mile mark. With about a mile left, she closed the deficit to about 150 meters. “She was so far out in front with three miles left,” Berry said. “I pushed the last mile hard. But so did she.” Berry had hoped to make one last charge with 400 meters remaining. And while Rhie had no idea she was closing, the gap was too big to make up. “She (Rhie) kicked hard at 26 miles,” Berry said. “She had too much of a lead in front of me. But I don’t think she knew I was there.” Berry finished six seconds behind, or roughly eight strides. But her time of 3:01.18, coupled with her time at Boston 13 days ago (2:56.51), put her under six hours for both races. “I wanted that record,” Berry said. “So, yeah I feel pretty good.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

Sign up for email newsletters', 'This year’s NewFronts are making some big changes, including a planned stop on the West Coast, but the biggest change impacting digital content creators and advertisers this year will be the consumer. The way we watch has transformed, and consumer expectations are higher than ever. It’s time to put the viewer at the center of not just the video experience, but the ad experience as well. That’s why mobile will be at the forefront, new video formats will rise and the trusted relationship between consumers and brands will be paramount at the 2018 NewFronts. Whether it’s sports, entertainment or news, there’s no denying that mobile devices have completely captivated consumer attention. Traditional TV viewing is on the decline while consumers are increasingly on mobile and other devices watching videos. The proof is in the numbers: Consumers now spend an unprecedented amount of time on their smartphones—more than five hours a day. Driving this incredible usage is the widespread availability of high-quality digital video. In fact, video consumption on mobile is growing at a faster rate than on a desktop/laptop. One of our recent studies found 88 percent growth year over year in time spent watching videos on a smartphone. As lines between TV and digital continue to blur, we’re going to see advertisers and brands follow suit with engaging content that reaches the new multi-screen viewer. Because they’re glued to their devices, consumers have even higher expectations for content on mobile, whether it’s a seamless livestream of an NFL game or on-demand viewing of need-to-know news. And these expectations for quality don’t just stop with content consumption—consumers are holding advertisers to a higher standard as well. Ads must be relevant and customized yet unobtrusive, complementing the consumer’s experience and not interrupting the moment. Today the goal for brands is more focused on enhancing the viewing experience and providing consumers with a new kind of utility from their phones. These heightened expectations for quality content and experiences that put the user first have ushered in a new frontier of ad formats. Those that work well for users and deliver an exceptional experience will, in turn, deliver for brand marketers. Last year there was much talk about the potential impact of mobile and consumer-first formats like augmented reality, virtual reality and 360-degree video. This year, the era of innovative, interactive content has arrived. Forward-thinking brands like The Home Depot and Pottery Barn are leading the pack by putting AR technology to work in their latest campaigns and bringing their in-store experience to shoppers’ mobile devices and living rooms. But it doesn’t stop there. It’s also about testing shorter video ad lengths and full-screen vertical video on mobile devices. These immersive advertising experiences perform exceptionally well with consumers and deliver big for advertisers, too. Brand builders are taking notice. With this future-forward content more accessible than ever, expect even more brands to leverage innovative ads in the year ahead to transform the world around you into an exceptional brand content experience. These industry leaps and innovations are juxtaposed with issues of brand trust and safety that are top-of-mind for every marketer. A brand-safe environment matters, but authenticity is critical, too. We’ve pioneered an incredible amount of technology in recent years that has completely metamorphosed digital advertising. Today, brands know that in order to create a trusted consumer experience, their ads must appear next to content that matches the brand and their consumer’s values.The key now is to go beyond just creating a relevant ad experience for consumers and for marketers to ensure that the content created is representative of their values and customers. My advice for what marketers should keep top-of-mind throughout the 2018 NewFronts? The consumer. Today’s consumer is rapidly evolving, and it’s paramount for marketers to keep a pulse on consumption habits in order to create meaningful brand experiences. Brands, publishers and platforms that are consumer-trusted and mobile-capable will flourish in this new digital ecosystem. The future is built on mobile with the consumer at the wheel.']",0.0,2.0,0.3434343434343434,0.0,1016936.0

The fastest way to find the right agency Oath marked its Digital Content NewFront debut with a host of announcements including a mobile advertising tie-up with Samsung, plus a host of new programming, which it\'s pitching to marketers along with the unified adtech assets of AOL and Yahoo. The Verizon-owned online behemoth, which aims to rival the dominance of Facebook and Google when it comes to online media budgets, chose its 2018 NewFront bonanza to announce a global distribution deal with the handset manufacturer that will see it serve ads and content to Samsung Galaxy owners. Samsung tie-up Oath’s newsroom app, plus Yahoo Finance, Sports, and Go will be pre-installed on the flagship Samsung smartphone series with advertisers now able to reach said audiences via native ad units specifically designed for mobile viewership through its Yahoo Gemini offering. A statement announcing the tie-up attributed to John DeVine, chief revenue officer at Oath, plus Dave Bottoms, vice president, product management at Oath, claimed it represents its ambition to hone in on the lucrative advertising market across its NFL, NBA coverage plus the Yahoo Finance portal, as well as the Samsung Galaxy App Store. “Following the launch of the Galaxy S9 and S9+, Oath becomes Samsung\'s premiere content partner on Bixby Home in the US, with plans to expand across global markets later this year,” reads the statement. “The content and ad experience was custom designed with Samsung to create the best consumer experience that drives deeper mobile engagement. With a single swipe, Samsung customers can stay connected to the most important customized content from Oath’s powerful house of brands.” Brand safe premium content In conjunction with the Samsung tie-up, Oath also employed the star power of Hollywood personality Jamie Foxx See (image below) to unveil a slate of 10 new original video series, documentaries and live programs to run on its household name content brands. Speaking with The Drum, DeVine, explained that part of its NewFront pitch to brands advertisers was simplifying their route to audiences on mobile devices in a brand safe environment – already a commonly occurring theme at this year’s week-long proceedings. As part of #NewFronts, young female filmmakers from @ReelWorks learned mobile filmmaking & gained real-world experience & training from @oath brand producers to increase their chances of becoming tomorrow’s creators. Proud to support females in film! #OathforGood@iamjamiefoxxpic.twitter.com/K7FzKp15nD — Oath For Good (@OathForGood) May 2, 2018 DeVine further went on to highlight its content marketing services – demonstrated by Oath’s recently RYOT Studio partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to produce a documentary called I Promise – as an example of its play to win over premium marketing budgets. “The second thing we\'re really trying to simplify is our ad formats to a select golden few ad formats that work for users,” he added. “We know consumers want fewer ads, but they really want fewer bad ads and we’ve launched a few examples like Mobile Moments that is resident within our apps.” How Oath is consolidating its adtech brands Detailing Oath efforts to simplify its adtech offering into a single offering – Yahoo’s BrightRoll and AOL’s One offerings had various levels of overlap – said it had been on both its buy- and sell-side offerings, adding it was roughly “two-thirds of the way in”. “On that, we\'re simply consolidating platforms, just working relentlessly through our roadmap to bring the number of DSP as we have now to a single UI for advertising on the display side,” he added. “We’re, we are looking to have a lot of that integration closed, uh, as we go into the prime of this year in Q3, Q4.” Newly unified privacy terms DeVine also spoke of how part of this consolidation also entails Oath harmonizing the data privacy policies of its previously disparate adtech offerings, an especially important consideration as online platforms come under public scrutiny, not least in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) loom. ""We just released our integrated privacy policy and terms of service with AOL and Yahoo together and most importantly as we globally, especially in Europe where we have GDPR,” he said. Oath\'s brand safety pitch Meanwhile, Jeff Lucas, the newly installed head of sales for North America at Oath, underlined his brief to assure advertisers of the outfit’s brand safe offering with a host of content curated by professionals. “I think you have this great intersection between great content and the ability to do great commerce using data in a very brand safe environment. I think that a message that the ad community needs to know more of,” he said. Speaking to the relatively unique posting that Oath now occupies in the market (given its backing by US telco Verizon Wireless) Lucas went on to voice his belief that it was an asset that “no one else can offer” given its mix of content, consumer insights and ready-made advertising tools. He added: “I think what other companies are striving for as a way to figure out content. I think it has already figured out content and how to merge the two together.” This article is about: North America, NewFronts, Oath, Programmatic, Digital Advertising, Digital Oath Inc. is a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that serves as the umbrella company of its digital content subdivisions, including AOL and Yahoo!.

MAKERS Money is a weekly series hosted by Sallie Krawcheck, one of the most powerful female executives on Wall Street who served as CFO of Citigroup and a top executive at Bank of America. The show looks at the gender pay gap, and advises on investing, and saving for retirement. It was created and produced by feminist media brand MAKERS and Yahoo Finance in partnership with Krawcheck’s investment firm Ellevest. BUILTBYGIRLS Live, a weekly studio show, is touted as a cross between Squawk Box and The View, but focused on technology and through the eyes of women. Panelists include the partners in production company BBG Ventures Susan Lyne — former Walt Disney Entertainment president— and Nisha Dua, the founder of the #BUILTBYGIRLS movement; and Yahoo Finance senior producer and anchor Jen Rogers. Oath unspooled the shows at the Digital Content NewFronts, an offshoot of the historical upfront presentations by broadcast television networks to Madison Avenue on the upcoming fall season. With billions of dollars in corporate marketing budgets in play, more than 1,000 advertisers packed the event at Pier 26 in New York City seeking fresh content and new ideas to attract viewers in a fast-changing media landscape and sell them stuff. Oath’s platforms include HuffPost, Yahoo Finance, and Yahoo Sports, and others, with distribution across mobile, TV and OTT. John DeVine, Chief Revenue Officer said Oath’s well-known brands give it an edge, among a huge amount of online clutter. “This is not your typical upfront,” he said, “It’s an uprising at a time when high quality, brand safe content matters more than ever.” Oath showcased three mobile sports shows by Yahoo Sports:The Rush, with daily game highlights; The Spin, with deep-dive sports reporting; and Soccer Mom, featuring hosted interviews with star athletes settling into marriage, family life and caregiving.

In addition to its new brand, Disney plans to launch a new app — Oh My Disney — this summer. The app will house social video content from Disney website Oh My Disney, Disney Digital Networks, Freeform, and creators from the Disney-owned Maker Studios.

Studio71’s slate includes new original content from some of its most successful creators like comedian, entertainer and actress Lilly Singh, and a continued focus on hit shows with new seasons of “Good Mythical Morning,” one of the biggest daily shows on the Internet and “This Might Get,” a variety show starring comedian and BFF’s Grace Helbig and Mamrie Hart. Studio71 also unveiled new content pillars from Seven Bucks Digital Studios, the digital arm of Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia’s Seven Bucks Productions. “At Studio71, we are doubling down on the future of premium digital content with some of the biggest signings in talent, and our upcoming slate” said Dan Weinstein, President and Co- Founder, Studio71. “To remain competitive with the ever-changing shifts in digital entertainment, we offer our advertisers the largest access to consistent, predictable, and most importantly safe content online with hyper-engaged organic audiences.” At its annual NewFront presentation today, Condé Nast unveiled its digital video distribution expansion and new programming slate for the 2018-19 season. The company plans to expand its OTT distribution with a dedicated channel for Wired, scheduled to launch later this year, followed next year by channels for Bon Appétit and GQ. The newly launched channels will be available on AppleTV, Roku and Amazon Fire. Additionally, the company unveiled more than 60 new digital video pilots in production, new series for Snapchat and new ad products that leverage the influence of the company’s portfolio for advertising partners. “While consumers have more screens and more content to choose from than ever before, advertisers face the challenge of less buyable options,” said Pamela Drucker Mann, chief revenue and marketing officer of Condé Nast. “Condé Nast has the engagement, brand safety and influence that make us the most impactful buyable solution in the industry. And our new OTT expansion is significant because it brings the quality of Condé Nast to next gen consumers on new platforms, and in new ways.” Continuing its investment in original video content, Oath, a Verizon subsidiary, has announced a new slate of 10 original video series, documentaries and live programs at its Digital Content NewFront that will premier across its house of brands including HuffPost, MAKERS, BUILD Series, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and more.

The event is hosted by Jamie Foxx at Pier 26 in New York. “This is not your typical upfront, it’s an uprising at a time when high quality, brand safe content matters more than ever,” said John DeVine, Chief Revenue Officer, Oath. “We know that brands matter and trust matters to deliver the best video experience for our consumers and advertisers.

Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed. “We bring a special experience to the users where swiping to Bixby will open up the world of Oath’s content with news, finance and entertainment,” he said an interview, pointing out that the properties will access “millions” of additional potential users. ” … We’ll also get to point our demand for our advertisers onto those phones through those apps and … Galaxy apps so brands can place their ads on a quality desktop.” The news was announced at the same time as Oath debuted its slate of 10 new shows during its 2018 NewFront, held on a sunny patch of concrete at the City Vineyard on the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. The event was a sharp contrast to last year’s NewFront, which was a scaled-back series of small cross-country dinners with advertisers in major markets, similar to AOL’s 2016 new front at Manhattan’s South Street Seaport. The new shows are centered around three areas: sports, news and entertainment. Yahoo Sports’ “Soccer Mom,” starring soccer celebrity Abby Wambach, will feature a variety of high-profile athletes in an interview series focused on balancing career ambitions and parenting. Former football player and comedian Jared Quay stars in “The Rush” alongside a variety of other athletes and celebrities. In the news category, “Storm The Gates” will follow eight female political candidates as they run for Congressional seats. In addition to the news and sports series, Oath-owned RYOT is partnering with the Lebron James Family Foundation on the “I Promise” Education Project, a documentary that will show the NBA star’s work with the I Promise school in Akron, Ohio, during its first year. The school focused on science, technology, engineering and math curriculum for students in the city. Oath’s NewFront also comes a week after the announcement of a high-profile hire for its advertising sales team, bringing onboard Jeff Lucas, who previously headed up direct ads sales for Snapchat. (Prior to that, he spent a number of years at Viacom.) While Verizon has spent the past two years building out its data-powered advertising suite to compete with Google and Facebook, the European Union’s implementation of sweeping data protection policies leaves room for uncertainty around how new data collection and usage rules could affect advertiser accuracy. When asked how General Data Protection Regulations might affect Oath, DeVine said GDPR has been “a watershed” moment for the company, which is currently in the process of rewriting its privacy policies and terms of service across all properties. Oath’s NewFront also comes while AT&T battles in court for the ability to acquire Time Warner. Meanwhile, last week, Sprint and T-Mobile announced plans to merge under the T-Mobile brands pending approval by regulators. DeVine said that the company will “give consumers choice” in how the subsidiary will “use their data to give them a better experience or protect their data if they so choose.” “Oath stands for transparency, and we’re going to maintain that front with consumers,” he said. “I would say that we’re working aggressively with the IAB and other standards in terms of data and security.”', '6 FREE articles per month News Headlines > Isle of Man abortion law passed by island\'s parliament Members of the Legislative Council will now consider the legislation. If approved the bill will be submitted for Royal Assent and become law Legislation to change the Isle of Man’s abortion laws has been approved by the island’s parliament. Members of the House of Keys, the equivalent of the UK’s House of Commons, passed the Abortion Reform Bill by a margin of 22-2 on 1 May. The new legislation will allow abortion up to 14 weeks “on request”, up to 24 weeks in cases of foetal anomaly or on “serious social grounds”, and after 24 weeks in rare circumstances where the life of the mother or baby is at risk. Counselling must be offered before and after the procedure, and a clause allows medical professionals to opt out of delivering treatment if it clashes with their personal views. Currently abortions can only be carried out if a pregnancy is the result of rape or because of mental health concerns. Members of the Legislative Council will now consider the legislation. If approved the bill will be submitted for Royal Assent and become law. The move follows a consultation on The Abortion Reform Bill, which received the biggest ever response to a public consultation on the island with more than 3,600 respondents giving feedback. Alex Allinson, the former GP and politician who introduced the bill, said he hoped that the bill would “right a wrong done to Isle of Man women for over 50 years”, as the island never adopted the UK’s 1967 Abortion Act. He added that the aim of the reforms is to take abortion ""out of the realm of the criminal justice system"" and make it available ""on request"" to women in a broad range of circumstances. He described the reforms as a ""major step forward"". Pro-life charity, Life, described the bill’s progress as “very sad”. The charity’s Senior Education Officer, Liz Parsons, said the new bill contained “extreme pieces of legislation” that she believed would lead to “fast-tracking vulnerable women towards abortion”. “Every abortion is an act of desperation,” stated Monsignor John Devine, Dean of the Catholic Church on the Isle of Man, in a letter to the island’s Chief Minister Howard Quayle written in February. He said he was concerned that the bill cites “\'serious social grounds” or “impairments” like to limit either the length or quality of the child’s life as justification for a late abortion. “The former could be cited if an unplanned pregnancy was considered to be inconvenient,” the priest wrote. “The latter is already being used in the UK to abort children diagnosed with Down’s syndrome or even cleft palate, a condition routinely corrected surgically at a later date,” he continued. The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency. Although fewer than 10 abortions are carried out on the island annually, around 100 women are thought to travel to the UK every year for private abortions.

Oath is the Verizon subsidiary that holds AOL, Yahoo, HuffPost, Makers, Build, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, and more. While other publishers are highlighting distribution partnerships this year, Oath’s powerful message to brands was that it could reach viewers at scale all by itself. Tim Armstrong at the 2018 Oath NewFront Highlights from the new series include “Soccer Mom” (Abby Wambach and other athletes talk about their roles as parents), “I Promise” (a documentary project with the LeBron James Family Foundation about an innovative new school in Akron, Ohio), and “Makers Money” (a weekly financial series that helps women taken control of their financial lives). Oath will also create a morning show and a behind-the-scenes show for its Build series, look at the new wave of women running for office with HuffPost, and create a snackable daily sports show for Yahoo Sports. The Oath NewFront kicked off with a welcome from CEO Tim Armstrong, then turned into a boisterous musical happening led by actor Jamie Foxx. Foxx showed himself to be a tireless entertainer and perhaps the hardest working person of the 2018 newfronts, managing to give the highly scripted evening the feeling that anything could happen. Throughout the event, Oath wasn’t shy about asking advertising partners to commit money for brand integrations, creative ad formats, and programmatic buys. “This is not your typical upfront; it’s an uprising at a time when high-quality, brand-safe content matters more than ever,” said John DeVine, chief revenue officer for Oath. “With our deep editorial expertise in sports, news, entertainment, and finance, we’re creating video programming that consumers crave, while making it even easier for advertisers to reach these audiences with three simple ways to buy video and make their dollars work smarter.” Comments are closed.

Owen on Thursday won the NorCal PGA Match Play Championship and qualified for his first PGA event. CSUMB/contributed The experience was gut-wrenching and humbling for a then 22-year-old kid from a small town of 2,800 in Illinois. So much so that Jason Owen vowed that he would never play Pebble Beach Golf Links again unless it was in a tournament. “I qualified for the 1999 U.S. Amateur,” Owen said. “I came out here so scared. I played so poorly. I told myself I’m not getting on that course again unless it’s to redeem myself in an event.” That was 19 years ago for the CSU-Monterey Bay men’s golf coach. Redemption came Wednesday when Owen won the Northern California PGA Match Play Championship at Pebble Beach. “I got my redemption,” said Owen, who will be taking the Otters golf team to the NCAA Division II West Regionals on Saturday in Amarillo, Texas. The win didn’t just provide Owen with piece of mind, it also qualified him for his first PGA tournament. He’ll compete in August in the Barracuda Championships in Reno. “I’ve played at every level accept the PGA Tour,” Owen said. “It’s been like a life-long goal to tee up in a Tour event.” Owen, who has been the golf coach at CSUMB for 10 years, played 108 holes over three days at four different golf courses, playing 36 holes each day. “I probably haven’t played six rounds of golf in the months of March and April combined,” Owen said. “I don’t know if my players were shocked. But they were extremely happy.” Playing in a field of 64, Owen won his first two match-play rounds on Monday at Corral De Tierra Country Club and two more at Pasatiempo Golf Club in Santa Cruz on Tuesday. “I didn’t play well in my first couple of matches,” Owen said. “By the time I hit Tuesday, I started to play some pretty good golf. Like I have in the past.” A win in Wednesday’s semifinals at Cypress Golf Course ensured him a trip back to Pebble Beach for the first time since that uneventful performance. “What was special about Cypress is one of my former players caddied for me,” said Owen, who was seeded No. 9 entering the tournament. Then it was time for a little revenge on the world-renown course. “I know what I’m doing,” Owen said. “It’s more, can I get in a good rhythm and let it go? As the week kept going, things became easier and easier for me.” Over the last decade at CSUMB, Owen has taken the Otters to one NCAA D-II national championship, three regional titles and three conference crowns. But redeeming himself at Pebble Beach has been on Owen’s bucket list for nearly two decades. A 5-4 win in the championship round put a few demons to rest. “I don’t play very much at all any more,” Owen said. “I go in spurts with the guys where I play with them every other week. I’m trying to carve out a little more time. It’s a balancing act when you’re coaching a team, especially in the spring.” Yet, his effort over the course of three days didn’t surprise him either. “It’s one of those things where I know it’s in there,” said Owen, who attempted to qualify for the US Open in 2010. “Lots of hours have been put into the game in the past. For me personally, can you calm your mind and let your body do what it knows how to do?” Owen won’t be back on the greens again soon as a player. He hopes to keep the Otters’ season going another two-plus weeks. CSUMB enters the West Regionals ranked No. 14 in the nation. The Otters have arguably one of the best golfers in the nation in sophomore Ellis Svard, who won the conference title and earned CCAA Player of the Year honors earlier this week. “Everyone kind of feeds off him,” Owen said. “This group is different than past teams. It doesn’t go in with expectations. It’s been an adjusting period for me. But it works for them.” Once the season is over, Owen said he will devote a little more time to his craft. He will treat his first PGA event like any other tournament, with an expectation to win. “What can I do from the wedge game and short game?” Owen said. “If I can get dialed in, who knows? I’m not going in hoping to make the cut. I’m going in there with the thought of winning.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

He is charged in a two-count indictment involving the smuggling from Cuba of Seattle Mariners outfielder Leonys Martin, who previously played for the Texas Rangers. The bail agreement with prosecutors also permits Hernandez to travel for agent work.

Personal records, sacrifices turned into points for the tea and surprise finishes. The Spirits even held a six-point lead with two events left Friday in the Monterey Bay League’s Gabilan Division track and field finals. Yet, the tank was empty for the final two events, as San Benito piled up 28 points to complete an undefeated season with a 152-131 win at Gilroy High. “We threw everyone and everything at them and got our best marks in the most important meet of the year,” Notre Dame sprinter/hurdler Kate Riordan said. “It’s something we really wanted.” Behind Isaac Gensel’s two individual titles and 28 points, Monterey won its first boys track title in 10 years, holding off Watsonville for a 112-101 win in the Pacific Division. Watsonville returned the favor in the girls division, posting a 106-102 win over Christopher. The Toreadores, who were undefeated in dual meets, finished third with 98 points. While eight athletes were producing points for Notre Dame, the Balers were stockpiling points with their depth, dominating the final two events. “I told the girls that we did everything we could,” Notre Dame coach Jason Smith said. “We didn’t leave a point that couldn’t be had. We made San Benito beat us.” Riordan did her part, capturing three individual events for Notre Dame, while running a leg on the winning 400-meter relay team. The senior won the 100 in 12.54 seconds, the second fastest time in school history. She came back to win the 300 low hurdles, then bounced back 10 minutes later to win the 200. “Coming off the curve in the 200, it was tight,” Riordan said. “I’ve never had the opportunity to dig that deep. Everything went numb. I’ve never felt that before.” Riordan, who ran the 200 just for points for Notre Dame, took command of the race with 80 meters left, holding off three runners, including teammate Nora Rawson. “It was awesome, but terrible at the same time,” said Riordan, who hadn’t run a 200 until Tuesday’s trials. “I prepared for this. I was thinking about it all week. I wanted to do this for the team.” Riordan is currently ranked fifth in the Central Coast Section in the 300 low hurdles, where her focus will return at next Friday’s Masters Meet at Gilroy. Teammate Angela Leavitt was a champion for Notre Dame in the 1,600, and finished second in the 3,200 and fourth in the 800. Rawson, who is just a freshman, finished third in both the 100 and 200 for Notre Dame, and ran a leg on the winning 400 relay. San Benito ended Palma’s run of six straight MBL-G titles, capping an undefeated season with a 163-70 win. North Salinas and North Monterey County finished in a tie for third with 60 points. Watsonville came into the boys finals undefeated in dual meet competition. But the Toreadores had an answer late in the meet when they piled 20 points in the 200. “That was big,” Monterey coach Alex Petersen said. “But what really set the tone for us was the first event. We ran a half-second faster in the 400 relay.” And Toreadores got a big effort Gensel, won the 1,600 and 3,200 and finished second in the 800 with a personal best, accounting for 28 points. “Isaac is a tactician,” Petersen said. “He knows what’s about to happen. He has eyes in the back of his head. He has the wheels and knows when it is time to turn it on.” With the Master Meet next week, Petersen is unsure which event Gensel will focus on. “I told him we’ll discus it over the weekend,” Petersen said. “Lets enjoy this.” Seaside, which finished third as a team, got a blistering effort from De’Antae Williams, who won the 100 in 10.93, edging Monterey’s Azjani McGill. In arguably the closest three-way finish in the MBL-P, Monterey fell short in its bid to cap an undefeated girls season. “It’s heartbreaking for them,” Petersen said. “But they did an amazing thing. Every one of them set a personal best in the meet.” Jhailyn Bryant won the 400 and finished second in the 200 and triple jump. She also ran a leg on the 400 relay team that set a personal best by more than a second. “We just didn’t have a lot of depth,” Petersen said. “We took 11 girls. The girls we took produced.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Monterey Peninsula College’s Sally Bowles takes a cut against Sequoias on Friday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Monterey Peninsula College’s Lauren Salvati makes a catch in the first inning against Sequoias on Friday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) MONTEREY >> Emotions were kept in check, just like its first 30 wins this spring. Granted this was just one step in what hopes to be an extended postseason journey for the Monterey Peninsula College softball team. Yet, it was a big hurdle to clear for a program that is having another historic season. The Lobos opened the CCCAA Regional Tournament on Friday with MPC hurler Sally Bowles pitching a gem in a 2-0 win over College of Sequoias in their best-of-three series. “We don’t talk about last year,” Bowles said. “We’re a little more focused in the present. We just want to get one more win.” MPC is now one away from advancing into the next round. It will have two chances to win one game Saturday, with the first of a possible two games starting at noon. It was MPC’s 31st win, surpassing last year’s record-setting 30-win total. The Lobos also won their second straight Coast Conference title this year, another first in school history. Bowles (16-2), who has been dominate all season, lowered her earned run average under 1.38. “Sally’s ERA would be under one this year had it not been for a judgment call that was ruled a hit instead of an obvious error,” MPC coach Keith Berg said. Berg has alternated Bowles with Shayla Castaneda, who is 15-2 with a 1.88 ERA. He has not made a decision on who will start Game 2 of he series. “We are about to go into a meeting and discus that,” Berg said. “I don’t know. That’s a good hitting team over there, and Sally limited them to three hits.” Runner-ups in the Central Valley Conference, Sequoias has won 26 games this year. It has scored 70 more runs than the Lobos. The Giants have been shut out just two times this season, the last coming on Feb. 23. They came into the game having gone 8-2 in their last 10 games. “I was hitting my spots,” Bowles said. “I just made sure I was spinning the ball. Location is huge. I was getting ahead in the count.” That is when Sequoias wasn’t swinging at first pitches, which is what occurred in the seventh inning when Bowles needed three pitches to get three outs and end the game. “The scouting report on Sally is go after her first pitch,” Berg said. “Their swings got long. It looked like they were trying to tie the game with one swing.” Accept the Giants were trailing by a pair after MPC produced two runs in the fifth on what probably should have been an inning ending out. Bowles, who came into the game hitting .368 with a team-high 38 RBIs, lifted a shallow fly ball into left field that was lost in the sun. By the time it fell between two players, Malia Usrey was racing toward third and headed home to score the first run. “I knew the sun might be a factor,” said Usrey, who singled sharply with two outs. “I was running as hard as I could. I saw it drop right as I got to third and just kept going.” The former Seaside High standout easily beat the throw to the plate to break up a scoreless battle and a pitchers duel with Sequoias’ Arianna Guzman. “That’s what we do,” Berg said. “I will take any risk I can when it’s a close game. I have lived that life as a coach for 30 years. It would have taken a perfect throw to get her out.” Guzman, who came into the game matching her jersey number with 24 wins, allowed just six hits. But two came in the fifth when Marielle Tuazon followed with a sharp single to score Bowles. Tuazon came into the game hitting .365 for the Lobos, while Usrey scored her 29th run and raised her batting average to .310. “Getting two runs allowed more room to work,” said Bowles, who is weighing offers to pitch next year from four schools. Bowles, an Atascadero High graduate, didn’t get much work as she threw just 12 pitches in the final two frames and put the Lobos one win away from advancing. “We have to keep our defense up on Saturday,” Usrey said. “Our bats need to get started earlier to support our pitchers.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

It is the second win in a row for Park View, who improves its record to 2-2 on the season. “We had a great game,” Lovejoy said. “We lost our first two games, two tough games last week before the kids had vacation and this week we battled back and we were 2-0 this week and it’s starting to come together. We have a lot of veteran leadership with our eighth graders and they’re really leading the way this year.” Devante Viveiros started on the hill for Park View pitching four strong innings. Viveiros was followed by his teammates Giovanni Grundy, who pitched in the fifth, John Devine, a sixth grader, who pitched in the sixth and lastly, Park View’s ace pitcher Clyde Boutier, who closed it out in the top of the seventh. “It was a tight game and we made a few more plays and our pitchers got us out of a few jams,” Lovejoy said. Matt Colvin got the start on the hill for Winman, pitching four innings and then Berard pitched in two innings followed by Zach Scotti. Park View took a 1-0 when Boutier drove in a run in the second inning with an RBI double before Winman tied it in the top of the third when Corbin Berard scored on a fielder’s choice. Park View’s second run came on an error and then Arthur Peters hit an RBI single in the fourth inning and extended Park View’s edge to 3-1. Winman’s second run came when Dom Calise scored on a double steal in the top of the fifth. With the loss, Winman drops to 1-3. The Warriors have given up run totals of 5, 3, 3, 1 in their four games, which isn’t all that bad, but their offense has been struggling to produce at the plate. “The pitching and defense has been good,” Winman head coach Ed Colvin said. “It’s been good all year. We’re just not swinging the bats. So, all the games are low scoring, they’re all one-run games. Hopefully, we’ll swing the bats and as the weather warms up, we’ll score some runs for our pitching and we’ll get back in the playoff race.” Winman played at Riverside on Monday and Park View was at Cole.

(John Devine - Monterey Herald) Santa Catalina’s Laurel Wong defends her MTAL pole vault title on Saturday. (John Devine - Monterey Herald) Pacific Grove >> The perpetual trophies have had a familiar home for the past five years. That home will now become permanent. A sixth consecutive Mission Trail Athletic League track and field title for the King City boys and Santa Catalina girls Saturday had a little more meaning this time. With the league seizing to exist after this spring, the Mustangs will have to find a full-time home for an aging, but historic trophy after posting a 158-74 win over runner-up Carmel. Santa Catalina pulled away late from Stevenson, sealing victory in the 1,600 relay to secure a 100-78.5 win, its closest finish since the streak began. “It feels like a fulfillment of my time at Santa Catalina,” senior Avery Blanco said. “There was some pressure on us. We’ve set the bar for others to follow.” While King City did it with depth, the Cougars relied on eight girls producing points to engrave its names on the plaque one last time. Half of Santa Catalina’s points came on wins as Carolina Bishop defended her titles in the 300 low hurdles and 100 hurdles, producing 26 points as an individual. “As a captain, I was trying to keep the nerves steady,” said Bishop, one of two seniors who scored points. “We have athletes that haven’t experienced this. I’m trying to be a good mother.” Mission accomplished. Three freshmen helped make up the Cougars league championship 1,600 relay team. And then there is junior Laurel Wong. The current state leader in the pole vault at 13 feet, 3 inches, Wong defended her title at 12-6, and was a part of the league champion 400 relay team, supplying 20 1/2 points among her four events. “I knew competing in four events, that it would be unrealistic to get a personal record today,” Wong said. “I could have tweaked a couple of things. But the objective for this meet was team.” Santa Catalina produced points in 14 of the 16 events — manufacturing 14 points in the 100 hurdles and 300 low hurdles, 11 in the pole vault and 10 in the long jump. “You have to have a little balance of both in terms of pressure and expectations,” Blanco said. “We have been preparing for a run at the title. I felt we had a responsibility.” The Mustangs won just three events. But they piled up points in several events, producing 28 points in the triple jump, 20 points in the long jump, 19 points in the discus and 18 in the 110 high hurdles. “Points were equally distributed,” long jump champion Dylan Oliveros said. “We weren’t individuals today. We were unselfish. A lot of us did multiple events. We had to. What mattered was the title.” Oliveros, who will likely be King City’s quarterback this coming season, contributed 18 points, as he finished second in the triple jump behind teammate Cesar Chavez. “We felt if we all did our part, we were going to be fine,” King City hurdler Jhames Bautista said. “This was the last MTAL meet. We wanted to keep the trophy forever.” Bautista ran arguably his best race of the season in capturing the 110 high hurdles, then came back to place third in the 300 intermediate hurdles. “I was able to three-step the entire race in the 110s,” Bautista said. “I had rhythm. I started to gain more speed.” Rashaan Ward and Nick Sloan combined for 41 of Carmel’s 74 points, with Ward winning the 100, a step in front of Sloan at 11.33. The pair traded places in the 200. “I had a strong finish,” Ward said. “I felt people in the beginning. When I am in the lead, I tend to tighten up.” That was the case in the 200 when Sloan caught Ward at the tape in a photo finish. The pair were also a part of the Padres’ league-champion 400 relay team. Sophomore Aaliyah Carreras became Marina’s first ever double winner at the league finals, blistering the track in the 100 (12.68) and 200 (25.99). “I slipped out of the blocks in the 100,” Carreras said. “At that point, I just tried to drive through the first 30 meters. I caught the field at 50. I made a lot of mistakes. That tells me I can run a lot faster.” Soledad’s Noora Hautamaki was a double winner, capturing the triple jump (36-7.5) and shot put, unseeding defending league champion Soana Laulotu of Carmel with a mark of 35-6.75. Danyelle Landeros won the most difficult double of the meet, claiming the 400 (61.83) and 800 (2:26.37) for the Aztecs. Carmel’s Colleen Lang won the 3,200 and finished second to Stevenson’s Anna Watson in the 1,600. Watson was second to Lang in the 3,200. Pablo Villasenor became Gonzales’ first double winner in 25 years when he won the shot put and discus. The junior three-sport standout is ranked third in the CCS in the shot at 50-9. Distance ace Christopher Plascensia became the first Marina champion in the 1,600, then came back 20 minutes later to finish second in the 800 to Pacific Grove’s Will Stefanou.

The difficulty in getting voters to show up for a runoff election is a big problem in Texas. There are hotspots around the state that might engage more voters, but generally speaking, it’s hard enough to get voters to the table once —and harder still to get them to come back for seconds. Turnout in the March primaries was mediocre. According to the Texas secretary of state, 10.2 percent of the state’s 15.2 million registered voters cast ballots in the Republican primary, while 7 percent showed up for the Democratic primary. Together, those primaries attracted a little over 2.6 million voters. What does that mean for this month’s runoffs? To start with, there’s only one statewide race on the Democratic ballot — the one for governor — and no statewide race on the GOP ballot. In many parts of the state, that takes away a big reason to cast a ballot on May 22 or during early voting. On the Republican side, local races from Congress down to constable could be on the ballot — most of them low-draw affairs. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The last gubernatorial-year primaries in 2014 open a window on this. In the primaries that year, 10 percent of registered voters showed up for the GOP primary and another 4.1 percent came to the Democratic primary. For anyone who measures civic health by voter turnout, the turnout for the 2014 runoffs would have prompted a call for an ambulance: 5.5 percent turned out for the Republican primary runoff, while 1.5 percent turned out for the Democrats. What was on that ballot? Democratic voters decided two statewide races, making David Alameel their nominee for U.S. Senate and picking the unknown Jim Hogan over the all-too-well-known Kinky Friedman as their nominee for Texas Agriculture Commissioner. In most parts of the state, those were the only two contests on the ballot. On the Republican side, four statewide races drove turnout — for lieutenant governor (Dan Patrick beat David Dewhurst), attorney general (Ken Paxton beat Dan Branch), agriculture commissioner (Sid Miller beat Tommy Merritt) and railroad commissioner (Ryan Sitton beat Wayne Christian). All that activity is one big reason their second-round numbers were a bit healthier than the Democrats’ second round turnout. In 2010, the gubernatorial election year before that one, the Democrats had no statewide races. Voters turned out the way you would expect in that situation: They stayed home. Turnout was 5.2 percent in the primary and dropped to 0.21 percent in the runoff. Republicans had only a Texas Supreme Court race (Debra Lehrmann beat Rick Green) on their statewide runoff ticket. Their turnout that year dropped to 2.6 in the runoff from 11.4 percent in the primary. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The overall turnout numbers are higher in presidential election years, but the runoff slumps are just as pronounced. In 2016, with only one statewide race on their runoff ticket (Grady Yarbrough beat Cody Garrett in the race for railroad commissioner), Democratic turnout was 1.3 percent, down from 10.8 percent in that year’s March primary. On the Republican side, turnout fell to 2.6 percent in the runoff, down from 19.9 percent in the primary. The draws in the first round were big: The GOP had not yet chosen a presidential nominee, and Texans turned out to vote on a list of candidates that included Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and all those others. The runoff attractions were a lot less than dramatic, with Wayne Christian beating Gary Gates in a bout for railroad commissioner and two judges — Mary Lou Keel and Scott Walker — winning nominations for the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. Those aren’t generally the kinds of races that get many people talking — or voting — and that’s why the drop was so big. The 2012 presidential primary year wraps up this quick survey. On the Republican side, a hotly contested U.S. Senate race drew national attention for the first time to a political nobody named Ted Cruz, who bested Dewhurst. Christi Craddick won a spot on the Texas Railroad Commission and John Devine beat David Medina, an incumbent, for a spot on the Texas Supreme Court. Those are better-than-average draws, and turnout in the runoff was 8.5 percent, compared to 11.1 percent in that year’s Republican primary. Not bad, as these things go. On the Democratic side, the 2012 primary turnout was 4.5 percent, about the norm for the state’s smallest major party. The runoff turnout was weak, with only a lackluster U.S. Senate race (Paul Sadler beat Grady Yarbrough) on the statewide tickets. Only 1.8 percent turned out for that. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. This year isn’t a presidential year, and there’s just that one Democratic race on the statewide runoff ballot. Hope for a big turnout, but don’t count on it. Read related Tribune coverage Perhaps it goes without saying — but producing quality journalism isn't cheap.

Lombardo. Denny Soltis started from the pole in his No. 1x, but quickly lost the advantage to \\Lombardo. From there, Lombardo opened up a decent gap over Keith Flach. Further back, drivers such as Brett Hearn and Kenny Tremont Jr. were having a fair amount of issues moving up through the pack. A caution due to Kyle Sheldon spinning and nosing into the wall on the frontstretch brought the field back together. Shortly after the restart, New Milford, Connecticut’s Kyle Armstrong was able to get past Flach for second and began to put the pressure on Lombardo. Armstrong was only able to keep up the pressure for so long before Lombardo took advantage of the house motor from Billy the Kid and pulled away. As the race continued, Tremont and Hearn continued to encroach on the leaders. Tremont eventually got himself up to fourth, while Hearn was knocking on the door of fifth. Meanwhile, Rob Pitcher quietly kept himself in the top five and made a run on Armstrong. With two laps to go, Pitcher was able to snatch second away from Armstrong. All the battling occurred behind Lombardo, who held on to take his second career win at Lebanon Valley. Afterward, Lombardo was overjoyed. “You gotta bring some serious horsepower to [Lebanon Valley] and we’re not lacking it anymore,” Lombardo said in the pits. “That was the name of the game tonight. We had horsepower and the car was absolutely spot on. I couldn’t [think of] anything we could have done to make it better.” Pitcher finished second, while a big scramble on the final lap saw Flach move up from fifth to third. Armstrong held on for fourth, while Tremont just edged out Hearn for fifth. The Small Block Modified class saw Andy Bachetti start from the pole in his new No. 17. Once the green flag dropped, Bachetti ran away and hid from fellow front row starter Brian Peterson. Behind Bachetti, there was a good amount of action for position. Frank Harper stalked Peterson early on before taking second away on lap 7. Behind them was Brett Haas in his new Bicknell chassis, a car that Haas is very pleased with so far. Haas, who was fastest in hot laps, ran down Harper and took away second on lap 11. He seemed to have equal pace to Bachetti, but had spotted him a significant amount of time. The race’s lone yellow flew when J.R. Heffner had engine issues in turn 2, setting up a six-lap run to the finish. Haas was able to hang with Bachetti for the first few laps, but dropped back with a glazed-over tire. From there, Bachetti pulled away to win his first race back in the Small Block Modified division. Haas finished second, followed by Jason Herrington and Tremont. Harper was fifth. The Pro Stock feature saw 25 cars duking it out, along with the requisite bumping and banging. Jason Casey started from pole and pulled out a gap when Rich Crane had issues coming up to speed. Then, the trouble started. Steven LaRochelle spun on lap 2, collecting Scott Kilmer and Jay Casey in the process to bring out the first yellow. A few laps later, Don Collins, Joe LaFlamme and Victor Hopkins were wrapped up in an incident in turn 4. Opening-night winner Rob Yetman struggled mightily. He was caught up in a crash in turn 1 along with Rick Dempsey and Tom O’Connor and could not advance up the order. In between the incidents, Nick Arnold started to flex some muscle. Arnold was able to move his No. 1 up to second in one of his best runs at Lebanon Valley. In the closing laps, Jason Meltz was able to snag second from Arnold, but could do nothing with Jason Casey, who claimed his 13th career Pro Stock win at the Valley. Meltz was second, followed by Arnold, Crane and Jon Routhier. The Sportsman feature saw Chris Lynch start from the pole and lead early. However, Rob Maxon had the best car on Saturday night. He moved up from the eighth starting spot to snag the lead away on lap 6. Opening-night winner Chris Curtis had a tough night, spinning out at halfway to draw the race’s only yellow and getting hit by John Virgilio. Curtis would recover to finish fifth. After the restart, Maxon pulled away from the pack to take a well-deserved victory. Peter Carlotto finished second, followed by Lynch, Cody Ochs and Curtis. In Pure Stock, John Devine, Chad Arsenault and Ed Hatch each won regular features. Al Relyea won the Boomer’s Performance Purestock Clash.

The Trojans won the game, 3-1, one of several Alisal teams that kicked their performance into high gear this season. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Trinity Christian School's Zach Hayes follows his shot during the MTAL Golf Championships at Laguna Seca Golf Ranch in Monterey on May 1. Hays will be one of the few county golfers who gets on course early Tuesday for the CCS regionals, which will be held in one day instead of the traditional two. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) It’s been a banner year for Alisal High. The Trjojans’ string of success started in the fall with its cross country team claiming the Monterey Bay League Gabilan Division boys team title. A few weeks later, the football team won its first ever postseason game. This winter, the boys soccer team won its fourth straight MBL-G title and first Northern California Division II crown. Meanwhile, the Trojans basketball team moved from the MBL Pacific to the Gabilan and promptly won its third straight league title. And now the baseball team has achieved back-to-back MBL-P titles for the first time in school history — aided by a school-record, 11-game winning streak. The decision to add a third division for volleyball this spring means three eight-team brackets instead of two 12-team divisions. With enrollments deciding placement in the three divisions, Carmel was seeded No. 1 in Division III at 27-3 and will host No. 8-seed St. Ignatius of San Francisco on Tuesday at 7 p.m. The Padres’ path to a section title could be labeled a redemption tour, as they have the potential to face No. 5 Pacific Collegiate of the Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League. The Pumas beat them earlier this year and in last year’s Division II quarterfinals on their way to winning the CCS title. Monterey was seeded No. 7 in D-III and will visit 2013 CCS D-II champion Mount Madonna of Watsonville, the No. 2 seed. MBL Gabilan runner-up Salinas was seeded No. 6 in D-I and will visit Menlo-Atherton. The Bears, despite a 28-0 record, were seeded only No. 3. Just one program in Monterey County has ever played for a volleyball title and that was Monterey in 1997, where it fell to West Catholic Athletic League power Bellarmine in the single-division tournament. Another division is being added to the CCS baseball playoffs, bringing the total to four. However, the amount of teams going to the postseason will remain the same. Instead of 16 teams in the Open Division, it will be reduced to eight. Division III, which returns after a four year absence, will also only have eight teams. Divisions I and II will continue to load their brackets with 16 teams. Among the teams looking at the postseason in D-III include Palma, St. Francis of Watsonville, Carmel, King City and, potentially, Pacific Grove. Soledad and Monterey will be ticketed to D-II, while Alisal will likely be placed in D-I. MBL-G champion San Benito is headed to the Open Division. On the bubble for the postseason are Salinas, Seaside and Alvarez. The CCS regionals are being lumped into one full day instead two days. They will take place Tuesday at Laguna Seca Golf Ranch with a group of teams teeing off at 8 a.m. and a second round beginning around 1 p.m. Conditions in the afternoon are likely to be windy and dry, while golfers playing in the morning could have damp grass from the morning dew. Carmel is the only county team playing in the morning, along with individuals Tyler Swedberg and Zach Hayes of Trinity. Teams from Palma, Stevenson and Salinas will all get going in the afternoon. The top four teams in each bracket, and top four individuals not on a qualifying team in each of those brackets, will advance to the section finals in eight days at Laguna Seca.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald file) Carmel’s Luke Melcher, left, battles Scotts Valley’s Ryan Conte during the MTAL lacrosse championship in Carmel on May 12, 2017. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald file) Seventeen different sports help make up the Central Coast Section for boys and girls. All but one has a playoff format. Granted, lacrosse is still a sport in its growing stages, as less than a fourth of the schools in the CCS offer it. Yet, the popularity in boys and girls lacrosse has seen continued growth. The demand for a postseason has also become a topic of growing interest. “There’s been tons of discussions about it in terms of different layers,” Stevenson coach Cooper Kehoe said. “In terms of the higher-ups from the section, there hasn’t been much conversation.” There is a reason for that. Adding a postseason for lacrosse doesn’t start with the CCS. It begins with each league submitting a proposal. That has never happened. “Our office is not objected to it,” CCS assistant commissioner Steve Filios said. “But membership schools make the rules. Any proposal changes have to come from the league first. There’s never been a proposal from any league in my 10 years here.” Currently, there are three leagues with lacrosse — the Mission Trail Athletic League, Santa Clara Valley Athletic League and West Catholic Athletic League. There were 35 boys programs that took part in the three leagues this year, with five other programs playing an independent schedule. “Growing the game is something we talk about,” Pacific Grove coach Schuyler Horn said. “Playoffs are such a great format to that. That’s when the energy is high and people start to pay attention.” While the MTAL divided its league into two divisions this year to create parity, it stopped their own league tournament, leaving some schools feeling unfulfilled. Palma cruised to an undefeated league season in its division, while Aptos won the MTAL’s upper division. Proving how good it really was could have come with a postseason format for the Chieftains. “We need to have more discussions about this,” Palma coach Vince Brigantino said. “It seems odd that we are the only sport that doesn’t have a CCS playoff format.” Coaches in the MTAL will meet one more time in the next week to discus the future. The playoffs are expected to be a topic of conversation. “All you have to do is come up with a proposal,” Filios said. “If your leagues supports it, we would put it on our board to see whether to have it or not.” Filios cautioned about not waiting too long to come up with a proposal. The CCS board of managers only meets three times a year, with upcoming meetings slated for October and January. MTAL coaches are meeting in the next few days to make all-league selections. “You would propose it at your meeting,” Carmel athletic director Golden Anderson said. “From there it goes to a vote of athletic directors. I don’t think anyone is opposed to it. I think we would be very supportive of it.” If the CCS were to approve the adoption of a postseason for lacrosse in October, a second vote would occur at the sections next meeting in January. If it received approval, a playoff system could be in place for 2019. “I would hope it comes up at some point in our meeting,” Horn said. “I don’t think there are any coaches that don’t want a playoff format. It’s a question of logistics.” What would help enhance the process is if the other two leagues are on board, and all three leagues submit a proposal by October. “There’s a lot of parity in the section right now,” Horn said. “I would think that would lend itself to a playoff situation that is exciting.” One thought would be to add one 12-team bracket, with the top four teams getting byes. That would add just one extra week to the season, with each league assured of four teams. If a league has two divisions based on equity, a play-in game could be played between the lower league champion and the fourth place finisher from the upper league for the last spot. “I think it would be awesome,” Horn said. “It would make it more exciting for the kids. It would keep them engaged. There’s something else to play for besides a league title.” According Filios, the North Coast Section has a playoff system. But the entire southern section does not. “The southern section has a rule where 40 percent of the schools have to have the sport,” Filios said. “We don’t have that rule in our section. If they want this, they need to start the process now.” Kehoe believes having a postseason for lacrosse gives the sport more creditability, as its numbers continue to grow throughout California. “Why wouldn’t we want to have this?” Kehoe said. “For the growth of the game, it’s important that it gets to that level so it has some legitimacy.” Kehoe, a 2007 Stevenson graduate, took his team down to San Diego in the spring just to get in a few games in against different opponents. “It’s an interesting feeling when the season is over,” Kehoe said. “But I know nothing different. Until there is a change, the mindset remains the same.” Should a proposal be forthcoming, Filios cautioned about Title IX. Would a postseason format for a boys lacrosse playoff constitute the need for girls lacrosse to also have a playoffs format? While 40 schools make up boys lacrosse in the CCS, just 26 girls teams are currently playing the sport, including six in Monterey County. “If boys lacrosse got approval, would they need to approve girls lacrosse?” Filios said. “There aren’t as many teams for girls at this point. But it too is growing.” “Lacrosse is a pretty powerful game,” added Horn, who grew up on the East Coast. “If we want to grow the game, the playoffs are a way to do it.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

(John Devine - Monterey Herald) Phil Grote goes up for a block for PCS as setter Jake Sandidge looks on in the first set of a CCS Division III semifinal match against Carmel on Thursday in Carmel. (John Devine - Monterey Herald) CARMEL >> To take that next step in an already historic boys volleyball season, to exorcise its demons, Carmel High had to get past the defending Central Coast Section Division II champions. That meant defeating a Pacific Collegiate School program that quite frankly has had the Padres’ numbers since it joined the league eight years ago. “We were confident, but cautious,” Carmel setter Charlie DeLapa said. That confidence soared Thursday as the Padres ended a string of eight straight losses to PCS with a 25-21, 25-21, 25-21 sweep in the CCS Division III semifinals. Carmel’s first win over the Pumas means its first ever trip to the CCS finals, where it will play Harker — a five-set winners over Mount Madonna — Saturday at St. Francis in Mountain View. “How sick would it be if we could hang a banner in this gym,” said DeLapa, who finished with 35 assists. In addition, the win put the three-time Monterey Bay League Gabilan Division-champion Padres into the CIF State Northern California tournament next week. “I told coaches at our league meeting this week that this just wasn’t about Carmel,” Carmel coach Israel Ricardez said. “But getting the respect that our league deserves.” The Padres (29-3) will go into Saturday’s title match having won 21 straight matches — 19 by sweeps. They have now avenged two of their three losses this year, including a season-opening loss to Pacific Collegiate. “I didn’t realize we had beaten them eight straight times,” first-year PCS coach Todd Harrison said. “Carmel had a ton of momentum coming into the tournament. He has some depth.” The Pumas (18-6) battled to get to this point, needing five sets to get past Saratoga — the 2017 NorCal champion and PCS’s foe in the 2017 CCS D-II title match — in their playoff opener. Prior to that, they went four hard sets in a loss to Aptos in the Santa Cruz Coast Athletic League tournament semifinals. They finished third in the SCCAL behind champion Aptos and runner-up Mount Madonna. “My guys are tired,” Harrison said. “We’re just worn down. But we weren’t ready for the season to end. We wanted to defend that title.” Pacific Collegiate ended Carmel’s season in the D-II semifinals last year en route to winning its second section title. “We’re not the same team,” Carmel hitter Keegan Forrester said of the early season loss to the Pumas. “I think midway through the year, we figured it out and came together.” Forrester, who finished with 14 kills, pointed toward a win over Aptos last month — another team that beat them earlier this year — as a turning point in the Padres’ season. “At that point, we realized we have something special going on here,” Forrester, who also recorded 15 digs, said. “Lets see how far we can take this.” While winning the first two sets didn’t take long for Carmel, finishing off the defending champions in the third set was a battle. In fact, the Pumas put the Padres on their heels when they took a 16-15 lead on the strength of setter Jake Sandidge and middle Phil Grote. They maintained that lead to 21-20. A block from Cole Dickman swung the momentum, however, and sent the Padres on a 5-0 run to close out the match. “These kids bought in the process,” Ricardez said. “The postseason is a new season. I challenged them to care for each other and keep this season alive.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

Soledad earned the top seed for the CCS D-II playoffs. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Palma School’s Sam Stoutenborough makes contact against host Monterey earlier this season. The Chieftains earned the No. 4 seed for CCS Division III play. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Despite arguments from a representative from the West Catholic Athletic League, Soledad was seeded No. 1 Saturday in the Central Coast Section Division II baseball playoffs. The Aztecs (21-5), who ran off 13 consecutive wins to capture their third Mission Trail Athletic League title in eight years, host No. 16 Prospect in first-round play Wednesday at 4 p.m. “The representative for the WCAL made a move, calling it a seeding error,” Soledad coach Damien Ryan said. “A couple of people came to our defense. The support was nice.” Because St. Francis is seeded No. 2 and Archbishop Mitty No. 3, there is no possible way the two WCAL teams can meet in the finals. “I think they wanted an all-WCAL Division II finals,” Ryan said. Soledad, who has never earned a No. 1 seed, has reached the CCS D-III semifinals in the past. “Soledad deserved the No. 1 seed based on the criteria that the CCS has,” King City coach Lorenzo Espino said. “It went to a vote and the representatives voted no.” Soledad will face a Panthers program that hasn’t been to the playoffs in a decade. “I got a chance to talk to their coach,” Ryan said. “I gave a little idea of what the weather will be like in Soledad. But not too much information.” King City (19-7) is going to the playoffs for the third straight year as the No. 13 seed in Division II. It will visit No. 4 Gilroy (18-9) on Wednesday. “I kind of had an inking we were going to be in Division II,” said Espino, whose has always been in Division III. “We’re excited to be in the playoffs. Gilroy is a quality team.” Monterey (16-11) is back in the D-II playoffs after missing last year for the first time since 1991, as the No 10 seed, and will visit No. 7 Pioneer in San Jose. The Toreadores snapped a four-game losing streak, closing the Monterey bay League Gabilan Division season with a 4-1 win over Salinas to seal a postseason spot. “It’s fantastic,” Monterey coach Michael Groves said. “The kids worked really hard to get back to the playoffs. Hopefully we’re starting another streak of postseason appearances.” Two-time MBL Pacific Division champion Alisal (17-7) was seeded No. 6 in D-I and will host No. 11 Los Altos (14-14) on Wednesday at 4 p.m. The Trojans went 8-1 down the stretch to secure the league title. A seven-game winning streak to close the season catapulted Alvarez (17-11) back into the D-I playoffs as the No. 12 seed, as it will visit No. 5 Carlmont (15-11). Carmel, who missed the postseason for the first time since 1995 last spring, is back as the No. 6 seed in D-III and will visit No. 3 Thomas More (23-3) on Saturday. “Obviously it’s good for the kids,” Carmel coach Randy Bispo said. “I believe the kids coming back had a sense of urgency in getting back to the playoffs. It was a crappy feeling last year.” Palma (15-11) is also in D-III as the No. 4 seed and will host No. 5 Terra Nova (12-13) on Saturday. St. Francis of Watsonville (18-7) was the No. 1 seed in the newly created eight-team bracket. Just missing the playoffs were Pacific Grove and Seaside, who went 7-1 down the stretch.

Yet, for the York School senior, his peaking period comes next week, when the stakes are raised at the California Interscholastic Federation state swimming championships. “The plan all along is to get to state and have a pretty good time going in,” Blaul said. Blaul accomplished his first goal Saturday, finishing second in both the 200-yard individual medley and 100 breaststroke at the CCS finals at Santa Clara International Swim Center. In both cases, Blaul swam season-best time, clocking 1:50.72 in the 200 IM and 55.71 in the 100 breast to advance to his third straight state meet. “I’m on track for my best time in the 200 IM,” Blaul said. “I went a little faster at the start and a little faster in the finish. I can clean some things up. I think it will be a lot faster next week.” Blaul’s swam 1:50.90 last year in finishing seventh at the state finals. As a sophomore in 2016, he swam a career best of 1:49.66. “I will be more rested next week,” Blaul said. Bound for Northwestern University to swim in the Big 12 next spring, the 18-year-old fell behind early in the 200 IM, closing ground on the third leg, which is the breaststroke. “He took it out on the fly,” Blaul said. “I held my own on the back. I gained at least a second on the breast. The free was about the same. My out was fine. My breast can be at least a second faster.” In part, because the breaststroke is Blaul’s strongest event, as evident by him chasing a section title with his best time of the season. “It puts me a good spot in terms of lanes for state,” Blaul said. “I was happy with the back split. Now that we’re shaving down on our workouts, I’m getting more rest and stronger.” Blaul, who has a career best of 55.30 in the event, felt he wasn’t patient coming out of the turn on the last wall, and was a little off on his dive into the pool. “I might have rushed my turn a little bit,” Blaul said. “When you’re tired, you makes mistakes. I need to work on my head position in the water. Little things like that can shave a second.” A three-time Mission Trail Athletic League champion and school-record holder in eight different events at York, Blaul was fourth in the 100 breast last year at 57.03. “I believe I’m on track to dip under 55 seconds,” Blaul said. Last year Blaul finished seventh in the state in the 200 IM (1:50.90) and ninth in the 100 breast (56.29). Teammate Connor Barringer finished eighth overall in the 200 free at 1:42.54. He is under consideration to make state, which will be determined Monday based on times from all sections. Stevenson’s Will Morgan, who will play water polo next spring at UCLA, finished 11th overall in the 50 free in 21.63. Pacific Grove sophomore Selly Diallo will have to wait to find out if she is headed back to the state championships in the 50 free. A two-time MTAL champion in the 50 and 100 free races, Diallo finished eighth overall in the 50 free (24.02). Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

In total, the Lancers won 13 events Monday. Pope Francis’ Tanner Longo won the high jump (4’10”) during the tri-meet, while Agawam’s Kimberly Beaver took first in the 800m with a time of 2.33.0. It was another satisfying season for Longmeadow head coach John Devine, who will close out his coaching career this spring after over 20 years at the helm of the Lancers’ program. “We’ve been very blessed with talent and depth and great assistant coaches,” Devine said. “I’m very fortunate.” GIRLS TRACK SCOREBOARD * notes a league game # notes a tournament game Embed Code The code has been selected for you.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) The CSU Monterey Bay baseball team begins its hunt for a national title in earnest Thursday with the start of the NCAA Division II West Regionals at Pacific Azusa. The Otters hold the No. 1 seed and must win four more games to reach the national championship. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Walt White looked at the bracket for the NCAA Division II West Regionals and saw no surprises. “Any one of these six teams could have been the top seed, or could win the national championship,” the CSU-Monterey Bay baseball coach said. That includes the Otters, who received the No. 1 seed and will face conference rival Chico State on Thursday at 3:30 p.m. at Azusa Pacific. “There is a formula for the seeding,” White said. “We checked off a lot of boxes. Our record against the opponents in our bracket is good. We have a good resume.” At 38-16, the California Collegiate Athletic Association champion Otters need two wins to break the single-season school mark of 39, achieved in 2013. “Our goal is to win four more games,” White said. That would put CSUMB into the Division II national championships in Cary, North Carolina, for the first time in school history. “Right now we’re just worried about Thursday and Chico State,” White said. The Otters had their way with their conference rivals this year, going 3-1 against them in the regular season and beating them in the conference tournament. “We didn’t play our best baseball in the tournament,” White said. “But this is what we’ve worked for all season, to put ourselves in the position we’re in.” With the tournament having no baring on the Otters’ seeding position, White held out two starters who are nursing injuries and kept the pitch count down on his staff. “We’re finally getting back to full strength,” White said. “We played the last month without a couple of starters. We had to rest a pitcher for three weeks to gear up for this.” Despite the injuries, the Otters didn’t skip a beat over the final month of the season in capturing their second conference title. This will be CSUMB’s third appearance in the West Regionals in the last five years and the second time it has been the top seed in the tournament. Being the top seed often comes with being the host site. But because CSUMB doesn’t have lights, it can’t host the tournament, so No. 2 Azusa Pacific got the rights. “I looked at Sollecito Field,” White said. “I just didn’t know if we could get it prepared. We’ve talked about getting lights on our field. Hopefully down the road it will be a reality.” Arguably the hottest team coming into the tournament is No. 3 seed UC San Diego. The 2017 D-II national runner up has won eight straight and is 16-1 in its last 17 games, winning the CCAA tournament. CSUMB split its four-game series with San Diego before failing to the Tritons in the tournament. It also went 3-0 against No. 4 seed Point Loma earlier this year. The return of Pacific Grove graduate Kyle Czaplak and second basemen Myles Hager will bolster the lineup for the Otters. Czaplak hasn’t played shortstop since breaking his wrist after being hit by a pitch six weeks ago. He returned to the field two weeks ago as a designated hitter, raising his batting average to .358. Hager has been Czaplak’s keystone partner at second base and road roommate all season. “Kyle started taking ground balls last week and looked good,” White said. “Both those guys do as much for us defensively as at the plate.” The Otters have no shortage of hitters this year. They’re hitting .311 as a team with 50 home runs — including 16 each from single-season school-record holders Jacob Tonascia and Hayden Duer. Duer had previously shared the single season-record of 13, which he set two years ago. The pair have combined for 117 RBIs. “We’re pretty potent offensively,” White said. “Add TJ Dove and a healthy Myles Hager and Kyle Czaplak and we’re tough 1 through 9. We have a bunch of No. 3 hitters in the lineup.” Dove quietly went out and shattered the consecutive-games hitting-streak record at CSUMB with 23, reaching base a record 49 straight games before having the run come to an end in the tournament. “It was almost like when a pitcher is throwing a no hitter,” White said. “We never talked about it. That is what makes him so good. When it ended, he said, ‘Let’s start a new one.’” Dove, who covers center field, hit a team-high .378 this year, stealing 13 bases while scoring a team-high 56 runs. “Our body of work looks pretty good,” White said. “Our offense is as good as anyone in the country. If our pitching matches up with other teams, we will be fine.” The Otters’ rotation starts with San Benito grad Colton Fletcher, who posted a 9-1 record with a 3.03 ERA, striking out 70 in 74 innings of work. Ethan McRae will likely draw the start in Game 2. The bullpen has seen Soledad product AJ Banuelos become a stopgap to closer Fabing Connor, who has 10 saves. “What we have is a bunch of kids that choose to be here,” White said. “Some of them have been in the program for four and five years. They’ve put us in a position to continue something special.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Santa Catalina’s Emma James delivers a pitch during a CCS Division II first-round game against South San Francisco in Monterey on Wednesday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Monterey >> If there was one thing that concerned Alex Pingree before the first pitch, it was how would her Santa Catalina softball team would handle playoff pressure. A roster with six freshmen, including pitcher Emma James, and four sophomores didn’t have much postseason experience, if any at all. “We’re so young,” said Pingree, the Cougars coach, prior to Wednesday’s Central Coast Section Division II playoff opener. “I have one senior. We’re going to play nervous.” It didn’t help that the game was delayed 70 minutes because the umpires were late. “That threw us off a little,” catcher Emily Hayes said. “That happened to us once before. I just felt like we’d battle back.” The Cougars erased a four-run first inning deficit Wednesday, with Hayes breaking up a 6-6 tie in the sixth, scoring the winning run in a 7-6 decision over South San Francisco. “I told you after the seeding meeting on Saturday that we’re on a tough side of the bracket,” Pingree said. “We got the win and jitters out. Now we’re ready.” It won’t get any easier for the No. 2-seeded Cougars (18-1), who will face Notre Dame-Belmont on Saturday, likely at the Salinas Sports Complex although details had yet to be announced on Wednesday evening. “The first playoff win is always the toughest,” said Hayes, who had four hits. “Now we’ve got one under our belt.” The Mission Trail Athletic League champion Cougars, who came into their playoff opener having rattled off 15 straight wins, spotted No. 15 South San Francisco four runs in the first inning. That prompted a meeting in the circle with Pingree, who pitched Santa Catalina to its only CCS title in 2013. “I just said ‘This is not you,’” said Pingree, who is in her second year as the Cougars’ coach. “We’re not going out like this.” Champions of the Peninsula Athletic League Ocean Division, the Warriors had five hits in the first inning, taking advantage of an error and a mental mistake to produce four runs. “We knew we had plenty of time to get back in the game,’’ Hayes said. “Once we got out of the inning, we settled down.” The Cougars got one back in the bottom of the first inning on a run-scoring single from Hayes, then erupted for five runs in the second inning to take a 6-4 lead. Grace Atkins highlighted the five-run uprising with a two-run double. Hayes also ripped a run-scoring double during the outburst. James, who won her 18th game of the season, rebounded after her rugged first inning by shutting down the Warriors over the next three frames, relying on a defensive gem from Emily Radner at third. Yet, the Warriors (14-13 overall) put pressure on Santa Catalina when Christina Herrera lined a two-run double in the fifth to tie the game at six. That set the stage for Hayes, who opened the bottom of the sixth with her fourth hit of the game. After being sacrificed to second, she eluded the tag at third on a fielder’s choice. “I thought the third baseman was going to make the play and just tag the bag for the force,” Hayes said. “But the shortstop picked it up and I beat her to the bag.” James then sent a slow grounder to first basemen. Yet, instead of getting the force at the plate, the first baseman took the out at first, enabling Hayes to score. “Yeah I was surprised,” said Hayes, who scored standing up. “I was running on contact. I was trying to beat the throw. But there wasn’t one.” The Cougars then put the ball into the hands of James, who gave up a one-out single. The potential tying run eventually reached second base before James got the final out on a fly ball to Jessica Clements. “I’m proud of how the girls were able to bounce back,” Pingree said. “It’s a good step. Now we got the jitters out.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337. Sign up for email newsletters', ""Here is the third-quarter honor roll for Dover-Sherborn High School.

Billy, who had battled cancer, managed the Glentoran Colts team but is most fondly remembered and respected for the many great players he brought to The Oval over four decades of outstanding service. Morrison, who made 432 appearances for the Glens from 1982 to 1994, was just one of the great players guided by Billy. The long list of talent he welcomed into the Glentoran family also included John Devine, Tommy Leeman, Gary Hillis, Terry Moore, Paul Millar, Philip Major, David Keery, Andy Mathieson, Gordon Hillis, Justin McBride, Gary Smyth and David West. Morrison, who won two titles and six Irish Cups with the Glens, said: ""My late father Rab worked at the shipyard with Billy and Jim \'Bimbo\' Weatherup and Billy spotted me playing for the joiners\' team in the summer league. He was great at looking after players, particularly when things weren\'t going smoothly. ""In this era, there\'s no-one like him and you can only imagine the money he saved the club.

He looked into the eyes of the players and could see the eagerness to learn. It was enough to lure Dulisse to Marina High to become the school’s third head coach since going to 11-man football eight years ago. “I realize there isn’t a lot of tradition here,” Dulisse said. “But it’s growing. It’s a canvas that hasn’t been painted yet. There’s momentum being built.” The Mariners produced a record-setting season last fall, in which they established new marks for wins (5) and consecutive wins (4), while shattering every offensive school record. “There is no doubt in my mind that we can build off that,” Dulisse said. “There will be a bridge for the younger kids to follow, with those that are back providing leadership on being more fundamentally sound.” Marina closed last season with four straight wins to finish second in the Mission Trail Athletic League’s Coastal Division. Despite the success, the interest level in the off season has been just slightly higher than usual. Only 19 players are taking part in spring ball. “We did lose some good seniors,” Dulisse said. “Not everyone is coming back either. One school pushed hard to recruit one of our kids. That’s fine. If you want to be here, that’s great. If not, it’s the next-man-up mentality.” Dulisse spent two years as a freshman coach at Alisal before going over to Alvarez last season as an assistant. He understands there are obstacles in his path that others schools don’t deal with. For instance, Marina has used three different sites for home games in the last two years. This fall, three of the team’s first four games will be on the road. “Our nonleague schedule is aggressive,” said Dulisse, who didn’t make the schedule. “But I think we can make waves in our league.” In addition, the Mariners will likely be without a junior varsity program for the second consecutive year. The program’s numbers, as of now, won’t allow Dulisse to field two teams. Last year the program lost eight freshman when it dropped its JV squad. Dulisse doesn’t feel that will be a problem this year. “You have to put kids in the right positions to be successful,” Dulisse said. “If you provide them with the necessary foundation, it’s not as intimidating. These kids deserve my undivided attention.” Dulisse has had good vibes out at spring practice. He’s brought new energy to the program and sees the enthusiasm of those that are out at this time. “It’s been great,” Dulisse said. “We’re going to implement some new things, keep it simple and have some fun. The program will expand if you win. People love winners.” Understanding that he doesn’t have a lot of depth, Dulisse will run an offense that will be designed to shorten up the game. “We’ll run something similar to what Stanford runs,” Dulisse said. “When you don’t have a lot of bodies or depth, you have to play ball-control offense.” Dulisse feels he already has the personnel to grind the ball, chew up the clock and slow the game down to keep his players healthy. Several will likely go both ways. “We have some pieces coming up that I feel can help right away,” Dulisse said. “We don’t have a lot of depth in the trenches. But the linemen we have are solid. And we have skilled players.” Over the final four games of the season last year, the Mariners simplified the offense and erupted for 210 points — more than in any full season in the program’s short history. Dulisse will follow a similar pattern in keeping the game simple. There won’t be a playbook where players are looking at their wristbands before each snap from center. “I want them excited, not coming out of the huddle thinking (about) what the play call was,” Dulisse said. “We’re going to keep the terminology simple.” Dulisse is also inviting parents or the student body to attend practices this fall, as he hopes to build more excitement on campus. “I want it to be an inviting environment and see the process,” Dulisse said. “There were a lot of positives from last year. The challenges will be continuing that with a new group of men.” Considering the team has been without a coach for three months, Dulisse didn’t expect a big turnout. But he does believe more players will come as the season gets closer. “I embrace kids,” Dulisse said. “Things come up. I’m not going to penalize a kid for not making every summer workout. One way to lose a championship is to turn kids away that can’t be there all the time.” Dulisse has long-term goals, including hopes of having a stadium built on campus, bringing the numbers up enough to have a junior varsity program and contending for supremacy in league. Marina will play in the Santa Lucia Division, the lowest tier of the new Pacific Coast Athletic League, this fall. “I can’t compare our team to teams from the past,” Dulisse said. “I can only compare to what we are doing going forward. And I like what I see.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Carmel High’s Rachael Carroll bunts during a CCS Division II softball game against Pacfic Grove in Salinas on Saturday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Carmel High’s Jessica Pavloff delivers a pitch to Pacific Grove on Saturday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Salinas >> The coaches had nothing to say. The players for Carmel did. A gut wrenching loss late in the regular season meant it was time for teammates at Carmel to be held accountable. “We sat on the softball field and talked until Pacific Grove kicked us off,” recalled Carmel pitcher Jessica Pavloff. “We respect each other. Sometimes it’s better if it comes from the players.” While the results weren’t immediate, the message was clear. The postseason would be a chance for the Padres to redeem themselves. So far, so good as Carmel is headed to the Central Coast Section Division II semifinals for the first time since 2006 after ending rival Pacific Grove’s season Saturday with a 11-0 win at the Salinas Sports Complex. The No. 5 seeded Padres (16-6) will face top seed Hillsdale (22-6) at a date yet to be determined next week at PAL Stadium in San Jose. “Hillsdale is a strong team,” Carmel coach Jim Pingree said. “Good pitching, good hitting. But we’ll show up.” Ironically, the meeting of the minds between the players came after Carmel was eliminated from the Mission Trail Athletic League title chase on May 3 with a 2-1 loss at Pacific Grove. “It was a big talk,” senior Rachael Carroll said. “We were on that field for 30 minutes after the game. With no coaches, we were a little more aggressive with what we had to say.” The Padres had come into this season as the reigning two-time league champions with 16 straight league wins — a streak halted by Pacific Grove on March 23. “We were just a little more focused today,” Pingree said. “The girls came ready to play. We played like we had something to prove. We’re playing our best ball right now.” The timing couldn’t be better for Carmel, who last semifinal appearance 12 years ago resulted in a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to eventual CCS champion Notre Dame. Carmel, who erupted for 17 hits in Saturday’s quarterfinal, had scored just nine runs in dropping two of its three games this spring to the Breakers “We just started timing the pitches better,” said Carroll, who had three hits at the top of the order and scored three runs. “We knew what she was going to throw.” The Padres put two on the scoreboard before the Breakers got to the plate, using a run-scoring single from Dillan Chiewpanich. It turned out that would be all Pavloff would need as the junior zeroed in and shutout the Breakers, firing a three-hitter over the first four innings, finishing with a seven hitter. “Jocelyn (Bruno) called a good game,” said Pavloff, in talking about her catcher. “A few things were working and we stuck with it throughout the game.” Pavloff only had one strikeout. But the right-hander mixed her pitches, coming inside and jamming the Breakers power hitters, while inducing others to ground out. “Oh, no doubt having the lead enables you to relax a little more out there,” Pavloff said. “I felt good out there.” And it showed as Pavloff set down the final five hitters she faced. She also got help from her defense as Carroll made a running catch at second base to halt a potential threat. “Things didn’t go how we hoped or thought it would in league play,” Carroll said. “The playoffs are a new season, a chance to made amends of sorts.” The Padres produced runs in six of the seven innings, using a two-out run scoring double from No. 9 hitter Quincy Cox to opened up a 4-0 lead in fourth. Kendra Hyles’ third hit of the game in the fifth resulted in an RBI and a 6-0 cushion. Carmel scored three more times in the seventh on RBI from Kristin Cardinalli and Bruno. Ten hitters reached base for the Padres, including Bibiana Silva, who celebrated her birthday with a pinch-hit single. “It’s been their team since the get go,” Pingree said. “The girls want to put the regular season in the past. Now they’ve done something that hasn’t happened in 12 years. I’m proud of them.” While Pacific Grove finished with seven hits, its only threat came in the fifth inning, when catcher Danielle Pasquariello’s double put runners at second and third, only to be left stranded. The Breakers, who advanced to the quarterfinals when Pasquareillo hit a walk-off three-run homer on Wednesday, finished the year 19-8. Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

The California Collegiate Athletic Association champion Otters tied the single season school record for wins this spring with 39 after beating Chico State in the tournament opener. It was the Otters’ third West Regionals appearance in the last five years. CSUMB gave up 28 runs in its last two losses. CSUMB dug itself a deep hole, falling behind 7-2 after two innings. After it crept to within 10-8 in the fifth, Cal Baptist responded with four runs in the sixth. What really hurt the Otters was their defense. They committed a season-high seven errors. Pacific Grove graduate Kyle Czaplak hit his second homer of the tournament for the Otters, giving him five on the season. He also doubled and drove in four runs. TJ Dove had three hits and scored three runs for the Otters. Dove recently posted a school-record 21-game hitting streak and 49-game consecutive streak of reaching base end. Myles Hager and Darren Kriz both had two hits for CSUMB (39-18). Czaplak’s homer gave CSUMB a school-record 57 as a team, rewriting the old mark of 54. Hayden Duer and San Benito High product Jacob Tonascia will share the single season home run record of 18. Duer previously shared it with Kevin Davidson of 13 in 2016. Both could be drafted in MLB’s June Amateur draft. With 65 runs batted in after a sacrifice fly in Saturday’s loss, Tonascia is the new school record holder. Duer finished with 61. The old record was 51, set by Kevin Davidson in 2016. The Otters also set a school record for scoring 10 or more runs in a game 19 times, breaking the old mark of 12.

Division I Girls Track and Field Championships, only three athletes from Longmeadow came away with individual wins. But what the Lancers lacked in outright wins, they more than made up for with numerous contributions across a loaded roster. In total, the Lancers scored in 15 total events during the championship meet at Holyoke High School, finishing with 118 points to clinch their third consecutive Western Mass. title. “There was great effort by so many different people,” Longmeadow head coach John Devine said. “A lot of depth. There were some, like Jordyn Shubrick captured two firsts, Stephanie Perkins captured a first, but there was a lot of the team and depth and everyone contributed a little of something."" “I don’t know all of the names and scores, but a lot of people contributed, and that’s always a good feeling for a team. That it wasn’t just a couple of stars, it was everyone contributing.” While a multitude of Lancers stepped up in Monday’s win, Shubrick set the tone in field events with first-place results in both the shot put (36’10.25”) and discus (101’2”). “It’s kind of the same gameplan,” Shubrick said. “I just try to stay calm, stay focused, cheer on my teammates. Make sure we all have fun. I think that’s the big thing. Everyone is trying their hardest — you’ve got to love it.” Elsewhere, Perkins set a school record with a first-place mark of 36’4” in the triple jump. Perkins also placed third in the long jump (16’0.25”) and fifth in the high jump (4’10’). Leelle Tyler won the 100 meter hurdles (16.66) while also placing third in the triple jump, while Hannah Lavoie placed second in the 400 hurdles (1:10.23). East Longmeadow finished second with a score of 103.5 — with Madison McMahon winning the high jump (5’0”), pole vault, Krishiana Ramesh winning the pole vault (9’0”) and Ashley Corcoran leading the pack in the 400 meter hurdles (1:08.49). “The East Longmeadow girls weren’t at full strength and they competed phenomenally well,” Devine said. “They did a great job.” Amherst’s Sophia Jacobs-Townsley dominated in distance races, winning both the one mile (5:17.04) and two mile (11:07.02) while racing on a 4x800 relay squad that won with a time of 10:04.49. Central\'s Kyla Hill was a force in the 100 meter and 200 meter dash, winning both events. One of Jacobs-Townsley’s partners on that 4x800 relay team — Isabela Shepard — also won the 400 meter with a time of (59.08). “I’m hoping to get out there and maybe not go completely out until the state meet, but definitely in the mile, try to push a little bit harder,” Jacobs-Townsley said of her goals going into the Central-West meet next Saturday. “Today, I was supposed to push a little bit harder and I didn’t because I wasn’t feeling amazing."" Minnechaug had two first place finishers in Grace Pettengill (800m, 2:21.14), and Savannah Vartabedian (Long jump, 16’5.25”), while Agawam’s Nicole Langevin won the javelin (105’6”). Pittsfield also took first in the 4x100 relay with a time of 52.09. For Devine, who will not longer coach the Lancers next year after over 20 years at the helm, his team’s effort in what was his final WMass championship was something that he won\'t forget. “For our girls, I think they wanted to try and send me out as a winner, and that may have helped their motivation,” Devine said. “It’s very touching that they gave so much of themselves.""

Many people wonder what relevance PR has got to do with online visibility, yet there are two reasons why it is deeply influential – brand awareness and links. Driving large volumes of traffic via brand awareness and earning links, which increases non-brand search visibility for commercial keywords, helps bolster a company’s digital presence. Online conversion from brand awareness is easy to explain. A business undertakes a PR campaign, people read the resulting editorial and are subsequently aware of this brand. This awareness sees more people Googling the brand and then converting into customers. Links on the other hand, are a little more esoteric to explain. They are arguably the number one ranking factor for search engines and the higher quality links a website has, then the further up the search engine results list a company will appear. When a business runs a PR campaign, journalists will more often than not link to a businesses website in the editorial. Linking occurs in approximately 30 per cent of all press coverage, but this can be increased to 50–60 per cent if the PR company used for the campaign is digitally savvy. Since Google started penalising companies that buy high volumes of low-grade, spammy links, canny businesses have been focusing on quality, not quantity, when it comes to digital PR. In simple terms, one link to a company website from the BBC or the Guardian is an endorsement from a very reputable source and counts for more than several referrals from irrelevant, ill-functioning webpages. Hence, if a site is only building up poor quality links, this actually becomes counterproductive, in turn reducing its domain’s authority. So, how can businesses go about bolstering brand awareness and online visibility? To help navigate this minefield, let’s explore the effective ways companies can implement these business-enhancing techniques to bring about an improved online presence. A good PR agency will always start by identifying a company’s key objectives and making these the foundations for the project. Chosen objectives depend on the client, but these might include; increasing online enquiries and visibility, boosting website traffic, or even earning quality links to a client’s site. These can then be used as a guideline to ensure a strategy and its content does not stray too far from the intended purpose. It is paramount that a high-quality, relevant editorial campaign is created, as opposed to sales-heavy press releases. This way, a brand will be better represented and have a greater chance of gaining more targeted coverage and links, driving traffic that will convert into sales, appointments, or whatever the aim of the website might be. From personal experience, the most effective way of doing this, which journalists respond favourably to, is to carry out a piece of research, compile a study or create a video. In the case of Fletchers Solicitors, one of the UK’s leading medical negligence and serious injury law firms, our PR team conducted in-depth research looking into the UK’s most popular professions and how people’s career choices have been influenced by the nation’s favourite TV programmes. As a result, we discovered law and healthcare-related roles are the most glamourised and desirable job titles to possess. These findings were well received by a wide range of national publications including Vogue, The Sun and The HR Director. Links from these publications, along with a whole host of others, helped bolster the brand’s recognition earned trusted links from reputable sources and increased traffic to the firm’s website. An equally important aspect to this process is to compile a relevant media list of key titles to which targeted material should be sent. As a starting point, identify competitors and see where they are being covered, as this will provide a rough idea of where the content should be aiming to get published. Private Midwives is a great example of how creating a targeted media campaign can do wonders for brand awareness and boost a website’s online visibility. By compiling a series of maternity-focused PR campaigns, our tailored content brought about a wave of coverage in highly reputable publications, such as the London Evening Standard, Elle UK and Female First. The links included within these articles were all of a high quality, hence they helped bolster the company’s online visibility. As a result, the brand’s website also started ranking for a number of midwifery-related keywords, which in turn increased leads from the business’s website. To ensure a company’s online presence is being improved rather than damaged, by chasing low quality links, take advantage of tools such as Majestic and Moz. As a general rule, if a site has a good trust flow, which is a score to show how trustworthy a site is, and is linking out to a selection of sites relevant to its readership, it is likely to be a reliable source and a good opportunity. However, if a website appears to be linking out to a vast number of random sites, then it is one to be avoided. PR can boost a website’s ranking, drive traffic and, of course, establish the company as an expert in its field. However, it is paramount that quality runs through all aspects of a PR approach in order to make the most out of it. Unfortunately, in this instance, there are no shortcuts and slow and steady growth really is the best policy. Play by the rules, aim for coverage on reputable media outlets and success is sure to follow.

The Manchester agency will handle consumer and trade PR for Durham-based Honcho. The launch will target millennials and young drivers and comes following an £850k crowdfunding campaign by the start-up. “honcho is a truly innovative and disruptive brand, and one which we have been part of the story of for a little while already, having provided PR support for their first round of crowd-funding,” explained James Crawford, managing director at PR Agency One. “We are delighted to be working with them to re-educate young drivers and the general public about how a consumer champion should behave – and lift the lid on what other players in the insurance market are really doing behind the scenes.” PR Agency One will oversee the strategy, creative and execution of honcho’s consumer launch campaign, which will use PR targeted at millennials to drive customer growth and build brand awareness. “PR Agency One impressed us with both the breadth of their creativity and experience working with big name consumer brands. Like us, they are disruptive, results-driven and agile – which is exactly what we need from an agency as we enter the market for the first time,” added Gavin Sewell, chief executive officer at honcho. “What’s more, they were willing to lend their support to PR our crowd-funding efforts earlier this year. As a result of all the PR exposure they secured for that, we not only managed to over-exceed our funding target, but we have been contacted by a number of insurers and brokers that we had yet to approach, all of whom are keen to partner with honcho.” © 2017 Prolific North | Co reg: 08268534 Hosted by:', ""Log in or create an account A MarketBeat account allows you to set up a watchlist and receive notifications for stocks you are interested in.

On Saturday, they made it two wins from three league games with a 19-run victory over Arnside in what was a low scoring game at Cross Hill Park. Captain Andy Hill won the toss and elected to bat but Westgate posted a score of just 82 all out. Only Danny Wilkinson (34) and Craig Buchanan (14) reached double figures, and the pair put on 32 runs together to take the innings from 19-5 to 51-6. Adam Cowperthwaite was the man of the moment for Arnside, taking excellent figures of 5-18 from 20 overs, including 12 maidens. Arnside struggled to a score of 63 all out. Six players didn’t score, and only James Crawford (24) and Adrian Lee (10) made double figures. Westgate’s Peter Wilson (4-22), Dylan Conroy (3-22) and Danny Wilkinson (3-8) were in the wickets. On Sunday, they faced Warton away from home in the second round of the Hackney and Leigh Trophy and suffered a heavy eight-wicket defeat. Westgate won the toss and elected to bat. They posted a score of 141-7 from the allotted 35 overs, with Craig Buchanan retiring not out on 51. In-form Danny Wilkinson (35) and Garry Tattersall (10) were the only other players to reach double figures for the visitors. Warton reached the target in 30.3 overs, and only lost two wickets. Opener Gareth Finney top scored with 50 not out, and had to retire in accordance with the rules. J.Bolton was also 35 not out for the hosts. Meanwhile, Westgate’s second team suffered their first defeat of the season, and it was a heavy 134-run loss to promotion contenders Sedgwick. Sedgwick won the toss and decided to bat first, posting a remarkable 221-6 from 45 overs. Number seven batsman Chris Evans top scored with an impressive 80 not out from just 59 balls in an innings that included 12 fours and two sixes. Abdul Rehman was Westgate’s top wicket-taker with figures of 3-55. Westgate made just 87 in response, with Abdul Rehman (29no) and Dakshina De Silva (26) the only players to make double figures. Jack Kilshaw was the standout bowler for the hosts with outstanding figures of 7-33. This week, Westgate’s first team face Shireshead at home in the second of the T20 games on Friday (6pm start) before they travel to Ambleside in the league on Saturday. The second team face another tough game as they face Penrith seconds at home on Saturday before taking on Trimpell on the Bank Holiday Monday at Cross Hill Park. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011155.0

Picture: Jonathan Barry A CITY councillor has warned residents not to pay for services which offer to fix bad TV signals near 4G network masts - as the problem can be solved for free. Cllr Stephen Hodgson, who represents Warndon Parish North at Worcester City Council, has received many reports of poor TV signals near to a mobile mast in Warndon. The problem stems from a mast opposite Haywain Avenue which now emits a 4G signal - meaning Freeview users now experience loss of sound, blank screens, no signal messages and constant freezing. Some frustrated viewers have paid to fix the issue unaware that a company called at800 offers free support to homes that watch TV through Freeview. Cllr Hodgson said the bulk of reports have come from a cluster of roads off Plantation Drive including Purleigh Avenue, Birchanger Green, Cangle Lane, Wryflatt, Burtree Avenue and Woolmead Row. ""I just want to make people aware that there is a company that will help them out if there signal is poor and they are affected by the new 4G signal from the mast,” he said. ""I\'ve been told that residents have been paying to sort this problem out and there really is no need for that."" You are more likely be affected if you live close to a new 4G mast, are in an area with weak digital television reception or have a TV signal booster. Satellite and cable services such as Sky and Virgin Media are not affected. 4G mobile signals transmit at 800 MHz which interferes with Freeview because the signal is transmitted through an aerial. Plans to modify the existing mast for a 4G signal were quickly accepted by the city council as not much work would be needed and it would bring faster network signal to the area. at800 also offers extra support for people who are 75 years of age or older, are registered blind or partially sighted or receive some benefits. Any viewers who experience interference should call at800 for free on 0808 1313 800 or visit at800.tv. Last Updated: Are you sure you want to delete this comment?

Pic Jonathan Barry WHAT'S the point of a grit bin, if there’s no grit in it? That’s the question that has sent Worcester resident Ian Parker to a variety of councillors and council officers without much success. Although it looks like a solution has been found. Mr Parker lives in St Audrie’s Road, a small cul-de-sac in Battenhall, which used to have a yellow county council grit bins many years ago, but that was taken away. When he asked for it to be restored, he was told that wouldn’t happen. Mr Parker said: “I spoke to Councillor Marc Bayliss, who said he could provide a bin from one of his funds. There was a question about who had to pay for the grit, but it turned up and was filled. “It wasn’t needed for a few years and people asked me what the point of having one was. But last year in the snowy weather we used it and kept the street clear. “But now we need the bin filled up again.” Mr Parker rang Worcestershire County Council but was told because his bin was green, and not yellow, it was not one of County Hall’s bins, and wasn’t even on the list. He said: “I spoke to Councillor Louis Stephen who rang around but didn’t get much of an answer. Then I spoke to Councillor Steve Mackay.” It seems that Cllr Mackay, who is both city and county councillor for the area and is Worcester mayor, managed to get to the bottom of the issue. For now. He said: “I think the city council is going to be taking on responsibility for these bins. “It probably helped that I have a foot in both camps of the city and county council. I am glad to have been able to help in this case.” A spokesman for Worcester City Council confirmed that the authority was going to refill the bin this week. It is understood that discussions between Worcestershire County Council and Worcester City Council regarding responsibility for refilling grit bins in general are ongoing.

Picture Jonathan Barry THE Met Office has warned people not to be lulled into a false sense of security by the warmer weather - as temperatures are set to plummet in the coming days. The forecasting agency has even said a long spell of colder weather could see snow in Worcestershire next week. The Met Office says it has recorded a sudden rise in temperatures at the North Pole, which usually triggers a phenomenon known as a polar vortex that leads to a cold weather spell. Professor Adam Scaife, of the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “Signs of this event appeared in forecasts from late January and in the last few days we have seen a dramatic rise in air temperature, known as a Sudden Stratospheric Warming, at around 30km above the North Pole. ""This warming results from a breakdown of the usual high-altitude westerly winds and it often leads to a switch in our weather, with cold easterly conditions more likely to dominate subsequent UK weather.” Met Office computer simulations is predicting snow across the UK in late February as a direct result of the events at the North Pole. Frank Saunders, chief operational meteorologist at the Met Office, added: “The outcome for the UK’s weather is still uncertain, but forecasts from computer models at the Met Office and at other centres are beginning to coalesce around a greater likelihood of cold conditions in the days and weeks to come.” Forecasters are predicting temperatures to begin dropping below freezing in the county from Thursday, reaching as low as -3C over the weekend and into next week. Snow showers are currently forecast for Worcestershire for the middle of next week.

Youngsters enjoyed traditional party games, a treasure hunt to find gold coins and a special celebration cake embossed with the nursery’s teddy bear logo. The setting opened its doors in 1968 and has been in operation at the same site at St Martin’s Parish Centre, Victoria Avenue for 50 years. Manager Fliss Rothery said: “London Road is one of the longest-serving early years settings in Worcester and 50 years is certainly an achievement to be recognised and celebrated.

The proposed site of the new Worcester City FC at Parsonage Way. Picture: Jonathan Barry. THE Worcestershire FA will not be making any capital investment in Worcester City’s Parsonage Way project – but is prepared to back the club's quest for grant funding. That’s the message from chief executive Nichola Trigg, who confirmed the county association remains in talks over holding the head lease at the proposed site. It would see the Worcestershire FA provide a back-to-back lease to City for the plot owned by Worcester City Council with the club then taking responsibility for managing the facility. “We have been asked by the council to consider holding the lease,” said Trigg. “Nothing has been signed and like anything, it is subject to the detail but we have certainly not refused to. We are holding discussions and they are not negative. “We have seen draft heads of terms and remain in dialogue with the council and the club. We would always look to support football in the community and from our understanding, Parsonage Way would have a significant element of community use.” One of the prevailing questions over the project has been how much it will cost with the club officials stating that work continues on tweaks to its initial plans and estimates for the work. On the funding of the project, Trigg added: “We will support the club through the process of any grant applications it is eligible for but will not be contributing any finances. Our only formal involvement is potentially holding the head lease. “Most clubs that apply for grants, particularly those that go to the Football Foundation or the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, usually ask for our involvement. “If they go directly they would effectively come back to us for review and consideration anyway. “Until a grant application is submitted it would be impossible for me to comment on whether it is viable or otherwise. “Although we are not particularly close to the application, more the lease and any potential grant application, I know it is in phases but Worcester City is a privately-run club and it is their project. “A number of projects cross our desks for grant applications. Some never get off the ground, others fly through. It depends on the affordability and whether it complies with the grant requirements.” Last Updated: Are you sure you want to delete this comment?

Pic Jonathan Barry 27.2.18. WORCESTERSHIRE has so far dodged the heavy snowfall delivered elsewhere in the UK by the Beast from the East, but it looks like it will arrive today. Snow fell on the county yesterday, leaving a light dusting in places as temperatures fell to a low of -6C. However the Met Office\'s previous yellow warnings are upgraded to amber from noon today, meaning heavy snow is expected. The Met Office warning says: ""A spell of heavy snow is expected to move north through Thursday afternoon and evening. ""Some places could see significant ice build up overnight into Friday. ""The snow is likely to be accompanied by strong easterly winds. ""Long delays and cancellations to public transport is expected, whilst some roads may become blocked by deep snow, stranding vehicles and passengers. ""Long interruptions to power supplies and other utilities are likely to occur."" The forecast is for light snow throughout today, which will start properly settling at lunchtime, and will turn into heavy snow in the early hours of tomorrow morning. Temperatures today are not expected to get above -1C, and fall to a low of -4C. With the wind, forecasters warn the feels-like temperature will be at -12C. Worcestershire County Council highways tweeted to say it was preparing for the snowfall by gritting overnight, and fitting snowploughs ready for action. Elsewhere the Met Office, for only the second time ever, issued a red warning. The warning, for Scotland, is forecasting extreme weather which is likely to pose a risk to life and cause widespread disruption, and damage.

Picture: JONATHAN BARRY ALEX Gidman is returning as second XI coach for the final piece in the jigsaw of the restructured set-up at Worcestershire. He will slot into the role after Matt Mason’s departure and the promotion of Kevin Sharp to head coach. It follows January\'s appointment of Alan Richardson as head bowling coach. Gidman joined the County from Gloucestershire, where he skippered the side for four years, for the 2015 season on a two-year contract but retired with a finger injury the following winter. He has since become an elite performance, leadership and cricket coach. Gidman, 36, has worked in sport and business developing areas such as resilience, creating a positive culture and dealing with pressure. He has combined his own experiences — psychology, which he’s studying, and neuro linguistic programmes to create workshops and programmes to assist team and individual development. Sharp said: “I\'m delighted for us and for Alex. He quite clearly wants to get back into the game as a coach. He made that very clear in his interview. “He is a wise man, a smart man and has got captaincy experience. He is an outside-of-the-box thinker and I’ve always enjoyed that with Alex. “He will complement our coaching team and bring a dynamic to it, a way of thinking, that will challenge us. That is just brilliant. “The lads will be delighted with his appointment. It will motivate the group enormously.” County vice-chairman Tim Curtis, who headed up the team making new appointments this winter, said: “It is a really outstanding appointment with real potential to add additional quality to the whole coaching set-up. “He is a person with a hunger for learning and understanding as much about what makes people be successful and thrive under pressure. “He is delighted to be back. Obviously his spell here and his career was cut short through injury but he is relishing working at the club in a different capacity.” Gidman, who coached the MCC Young Cricketers last summer, said: “I’m very happy, really excited and looking forward to starting with the group and hopefully assisting them in achieving their team and personal goals. “Getting back into the professional game was always something I’d have liked to have done. ""Opportunities don’t come around very often. I’ve put in a lot of work and learnt a lot in order to try to make myself a better coach. “I’ve learnt a lot away from cricket which I think has been very helpful and developed me as a person and a coach. “So once this opportunity came up I gave it a go and felt I was in a good position to offer something to the group. I’m grateful to have been given the opportunity. “There is no doubt I built some good relationships with the players when I was playing but that was a long time ago now. “A lot has changed. I’ve changed as a person and this is a completely different role. “However, it’s nice to have an understanding of some of the players\' characters and technical work. It’s a really exciting opportunity.” High Wycombe-born Gidman scored 11,622 first-class runs at an average of 36.31 with 24 hundreds plus 4,473 List A runs and took 103 wickets. He passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season six times and was part of the successful Gloucestershire one-day side in the 2000s. Gidman was appointed England A captain for the 2003-2004 tour of India and Malaysia. He had to withdraw with a hand injury but did tour Sri Lanka 12 months later and was in the preliminary England squad for the 2004 Champions Trophy.

Pic Jonathan Barry 7.3.18. A WOMAN was refused a partial refund on her weekly bus ticket after buses were suspended due to recent bad weather. April Holmes says the refusal is unfair as she was unable to use the ticket. However, a spokesman for First Buses said the company was surprised to receive the refund request and will not pay the money back. Mrs Holmes lives in Linden Road and relies on the buses to make a journey to and from her shift work at Regents Care Home in St John’s. She buys a £14 weekly ticket to cover the cost of her weekly bus journeys. The 55-year-old said she was on a shift last Thursday when colleagues told her the buses had been suspended, after the heavy snowfall. Mrs Holmes said: “I got a taxi home, it cost me £10.” She was due to work her next shift on Saturday but was unable to make it in after realising the buses were suspended all day. Mrs Holmes said: “I asked my husband, Norman, to see if I could have a partial refund - like they do with trains. He called on Monday and after waiting 45 minutes, they said simply they don’t refund on tickets and we would have to do it as a complaint. “I’m obviously not blaming First Buses for suspending buses, but it is just the fairness. They are adamant they don’t refund, but £14 is a lot of money to me. I’m doing 21 hours a week, and I’m only on minimum wage. “Myself and my husband don’t drive, so I have to rely on the buses. This makes me lose faith.” Sarah East, head of operations, First Worcester, apologised for any inconvenience but added: “Our drivers did a fantastic job keeping our buses running for as long as they did and received many commendations from customers for their efforts in getting them to their destinations and keeping them safe. “I am surprised that a request has been forwarded to refund a journey that did not run due to the heavy snow fall, as this is totally out of our control and not something we can be held responsible.

""The area is marked for housing in the South Worcestershire Development Plan. ""It worries me that a 70 miles an hour road is at the end of this road. I think it should still be 40 there. ""I believe it is imperative that the footbridge is built before work on houses begins. We must make the best of a bad job.

Cllr Tony Miller also called for the footbridge to be built before housing work was completed also describing the houses as having ""unimaginative designs.""

A grassed bund is located between the A4440 Swinesherd Way and the west of the site. The proposal includes the provision of 68 open market houses and 45 affordable houses.

Could a new medical school be on the way? Picture: Jonathan Barry A MULTI-million pound medical school at the University of Worcester has moved a step closer, but it is likely to be a few years before the major project comes to fruition. The Worcester News first reported on the plans a year ago, and the university has now launched its formal application to the General Medical Council (GMC) for the creation of the school to serve the Three Counties including Worcestershire. Currently the closest medical schools to the county are in Birmingham and Bristol, with both areas tending to be where most of the newly qualified doctors settle. The university\'s Board of Governors unanimously approved the application at their mid-March meeting, following a year of preparations, including an independent audit. The final touches to the application are now underway before formal submission to the GMC by the end of March, where it will begin the standard in-depth scrutiny and accreditation process that always applies to applications for a new medical school. This process normally takes at least two years. During the preparatory work the six local trusts, including Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, showed support for the project, including providing placements for medical students. Medical practitioners in the Three Counties and surrounding areas also expressed desire to become involved. Last year the Government announced plans for a significant expansion of doctors, with an extra 1,000 training places available across England from 2018. The University of Worcester applied for 100 places for the new medical school in the national competition, with the initial results reported today. The round was oversubscribed, with applications for 2,400 places, and the university reports it missed out as ""this opportunity came too early in the accreditation process for Worcester"". However, assuming that the national shortage of medical doctors will lead to the creation of more places in the next two to three years, the university expects Worcester to be in a ""more stronger place to apply"" providing the application for accreditation by the GMC is successful. The official letter received by the university says: “The Government has indicated that the numbers allocated through this expansion process are intended to address current recognised shortages, so there remains scope for a further expansion of medical places to be agreed in order to meet future workforce planning need. ""We would therefore encourage you to be mindful of the potential for such policy development and to consider bidding again should further opportunities arise to apply for additional medical places.” Professor David Green, University of Worcester\'s vice chancellor and chief executive, said: “Creating the Three Counties Medical School to serve the people of this region and beyond is a major investment. ""The accreditation process rightly takes several years. The university is fully committed to this development and is very confident that, together with our trust partners, we will be successful in the early 2020s. ""As well as working through the necessary scrutiny by the GMC, the university plans to increase its work in relevant research areas in which we are already very strong including bipolar disorder and dementia. ""We are also increasing our work in subjects allied to medicine, including nursing, where we enjoy an outstanding reputation for quality and innovation. “We are very grateful for all of the support from the medical profession, health educators, trusts and sister universities that we have already received. Our concentration over the next period will be to work together to earn the necessary recognition from the GMC. “There is a serious shortage of doctors in many rural areas as well as in the acute hospitals. “The formal submission of our application to the GMC is a significant commitment for the university. More importantly, it is a potentially life-enhancing development for the people of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire, a region which currently lacks a medical school and which is battling an ever-growing shortage of general practitioners and other highly trained physicians.” Last Updated: Are you sure you want to delete this comment?

Pic Jonathan Barry 29.1.18. WORCESTERSHIRE has some of the best kept roads in the West Midlands, new figures show. Three per cent of the county’s A roads needed fixing in 2016/17 putting them in equal fourth out of 14 local authorities in the West Midlands - despite having the second largest amount of A roads. Figures provided by the BBC Shared Data Unit showed the state of Worcestershire’s roads over the past eight years and how much of our roads has needed attention. Around five per cent of Worcestershire’s A roads needed fixing in 2009/10, a figure that fell to four per cent in 2010/11 and remained at that percentage in 2011/12. The amount of road needed to be fixed fell by one per cent in 2012/13 and has remained at that level. Three per cent of the 466.3km of A road in Worcestershire needed fixing last year - equal to almost 14km. Over eight years, the amount of road needing attention fell by two per cent. The figures for Worcestershire’s 3,681km of minor roads paint a similar picture despite rising by one per cent last year. Around 147km of the county’s minor roads, B, C and unclassified, needed fixing last year - equal to four per cent. It is a sharp decline from 2012/13 when ten per cent of the county’s minor roads were in need of attention. The state of Worcestershire’s roads is also a sharp contrast to the figures for neighbouring Herefordshire. Almost 23km of A roads in Herefordshire needed fixing last year - a total of six per cent. A Worcestershire County Council spokesman said: ""In Worcestershire, we have some of the best roads and this is something that has been recognised recently by the Department for Transport. ""It is important that we continue to prioritise the quality of Worcestershire\'s roads. ""We are investing millions of pounds into reducing congestion, through various countywide initiatives to keep Worcestershire moving and our Highways team do an excellent job of repairing roads all year round using a variety of maintenance techniques.""

Picture by Jonathan Barry A new leader of Worcester City Council could be in position as soon as next Tuesday. Conservative Councillor Chris Mitchell has put forward a motion, which if passed, would see his leader, Councillor Marc Bayliss installed in the top job. Currently Cllr Bayliss is the deputy leader of the council, with Labour’s Councillor Adrian Gregson as leader. Cllr Mitchell’s motion says: “In order to reflect the democratic will of the people, in the event of a hung council,the leader of the council is drawn from the largest group and the deputy leader of the council is drawn from the second largest group.” The Conservatives are the largest group with 17 councillors, but Cllr Gregson was kept on as leader by 16 Labour and two Green councillors. But since Labour councillor for Warndon, Elaine Williams resigned last week, Labour only have 15 councillors. That could see a tie on the motion, but Conservative mayor Steve Mackay would have the casting vote. Cllr Mitchell said: “We suggested a year ago that the leader should be from the largest party, or a joint leader system, but the Labour Party and the Greens weren’t interested. If it is passed then we should remove the leader and deputy leader then and there and vote new ones in.” The council’s current leader Adrian Gregson said: “They’re playing political games. It’s the last council before the election. They’re doing it because they think they can because we’ve lost a councillor.” But Cllr Bayliss said: “It would reflect the political make-up of the council, but I’d be very happy if a consensus emerged around having joint leaders.” The meeting is at 7pm on Tuesday 27 March at the Guildhall. Mrs Williams stepped down for personal reasons and did so now in order to allow a by-election to be held at the same time as city council elections on May 3.

DID you spot our April Fool’s yesterday? We reported how dog owners had been warned to keep their pets on a lead when walking by the river Severn in the city, following fears a giant predatory catfish was on the prowl. We detailed how the Wels catfish had devoured Ron Greller’s dog Archie and how he described it as like something from another “tunaverse”. Gary Prosser said on our Facebook page: “I’ll be completely honest, I initially fell for the headline. Hook, line and sinker, if you will.” Char Willmott said: “Man I keep falling for everything n thinking its just a really mad day - leave me alone.” Phil Goodall commented: “ Haha, sounds fishy to me, nearly caught us trout with that one.” While Carol Heath pointed out “several reliable fishermen” have hooked something very large whilst fishing the Diglis area and said it could be a ""catfish"". Here is the original story: DOG owners have been warned to keep their pets on a lead when walking by the river, following fears that a giant predatory catfish is on the prowl. For one small dog, a Jack Russell called Archie, it seems as if the warning has come far too late, according to his distressed owner, Mr Ron Greller of St John\'s. Mr Greller claims a giant killer fish attacked Archie and dragged him down into the water, while the dog was swimming happily among the swans, last Friday (March 23). Mr Geller said: ""I was just walking Archie last Friday and I codn\'t believe what was happening. I tried to mullet over but this thing was off the scale. ""I\'m a bit of an aficionado when it comes to the animal kingdom but I\'ve never seen anything like it. It was like something from another tunaverse. ""I don\'t like to see that sort of violence happening to animals especially my little Archie, I\'m a lifelong pacifisht. ""That beast has no plaice in this city."" Mr Greller was able to provide a sketch of the creature which devoured his pet, and experts at West Mercia Police have identified it as a giant Wels catfish - a creature that can grow to over 200lbs in weight, even in UK waters. The Wels catfish, which thrives in large rivers, is not native to the UK; but it has been introduced by anglers, because the fish can grow to such an enormous size. In France and elsewhere, the Wels catfish has been filmed snatching hapless pigeons from the river bank - but attacks on small dogs are still relatively rare.

John said he has designed Rise as a complement to the gym, Fit3Sixty, he already runs at Shrub Hill: “We wanted to offer something a bit different. “This is one-to-one training with a trainer and very small groups. We wanted to put a gym very near the centre of the city so that people can use it as part of their day. We wanted to make it easy for people to come in before work or at lunchtime or before they set off for home.” Rather than being open for customers to turn up at any time, like a large commercial gym, Rise has specific bookable sessions, so that numbers in the small space are kept manageable. There are specific ‘lunchtime express’ sessions of 45 minutes at 12/15 and 1pm to allow workers to get away from their desk and get some exercise. But, John says, don’t be afraid if you haven’t been to a gym before, or for a long time. He added: “People sometimes feel they have to get in shape before they go to a gym because they’ll feel embarrassed, or they’ll be laughed at because they don’t know what they’re doing. “That’s not us at all. We are very friendly and supportive whether you’re new or nervous or are a regular at the gym. We aim to make it a really enjoyable experience. If people enjoy themselves then they’re much more likely to come back and make it part of their routine rather than if they have to force themselves.” Exercise plans can be tailored by the coaches and instructors to individual customers’ needs and include both weights and cardio-vascular exercise. John said: “All our training uses weight-training in some form .We’ll give full instruction and support for those who’ve never lifted weights before, and there’s cardio equipment as well to give an all-round work-out. There’s a seminar session to discuss programmes with the coaches.” Rise is open four days a week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and has specific bookable sessions running 45, 60 or 90 minutes. As the gym has just opened it’s offering new customers an unlimited trial month.

A COUNCILLOR wants to plant fruit trees at the county council’s headquarters as part of a drive to boost healthy eating. Cllr Richard Udall hopes to turn council-owned land, including that around County Hall, into community orchards, where people could pick their own fruit for free. He plans to schedule a vote on his proposal at the next Worcestershire County Council meeting on May 17. Cllr Udall said: “I want to see apple and pear trees planted at County Hall and at many other council-owned land and picnic sites. “We have a duty to promote healthy lifestyles, to promote healthy eating and to encourage local produce. “Allowing local people to harvest fruit from local authority owned trees is a great idea which could help us to help those suffering from austerity and to provide free food. “Anything we can do to encourage healthy eating, to help people to afford healthy fruit and vegetables, has to be a good idea. We have the land, we have the ability to do it, so let’s give it a go.” Cllr Udall, Labour’s local rural affairs spokesman, added that residents have called for more fruit trees in public places. He said locals would be able to pick free fruit from the trees, under the plans, and said that the idea had been implemented elsewhere in the country. However John Smith, county council cabinet member for health and wellbeing, said: “It’s not something I get too excited about. “Anything like that is a fairly long-term project, it will be five or six years before they bear any fruit. “There’s lots of places they can plant but I don’t think County Hall is the appropriate place. “I like the open spaces at County Hall and the county park - where people walk.” The councillor added that people are able to exercise on the land around County Hall. Worcestershire County Council owns sites and parks near Knightwick, Bewdley, Eckington, Elmley Castle, Broadway, Hartlebury, Fladbury, Pershore, Droitwich, Malvern Wells, Rubery, near Birmingham, Stourport, and Worcester.

Picture: JONATHAN BARRY WORCESTERSHIRE captain Joe Leach lifts the lid on his thoughts going into the new Specsavers County Championship season. WE are really excited to be heading into the new season. It is a step up in standard in Division One but one we look forward to making. We want to finish as high up in the table as we possibly can and establish ourselves as a top-flight side. This group is more established in first-class cricket. There is more experience and I think we can take real confidence from the fact we won Division Two last year. The club have won promotion as the second-placed team in the past but winning the title was a confidence boost for everyone involved and I feel we can take that forward into this year. We feel like we belong now. Before, we might have gone into it with a bit of a survival attitude but this time we want to give it a really good crack and see where it takes us. There is more strength in depth in Division One. At the lower end of Division Two, there are more beatable teams but anyone can beat anyone at this level. It is a scrap for the whole season, a very competitive standard with a quarter of the teams getting relegated at the end. There is something on every game all the way through and that’s not always the case in the second tier. We want to be challenging and looking to win one of the white-ball competitions. The way we played our 50-over cricket last year, dominating the north group, suggests we have a chance of doing that. In the four-day cricket, we will simply look to finish as high as we can. I don’t want to say avoid relegation because I think that would be a negative mindset. I also don’t want to say we’re looking to win it because it is all about taking one game at a time, winning as many as we can and seeing where that takes us. If we can build some momentum in the early part of the season in the same way we did last year then it will stand us in really good stead. The way the season is mapped out, there is a five-week block where we could put ourselves in a really good position. The young side you saw two or three years ago still has that youthful energy but with the clout to match it now. I think exciting times lie ahead.

Photo: Jonathan Barry A GANG which stole more than £14,000 of cigarettes was caught after one of the burglars left his wallet in a Worcester shop during a bungled raid. Costel Coclea, Adrian Dragoiu and Marius Stoican all admitted playing a role in the targeted raids which happened across the country but included shop burglaries in Worcester and Pershore. Dragoiu admitted eight counts of burglary while Coclea and Stoican admitted two each when they appeared at Worcester Crown Court on Friday. One of the raids involving Dragoiu and others happened at the Costcutter in Ankerage Green, Warndon Villages, Worcester on April 27 last year. Omar Majid, prosecuting, said: “Two men went into the shop and distracted the staff by asking a number of questions. At the time there was a large delivery of cigarettes being put away. As one of the males asked for some milk another picked up a box containing £2,800 of cigarettes. “Mr Dragoiu left his wallet and identification in the store which assisted in his identification.” Speaking after the hearing, shop manager Jamie Johns said she spotted the wallet on the floor two hours after the raid, initially thinking it belonged to a customer. It was only later she realised it belonged to one of the burglars, after finding it contained Dragoiu’s ID card, birth certificate and flight details. Another raid followed at a Co-op in Worcester on May 17 last year, this time involving four men, of one of which was Dragoiu. Two of the men distracted staff by asking for razor blades while another leaned over the counter and grabbed a large bag of cigarettes valued at around £1,000. But they were stopped from taking them. Another raid involving Dragoiu followed at a Co-op in New Road, Rubery, also on May 17 last year. Around £2,500 cigarettes were stolen. Staff only realised the following day after watching CCTV. Among the other burglaries, there was one involving Dragoiu, Coclea and Stoican in Pershore on August 21 last year. Dragoiu climbed over the counter and dislodged the till drawer in the process. The value of the cigarettes stolen was up to £400. Mark Sheward, for Dragoiu, said the job he had been offered in a car wash was ‘close to slavery’, paying derisory sums of money. Dragoiu, 23, of Pretoria Road, Bordesley Green, Birmingham was jailed for three years and Coclea, aged 25, and Stoican, aged 24, both of Pretoria Road, Bordesley Green, were jailed for 18 months. Jamie Johns, the manager of the Warndon Villages Costcutter, said: “What a silly thief. What kind of thief drops their wallet?” Since the raid the shop has installed more and better cameras.

Pic Jonathan Barry 4.3.16 0916014808. PERSHORE Choral Society is to dedicate its forthcoming performance of one of the greatest classical requiems ever written to its former conductor who has died from a brain tumour just three days before his 50th birthday. Andrew Wilson, was the choir’s musical director from 2000 to 2006, while also holding the post of organist and choirmaster at Great Malvern Priory and working as an examiner, composer, recitalist and adjudicator. The choir is to mark his passing by dedicating to him its performance of Mozart’s magnificent Requiem in D Minor in Pershore Abbey on Saturday, May 12. “We were already well into rehearsals of the requiem when we were informed of Andrew’s sad and unexpected death and our current musical director, Carleton Etherington, immediately suggested dedicating our performance to him,” said Ron Haden, chairman of Pershore Choral. “It was a natural thing to do. What better way could there be to show our gratitude for everything Andrew did for the choir than to sing this hauntingly tragic and dramatic work just for him? “Andrew played an important part in our development as a leading Worcestershire choir and he took us to new heights before leaving to further his musical career elsewhere.” Mozart, whose health was failing rapidly, worked feverishly on the Requiem throughout 1791, but died at the age of 35 when he had completed only two-thirds of it and the piece was finally finished by one of his pupils. His widow, Constanze, claimed that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the work for his own funeral and that it had been commissioned anonymously through a mysterious messenger who kept appearing unannounced as if he were haunting the composer. The concert also includes Mozart’s Coronation Mass in C Major, first performed in Salzburg on Easter Day 1779, and the anthems Ave Verum Corpus and Tantum Ergo.

Johnathan Barry, 38, of White Springs, suffered a heart attack on March 25 and was back at work 10 days later. “This is one of those success stories we don’t see often,” said Tommy Cochran, flight nurse. Cochran said the statistics of Barry surviving were slim. Flight medic Anthony Reid gives Jonathan Barry a tour of the helicopter he flew in. Barry said he was at home that evening when he thought he was having a heart attack. He called 9-1-1 communications and Hamilton County EMS responded. When they confirmed he was having a heart attack, life flight was called to transport him to North Florida Regional Medical Center. Barry passed out before the helicopter arrived. Flight medic Lee Cassels, Cochran and pilot Doug Bear of Air Methods responded to the call. “I remember waking up and asking Cochran not to cut off my shirt,” Barry said. Barry said he was told that he died several times and was brought back during the flight. At North Florida Regional, Barry received a sting inside his stent. This was his fourth heart attack within two years. His previous heart attack was only four months prior. “A lot of it is due to stress and smoking,” Barry said. He said he is working hard to quit smoking. Barry called the emergency personnel that responded to his 9-1-1 call, lifesavers. “I could never express my gratitude for these guys,” Barry said Family friend Leighton Mullis said she was thankful they responded quickly.

The two comedies are “Welcome to the Neighborhood,” about the “nicest guy in the Midwest” who moves his family to a rough neighborhood in Los Angeles, and an untitled show starring Damon Wayans Jr. The network has also formally given the go-ahead to “FBI,” a drama that got a straight-to-series order during development season. “Welcome to the Neighborhood” stars Josh Lawson (“Superstore,” “House of Lies”) as the above-described nice guy. His new neighbors are not used to his super-friendly ways. The cast also includes Cedric the Entertainer, Dreama Walker, Tichina Arnold, Sheaun McKinney, Marcel Spears and Hank Greenspan. “Big Bang Theory” veteran Jim Reynolds created the series, and James Burrows directed the pilot. The Damon Wayans Jr. show is inspired by executive producer Ben Winston (“The Late Late Show”), who for a time had pop star Harry Styles as a housemate while One Direction was rising to fame. Styles wasn’t involved in the pilot process but is now attached as an EP. The show will center on a married couple played by Wayans and Amber Stevens West (“The Carmichael Show”), who “reconnect with their younger, cooler selves” when a young pop star (Australian actor Felix Mallard) moves in with them. Chris Parnell also stars. Austen Earl (“9JKL”) and Tim McAuliffe (“The Last Man on Earth”) created the show and executive produce with Winston, pilot director Phill Lewis, Michael Rotenberg and Jonathan Barry. “FBI” comes from “Law & Order” producer Dick Wolf and writer Craig Turk (“The Good Wife”) and follows agents in the bureau’s New York office.

If the program is successful, the goal is to take it beyond the Saint John area to all of Canada. “We hope it will then broaden out in New Brunswick, which it looks like it’s going to happen. Then Food Allergy Canada is going to take it national,” said Barry, in an interview with Huddle. “The idea will be to basically have it in the same format that can be delivered to schools in assembly-style in 30 minutes, with a very minimal number of volunteers needed because the video does a lot of the work.” Barry, the director of strategic development at T4G, says his involvement in the Sweet Caroline Foundation stems from a very personal connection. “Caroline’s mom, Janet, and I grew up together since we were five or six-years-old,” said Barry. “Janet herself has severe allergies, so certainly my first experience with severe allergic reactions was with Janet.” After his family moved back to Rothesay from Toronto, the old friends reconnected, and Barry’s daughters became friends with Caroline and her sister Katherine. The video has already received an outpouring of positive comment on social media, with many saying it was informative and/or that they are thankful someone is bringing the topic into the spotlight. “If it can save even one life, then we’ve done what we wanted to do,” says Barry.

Picture: Jonathan Barry WORCESTERSHIRE residents are set to enjoy summer-like weather again, as temperatures are set to reach above 20C in the early part of next week. Another ‘mini heatwave’ has been forecast for Monday and Tuesday - which is expected to be the warmest day of next week. Forecasters say the temperatures are to rise up to 8C above normal for this time of year due to warm air from the south dislodging the cool and unsettled westerly airflow of recent days. The forecast for Monday is for it to be sunny and breezy, reaching a high of 20C, and on Tuesday temperatures could get up to 22C. There will be plenty of sunshine, and UV levels will rise. Hayfever and asthma sufferers are also being warned there will also be a higher pollen count. But residents are advised to take advantage of the sun as the heatwave is not expected to stick around with temperatures dropping to 14C on Wednesday, and are unlikely to get above 18C for the rest of next week.

THE CITY’S MP has repeated his opposition to a second inquiry into press behaviour after it was voted on for the second time in a week. MP’s rejected an amendment made by the House of Lords yesterday (May 15) which called for a further look into press standards. Robin Walker, MP for Worcester, said: “I hope the message is now clear. “I think the question is whether a Levson 2 would really add anything to the understanding we already have of the issues. “We have had the inquiry, we have had the investigations and we have had the criminal trials. “All of those have led, quite rightly, to some significant changes. “I think what we don’t want is for anything to lead to statutory regulation."" MPs first rejected an amendment to launch a new inquiry during a debate on the Data Protection Bill last Wednesday (May 9). In debating the Bill, the House of Lords passed an amendment on Monday (May 14) which would have set up the second part of the Leveson inquiry. MPs threw out those changes, voting 301-289 in favour of a government amendment overturning the Lords result. Mr Walker said he was glad the Labour frontbench “dropped their attack on press freedom” after abandoning the section 40 amendment which would mean newspapers would be forced to pay claimant’s legal – whether they won or not. Mr Walker called the section 40 measures “totally unacceptable”. Mr Walker also questioned the role of the House of Lords in the debate as the Bill \'ping-ponged\' between the two chambers. ""I also think there is a constitutional question,"" he said. ""If something has been passed then that should really be the end of it and the Lords should just not keep sending it back.""

CALLUM Ferguson will fill the void at Worcestershire left by Travis Head's international call-up. Head has been drafted in by Australia to prepare for the forthcoming ODI Series with hosts England and will temporarily part company with his adopted county after Sunday’s Royal London One-Day Cup match against Lancashire at New Road. Ferguson will now slot into the overseas player spot for the final four North Group games and be available should Worcestershire reach the quarter-final or semi-final. He had originally been scheduled to play the final North Group game which would have made him eligible for the knockout stages. With Australia having also arranged a mini T20 tour of Zimbabwe, Ferguson will also replace Head for the opening three Vitality Blast games and return for the final six group matches after the departure of Martin Guptill. Worcestershire head coach Kevin Sharp said: “Callum will play the four One-Day Cup games that Travis would have played in – and if we qualify he will eligible for the quarter-finals and semi-finals. “He will also play the first three T20s when Travis is away in Zimbabwe and then comes back when Martin has gone. Callum has arrived, met the lads already, trained with us and settled in well.” Ferguson has played 30 ODIs, three T20Is and one test for Australia. He was part of the Sydney Thunder side in the Big Bash and ended the Sheffield Shield programme with South Australia in good form, scoring 51 versus Tasmania and 92 against West Australia. When not on county duty, Ferguson will play for Ombersley in the Birmingham & District Premier Cricket League. Worcestershire travel to Yorkshire in the Royal London One-Day Cup tomorrow (11am).

The Normandy, Missouri, fisherman was participating in the annual Midwest Fish Tournament\'s Big Bass Bash on Sunday at Lake of the Ozarks when he hooked a 7.59-pound largemouth bass with a spinner lure. Unlike many tournaments where an angler\'s best five fish are weighed, the Big Bass Bash pays prize money for an angler\'s single-biggest fish. ""We had over 3,000 anglers from 30 states this weekend,"" said Charlie Terrell, an owner and organizer of the tournament. ""John\'s strictly an amateur — he was fishing from a 20-year-old Stratos boat on the Niangua arm of the lake when he hooked it. He was pretty excited when he came in. He was almost crying and almost passed out when he won."" Terrell said there was high drama during the weigh-in. There are four time slots that anglers can fish, and on the very first day of the tournament on Saturday, Mike Roberts of Oak Grove, Missouri, brought in a 7.44-pound bass that looked like it might win the whole event.

The fourth-place fish weighed 7.26 pounds and was caught by St. Peters angler David Bono. Odom\'s winning fish was the second largest bass ever caught during the six-year-old tournament.

Terrell is being recognized as a National Merit Finalist. ""Charlie is a phenomenal student,"" Dickerson said. ""He came to us a few years ago and has been top notch ever since."" Thanks to the National Merit recognition, numerous doors have opened for Terrell. ""I take as many hard classes as I can,"" he said. ""It\'s not as much preparation for test itself, but trying to learn everything I can in high school."" Even though Terrell is a Hamilton Lion, he spend most of his time taking classes at the Advanced Learning Center in Becker. That hard work is paying off. He was recognized as a STAR student, having the highest ACT score of 33. Star students are recognized in Jackson with their STAR teacher. ""The teacher you think impacts your education the most, so I chose my mom,"" he said. When Charlie is not hitting the books, he is active in the Future Farmers of America, developing his leadership skills and business savvy. He is also on the Quiz Bowl team, similar to the show ""Jeopardy,"" which requires in-depth study of various subjects. This fall, he plans to attend Mississippi State University on a full scholarship to study chemical engineering. ""At Mississippi State, there are co-op programs,"" he said.

A New Jersey optometrist who operated several Southwestern Pennsylvania vision centers will spend nearly three years in federal prison for committing up to a half-million dollars worth of health care fraud, according to U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. A judge on Monday sentenced Dr. Vincent J. Gamuzza, of Hazelet, N.J., to 33 months in prison and ordered him to pay a $25,000 fine. Gamuzza had pleaded guilty in September to health care fraud. Gamuzza operated 11 Pearle Vision center franchises both locally and in New Jersey, where he was in charge of all insurance billing, according to a release from Brady. Between December 2015 and July 2016, he submitted numerous fraudulent claims to Highmark, and in some instances submitted the same claims to both Highmark and its for-profit subsidiary, Davis Vision. Gamuzza submitted between $250,000 and $550,000 worth of false claims, Brady said. When investigators began investigating, he tried to cover his tracks by creating fake treatment records. In addition to the $25,000 fine, a judge ordered Gamuzza to pay $95,667 in restitution to Highmark and $3,333 to Davis. Megan Guza is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

The Trojans lost a handful of seniors but the eight returnees with state track experience under their feet are aiming to lead the army of Red and Black. Back for his 17th season to lead the team is Head Coach Mark Scott, who will be assisted by Timothy Kruckman. A good season In 2017, the Trojans had an abundance of athletes ready to step onto the oval and compete with 16 letter winners setting the example, including six seniors. The weather cooperated for much of the spring and Turkey Valley only seemed to get stronger as the season progressed. TV secured a third place finish with 78 points at the Upper Iowa Conference meet. The quartet of Mason Goerend, Cody Hackman, Wyatt Blazek and Cale Reicks collected a gold medal in the 4x200 relay and combined for silver in the 4x100 and sprint medley relays. In the 4x800 relay it was Elliot Dietzenbach, John Gossling, Jordon Snyder and Zach Gillen earning the UIC title. Earning bronze for the Trojans were Blazek in the 100-meter dash and Reicks in the 400-meter hurdles. The distance medley relay squad of Hackman, Kyle Langreck, Dietzenbach and Gillen also scored a third-place finish. At the state-qualifying meet a week later, the Trojans put together some strong performances, finishing fifth in the team standings and qualified seven events for the state meet. The 4x200 had the best finish at state, finishing seventh in 1:33.24. Members of the team were Will Einwalter, Hackman, C. Reicks and Blazek. The same quartet finished eighth in 1:37.59 in the sprint medley event. With a throw of 128’9”, Luke Anderson finished his junior season in 13th place at state. Blazek was on the track in the 100-meter dash and finished 14th in the prelims in 11.51 seconds. The 4x100 quartet finished in 18th in 45.61 seconds with members Evan Drilling, Hackman, C. Reicks and Blazek. Dietzenbach, Gossling, Snyder and Gillen also took the Blue Oval in the 4x800, taking 20th in 8:46.36. Graduating at the end of the year were Blazek, Dylan Bruess, Isaiah Drilling, Gossling, Hackman and Walker Leibold. Promising season ahead With a total of 29 athletes, including eight seniors who have all competed on the Blue Oval at state, gives the Trojans reason to believe that 2018 will be successful. Seniors guiding the underclassmen include Luke Anderson, Evan Drilling, Will Einwalter, Mason Goerend, Zach Gillen, Kyle Langreck, Cale Reicks and Jordon Snyder. Juniors looking to contribute include Jason Herold, Ryan Olson, Carter Reicks, James Schmitt, Billy Swestka and Jose Tinajero. Sophomores adding to the talent pool are Keegan Balk, Elliot Dietzenbach, Dylan Elsbernd, Isaac Franzen, Gage Gruenberg, Seth Huinker, Sam Kout, Kade Kruse, Ethan Leibold, Kannon Leuenberger, Eli Nymeyer, Eli Reicks, Brady Schmitt and Cole Vrzak. The lone freshman on the team is Kalvin Langreck. “We will have some experience in the running events and weight events,” noted Coach Scott. “As our young runners mature we will be competitive in the relays as well.” Scott said the squad will need to develop depth in the hurdle and jumping field events in order to be fully competitive. Highlighting the top of Scott’s list of favorites in the Upper Iowa Conference is South Winn, along with North Fayette Valley.', ""Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:30 pm U.S. Attorney Brady U.S. Attorney Powell PITTSBURGH — The manager of an opioid addiction treatment practice with locations in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh on charges of unlawfully dispensing controlled substances and health-care fraud. The indictment was announced Tuesday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania and U.S. Attorney Bill Powell of the Northern District of West Virginia. This indictment is the third in Western Pennsylvania since Sessions announced the formation of the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit. It’s a Department of Justice initiative that uses data to target and prosecute individuals who commit opioid-related health-care fraud. U.S. Attorney Brady U.S. Attorney Powell Charged in the four-count indictment is Christopher Handa, 47, of Pittsburgh. According to the indictment, Handa was an employee in charge of operations at Redirections Treatment Advocates LLC. The indictment alleges that Handa and others conspired to create and submit unlawful prescriptions for buprenorphine, known as Subutex and Suboxone, and then unlawfully dispensed those controlled substances to other persons. Handa is also charged with health-care fraud for allegedly causing fraudulent claims to be submitted to Medicaid for payments to cover the costs of the unlawfully prescribed buprenorphine. “Today we are facing the worst drug crisis in American history, with one American dying of a drug overdose every nine minutes,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “It’s incredible, but true, that some of our trusted medical professionals have chosen to violate their oaths and exploit this crisis for profit. Last summer, I sent a dozen of our top federal prosecutors to focus solely on the problem of opioid-related health-care fraud in places where the epidemic was at its worst — including Western Pennsylvania. These cases cut off the supply of drugs and stop fraudsters from exploiting vulnerable people. “Our prosecutors began issuing indictments back in October, and today we bring even more charges against those who allegedly defrauded the taxpayer while diverting potentially addictive drugs. We will file many more charges in the months to come, because the Department of Justice will be relentless in hunting down drug dealers and turning the tide of this epidemic,” Sessions said. Added Brady: “Because high quality, medication-assisted treatment is so essential to our opioid response, we must act rapidly and decisively to charge the unlawful diversion of buprenorphine. This indictment is the result of a well-coordinated investigation by the Western Pennsylvania Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, which is working to attack the opioid problem at its root: the diversion and overprescription of opioid painkillers.” And Powell said they’re “unified with our sister districts to combat those who believe they can hide behind professional services and violate the law. We will continue our joint effort to prosecute the opioid crisis at its very source.” Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert S. Cessar of the Western District of Pennsylvania and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah Wagner of the Northern District of West Virginia are prosecuting this case on behalf of the United States.

Christopher Handa, 47, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is named in a four-count indictment for unlawfully dispensing controlled substances and health care fraud. Handa, a manager at Redirections Treatment Advocates, LLC, is accused of conspiring to create and submit unlawful prescriptions for buprenorphine, also known as subutex or suboxone. Redirections Treatment Advocates, LLC is believed to have had locations in Washington and Bridgeville in Pennsylvania, plus sites in Morgantown, Moundsville, and Weirton. Buprenorphine can treat pain and addiction to narcotic pain relievers, but carries a high risk of addiction. Federal investigators searched six locations in five different cities Jan. 10, the Department of Justice confirmed Tuesday. A listing of the locations included sites in Morgantown, Moundsville, and Weirton. Handa is additionally accused of submitting fraudulent claims to Medicaid for payments to cover the costs of unlawfully prescribed buprenorphine. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania, and U.S. Attorney William J. Power of the Northern District of West Virginia issued a joint release to the media Tuesday. “We are unified with our sister districts to combat those who believe they can hide behind professional services and violate the law,” said Powell. “We will continue our joint effort to prosecute the opioid crisis at its very source.” Handa could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of all charges; including a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each of the two counts charging him with unlawfully dispensing buprenorphine, a Schedule III controlled substance; a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $1 million for the charge of conspiracy to unlawfully dispense a Schedule III controlled substance; and a maximum 10-year sentence and a fine of up $250,000 for one count of health care fraud. The indictment is the third in Western Pennsylvania since Sessions announced the formation of the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, which conducted the investigation.

A Pittsburgh man has been indicted by a federal grand jury after prosecutors say he used his position at a drug treatment facility to illegally dispense an opioid treatment drug. According to prosecutors, Christopher Handa, 47, while an employee in charge of operations with Redirections Treatment Advocates, an addiction treatment agency with facilities in Washington County and Weirton, West Virginia, conspired to “create and submit unlawful prescriptions for buprenorphine, known as Subutex and Suboxone, and then unlawfully dispensed those controlled substances to other persons.” Prosecutors also say that Handa filed fraudulent claims with Medicaid for payment to cover the cost of the illegally prescribed drugs. Handa has been charged with two counts of unlawfully dispensing a Schedule III controlled substance and a single count of health care fraud, which each carry a maximum fine of $250,000 or a 10 year prison sentence or both. He has also been charged with a single count of conspiracy to dispense a controlled substance, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million or 10 years in prison or both. Dr. Jennifer Hess, a counselor with Redirections, said that the organization has no comment on the indictment. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in the release, said that some medical professionals have chosen to exploit the opioid crisis — which he said kills an American every nine minutes — for profit and that his Department of Justice will continue to charge drug dealers wherever they are found. “Last summer, I sent a dozen of our top federal prosecutors to focus solely on the problem of opioid-related health care fraud in places where the epidemic was at its worst — including Western Pennsylvania,” he said. “These cases cut off the supply of drugs and stop fraudsters from exploiting vulnerable people.

They went unbeaten in last year's championship with no team even coming close to laying a glove on them. Their mind as on Leinster glory, which ultimately failed to materialise but with a good blend of youth and experience, they'll be the star they're all aiming to reign in again this year. THE FORMAT Durrow are the new team in this year having won the Senior B title last year, and along with Gracefield and Cappincur, they'll be the favourites to fall into the dreaded relegation battle. Beyond that, the usuals are there again - Rhode, Edenderry, Tullamore, Clara and Ferbane. The eight teams will face each other once in the round robin phase of the competition and like last year, the top two teams after that phase will go straight through to the semi-finals, where they won't be able to face one another. Their opponents will come from the four next highest placed teams with 3rd playing 6th and 4th playing 5th in the two knockout quarter-finals. They will then be draw to see who plays who in the semi-finals with the original top two teams unable to face one another. The final will once again be played in October. THE CONTENDERS Rhode The village club have been in superb form recently, and so far this year, have won all three of their senior league Division 1 games with consummate ease. The had ten points to spare over Edenderry, 19 over Gracefield and eight over Clara. It doesn't always pay to read too much into league fixtures at this time of the year as some teams will have been missing county stars, and in truth, Rhode aren't hugely represented on the county panel. Nevertheless, the likes of Anton Sullivan, Conor McNamee and Niall Darby returning will make a huge impact. Rhode still count the likes of Niall McNamee in their ranks and they're at least as strong as last year, if not stronger. They went unbeaten in last year's championship, eventually seeing off Clara by three points in the final. They are the undoubted class in the field and will be odds-on to collect title number 29. Tullamore With Johnny Maloney leading the charge for the town club, Tullamore will be a force to be reckoned with. They are a tight-fisted team that give away little in the way of scores. They've only given up an average of 11 points in their two league games this year and were similarly stingy in last year's championship. They'll have defensive talent of the ilk of Declan Hogan and Paul McConway to welcome back, and with both of those players performing well at county level, they'll be tough to break down. However, they have shown frailties, and despite reaching the quarter-final stage last year, they were surprise losers to Gracefield on a 2-8 to 0-8 scoreline. They'll have to improve massively to challenge, but one thing is for sure, they won't be an easy game for anyone. Edenderry Edenderry have a wealth of young talent in their ranks, including the likes of Jordan Hayes who made his breakthrough with the Offaly panel this year, but they didn't show that to good effect last year. They scraped into a quarter-final without really performing and yet again in that game failed to show up in a 1-11 to 0-9 loss to Clara. Nevertheless, the potential is there for the 2011 and 2015 champions, and they have been boosted by the return of Peter Brady as manager. The former Offaly star was at the helm on both of those occasions and will certainly get buy-in from his fellow Reds. The likes of Sean Pender and Richie Dalton could be considered veterans at this stage having been young guns in that shock 2011 success, and they will play an important role in galvinising others. They appear to have shown little interest in their early league games this term, losing both heavily to Rhode and Clara, but with the production line of talent at their disposal and Brady back in charge, they could put in a good showing. Clara The long-time bridesmaids of Offaly football and so often the runners-up, Clara have undoubted talent in their ranks, including the likes of Scott Brady and Offaly exile Graham Guilfoyle. Again, Clara are a shrewd outfit that gives up little in defence and very often get enough scores to get over the line in games. They've been a bugbear to the likes of Edenderry in recent years, but it's notable that they haven't secured the title since 2009. They're a team that have been on the road together a long time and will almost certainly grind their way to a semi-final spot. They were solid last year and eventually reached the final, but had come up short in the round robin phase in the bigger games against the likes of Rhode, Ferbane and Tullamore. They've lost to Tullamore and Rhode again in this year's league despite having all of their talent at their disposal, and may well find a couple of teams too good again. Ferbane Ferbane are the major improvers in Offaly over the last four or five years. They contested the final two years ago and were unlucky to lose out by just one point to Clara at the semi-final stage last year. The production line in Ferbane has been excpetional, producing the likes of Shane Nally and Cian Johnson. Johnson hasn't seen much senior action for Ferbane despite being part of Stephen Wallace's Offaly panel this year, but there is no doubt he'll feature this term. Despite still being a teenager, he can make enough of an impact to see Ferbane challenge highly for an automatic semi-final spot, or at the very least a quarter-final berth. They've also lost two of their early league fixtures, but there's no doubt they'll be a very different proposition come championship time. Cappincur Cappincur will most likely be fighting for their lives and Senior A status again this year having survived in the play-off against St. Rynagh's last season. They lost six of their seven championship games last year, but there were green shoots in their narrow one-point loss to Rhode in the round robin stage. However, they leaked far too many goals last year, including five against Ferbane and four against Clara, and are going to struggle again this time around. Their hope of survival is beating the new boys Durrow and hoping for an upset against one of the bigger teams. Gracefield should have enough to finish ahead of them again.

Scott,Brady,['http://dailycaller.com/2018/04/08/pennsylvania-family-of-five-fentanyl-ring/'],b'7039',"['A family of five is facing multiple federal narcotics charges for allegedly running a heroin and fentanyl distribution ring linked to several fatal overdoses. The 15-count indictment accuses twin brothers Brad Reed and Greg Reed, 26, cousins Richard Ruby, 31, and Justin McBride, 26, and McBride’s wife, Antoinette, 29, of trafficking and dealing heroin, fentanyl, cocaine and crack cocaine between January 2014 and December 2017 throughout Allegheny County in Pennsylvania, Department of Justice officials announced Friday, according to CBS Pittsburgh. The five defendants allegedly used two homes in Hazelwood and one residence in Munhall — neighborhoods in Allegheny County — for manufacturing fentanyl and packaging the drugs for distribution. “This indictment charges these five individuals for their roles in a criminal heroin/fentanyl trafficking organization that is responsible for causing two overdose deaths and four non-fatal overdoses in which the victims needed to be revived with naloxone,” U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said in a statement. Justin McBride, Brad Reed, and Greg Reed all face 20 years to life in prison for their role in the trafficking operation, while Antoinette McBride and Richard Ruby face five to 40 years behind bars. Overdoses are currently battering Pennsylvania — 4,884 lives were claimed in 2016. The increase was primarily opioid-driven, which were implicated in more than 3,900 overdose deaths across the state in 2016. Pennsylvania officials predict drug overdose deaths will top 5,000 when final figures for 2017 are released. Fentanyl overtook heroin as the U.S.’s deadliest substance in 2016, claiming 19,413 lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death for Americans under age 50, killing more than 64,000 people in 2016.

BALLYCUMBER GAA CLUB Tullamore Court Hotel Offaly Senior B Football Championship Ballycumber 1-10 Tubber 0-12. A dour first half finished all square at three points each. Two pointed frees by Cormac Quinn and a long range point by Colin Daly made up the Ballycumber total. Tubber replied with three points from play and were unlucky not to have added at least one goal to their total. Leo Guinan prevented a goal bound shot from entering the net with a good save. Ballycumber started the second half brightly and Cormac Quinn pointed two more frees in the first five minutes. Clive Keena replaced the injured Ritchie Dunne at half time and he added pace and determination to the half back line. Tubber scored the next four points with two frees and two from play to regain the lead. Joe Lowry pointed a free for Ballycumber to stall the Tubber momentum briefly. An outstanding display of accuracy by Seanie Farrell added three more points to the Tubber total and they looked destined for victory leading 0-10 to 0-6. Joe Lowry scored another point from a free to which Tubber replied with a point from play. The introduction of Karl Daly and the Corcoran twins – Tom and John swung the play in favour of Ballycumber. Sean Hackett scored a great point while under severe pressure. Joe Lowry pointed a free and John Corcoran scored a badly needed point to narrow the gap to one point. A high ball into the Tubber goalmouth fell kindly for Nigel Grennan and he drilled the ball into the roof of the net with his right foot to give Ballycumber the lead. Tubber quickly moved the ball down the pitch and were awarded a free which was kicked over the bar to leave the final score at 1-10 to 0-12.

Scott,Brady,"['http://www.filmjournal.com/features/bronco-blues-chloe-zhaos-rider-offers-intimate-look-broken-young-cowboy', 'https://www.showbizjunkies.com/news/jane-russell-profile/']",b'7037',"['The Rider centers on Brady (Brady Jandreau), a Native American bronco rider whose fall from his horse dramatically alters his life. The Sony Pictures Classics release, opening April 13, is written and directed by Chinese filmmaker Chloé Zhao, whose journey across America led her to the Lakota Reservation in South Dakota. “I arrived from Beijing and the U.K. a sheltered woman who did not speak English very well,” she confides, after a New York Film Festival screening last fall. “I dreamed of studying in America.” Zhao’s freshman year at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts began a few days before 9/11. “I was ignorant of America when that happened,” she recalls. “Everything I knew about this country came from Hollywood movies.” In her elegiac second feature, Zhao portrays an America few Americans know. Indian reservations, even the dozen or so that welcome visitors, or that share grazing lands and a border with U.S. national parks, such as Grand Canyon and Badlands, are rarely visited by vacationers. Badlands is on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where The Rider is set and where it was filmed. In the 1970s, it was the home of Oglala Lakota Russell Means, a founder of the American Indian Movement. One of AIM’s most famous protests was an occupation of Mount Rushmore in 1971, a monument built on land sacred to the Lakota. The Wounded Knee Massacre of Lakota in 1890 took place on what is now the Pine Ridge Reservation. The Lakota were among the organizers of recent protests at Standing Rock; the oil pipeline that was the object of those protests may endanger the reservation’s water supply. Chris Eyre’s Skins (2002), a story of a former Native American football player and his brother, was the first theatrical film shot on Pine Ridge, the most impoverished area of the United States. Zhao has produced both of her films there. The first, Songs My Brother Taught Me (2015), is about a young man, not unlike many other Native American men and women, whose prospects for a better life lie off the reservation and away from their loved ones. In contrast, The Rider profiles a cowboy, a man immersed in the mainstream ranching lifestyle of Native American reservations in the West and Southwest. “It is not as simple as saying Brady, as a cowboy, is a person of the land,” Zhao says, pointing to the complex nature of Native American identity. “We separated them from their land and put them in boarding schools. A couple of generations later, they’re on Snapchat, and some young people don’t know how to manage their land.” Zhao’s undergraduate degree is in political science, but she switched to film as a graduate student living in New York City. “I was in my third year in the film program, and I knew that my time in New York wasn’t going to work out,” she says. “It was expensive, and I was lost as a human being and a storyteller, so I went west.” By the time she began production on her first film, which she also wrote and directed, Zhao had moved to Denver, and was traveling back and forth between that city and the Pine Ridge Reservation. “Being someone who looks like me made it easy to be on the reservation,” she explains, “although my cinematographer, who is a tall, British guy, did not have it as easy as I did.” Joshua James Richards (last year’s acclaimed God’s Own Country) was Zhao’s director of photography on both of her films. “I can walk into someone’s home,” she adds. Lakota and Diné and other Native Americans welcome Asians and Asian-Americans as their Eurasian ancestors. The Rider features an all-Lakota cast playing themselves. Lane Scott, Brady’s hospitalized friend, was a local rodeo performer before he was severely injured in a car accident. Brady’s other co-stars, his father Tim, and his autistic sister Lily, are his real-life family. Zhao recalls that she was playing videogames when she first met Brady. “I thought: The camera is going to love that face,” she says. “I went outside and watched as he trained a horse. That evening, I asked him if he wanted to make a film with me.” Brady trains horses for a living, and was a rodeo bronco rider before his accident. It is a sport many Native American boys and men (and some women) aspire to. Bronco contestants ride a specially trained horse that bucks in an attempt to throw the rider, as Zhao illustrates in the film. Rodeos are the main sporting event on some reservations; while they include competitions in roping and herding, bronco riding is the epitome of masculine bravado. “I didn’t have a story for almost a year and a half,” Zhao says, “and then Brady got hurt and I had my story.” The Rider begins with Brady picking stitches out of his head, where he now has a metal plate. The film charts his recovery, and his far more painful realization that his rodeo days are behind him. “I was drawn to Brady because there is something so pure and authentic about who he is at a time when everyone is conforming to trends and young people want to be someone else,” Zhao notes. “He is so unapologetically himself. I thought the camera would capture that.” Brady’s difficult relationship with his father is not invented, nor is his tender and candid way of being with Lily. As for the cowboy’s horse-training skills, Zhao staged some shots, but when Brady is in a corral calming a bucking horse, that is real—the horse is wild. The scene, which showcases Richards’ handheld camera work, is also a particularly remarkable example of the delicate verisimilitude that distinguishes Zhao’s film. Zhao started with a 55-page script based on her actors’ lives. She remembers her first meeting with Lily: “She had taped scenes from TV shows, edited them in-camera, and acted to that. Lily has been expressing herself through storytelling all of her life.” Reflecting on Lily’s autism, Zhao says that it was very important to her “to be able to cast someone who has disabilities but not making the film about that.” The Rider is shot almost entirely in natural light. “What lights we had, we bought at Walmart,” Zhao says. “It is hard to make a film beautiful and real, because it has to go beyond beautiful to make it real. I give that to Josh Richards. He’s that good.” As for the splendor of the landscape, the night sky and the horses, they needed no embellishment. “What Brady is seeing,” Zhao says, “is something already so majestic.” Follow @film_journal Movie Reviews, Box Office News, and More', 'Publicity photo from ‘The Outlaw’ starring Jane Russell. (RKO Radio Pictures) Glamour queens come and go in the movies, but few have made as much of an impression as Jane Russell. At one time known more for the dimensions of her bosom than for her acting ability, she proved herself to be quite adept at comedy roles as well as her usual sexpot roles. Jane Russell became famous as a movie star before anyone had seen her on the screen! Due to an intense publicity campaign by RKO Studios and her boss, eccentric oilman and aviation genius Howard Hughes, her photo was propelled onto every movie magazine cover and newspaper front page. Billionaire Hughes groomed Miss Russell for her film debut in the sexy Western, The Outlaw, co-starring handsome young Jack Buetel. The film was made in 1941, but it was too hot for the censors to approve. It was briefly released in 1943. It became a cause celebre because of the blatant sexuality displayed in the film. Hughes yanked the picture and tinkered with it for a few more years, doing re-takes and re-editing. Although Miss Russell was under contract to Hughes, she never appeared in another film during those first few years at the studio. Hughes wanted her to make a big splash first in The Outlaw before audiences saw her in anything else. The Outlaw was finally released in 1946 and became a sensation – just as Hughes had predicted. Miss Russell became a sultry overnight sensation after waiting for five years! It is rumored that Hughes, a noted aviation pioneer, used his engineering skills to design a sort of flying buttress brassiere to cantilever Miss Russell’s levitating assets. It’s one of the great Hollywood legends and only Miss Russell could confirm whether it was true or not. Hughes finally put her into a nondescript film called Young Widow in 1946. In 1948, Jane walked across the RKO lot over to Paramount Studios next door to make the sensational comedy, The Paleface, with Bob Hope. The picture was such a huge hit that it spawned a sequel, Son of Paleface, in 1952. Jane was kept busy at RKO co-starring with Robert Mitchum in such hard-hitting films as His Kind Of Woman and Macao. When the novel 3D film process came into vogue in the early 1950s, Jane was the perfect three-dimensional subject for the two-eyed cameras. She starred in a musical called The French Line. She projected her ample bosom out over the heads of an amazed and startled audience. The 3D process was used for what it was intended – popping your eyes out. The highlight of Russell’s career came in 1953 when she co-starred with Marilyn Monroe in the classic 20th Century Fox musical comedy, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. She and Marilyn knocked everybody out when they sang “We’re Just Two Little Girls From Little Rock.” Although Jane was a much bigger star than Marilyn at the time, this film skyrocketed both their careers into the stratosphere. Marilyn became Queen of the Fox lot at age 26. Jane followed up with the films The Tall Men with Clark Gable and Robert Ryan, and Gentlemen Marry Brunettes, with Jeanne Crain and Scott Brady, both in 1955. She again starred with Clark Gable in The King and Four Queens in 1956 with Eleanor Parker and The Revolt of Mamie Stover. When her film career waned in the 1960s, she still drew crowds to her nightclub act, thus proving that she was still a star. Her tour took her to South America, Europe, Mexico, and Canada. She later formed a singing group with singers Connie Haines, Beryl Davis, and Della Russell. They recorded a song, “Do Lord,” which sold two million copies. After divorcing former football great Bob Waterfield, Jane voluntarily retired from the screen and found happiness with a new husband. She remained in the public eye through her appearances for the World Adoption International Fund (WAIF), a charitable organization for orphaned children. Television commercials that Jane made for a bra company crowned her the “full-figured gal” and brought her to the attention of a whole new generation of young fans. She also took to the stage and did successful engagements with the musicals Bells Are Ringing and Janus. She took over on Broadway for Elaine Stritch in the hit musical Company in 1971, in which she played for six months. Miss Russell represented the film industry as one of its most outstanding citizens and spokespersons. She demonstrated graceful longevity and received respect from her peers in Hollywood for her many good public works. She also wrote her autobiography in 1985, Jane Russell: My Path and My Detours, to great acclaim. She retired to a quiet life in the Santa Maria Valley of coastal California. She died February 28, 2011 at age 89 of a respiratory illness. She was survived by her three children.

Scott,Brady,['http://chinafilminsider.com/bronco-blues-chloe-zhaos-rider-offers-intimate-look-broken-young-cowboy/'],b'7036',"['“The Rider” centers on Brady (Brady Jandreau), a Native American bronco rider whose fall from his horse dramatically alters his life. The Sony Pictures Classics release, opening April 13, is written and directed by Chinese filmmaker Chloé Zhao, whose journey across America led her to the Lakota Reservation in South Dakota. Features Movies Features Filmmakers “I arrived from Beijing and the U.K. a sheltered woman who did not speak English very well,” she confides, after a New York Film Festival screening last fall. “I dreamed of studying in America.” Zhao’s freshman year at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts began a few days before 9/11. “I was ignorant of America when that happened,” she recalls. “Everything I knew about this country came from Hollywood movies.” In her elegiac second feature, Zhao portrays an America few Americans know. Indian reservations, even the dozen or so that welcome visitors, or that share grazing lands and a border with U.S. national parks, such as Grand Canyon and Badlands, are rarely visited by vacationers. Badlands is on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where The Rider is set and where it was filmed. In the 1970s, it was the home of Oglala Lakota Russell Means, a founder of the American Indian Movement. One of AIM’s most famous protests was an occupation of Mount Rushmore in 1971, a monument built on land sacred to the Lakota. The Wounded Knee Massacre of Lakota in 1890 took place on what is now the Pine Ridge Reservation. The Lakota were among the organizers of recent protests at Standing Rock; the oil pipeline that was the object of those protests may endanger the reservation’s water supply. Chris Eyre’s Skins (2002), a story of a former Native American football player and his brother, was the first theatrical film shot on Pine Ridge, the most impoverished area of the United States. Zhao has produced both of her films there. The first, Songs My Brother Taught Me (2015), is about a young man, not unlike many other Native American men and women, whose prospects for a better life lie off the reservation and away from their loved ones. In contrast, The Rider profiles a cowboy, a man immersed in the mainstream ranching lifestyle of Native American reservations in the West and Southwest.

Firefighters rely on their equipment to keep them as safe as possible when facing danger, but not everyone is in agreement about making the purchase. ""If you can\'t bring a fire engine to a fire, you can\'t put out a fire,"" said South Hadley Fire Chief Scott Brady. A pump on engine four at South Hadley\'s Fire District Two was deemed to have a critical issue. ""It is unable to hold a vacuum unless every valve is closed on the engine while it is running,"" Brady noted. That issue poses concerns about getting water to a fire, but that\'s not the only problem. ""We have a lot of rot on the underside. The air tanks are corroding, the vehicles engine has some leaks as well,"" Brady continued. The national standard to retire an engine is 25, and fire engine four is 27 years old. Chief Brady said the age alone is a reason to pull it out of service. He told Western Mass News they learned about the problem with the pump on the same day as a prudential committee meeting where members were deciding what should be brought before the voters for approval. ""At that point they did not choose to place the engine on the annual meeting warrant,"" Brady explained. Since that day the Prudential Committee regrouped and decided to hold a special meeting later this month to discuss the options surrounding replacing the engine. ""The firefighters are number one. They are the most important thing when it comes to putting out a fire, but they can\'t do it without the correct tools, and they certainly can\'t do it if they aren\'t safe on scene,"" Brady added. Like any other organization, there is a budget. Western Mass News spoke to Robert Lak, a member of the Prudential Committee. Lak said that they have discussed adding the replacement of engine four to the districts warrant in the past, but voters turned it down last year. He noted the fire company needs a new ambulance as well, and does not want jeopardize the warrant to buy a new ambulance. Lak also explained that the Prudential Committee did not get an estimate to repair engine four, rather than remove it from service. ""If you have a concern about losing water during fire ground operations, it\'s scary,"" said Brady. Copyright 2018 Western Mass News (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

Two indictments made public on Thursday signaled the commitment of the Erie County District Attorney\'s Office and the U.S. Attorney\'s Office to work together to fight the opioid epidemic in northwestern Pennsylvania. The U.S. Attorney\'s Office announced that a grand jury on Wednesday indicted two Erie residents in federal court in Erie on felony charges that they sold drugs that led to two separate fatal opioid-related overdoses in Millcreek Township in 2017. The indictments represent the first time the U.S. Attorney\'s Office in Erie has prosecuted cases under the federal law that covers drug distribution resulting in death or serious bodily injury, the government said. The cases are separate, though both defendants, Damon D. Henderson and Derrick L. Hemphill Sr., were already facing drug-delivery charges in Erie County Court for the same fatal overdoses. The Erie County cases are expected to be dismissed in light of the prosecution in federal court, where the penalties are more severe than in county court for the drug-delivery charges. The Erie County District Attorney\'s Office was involved in the referrals to federal court, District Attorney Jack Daneri said. A conviction in federal court on the charges in the two cases carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and a maximum sentence of life, the government said. If convicted in Erie County Court, each defendant would have faced a maximum of 40 years in state prison, but with no mandatory minimum sentence, Daneri said. ""Local law enforcement in this county will continue to work closely with our federal partners to put maximum effort at addressing the opioid overdose epidemic,"" Daneri said. ""We will continue to work with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. attorney, and we will make referrals for federal prosecution where the facts warrant."" Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Pittsburgh-based Western District of Pennsylvania, which includes Erie, said the indictments show that, ""To combat the deadly opioid epidemic, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will use every lawful tool in our arsenal to identify and prosecute drug traffickers whose products poison our citizens."" ""Severe penalties are warranted when drug dealers knowingly distribute drugs that kill our fellow citizens,"" Brady also said. Two other cases involving drug-delivery deaths are pending in Erie County Court and another, in which the death occurred in Titusville, is pending in Crawford County Court. Henderson, 28, also known as Dee or Dd, is named in a seven-count indictment announced Thursday. He is accused of selling a quantity of fentanyl and a quantity of cocaine that caused the death of a victim, identified only as R.R.T., in June. The victim, a 56-year-old man, was pronounced dead at UPMC Hamot on June 16 after Millcreek police found the victim in cardiac arrest at a township residence in the late evening of June 15, according to court records in the Erie County case. The indictment also charges Henderson with possessing with intent to distribute various amounts of heroin, fentanyl, a heroin-fentanyl mixture, cocaine and crack cocaine around June 20. The indictment alleges that Henderson discarded the drugs outside a residence in the 900 block of East Eighth Street, near East Avenue. Hemphill, 27, also known as G or Shelly, is named in a three-count indictment. He is accused of selling fentanyl that caused the death of victim K.A.J. on Nov. 26. The body of the victim, a woman, was found in an apartment on Baer Drive in Millcreek, according to court records in the Erie County case. The indictment also alleges that Hemphill possessed with intent to distribute fentanyl and a heroin-fentanyl mixture on Nov. 26 at a residence in the 400 block of East 25th Street, near Wallace street. Henderson and Hemphill are in the Erie County prison, where they have been awaiting prosecution in the county cases. Their first appearances in federal court are scheduled for April 19 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan Paradise Baxter. Assistant U.S. Attorney Marshall Piccinini is prosecuting both cases. The Erie and Millcreek police investigated the cases with detectives from the Erie County District Attorney’s Office and with assistance from the DEA, the government said.

Erie City Council President Sonya Arrington has been indicted by a federal grand jury. The 51 year old was named by the Department of Justice Wednesday in a 33-count indictment for wire fraud, theft of government property and false writing or document to the government. The indictment accuses Arrington of using money donated to her non-profit organization, Mothers Against Teen Violence (MATV), for her gambling and personal expenses. Arrington defrauded MATV of at least $70,000 from December 2011 to March 2018, according to the indictment. It alleges she used a MATV credit card on 113 occasions from April 2012 to January 2018 to withdraw MATV funds at Presque Isle Downs and Casino. The indictment said Arrington sustained gambling losses at Presque Isle Downs & Casino of at least the following approximate amounts: She allegedly solicited donations from individuals and entities, received donations to MATV in cash and checks payable to MATV, and deposited part of the donations into MATV bank accounts while keeping a portion in cash for herself, the indictment alleges. Investigators said she used a debit card for the MATV bank accounts to make purchases unrelated to the organization\'s purposes. It was reportedly used for things like personal items of clothing, groceries, car washes and food at restaurants and to pay personal bills for T-Mobile, State Farm, First Energy and others. Arrington also fraudulently received approximately $29,558 in Social Security disability benefits and submitted a document to the Social Security Administration that contained a false statement, the indictment said. U.S. Attorney Scott Brady requested a summons, instead of an arrest warrant, for Arrington to appear before the Court for arraignment, post bond and file an appearance of counsel. He asked for bond to be set at $10,000 unsecured. She could faces up to 635 years in prison, a fine of $7,750,00 or both if convicted. Arrington never commented after FBI agents raided her home March 1. Erie News Now reporter Chris Carroll went to the door of her east Erie home Thursday, but no one answered the door. Arrington\'s Attorney Responds Arrington\'s defense attorney Leonard Ambrose spoke to Erie News Now Thursday about the indictment. ""She is innocent until proven guilty,"" said Ambrose. ""We intend the vigorously contest the indictment. We haven\'t received any discovery at this point in time as to what the basis is for these charges, documents, records, etc. I have to review them and move forward."" Arrington hired Ambrose shortly after the FBI raid. City Hall on Indictment: Should She Resign? Arrington was elected to a four-year term on Erie City Council in 2015 and appointed council president in January 2018. Councilman Casimir Kwitowski was surprised by the indictment. ""[I\'m] kind of shocked, stunned,"" said Kwitowski. ""It is never good news when you hear stuff like that."" Kwitowksi said the decision to resign is up to Arrington. ""Number one: She has to do what is right for herself and her family and friends,"" said Kwitowski. ""Number two: She has to do what is right for the city as a councilperson."" Councilwoman Liz Allen thinks Arrington should consider remain on council but not as president. ""I think stepping down as council president would ease up some time to be able to concentrate on personal things she has to deal with right now,"" said Allen. City of Erie Mayor Joe Schember said he will respect the legal process, and it would be inappropriate for him to comment. Schember said he is not ready at this time to ask Arrington to step down. ""I just don\'t feel like I am ready,"" said Schember. ""At this point, I don\'t understand enough. I need more information. I need to talk to a bunch of people, including Sonya."" Mothers Against Teen Violence (MATV) Arrington formed and started Mothers Against Teen Violence (MATV) in January 2010 to help prevent violence among teenagers. Articles of Incorporation for the nonprofit were filed with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in February 2010. The paperwork included the following language: ""No part of the earnings of this corporation shall inure to the benefit of or be distributable to its directors, officers, or any private individual, except that the corporation shall be authorized and empowered to pay reasonable compensation for services rendered and to make payments and distributions in furtherance of the purposes set forth in these articles."" She also filed with the IRS in January 2010 to request non-profit status for MATV ""as an organization whose property would be dedicated to charitable purposes,"" according to court documents. Arrington typically holds three primary MATV events each year. They include an anti-violence march and rally, a talent show and a community picnic. MATV operates at the Booker T. Washington Center at 17th and Holland. It was also raided March 1. Booker T. Washington Center leaders then told Erie News Now agents were looking for payroll, written and received donations and accounting information related to Mothers Against Teen Violence (MATV) when they served the subpoena.

I had a lot of fun on my visit and it became clear that this was the best place for me to develop as an individual and an athlete, beautiful campus, great teammates,” he said. “Honestly, the coaching staff is awesome, showed genuine interest in me coming out of high school,” the 6’0, 225lbs tailback added. “They place a lot of emphasis on high academic achievement, which I admire, very organized and dedicated coaching staff and I’m looking forward to working with them.” Ojo’s career has spanned two years with the Bert Church Chargers (RVFL) in his hometown of Bert Church, Alberta. He will be taking computer science with the hope of attending medical school. 6-0 225 RB Tolu Ojo from Bert Church – another big, physical addition to our backfield – welcome to the Marauder family!! #MACGrit pic.twitter.com/8hGSFMJncR — Scott Brady (@CoachSBrady) March 16, 2018 Curtis Vincent When Curtis Vincent began playing football, he couldn’t help but think about where the sport might take him. “I always thought one day (how) it would be amazing to play for a top team in Canada and I am now going to McMaster,” he said. “I chose to commit because I love the history behind the team and the success they have (had) and I want to be apart of that.” Vincent, who is 6’2, 215lbs, added that the Marauders’ coaches were very welcoming. “They told me straight truth of what would happen if I were to come to McMaster and all the coaches I’ve talked to so far are great coaches,” he said. “I can’t wait to get to work with them.” Starting his career in high school, Vincent has been involved in football for five years. In that time, the product of Brantford, Ontario, has played with the Assumption Lions (BCSSAA) and the Brantford Bisons (OFC). In 2017, he participated in the Fox 40 Prospect Challenge.

A Duquesne man may be looking at decades behind bars after he pleaded guilty Monday to charges of conspiracy and distributing cocaine that was sent from California, according to U.S. Attorney Scott Brady for Pennsylvania's western district. Prosecutors say Christopher Joseph Lubic, as part of his plea, told them that he, along with others and between July 2015 and August 2016, established a cross-country connection with drug dealers in California who would mail him packages of cocaine. Lubic, according to prosecutors, would pay for the drugs with a money order and then resell them for a profit. On Aug. 18, 2016, law enforcement officials, armed with a search warrant, opened one of the packages destined for Lubic. “The package contained cocaine,” prosecutors said in a press release. “An electronic monitoring device was inserted into the package in preparation for a controlled delivery. Shortly after the package was delivered to the defendant, authorities were alerted that the package was opened.” When agents with the postal service entered Lubic's residence, they found the package opened on the floor. They say a portion of the mailing label had stuck to Lubic's shoe. When they searched the residence, officials found more than 500 grams of cocaine, the chemicals used to “cut” it, a cocaine press, $60,000, paraphernalia and materials used in previous deliveries. Prosecuters say Lubic agreed to speak with postal inspectors, whom he allegedly told that he regularly received packages of cocaine from California, and that he would pay $20,000 in money orders for it and then sell it for $22,000. U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon scheduled a sentencing hearing for Aug. 8. The law provides a minimum jail sentence of five years and a maximum of 40 years, as well as fines up to $5 million, the U.S. Attorney's office said. Matthew Medsger is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

A Coraopolis man pleaded guilty Wednesday to federal charges of carjacking and robbing a pharmacy last year, according to court records. Police caught 37-year-old Joshua Williams shortly after the May 29 crimes thanks to the OnStar tracking device installed in the stolen car. The incident began when Williams climbed through the open passenger window of a Chevrolet Malibu in Pittsburgh's West End and tried to stab the driver, according to a release from U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. The driver leapt out of the vehicle and crawled to the sidewalk while Williams took off with the Chevy. He drove to a Rite Aid on Noblestown Road where he jumped the pharmacy counter wielding a large, serrated knife, Brady said. Williams demanded Oxycodone, Fentanyl and Adderall and made off with a trashcan full of medications worth nearly $200,000, Brady said. Police used the OnStar tracker to find Williams and vehicle a short distance away. Williams pleaded guilty to carjacking, robbery and a drug charge. Megan Guza is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Scott,Brady,['http://citizensvoice.com/sports/fly-fishing-legend-stanley-cooper-jr-dies-at-93-1.2327460'],b'7031',"[""Access the Citizens' Voice e-Edition on your computer or smart device in its original print format. Home delivery subscribers can read it free! THE CITIZENS’ VOICE FILE Wilkes-Barre’s Stanley Cooper Jr. was a legend in the fly fishing community. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter both got in touch with him, but he wasn’t a politician. He also heard from college basketball coach Bob Knight and sportscaster Curt Gowdy, but not on the sideline or in the broadcast booth. He didn’t have to share the outfield with Ted Williams to build a friendship with the baseball Hall of Famer, either. Fly fishing was Stanley Cooper Jr.’s passion, and it’s what connected him with all those household names and so many others. Cooper began tying flies decades ago with his father and didn’t stop as he entered his 90s. Cooper died Tuesday following a lifetime that included a couple million flies and plenty of connections in the fishing community. The Wilkes-Barre resident was 93. “I got to know him through the regular meetings and our board meetings. You could tell right away, this is the guy’s life,” said Jay Downs, a director at Trout Unlimited’s Stanley Cooper Sr. Chapter, named after Cooper’s father. “Everything he did kind of revolved around fly fishing and fly tying. “Then, when you hear the stories about who he knew and who he tied flies for, you start to realize you’re in the presence of a living legend.” That status — a living legend — was cemented in 2016, when Cooper was one of the four Catskill Legends selected annually by the Catskill Fly Fishing Center and Museum. Each year since 2014, the center “honors four individuals who have contributed their expertise to impact, educate and share the history and knowledge of the Catskills” and “continue the tradition of Catskill fly fishing,” according to its website. Cooper was 91 years old when he was named a legend in the fly fishing world, roughly 70 years after he started tying flies with Cooper Sr. It was a father-son bond that quickly became a business for the two. J. Scott Brady, the president of the Cooper Sr. chapter, said he can tie five or six flies in an hour if he’s working hard. Once, he was curious and asked Cooper how many he’d tied one day, and was surprised when Cooper counted off about 15 different ties. “That’s not very many,” Brady recalled reacting. “He said, ‘No, 15 dozen.’ ... He did it well, and he made a living out of it.” Downs said, “Everyone knew if you were getting Stan’s flies, you were getting top quality.” Cooper’s passion became an avenue to a number of high-profile individuals. In a 2016 interview with The Citizens’ Voice, Cooper noted he kept records and had tied more than two-and-a-half million ties. Among those, some went to Carter, Eisenhower, Gowdy and Knight; in return, he received a thank-you card from Carter and a signed scorebook and Indiana hat from Knight. He also built a relationship purely centered around fishing with Williams, the Red Sox great who hit 521 home runs in 19 seasons with Boston but is perhaps best known as MLB’s last .400 hitter in a regular season. “I fished with Ted for about 10 years, and in all that time not once did we talk baseball,” Cooper, who fished as near as the Poconos and as far as Colorado, California and Canada, said in the 2016 interview. “We always talked about fishing. I’m proud to say I fished with him.” But Cooper certainly wasn’t in the business simply for those connections. As Downs quickly pointed out, Cooper made himself as much of a resource as he could to children trying to learn the ropes. He’d be one of the first to sign up and attend any event that benefited kids, Downs said. And at a yearly banquet, he’d make sure a child won his special prize, which included dozens of ties he made. “He was super conscientious about the kids, but (also) with everything the chapter did,” Downs said. “He was there to help teach and expand the sport. ... He was a real diplomat.” Funeral services for Cooper Jr. will be at 11 a.m. Friday at Wyoming Valley Presbyterian Church in Wilkes-Barre.

A 36-year-old Fayette County man indicted in 2016 as part of a large-scale cocaine smuggling ring was sentenced this week to 10 years in prison after his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine. After serving his prison term, Jamal Eddings of Uniontown will also have to serve three years of supervised release, according to U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. According to information presented to the court, Eddings was involved in a large-scale drug distribution ring in the Uniontown area. He conspired with others to distribute at least 100 grams of cocaine. When he was arrested in 2016, authorities identified Edding as part of a cross-country drug trafficking ring. Officials said the organization shipped heroin and cocaine from New York and California into Fayette and Washington counties. Brady said the investigation involved the FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Fayette County Drug Task Force, the state Attorney General's Office, Pennsylvania State Police and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

Pictured is the 2018 Salamanca golf team. Front row (from left): Cole Hedlund, Haley Pond, Chris Wils. Back row: Coach Gene Jankowski, Brandon Milanowski, Jarrett Pond, Justin Blakesslee, Eric Murphy. The good news, as coach Gene Jankowski sees it, after one match for the Salamanca golf team is the Warriors picked up near where they left off last season. But the bad news? It wasn’t enough to secure a season-opening victory against Allegany-Limestone, Cattaraugus-Little Valley or Ellicottville. But the margin, he said, is close enough that shedding a handful of strokes would flip a match here or there. “I want to win,” Jankowski said of his goals. “I tell the kids that and they do to, but you’ve got to get through their heads that every shot matters.” Junior Brandon Milanowski returns after carding Salamanca’s low average last season (50) and shot that score on Monday. The team also returns its second and fourth best golfers from last season in senior Braden Siebert and freshman Jarrett Pond. “We’ve got a lot of middle of the road golfers in the 50s (Monday) and judging by our results that’s not going to win us as many matches as we’d like,” Jankowski said. “We had a 58, 57, 57 today and if they would have been 56s, I think we would have won two more matches, so it’s that close, which is frustrating but it’s the first time out and we’re all in the same boat. We’ve got a lot of kids, but of the five kids that golfed today, four of them are playing two sports. Another kid who would be starting, Braden Siebert, is playing lacrosse as his primary sport. “Looking at today, they shot just about what they ended up last year. So I guess that’s a positive. It’s going to be the same five guys. It’s going to be Brandon, Jarrett, Cole, Justin and Braden when he can get in. I don’t know if it’s a five-headed monster, but they’re all going to be there. What we need is one or two of them to have a really good round. You want consistency as a coach but if one of them just shoots six, eight strokes better like kids are doing against us…” Salamanca was set to play again Tuesday and Wednesday at Elkdale Country Club and visit A-L at Birch Run on Friday. The team will face a busy schedule if weather allows before the sectional qualifiers May 14-15 at Bartlett C.C. in Olean. With poor weather for much of April, the team has been confined to indoor practices, but Jankowski doesn’t see that as an excuse. “I’m not going to blame anything on the indoor practices,” Jankowski said. “We did what we wanted to do. It would be nice if we were outside playing, getting some swings in, but we’ve got four matches this week and we’re going to be seasoned veterans by next week if the weather cooperates. ” While many play multiple sports, the team has 17 members from grades 7-12. The numbers encourage Jankowski, who sees additional help with developing youngsters from assistant coach Scott Brady. He said Brian Spako also runs an after-school program at Seneca Elementary, where young students can take golf lessons at Elkdale paid by the school. “The plan is get those young kids involved and build for the future and when we have a match, the assistant coach (Brady) was out golfing with the three kids today instead of them not golfing,” Jankowski said. “Now they’re out there practicing and staying interested. It’s always better when you’ve got a coach there when you hit a bad shot, he can kind of correct it right away. That builds the confidence so I’m hoping this makes us competitive real quick down the road, particularly with the young kids involved. If they like it, then they do lessons in the summer and that hopefully leads to success.” Light rain this evening with thunderstorms by morning. Low 67F. Winds S at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 90%.

Scott A. Brady receiving his award from the Utah Science Teacher Association at the Provo Marriott Conference Center Feb. 9. Scott A. Brady receiving his award from the Utah Science Teacher Association at the Provo Marriott Conference Center Feb. 9. MONROE – The Utah Science Teachers Association awarded South Sevier High School teacher Scott Brady the 2018 High School Science Teacher of the Year Feb. 9, in Provo. “I was deeply honored,” Brady said. “With all of the schools in the state and all of the teachers in my area, it is really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to receive such an award and be recognized in this way.” The USTA is an organization focused on the advancement, stimulation, extension, improvement and coordination of teaching in all fields of science at all educational levels. Award recipients are chosen by USTA’s governing board from nominations submitted by fellow teachers, administrators and district personnel. “It feels good because teachers in general are rarely recognized for all they do in the face of low pay, lack of resources and continuous politics and bureaucracy that constantly change the landscape of education,” Brady said. “Teaching is not for everyone, it takes a special person to be a good teacher that truly makes a difference. I am grateful that I received some recognition for all of my hard work.” Brady teaches science at SSHS in Monroe and at the Career and Technology Education Center in Richfield. Brady teaches courses in general biology, human biology, medical terminology, astronomy, botany, geology, advanced placement environmental science, emergency medical responder and emergency medical technician. Brady holds an associate of arts degree from Snow College, a bachelor of science in biology from the Southern Utah University and a master’s degree in environmental science and engineering from Washington State University. He is also a paramedic for Sevier County Emergency Medical Services. As the winner of this award, Brady received a plaque, a certificate, a free dinner and a permanent place on the USTA website.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:41 pm Gideon Bradshaw/Observer-Reporter U.S. Attorney Scott Brady, flanked by other law enforcement officers, speaks Wednesday during a news conference in Pittsburgh announcing the indictments of those allegedly involved in an interstate cocaine-trafficking network. Staff Writer Gideon Bradshaw/Observer-Reporter U.S. Attorney Scott Brady, flanked by other law enforcement officers, speaks Wednesday during a news conference in Pittsburgh announcing the indictments of those allegedly involved in an interstate cocaine-trafficking network. PITTSBURGH – Federal prosecutors in Pittsburgh announced charges against 39 people – many from Washington and parts of the Mon Valley – Wednesday as authorities said they dismantled a large interstate drug-trafficking ring that allegedly brought hundreds of kilos of cocaine into the region. The charges are outlined in two separate but related superseding indictments returned a day earlier by a grand jury following a nearly two-year investigation by various agencies. They contain charges including drug trafficking, money laundering, financial structuring and firearms crimes. “This cocaine organization is one of the largest in the history of Western Pennsylvania,” said Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, during a news conference at the U.S. courthouse in Pittsburgh. “It was spread across the country from Pittsburgh to Atlanta to Los Angeles, with sources to Mexican cartels.” He said it distributed cocaine throughout Allegheny, Washington, Greene, Westmoreland and Fayette counties. Many details of the nearly two-year investigation are not public. Asked to elaborate on how authorities believe those charged are all members of the same network, Brady said they “came to our attention through a variety of investigative means. This was the result of a wiretap investigation and traditional investigative methods, and everyone charged came to our attention through this investigation.” Brady identified two brothers – Jamie Lightfoot Jr., 25, of Verona and Deaubre Lightfoot, 27, of Monessen – as leaders of the regional operation. He said Don Juan Mendoza, 38, of Lawrenceville, Ga., was their supplier. Along with Mendoza, the Lightfoots and Moses, others charged in the first grand jury indictment include Edward Alford II, 30, of Donora; Devon Bell, 25, of Brownsville; Douglas Cochran, 39, of Washington; Anthony Crews, 44, of Monessen; John Duchi Jr., 29, of Donora; Sean Dungee II, 32, of Donora; Brett Fincik, age 43, formerly of Belle Vernon; Chace Johnson, 19, of California; Malik Lawson, 22, of Donora; William Shaw Jr., 33, of Brownsville; Herbert Sheppard, 44, of Monessen; and Quentin Vaden, 35, of Washington. Those charged in a second indictment include Brandon Thomas, 38, of Donora; Regina Davis, 48, of Donora; Adam Farabaugh, 28, of Canonsburg; Renee Kinder, 45, of Donora; Robert Margoni, 28, of New Eagle; Tyler Mucci, 31, of Monongahela; Ricky Pietroboni, 40, of Monongahela; and Michael Tirpak, 35, of Elizabeth. Brady claimed Todd Moses, 33, who formerly lived in Donora and now lives in Atlanta, connected Mendoza and the younger Lightfoot brother, who was arrested in November when investigators executed search warrants at his home and a recreation vehicle that was allegedly one of the vehicles used to traffic cocaine. Authorities have arrested almost all of those charged but are still searching for Moses, Brady said. The Lightfoot brothers were already in custody and facing charges following searches of their homes late in 2017. Investigators allegedly seized 52 kilograms of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana, a handgun and an AK-47 from Jamie’s home and a recreation vehicle, with additional searches of Deaubre’s and others’ homes the following month. “All told, in addition to the significant quantities of cocaine and heroin seized, 11 firearms and over $1 million in cash have been seized,” Brady said. Their father, Jamie Lightfoot Sr., 46, is charged with helping in the alleged conspiracy from federal prison in Loretto where he is serving time on previous drug dealing charges. Along with the FBI and state police, local departments including South Strabane and Elizabeth police carried out the investigation with funding from a federal task force. Brady pointed to a “disturbing trend” of cocaine making a comeback in the region. “In fact, many of our fellow citizens are overdosing on a combination of cocaine and fentanyl,” he said. A Ringgold elementary school teachers is among the 39 defendants charged in an alleged drug-trafficking network in the Mon Valley.

A large-scale, multi-state cocaine trafficking ring distributing drugs to the Mon Valley and sourced by Mexican cartels has been dismantled, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania Scott Brady announced Wednesday. “By taking down an entire multi-state organization at once, the impact on our region is felt immediately,” he said during a press conference at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Pittsburgh Wednesday afternoon. Among those arrested as part of the two-year investigation was 45-year-old Renee Kinder of Donora, a remedial reading teacher at Ringgold Elementary School, according to the district's website. Prosecutors said the investigation involved the FBI, state and local police departments, and resulted in the seizure of $2 million worth of drugs, including hundreds of kilograms of cocaine, in addition to heroin and marijuana. Officials also seized more than $1 million in cash, multiple firearms and other evidence, officials said. Thirty-nine people were federally indicted Tuesday, and 37 of those were arrested Wednesday morning, Brady said. He called the trafficking ring one of the largest cocaine trafficking organizations in the history of western Pennsylvania. “Two million. Stop and think about that number,” said Bob Johnson, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Pittsburgh Field Division. “That’s the street value of the cocaine that we confiscated during this investigation, and those drugs are now off the streets and out of the hands of our children. It can’t bring with it the violence that wreaks havoc on the families and in the communities that we live in.” The FBI-led investigation, called Operation Heavy Hand, targeted the Lightfoot Drug Trafficking Organization, with wiretapping and other investigation methods. According to the indictment, Jamie Lightfoot Sr., 46, who is incarcerated on federal drug trafficking charges, allegedly communicated and coordinated with his sons, Jamie Lightfoot Jr., 25, formerly of Verona, and Deaubra Lightfoot, 27, formerly of Monessen, to organize the ring. They were allegedly supplied by Don Juan Mendoza, 38, formerly of Lawrenceville, Georgia, named “a major interstate drug trafficker.” Investigators are still searching for Todd Moses, 33, originally from Donora. He is believed to be in the Atlanta area. Brady said Moses connected Mendoza and Jamie Lightfoot. Brian Powell, 39, formerly of Jacksonville, Florida, Troy Rowe, 28, formerly of Columbia, South Carolina, and Pedro Blanco, 40, formerly of Miami, Florida, allegedly helped Mendoza in transporting cocaine to the region. On Nov. 25, Powell, Rowe and Blanco allegedly drove an RV loaded with more than 51 kilograms of cocaine, one kilogram of heroin and 85 pounds of marijuana, along with an assault rifle and handgun. Officials conducted search warrants on Jamie Lightfoot’s Verona home, a hotel room and other property, seizing additional firearms and cash. “Although fighting the drug epidemic remains this office’s top priority, this case is clear evidence of a disturbing trend that cocaine is making a comeback in this region. In fact, many of our fellow citizens are now overdosing on a combination of cocaine and fentanyl,” Brady said. He said because of strong prosecution against opioid trafficking, cocaine is “filling the void.” Johnson said the drugs were distributed throughout the region, including Donora, Monessen, Charleroi, Belle Vernon, Brownsville, Uniontown, Washington and Canonsburg. “We want the community to know that these violent offenders will not be tolerated. This is not the end, but rather the beginning because as we further develop the intelligence that we have in this investigation, we’re going to identify new targets. We’re going to identify new drug trafficking organizations, and they will become the new case,” Johnson said. “I want the people in these communities to know that we are all working towards a common goal to make this community safer and to stop these drugs from coming into the place that you and I call home.” He emphasized the cooperation between state police and local municipal police forces. Also in attendance were State Police Trooper Melinda S. Bondarenka and Fayette County District Attorney Rich Bower, along with municipal police forces from Washington and Allegheny counties. “They have done an extremely good job in Fayette County,” Bower said. “They have come up and protected our citizens, and (Brady) has done his constitutional duty today, and with his staff, has done something which is an extremely important and difficult challenge for him by protecting the community — one of the greatest things that a U.S. attorney or a district attorney has as a responsibility.” State police are continuing an aggressive campaign to end drug trafficking, Bondarenka said. “Operation Heavy Hand is an example of how one efficient organization can affect so many communities in so many areas to include Pittsburgh and the Mon Valley area of southwestern Pennsylvania,” she said. “The Pennsylvania State Police is committed to an aggressive drug enforcement campaign against those that choose to traffic illegal drugs and poison our communities.” Other local people charged with various offenses relating to alleged drug trafficking ring are: Edward Alford II, 30, of Donora; Devon Bell, 25, of Brownsville; Douglas Cochran, 39, of Washington, Pennsylvania; Anthony Crews, 44, of Monessen; John Duchi Jr., 29, of Donora; Sean Dugee II, 32, of Donora; Brett Fincik, 43, of Belle Vernon; Kevin Ford, 32, of Clairton; Monty Ginage, 39, of Pittsburgh; Kaylin Homa-Lightfoot, 24, of Verona; Chase Johnson, 19, of California, Pennsylvania; Malik Lawson, 22, of Donora; Thomas Ohler, 36, of Greensburg; Eric Pinno, 53, of Pittsburgh; Eugene Reddick, 35, of Clariton; William Shaw Jr., 33, of Brownsville; Herbert Sheppard, 44, of Monessen; Roddell Smalls, 44, of Pittsburgh; Quinten Vaden, 35, of Washington, Pennsylvania; Brandon Thomas, 38, of Donora; Tyler Benefield, 33, of Vanderbilt; Regina Davis, 48, of Donora; Adam Farabaugh, 28, of Canonsburg; Josh Gillingham, 35, of Fayette City; Renee Kinder, 45, of Donora; Robert Margoni, 28, of New Eagle; Tyler Mucci, 31, of Monongahela; Jeff Newstrom, 30, of Masontown; Ricky Pietroboni, 40, of Monongahela; Michael Tirpak, 35, of Elizabeth. The remaining defendants charged in the case lived out of the state. Anyone with information on Moses is asked to call the FBI at 412-432-4000. “Make no mistake,” Brady said. “If you are selling drugs in western Pennsylvania, we are coming after you. If you traffic in cocaine, if you traffic in heroin or fentanyl, if you traffic in illegal firearms, we will come after you with the full weight and resources of the federal government.” Your comment has been submitted.

Brady announced the DEA will hold the 15th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, April 28th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., at hundreds of collection sites throughout the Western District of Pennsylvania. “During National Drug Takeback Day, everyone is encouraged to turn in unused, unwanted or expired prescription drugs for safe disposal, no questions asked and at no cost to them,” said U.S. Attorney Brady. “Having unused or old medicines in the house increases the risk of accidental poisoning or abuse. You help to safeguard your family’s health and safety when you properly dispose of these medications.” Western Pennsylvania residents can easily locate a nearby collection site by visiting https://takebackday.dea.gov/. The link allows for searches by zip code, county, and state. Last October Americans turned in 456 tons (912,305 pounds) of prescription drugs at more than 5,300 collection sites operated by the DEA and more than 4,200 of its state and local law enforcement partners. Overall, in its 14 previous Take Back events, DEA and its partners have taken in over 9,015,668 pounds—more than 4,508 tons—of pills. The disposal service is free and anonymous, no questions asked. The DEA can accept pills, patches, and tightly sealed liquids. The DEA cannot accept needles or sharps. Rates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs. Studies show that a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 91 Americans die each day from an opioid overdose. Some painkiller abusers move on to heroin: Four out of five new heroin users started with painkillers. Flushing medications down the toilet or throwing them in the trash pose potential safety and health hazards. This initiative addresses the public safety and public health issues that surround medications languishing in home cabinets, becoming highly susceptible to diversion, misuse, and abuse.', ""Sign up for one of our email newsletters.

Writer/director Chloe Zhao continues to make her presence felt as a filmmaker, and movie lovers are the beneficiaries. While filming her feature film debut Songs My Brothers Taught Me on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in 2015, Ms. Zhao met Brady Jandreau, a rising young star on the rodeo circuit. She knew a movie was in their future, but it wasn’t until the following year when the story wrote itself. Brady suffered a severe head injury after being bucked by a bronco. He was in a coma for 3 days, and a metal plate was screwed into his skull. Doctors warned Brady that riding a horse again could kill him. \ufeff This is not a documentary, but it’s pretty darn close. Brady Jandreau plays Brady Blackburn, a rodeo bronco rider and horse trainer who is recovering from a severe head injury. Mr. Landreau’s real father Tim and sister Lilly also appear as themselves. In fact, most of the characters are locals rather than actors, and many (including the Jandreaus) are part of the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe on the reservation. Also playing himself is Lane Scott, Brady’s best friend who is now paralyzed and unable to speak – the tragic result of another rodeo ride gone wrong. These two are like brothers, and their interactions provide some of the most emotional moments in the movie. The film is more cycle of life, than circle of life. It’s about having a lifelong dream snatched from your clutches. We follow Brady as he searches for his new place in life. Campfire confessions with his rodeo buddies portray the bond created by risking life and limb. His mother is dead, and Brady’s dad has spent a lifetime telling him to “cowboy up” – meaning, be a man and fight through every situation. Now dad is telling him to “let it go” and “move on.” This contradicts his friends who encourage him to not give up on his dream. Brady’s moments with his sister Lilly are some of the sweetest and most poignant. Despite her autism, Lilly is precious as she sings songs and offers clear insight to her brother. This is less about acting and more about being. Guns, horses, and pot play significant roles throughout, as does the stunning South Dakota landscape as photographed by cinematographer Joshua James Richards. The intimacy of Brady’s internal struggle somehow dwarfs the breathtaking sunsets. His quietly simmering intensity is masked by a stone face that only seems to brighten when around friend Lane, sister Lilly, or training yet another “unbreakable” horse. Rather than traditional story arc, this is simply a compelling way of life for people who put up no false fronts. Brady is trying to figure out how to be a man after life has stolen his dream. One’s purpose is essential to one’s being, and thanks to filmmaker Zhao we witness how one tough cowboy fights through. Terms of Use | Disclaimer']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1116817.0

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:41 pm A former Mon Valley man turned himself in to authorities Tuesday to face charges stemming from his alleged involvement in what federal prosecutors claim is a major interstate cocaine-trafficking ring. Todd Moses, 33, who previously lived in Donora and now lives in Decatur, Ga., traveled from his home state to Pittsburgh to surrender himself, said Margaret Philbin, spokeswoman for Scott Brady, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Moses was one of 39 people charged in two superseding indictments handed down last week. He made his initial appearance before Magistrate Judge Cynthia Reed Eddy Tuesday afternoon. Federal prosecutors are seeking to detain Moses while his case is pending. Based on a nearly two-year investigation, federal prosecutors allege Moses conspired with other members of the alleged trafficking network – including Jamie Lightfoot Jr., 25, of Penn Hills and his brother, Deaubre Lightfoot, 27, of Monessen – to bring cocaine into the region. Investigators found 52 kilograms of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana and two firearms during a search of a recreation vehicle they said brought the drugs from Los Angeles to Jamie Lightfoot’s home in November. Philbin said the Lightfoots’ half-brother John Duchi Jr., 29, of Donora is the only accused member of the network whom authorities haven’t located.

This year there’s a new parking fee structure and it appears state residents are loving it. New this year, if your vehicle is registered in Connecticut, you don’t have to pay an entry fee at CT state parks. You’ve already paid your parking fee through your vehicle’s registration; $5 dollars per year for two years. It’s the new 'passport to parks program' that was created by the state legislature. Funds generated through the system will support the parks system. “Honestly, if you come down once you’ve paid the fee based on the old parking prices,” Scott Brady, of Vernon. In-state residents with vehicle registrations are free, but out-of-state vehicles will be charged anywhere from $7 to $22, depending on the park and time of day. Fees to reserve overnight campgrounds for both in-state and out-of-state visitors still apply. “That’s beneficial, really good for the parks if you think about it quick and easy,” said Owen White, of Manchester.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:30 pm Attorney General Sessions Powell Brady Attorney General Sessions Powell Brady WASHINGTON — Five physicians of Redirections Treatment Advocates LLC, an opioid addiction treatment practice with offices in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have been indicted on charges of unlawfully dispensing controlled substances and health-care fraud. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady of the Western District of Pennsylvania and U.S. Attorney Bill Powell of the Northern District of West Virginia announced the indictments. The indictments represent the latest in a series of charges filed since Attorney General Sessions announced the formation of the Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, a Department of Justice initiative that uses data to target and prosecute individuals that commit opioid-related health-care fraud. The defendants named in the indictments: According to the indictments, Redirections Treatment Advocates LLC operates Suboxone clinics in several locations in Western Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia. The indictments allege that the defendants, working as contractors at various locations, created and distributed unlawful prescriptions for buprenorphine, known as Subutex and Suboxone, a drug that should be used to treat individuals with addiction. The defendants are also charged with conspiracy to unlawfully distribute buprenorphine. Finally, the defendants are charged with health care fraud for allegedly causing fraudulent claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for payments to cover the costs of the unlawfully prescribed buprenorphine. “Today we are facing the worst drug crisis in American history, with one American dying of a drug overdose every nine minutes,” Sessions said. “It’s incredible but true that some of our trusted medical professionals have chosen to violate their oaths and exploit this crisis for profit. “Last summer, I sent a dozen of our top federal prosecutors to focus solely on the problem of opioid-related health-care fraud in places where the epidemic was at its worst, including Western Pennsylvania. “These cases cut off the supply of drugs and stop fraudsters from exploiting vulnerable people. Our prosecutors began issuing indictments back in October, and today we bring even more charges against those who allegedly defrauded the taxpayer while diverting potentially addictive drugs. I want to thank our dedicated (assistant U.S. attorneys) Robert Cessar and Sarah Wagner, FBI, DEA, our U.S. Attorneys’ offices, FDA, the HHS and Veterans Affairs Inspectors General, IRS, our Postal Inspectors, and all of our state and local partners for their hard work on these cases.” “Expanding the legitimate use of medication to treat addiction is a critical part of this Administration’s multi-faceted approach to combat the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities,” Brady said. “Yet another vital component is the prosecution of unscrupulous practitioners who abuse their privilege to practice medicine and dispense prescriptions unlawfully. These indictments demonstrate that we remain vigilant in our pursuit of physicians who ignore their oath to do no harm.” “We remain unwavering in our efforts to combat those who violate drug laws and thereby contribute to the crisis of addiction. I have made clear that a medical degree provides you no protection from prosecution. We will persevere,” Powell said. Cessar and Wagner are prosecuting. The investigation leading to these indictments was conducted by the Western Pennsylvania Opioid Fraud and Abuse Detection Unit, which combines personnel and resources from the following agencies to combat the growing prescription opioid epidemic: FBI, U.S. Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General, Drug Enforcement Administration, Internal Revenue Service- Criminal Investigations, Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General-Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Attorney’s Office-Criminal Division, Civil Division and Asset Forfeiture Unit, Department of Veterans Affairs-Office of Inspector General, Food and Drug Administration-Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Licensing. An indictment is an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Dorothy Downing August 25, 1924 - May 5, 2018 Dorothy Joyce Winningham Downing, passed away Saturday, May 5, 2018, in Goodall-Witcher Hospital, Clifton, Texas. Her memorial service will be 1:30 p.m., May 12, 2018 at First United Methodist Church, Valley Mills, Texas. Burial will be in Valley Mills Cemetery. Reverend McGlothlin will officiate the service. Family visitation will be held on Friday, May 11 from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. at Oak Crest Funeral Home, 4520 Bosque Boulevard, Waco, Texas. Mrs. Downing was born in Waco, McLennan County, Texas on August 25, 1924, the daughter of Julious Vernon Winningham and Mildred Lurean Oliver. Dorothy attended Waco public schools and graduated from Waco High School in 1942. Dorothy met Clovis Paul Downing Jr., of Valley Mills when C.P. was serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps at Blackland Army Airfield, Waco. A loving and dedicated marriage of 63 years began when Dorothy and C.P married after a brief courtship and simple wedding ceremony held at the parsonage of the Clay Avenue Methodist Church presided by the pastor Reverend H.F. Draper in April 1943. C.P. and Dorothy\'s relationship taught their family the meaning of the promise ""to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."" They walked with Christ. In 1946 C.P. bought a small Ford tractor with a blade and his first partner was Dorothy. She answered the home phone for C.P., and took his business messages; kept his earning records and paid his bills. In 1947 C.P. and his brother Joe Downing formed a partnership named Downing Brothers. Dorothy continued to help with the business until sometime in the early 1950s. She was the stabilizing force as C.P. continued to grow the business for the next 39 years. They moved to Gurley Avenue on Bells Hill in 1946-47 where a new neighborhood was being built for returning G.I.s and their families. A new church named Asbury Methodist Church was built in the neighborhood and C.P. and Dorothy joined the church and many friendships were formed lasting long after they moved to China Spring in 1954.Dorothy and C.P. actively participated in the community for almost 40 years. Dorothy worked with the China Spring ISD as room mother, PTA officer and PTA member for many years. She was a charter sponsor of the award-winning China Spring Band program and first President of the C.S. Band Booster Club. She was a partner with C.P. in each of his volunteer community services. Dorothy was preceded in death by her parents; husband of 63 years, Clovis Paul Downing, Jr.; brothers, Doyle Winningham, Bobby C. Winningham, Elbert E. Winningham; brothers-in-law, Bobby Bates and Joseph Cendrowski; and sister-in-law, Virginia Winningham. Survivors include daughter Clova Gibson and husband, Ronald Gibson; sons, Randall Paul Downing and wife, Glenda and Rodney Dale Downing and wife, Jean. Dorothy dearly loved and enjoyed her grandchildren, Melet Gibson, Christie Fisher and husband, Scott, Brady Gibson and wife, Vanessa, Shane Downing and wife, Kandi, Heather Beth Downing, Jordan Downing and wife, Dawn, Micah Downing and wife, Angela, Lauren Anderson and husband, Chris, and Whitney Downing. She also cherished her 14 great grandchildren and sisters, Wanda Gordon and husband, William Gordon of Clifton; Bee Cendrowski of Waco, and Barbara Bates of Conway, Arkansas; and beloved nieces and nephews. Pallbearers are: Shane Downing, Brady Gibson, Jordan Downing, Micah Downing, Andrew Downing and Chris Anderson. Honorary pallbearers are Dorothy\'s nephews.

An Atlanta man has been sentenced to more than five years in prison for his conviction in a money laundering scheme that involved a Pittsburgh-based co-conspirator and bilked nearly $350,000 from its victims, federal prosecutors said. Akintayo Bolorunduro, 36, of Georgia faces 63 months in prison and must pay restitution of $646,606.59 to people who lost money through fraudulent wire transfers, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said Thursday. Between January 2016 and last July, Bolorunduro conspired with others to launder money obtained through business email and fax scams, prosecutors said. The scams caused the affected businesses to wire real estate settlement funds to bank accounts controlled by Bolorunduro and the other conspirators, including at least one Pittsburgh-based person who accepted a fraudulent wire transfer of about $411,600, prosecutors said. Bolorunduro then directed his partner in Pittsburgh to purchase three cashier checks totaling $131,000 made payable to fake names and businesses and send them to Bolorunduro in Georgia. A separate scam resulted in a fraudulent wire transfer of about $235,000, of which Bolorunduro received a portion, according to prosecutors. On April 18, 2016, he deposited $20,000 into a bank account he opened using a fake Nigerian passport. Officials did not provide further details. They did not cite the number of victims nor name the Pittsburgh-based co-conspirator. U.S. Judge Arthur J. Schwab said Bolorunduro's sentence was appropriate because of his role in the conspiracy, the seriousness of the offense and the scope of financial losses. Assistant U.S. attorneys Adam N. Hallowell and Charles A. Eberle prosecuted the case with help from the FBI. Natasha Lindstrom is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Pleasant\'s Wyatt Wells on a Division II district championship in the boys pole vault Wednesday afternoon at Westerville North High School. Rob McCurdy/The Marion Star Pleasant\'s Wyatt Wells won the pole vault at the Division II district meet Wednesday afternoon at Westerville North High School.(Photo: Rob McCurdy/The Marion Star)Buy Photo WESTERVILLE - It was a pole vaulting competition like no other. Pleasant\'s Wyatt Wells didn\'t just win a Division II boys district championship; he persevered. The meet started Tuesday, but the District 2 pole vaulting didn\'t end until Wednesday evening at Westerville North High School. Just as competitors were wrapping up warmups, a lightning storm delayed it, then delayed it some more. They got more warmups in, but there were tornado sirens blaring which halted it again. Eventually time ran out and Wells and his fellow vaulters had to come back the next day. ""It’s definitely a mental thing when you’re getting ready the whole week for that one day and then you warm up and you have to stop because it’s storming,"" Wells said. ""You warm up again and you have to stop. It’s a mental game, but that’s what pole vaulting is. You have to get by those mental hurdles. That’s a mental hurdle and I have to get past that. That’s what gets you to higher heights."" When the external forces like weather — or breaking the crossbar like on his next to last attempt causing further delay — are conspiring against him, Wells turns to himself. ""I try to focus and block everything out and just pole vault. I think pole vault and every aspect of the vault from the start to the run to the takeoff to the swing to the top finish. I go through every part and try to make sure I’ve got it all right in my head,"" he said. It worked. The junior went 12 feet to take the district championship and qualify for next week\'s regional meet in Lexington. Wells started vaulting in the seventh grade, but it didn\'t click for him until his freshman season when he went 11-6 to finish seventh in the district. His previous best before that day was 10-0. ""I didn’t get to regionals, but I can do this. I can be as high as all these other people getting out at districts,"" he said. ""That’s when I said, ‘You can do this. You can vault with these seniors.’ That’s what really put me into the mindset of going out to be that person that everyone is trying to catch up with."" Last year he was third in the district at 12-0, but failed to clear that opening height at the regional meet. Wells is hoping for better days ahead. ""I didn’t really know how today was going to turn out because my steps have been off and I’ve been under,"" he said. ""We’ve been trying to fix that and work on that. I was a little better today, but I still have to work on it for regionals. Overall, I’m super excited about it."" Wells will be joined at the regional by River Valley\'s Scott Brady who was fourth in District 1 with a best of 12-0. RV\'s girls tandem of Abbie Waddell and Gemma Starrs went 1-2 in their district after vaults of 10-0. ""We’ll shoot for a lot better this year,"" Wells said of failing to reach last year\'s opening height at the regional. ""It’s personal. It’s always trying to get that higher height and overcome those obstacles and keep getting higher."" In practice, he\'s gone as high at 13-6. Now it\'s a matter of translating that on meet day. ""It’s trying to get in the zone and stay in the zone and block out all those distractions,"" Wells said after doing just that Tuesday and Wednesday. ""I think it’s going to take 13-6 at least to get to state. We’re going to try for it."" rmccurdy@gannett.com Work 740-375-5158 Cell 419-610-0998 Twitter @McMotorsport Instagram @rob_mccurdy_star', ""Please log in, or sign up for a new account and purchase a subscription to continue reading.

A Pittsburgh man will spend more than seven years in a federal prison after prosecutors showed he possessed more than four bricks of heroin and was planning to sell it, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady announced Friday. William Cutler, 37, according to prosecutors, came to the attention of the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014 when they were investigating drug trafficking in Western Pennsylvania. “That ultimately led to Title III wiretap interceptions over the phones of several individuals, including William Cutler,” prosecutors said in a release. On Feb. 24, 2015, the New Kensington Police stopped Cutler for having improperly tinted windows, according to court documents. A search of his car revealed a gun hidden under the hood, $7,000 and more than four bricks of heroin. “During the course of the conspiracy, Cutler was responsible for distributing 1 kilogram or more of heroin,” prosecutors said. Cutler was found guilty of possession with the intent to distribute and sentenced Thursday by U.S. District Judge David Cercone to 88 months in prison. The investigation leading to Cutler's arrest was administered by the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, a group headed by the DEA and including the state Office of the Attorney General, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Pennsylvania State Police and nearly a dozen municipal and county agencies. Assistant U.S. Attorney Shanicka L. Kennedy prosecuted the case. Matthew Medsger is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach him at 724-226-4675, mmedsger@tribweb.com or via Twitter @matthew_medsger.

A Pittsburgh man, who prosecutors showed was the ringleader of a complex tax fraud scheme carried out while he was already behind bars, will spend another eight years in a federal prison, U.S. Attorney Scott Brady announced Friday. U.S. District Judge Mark R. Hornak also sentenced Reginald Harris, 51, to five years of supervised release and payment of about $250,000 in restitution after he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit bank and mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Prosecutors say Harris filed fraudulent tax returns and collected refunds in other peoples' names from Sept. 2009 until Dec. 2012 while he was an inmate at a state corrections facility in Cambria County. Many of the fraudulent refunds were filed in the names of inmates also housed with Harris, according to prosecutors. When Harris was released from state prison he was charged with a federal drug offense, prosecutors say. While imprisoned for that crime and awaiting sentencing for his previous tax fraud at North East Ohio Corrections Center in Youngstown, prosecutors say Harris continued to file tax fraudulent tax returns. “Harris was the leader of the complex tax fraud scheme ... he was responsible for the filing of hundreds of tax returns that sought hundreds of thousands of fraudulent refunds,” prosecutors said in a release. “He coordinated the scheme through several non-incarcerated individuals who established banks accounts, mailed the tax returns, and obtained the information for the tax returns. Harris also taught other inmates how to conduct the scheme.” Prosecutors say Hornak described Harris' criminal history as a “buffet of criminal conduct” which included a history of fraud, theft, drug sales and threats of violence. According to prosecutors, Hornak expressed concern that a prison sentence alone seemed unlikely to deter Harris' further criminal conduct. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brendan T. Conway prosecuted the case. Matthew Medsger is a Tribune-Review staff writer. Reach him at 724-226-4675, mmedsger@tribweb.com or via Twitter @matthew_medsger.

Two Pittsburgh-area men were convicted by a federal jury Monday of robbery, and multiple drug and gun violations. Kahlil Shelton, 23, formerly of Duquesne, and Deron Howell, 25, formerly of Swissvale, are accused of an August 2017 armed drug robbery in Cranberry in which one person was shot and wounded. Howell faced additional charges as prosecutors contend he was involved in a July 2017 robbery of four people he picked up at Pittsburgh International Airport. Prosecutors said Howell drove the four victims to Pittsburgh's Lincoln-Lemington neighborhood, where they were held at gunpoint and robbed of $6,700 and their luggage. “This case arose from a marijuana deal gone bad when the buyers attempted to rob the seller. Shots were fired and one of the participants was wounded. All of this occurred in a quiet Cranberry neighborhood,” said U.S. Attorney Scott Brady. “Project Safe Neighborhoods, the federal program to combat the illegal use of firearms, is designed to address exactly this type of violent criminal activity.” Police were able to link the two crimes due to their similar styles, Brady said. Shelton could face more than seven years in prison, and Howell faces more than 30 years. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 1. Patrick Varine is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

The fund appears to be oversubscribed, considering that its initial filing (dated November 14, 2017) stated a target fund size of $300 million. Fund III also appears to be the firm’s largest to date. According to the firm’s most recent advisory filing with the SEC, last updated in late March 2018, its second fund (“INNOVATION ENDEAVORS PARTNERS II, LLC”) had $236 million in gross asset value, and its first fund (“INNOVATION ENDEAVORS, LLC”) had roughly $107.5 million in gross asset value at the time of filing. All this comes during a time of transition for Innovation Endeavors, which merged with Herzliya, Israel-based Marker LLC in August 2017. As part of the merger, Marker (and its funds) would be renamed Innovation Endeavors. According to Crunchbase data, Marker’s second fund, closed in May 2015, was $207.7 million. The size of its first fund wasn’t available through Crunchbase or public disclosures. According to a now-deleted blog post announcing the merger, a cached version of which Crunchbase News retrieved from the Internet Archive, Marker’s co-founding partners Rick Scanlon and Yuval Shachar, as well as Marker partners Ziv Kop and Liat Aaronson, would join extant Innovation Endeavors GPs Dror Berman and Scott Brady to collectively manage the firm. As part of the merger, the blog post said, “Eric Schmidt will be a co-founder, a non-managing member and the anchor LP.” According to Israeli business journalist Yasmin Yablonko, publishing in Globes Online, Schmidt was scheduled to be in Israel last week for a closed-door meeting on May 19th, two days prior to the signing date for Fund III’s paperwork, associated with his fundraising activities. As an aside, the “14 leading personalities” attending the meeting would include Israel Innovation Authority CEO Aharon Aharon, Professor Dan Ariely, and Microsoft Israel CEO Assaf Rappaport, among others. On May 18th, though, Israeli tech publication CTech revealed that Ziv Kop is leaving Innovation Endeavors. Kop is the third person from Marker’s investment team to leave Innovation Endeavors since the merger. Both Yuval Schachar and Liat Aaronson left the firm in October 2017, two months after the merger and just before the first LP check was signed for Fund III. These sorts of departures aren’t uncommon during fund mergers and restructuring. Rick Scanlon is the only remaining member of Marker’s investment team listed on the paperwork for the third fund. It’s no secret that Israel is home to strikingly talented engineering and business executive talent, so Innovation Endeavors’ merger with Marker could be seen as a great strategic move. With a third of a billion dollars to deploy in the US, Israel, and elsewhere, it will be interesting to see how the merged fund positions itself in the market and just how much influence Schmidt, an ostensibly non-managing member, exerts on the fund going forward. Crunchbase News did not receive comment prior to publication. Illustration: Li-Anne Dias A quick reminder that things are pretty bonkers right now.

Kahlil Shelton, 23, formerly of Duquesne and Deron Howell, 25, formerly of Swissvale, were found guilty in U.S. District Court. Along with an unknown third man, the pair robbed two people of marijuana last August at a home in the 9100 block of Marshall Road. According to U.S. Attorney Scott Brady's office, Howell and Shelton orchestrated the robbery by telling the victim that they wanted to purchase approximately six pounds of marijuana. Howell, Shelton, and the unknown accomplice then travelled to the victim's house in Cranberry. Upon arrival, Shelton excused himself to go to the bathroom and returned holding a firearm that he pressed to the heads of both of the victims. At this time, Howell stole the marijuana from one of the victims. The second victim struggled with Shelton before attempting to flee from the house. Before the second victim could flee from the house, the third unknown accomplice shot the victim through the chest, but he survived. Shelton and Howell are scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 1. Shelton faces seven years to life in prison, a $250,000 fine or both; Howell faces 30 years to life in prison, a $250,000 fine or both. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Cranberry Police Department and the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police conducted the investigation into the robbery and shooting.

Bob,Rudnick,['http://buffalonews.com/2018/02/09/bowling-derek-pawlowski-took-his-historic-878-series-in-stride/'],b'7013',"['Derek Pawlowski probably seemed the least excited or nervous soul in the house at Transit Lanes last Monday night. ""I was excited inside, but I\'m not a guy that shows a lot of emotion,"" Pawlowski said of his feelings as he was bowling an 878 series in the Monday Doubles League at the Transit Road facility. The 39-year-old right-hander\'s big series tied for the third highest in the annals of the Greater Buffalo USBC Association, according to association manager Bill Palumbo. Left-hander Bob Rudnick\'s 888 at Spare Time Lanes in 2006 still sits on the top of the list and is the highest series ever bowled in Western New York. Next on the GBUSBC list comes an 880 by Fran Kuras at Eden Lanes on Oct. 5, 2009. Pawlowski\'s 878 is right next to the series by Jim McClellan at Abbott Lanes on April 7, 2014. The 878 raised Pawlowski\'s league average to 243.8. Interestingly, unlike a majority of the area\'s best scratch bowlers, Pawlowski bowls in only the one league. ""It the only thing we have time for,"" said Pawlowski, who bowls with his wife, Jennifer, in the league at Transit which boasts some of the best bowlers in the area, male or female. League rosters include names such as Matt Zasowski, Henry Poole, Dan Melidona, Brian Cline, Bill Truman, Marion Singleton, Jessica Mamon and Julie Selk. The Pawlowskis like to stay close to home to tend to their family of three, sons 16 and 9 and a 3-year-old daughter. Also, Derek has to deal with his work schedule as a gate agent for Southwest Airlines, which requires some early morning and weekend shifts. Pawlowski, who lives in Depew but grew up in Marilla, started his big night with a 299 game, leaving a 10-pin. He bowled 300 in his middle game. After a double to start the third game, he converted a 4-pin then struck out for a 279. That moved him into Allie Brandt territory. Brandt, of course, bowled an 886 series in 1939 that stood as an American Bowling Congress record for 49 years. Terry Bennetti broke Brandt\'s Lockport USBC Association record. Pawlowski said he had no inkling, no premonition, that something special such as a career high and his 14th 800 series was in store. ""I\'ve been feeling good and bowling well, but there was nothing special,"" he said. According to Pawlowski, there were no flukes. He was consistently in the pocket, no crossovers or light hits although he admits he was a little slow in his 4-pin leave in his third game. Despite the 878 series, the Pawlowskis, who call their team Whatever P & P, were outscored by their opponents Dennis and Todd Cummings in the league match that night. ""My wife bowled about her average and the other team bowled well. They were good bowlers and the bowled above their averages,"" Pawlowski said. Pawlowski bowled from seventh grade on for the varsity bowling team at Iroquois. He comes from a family of bowlers but essentially is self-taught. ""It\'s just pretty much my own style,"" he said. There was no special coaching from his parents, but lots of encouragement. ""They always kept me into it,"" he said. When he was younger, Pawlowski tried to develop a cranking style, but gave it up on the advice of his high school coach. ""It\'s just pretty much a lot of revolution, a heavy forward roller,"" he said of his style. ""I don\'t crank it, but there is a little bend through the shot."" Although he\'s a once-a-week league bowler, Pawlowski bowled in the City Tournament and Obenauer Masters each year – he qualified for match play each of the last three Obies – and makes the annual trip to the USBC Open, which will be in Syracuse this year. Derek and Jennifer also are regular competitors in the GBUSBC Me & Mine Tournament, which gets under way Saturday at AMF Lancaster Lanes. Pin chasers * Today\'s squads are sold out for the Greater Buffalo USBC Association\'s Me & Mine Tournament, but walk-in spots are available for Sunday\'s squads at 12:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 6 p.m, especially the two later shifts. The Me & Mine continues next Saturday and Sunday as well. * None of the local bowlers made it to match play in the PBA Tournament of Champions, which will wrap up Sunday at Riviera Lanes, in Fairlawn, Ohio. Ronnie Russell of Marion, Ind., led the 18-games of qualifying with 4,166 and went 6-2 in the first round of match play on Thursday to keep he lead. Ryan Ciminelli, now a Clarence resident, finished 30th with 3,883 for 18 games. Brad Angelo was 33rd with 3,880. Liz Johnson was 75th at 3,531. For the record, Johnny Petraglia was 79th with 3,262 in his final T of C. Some big names that did not get to match play: Dom Barrett, Rhino Page, Osku Palermaa, Walter Ray Williams, Norm Duke, Pete Weber and Parker Bohn III. * Maddie Jensen (Orchard Park), who averaged a 213.2 including a 269 high single, led Villa Maria to fourth place in the Boulevard Bowl Classic in Schenectady last weekend. It\'s the first bowling season for the Vikings team coached by PBA pro Jack Jurek. Sara Snyder of Depew shot 191.2 for Saint Francis (Pa.) in the Boulevard. ECC was eighth. In the men\'s competition, ECC was third as Alex Leader (223.6 average), Joshua Large (222.2) and Dominic Germano (221.4) led the way. Large averaged 216.2 to lead ECC to fifth place in the Schenectady County CC Invitational last Sunday. Britney Grey\'s 197.4 led Saint Francis (Pa.) to second place in the SCCC women\'s division. ECC was fifth.']",,,,,

Bob,Rudnick,['http://buffalonews.com/2018/03/30/bowling-lackawannas-gable-is-in-the-groove/'],b'7011',"['Anybody who has been following our daily Area Bowling reports can\'t help but have noticed the performances of Chris Gable at Abbott Lanes. Some of those numbers seem to jump off the page. The 25-year-old former Lackawanna High bowler and Section VI all-star team member has shot some of the highest series, not only for this season, but all-time in Western New York. In October, Gable shot 279-299-300 for a 878 as a sub in the BW\'s Cagney C2 Tuesday Night league at Abbott. He left a 4-pin in the middle game. He threatened the Western New York record 888 bowled by Bob Rudnick at Spare Time Lanes in 2006. That erased the 886 by Allie Brandt of Lockport in 1939. Terry Bennetti of Lockport shot an 878 in 2007. Gable, who has worked in various jobs at Abbott Lanes for the last seven or eight years, has not been an overnight sensation. He averaged 233 in the Skip Wood Memorial and 231 in the Hammond Pro Shop/ Darin Tesmer Memorial League at Abbott last season and 233 as a sub in the Dick Robinson Insurance League. Gable averaged 222 in the WNY Sealcoat & Supplies League at AMF Airport. This year his average has been in the high 230s most of the season. Gable was overshadowed as a high school bowler and understands why. He came along at the same time as other teen phenoms, Chad Mee, Andy Herbert and Eric Michalski. Nevertheless he contributed an 1,174 total to the team that won the state intersectional championship for Section VI. Chris Gable, third from right, was part of the intersectional state championship team for Section VI in 2012. From left to right: Dan Kaplan, Section VI Bowling Chairman; Eric Michalski, Amherst; Andrew Herbert, Eden; Shane Ryan, Silver Creek; Chris Gable, Lackawanna; Chad Mee, Frontier; Coach Mike Rodgers, Niagara Falls; taken at Thruway Lanes on April 3, 2012. Missing from the photo are Tyler Laubacker, Lockport and Coach Matt Burt, Cheektowaga. (Mark Mulville/Buffalo News} Gable credits any improvement in his game since then to just learning to be more consistent. A right-hander, Gable says he\'s always thrown a pronounced hook. ""This year I\'m trying to cut down on the hook and go more straight up,"" he said. Gable has no personal coach. ""My dad helps me here and there,"" he said Gable bowls full-time in three leagues, two at Abbott and one at Airport, and subs in two other leagues at Abbott. He has 17 300 games to his credit, including six this year. He remembers ""four or five"" 800 series this season. Gable has never entered the Greater Buffalo USBC Association\'s premier event, the George A. Obenauer Masters, and said he has no plans to enter when it comes up in May. He say he intends to enter in 2019. ""The Obenauer is not in my plans for now for this year, but I might change my mind,"" he says. Open Championship begins The first of nearly 40,000 bowlers who will participate over the 3 1/2 months took to the lanes March 24 at the Oncenter in Syracuse for the start of the 2018 United States Bowling Congress Open Championship. The opening ceremonies included the traditional first ball. It was thrown by Patrick VanWagenen of Kingston, who was bowling his first Open Championship. VanWagenen was chosen at random for the Joe Bowler honor of presiding over the opening of the national championship. The Open returned to Syracuse for the first time since 1999 on 48 lanes set up in the city\'s convention center. Kurt Pilon, 45, of Warren, Mich., took the early lead in Regular All-Events, averaging 243 over nine games for a 2,186. Even though it\'s early, Pilon\'s total stands a good chance of standing up. Brad Angelo of Lockport was last year\'s Regular All-Events winner with 2,176. Pilon shot 763 in team, 752 in doubles and 671 in singles. Angelo\'s breakdown from 2017 was 735 in singles, 723 in doubles and 718 in team. Participation records are set every year. One notable mark was set on opening day by Susan Martin, 61, of Reno, Nev. She became the first woman to bowl in 25 Open Championships. The tournament was male-only from its founding in 1901 until it the American Bowling Congress opened its membership to women in 1994. Martin was among the women bowling in the national tournament for the first time that year. ""This is exciting,"" Martin said. ""I\'ve wanted to accomplish certain things in my bowling career, and this is one of them. To get to 25 years, and be the first woman to do it, is pretty remarkable."" Pin chasers * Daemen College\'s women\'s team finished fourth in the East Coast Conference Championship last weekend in Port Jefferson Station on Long Island. The Wildcats turned in a dramatic comeback to make the final four. Trailing, 3-0, Chestnut Hill College in their Baker format best-of-seven quarterfinal series on Saturday, they rallied to win four straight games. Earlier in the day, Coach David Zajac\'s Daemen team defeated Felician, 4-3, before losing to Lincoln Memorial (Tenn.), 4-0, in the winners bracket semifinal. Sophomore Rachel Steele led Daemen with 16.9 pins per frame for 36 frames on the day. A 4-3 loss to Adelphi elimated Daemen the next day. * Reservation deadline is Monday for the Greater Buffalo USBC City Open. The tournament is at Kenmore Lanes April 24 to May 12. Entries will close April 13 for the 46th annual GBUSBC Stan Kowalski Senior Singles at Broadway Sports Center April 21-22. The Obenauer Masters will be at AMF Airport Lanes May 15-20.']",,,,,
Bob,Rudnick,['http://bedfordandbowery.com/2018/04/danny-fields-signed-the-ramones-and-realized-this-is-a-moment/'],b'7010',"['April 5, 2018 By Bradley Spinelli From left: Danny Fields and Sacha Lecca. (Photo: Bradley Spinelli) “I was the best friend of several superstars,” Danny Fields told the crowd at Spoonbill Studio yesterday, explaining how he went on to sign Iggy and the Stooges, manage the Ramones, and become one of the godfathers of punk. Fields is a wonderful, weaving raconteur, with wandering recollections of a time when being in the right place and meeting the right people was all there was to it. Set up with prompts by Sacha Lecca, deputy photo editor at Rolling Stone, Fields started at the “beginning,” which meant hanging around the San Remo on Bleecker and falling into Andy Warhol’s orbit. His role was “kinda shadowy,” a witness to it all. “Suddenly some of us were very rich, very famous.” The Velvet Underground, Edward Albee. “I don’t know how I got there,” Fields says, and you sort of believe it. It goes something like this: Helping out some female friends with a folk act, he called the Whiskey A-Go-Go in L.A. to make sure they would be well taken care of, and someone at the Whiskey asked him to take care of their new band while they were in New York. “Women especially were in a frenzy over the lead singer.” Fields met The Doors, and then Elektra Records’ Jac Holtzman, and heard a song—“something about fire”—and said it would be a hit despite the “extremely pretentious organ solo.” Fields was asked to start the Elektra publicity department, which meant an expense account and plane tickets—“heady days.” Through Bob Rudnick and Kocaine Karma Twins, Fields started DJing a radio show, playing Pink Floyd, who had “never been heard in America,” and this was “before Dark Side, when they were really amazing.” The show got him to Detroit to see MC5, and he was knocked out. “If you like us,” Wayne Kramer told him, “you’ll like our little brother band—The Psychedelic Stooges. “I heard them before I saw them,” Fields said, and then “there was Iggy. What a bonus.” His delivery said it all—Iggy was gorgeous. Field called Elektra to say he’d seen two bands, one revolutionary, and “the other, they look harder to get developed, but there was something there that was quite magic.” He was told, “Offer the big band $20K, the little one 5.” The bands were all slack jaws: “Are you kidding?” The deal was done the next day. The Ramones came after Fields: “They Bombarded me—‘you’ve got to come see us, you’re gonna like us.’” He’d been writing a column for a Village Voice alternative, The Soho Weekly News, writing about Television and Patti Smith, “because they were the first to invent CBGB world.” The first Ramones song he heard was “I Don’t Wanna Go Down to the Basement.” “They had everything, they were perfect. I liked them so much that after, [they said] ‘Do you want to write about us?’ [I said] ‘I went to manage you.’” The response: “We need new drums, can you come up with three thousand dollars?” Fields talked us through some slides—ostensibly, photographs were why we were there. His new book, My Ramones, is a redesign of what was first a limited edition from Fields’s massive collection. He got into taking photographs partly from his friendship with photographer Linda Eastman (later Mrs. McCartney)—“Why do some ppl get called artists? It’s because they slice off a little piece of something, a person or a scene” — and partly because, after getting The Ramones signed to Sire, “There was nothing for me to do.” So, “I’ll take pictures, because this should be recorded, and I love this band, and this is a moment.” Favorites included the band standing in trash behind CBGBs; at a show in New Jersey that they played with Blondie (“The only band in this whole universe they actually liked, that they didn’t see as a threat, and were fine with”); and flipping through records at a “store on 2nd Avenue that no longer exists. This whole process no longer exists—unless you’re a vinyl nut.” During the Q&A, Fields recalled the time a fan yelled that Johnny’s driving a Cadillac wasn’t very punk rock. Intimating that he could drive whatever (the fuck) he wanted to, Johnny replied, “I invented punk”—perhaps the most punk statement there is.

At last week\'s candidates town hall, Capt. Joe Duffy introduced Capt. Jim Halsey as his undersheriff. ""I would argue the position of undersheriff is as important as the office of sheriff,"" Duffy said. Halsey is a 30-year veteran of law enforcement, and a 30-year Navy Seabee. ""He did two tours in Iraq, so he knows a little something about leadership."" Capt. Dan Coverley has chosen Sgt. Ron Elges as his running mate. Elges started with the Douglas County Sheriff\'s Office in 1993 as a reserve deputy and became a full time deputy in 1994. He was promoted to investigator in 2005, and then to sergeant in 2009. He has also been the SWAT team leader for 15 years. ""Ron connects with this community on so many levels and gives it his time and talents, and teaches others on a daily basis,"" said a Coverley in a campaign post on social media. Elges is the brother of the deputy involved in the 2001 incident which led to a 2002 lawsuit naming Coverley and the sheriff\'s office. Dean Paris is choosing to not appoint an undersheriff at this time. ""The undersheriff will be selected from within the office,"" said Paris. ""I will send an open invitation to the deputies who are interested to submit a resume, and a panel of peers will select the best qualified,"" Paris said. Dave Brady said he is weighing his options but has not made a final decision yet. When Brady ran in 2014, former Sheriff\'s Capt. Steve Orr joined the campaign. According to the county human resources department, candidates for undersheriff must have been a captain for two years before taking the position, or in a equivalent position, such as a colonel in the military. However, the sheriff is a constitutional officer and can either pick whomever he wants to be undersheriff, or even go without. Not all sheriff\'s have had an undersheriff, choosing a different structure for the office. Pierini was Sheriff Jerry Maple\'s undersheriff for three years before he was appointed sheriff in 1997 when Maple left. Pierini went without an undersheriff for seven years, instead relying on two chief deputies. Bob Rudnick was promoted to undersheriff from chief deputy in 2004. Howell was promoted from lieutenant to undersheriff in 2006 after Rudnick retired from the position.

EPA-EFE/DAVID FERNANDEZ Argentine club Independiente, winners of the Copa Sudamericana, on Thursday beat Colombia's Millonarios 1-0 in a group G match of the Copa Libertadores. In a closely fought match, Independiente's Martin Benitez scored the only goal in the 23rd minute to secure his team's first victory in the 2018 edition of the tournament, After losing to Deportivo Lara in Venezuela, the club, managed by Ariel Holan, played decisively in front of a home crowd to beat the Colombians, who had played a goalless draw against Brazil's Corinthians in their first outing. The Argentine side played on the offensive right from the start of the first half, repeatedly trying to get the ball past Millonarios goalie, the Venezuelan Wilker Farinez. After three missed chances, Benitez finally took advantage of an accurate pass to shoot past Farinez on the right. Millonarios attempted to fight back in the second half, with Roberto Ovelar, Santiago Monotoya and Christian Huerfano trying to break in with mid-range shots, but the Independiente defense stood its test. Independiente are now set to play against group leader Corinthians on April 18, while Millonarios will play against host Deportivo Lara a day earlier in the third round of matches in Group G of the Copa Libertadores.

Barcelona win extends gap to 12 points Villarreal had a potentially decisive say on the LaLiga title race on Sunday as they secured a 2-1 victory over Atletico Madrid, a result which leaves Los Colchoneros' title hopes hanging by a thread. Following the Blaugrana's victory over Athletic Club earlier in the day, Diego Simeone's charges knew that a defeat at the Estadio de la Ceramica would leave the Catalan giants with a potentially unassailable 11-point lead. The match actually started well for Los Rojiblancos, they created a number of early chances and went ahead inside 20 minutes. Antoine Griezmann has since been widely criticised for his theatrical fall in the penalty area, however Jaume Costa's challenge on the Frenchman was deemed a foul by David Fernandez Borbalan. Griezmann tucked away the penalty, much to the ire of the home crowd, and from then on it was a vintage Atleti display under the former River Plate coach. Atletico Madrid were compact, resolute in defence and didn't go searching for the second goal. Until the last 10 minutes of the match, it appeared to be working. The points appeared to be heading back to the capital until Enes Unal produced one of his finest moments since joining Villarreal. His first goal came with nine minutes left to play, the Turkish international showcased his aerial prowess beating Jan Oblak with a powerful header from an awkward starting position. It was at this moment that the visitors began to panic, rather uncharacteristically, and Villarreal sensed there was a chance for a second goal. With just minutes left to play, Unal got another golden chance and he took it, Atletico failed to clear a free-kick with the ball only travelling to the edge of the penalty area. A powerful shot was sent towards Oblak's goal with Unal in position to tap the ball in from close range, completing a memorable comeback. It still had time to get worse for Atleti, as Vitolo was dismissed in injury time for a clash that hardly seemed worthy of the punishment. © Marzo 2018 Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Our friends at Football Whispers have scoured the European media to round-up the latest transfer news and big stories. Bayern Munich have made a decision on the future of Robert Lewandowski, who\'s been subject of Real Madrid and Manchester United transfer talk. The German club do not want to sell the forward, who is under contract at the Bundesliga leaders until 2021. (Kicker) Guillermo Amor, Barcelona\'s director of institutional and sporting relations, says the club will accept whatever decision Andres Iniesta makes over his future.

Luciano Spalletti\'s side are also confident of bringing in Racing Club striker Lautaro Martinez, despite him also being a Borussia Dortmund transfer target. The Nerazzurri will also make a bid for Kevin Strootman if they are playing in the Champions League next season, and could offer Marcelo Brozovic or Joao Mario to Roma as part of any deal. Their final summer signing would likely be a left-back, with Domenico Criscito of Zenit St Petersburg their main target. (Gazzetta dello Sport) Giorgio Chiellini is a doubt for the first leg of Juventus\' Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. The suspected muscle strain the defender suffered against SPAL on Saturday is worse than first feared. The 33-year-old was initially considered doubtful for Italy\'s upcoming friendlies against Argentina and England but is now certain to miss those games.

His current deal in France runs out at the end of the season, but there is an option for a further year, which Nice intend to exploit to get around €10m for the Italian. (Gazzetta dello Sport) France Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has denied coach Bruno Genesio offered his resignation after their midweek Europa League exit to CSKA Moscow. Speaking after their win this weekend at Marseille, Aulas said: ""Bruno didn\'t offer his resignation, I didn\'t have to refuse that.

(Sud Ouest) ©2018 Sky UK', 'Sevilla suffered a hangover from their Champions League triumph over Manchester United as they lost 2-1 at mid-table Leganes in La Liga on Sunday, their sixth defeat in 12 league games under coach Vincenzo Montella. BARCELONA: Barcelona took a giant step towards winning the La Liga title after they beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 on Sunday and nearest challengers Atletico Madrid lost 2-1 at Villarreal, giving the Catalans an 11-point lead at the top of the standings. Cristiano Ronaldo scored four times as champions Real Madrid thrashed Girona 6-3 in a hugely entertaining game and moved to within four points of unseating Atletico in second place. Paco Alcacer took the place of suspended striker Luis Suarez in the starting line-up and scored a first goal in three months to put Barca ahead in the eighth minute at the Nou Camp, side-footing home a pass from Jordi Alba. Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row in all competitions and for the 25th time in this league campaign when he doubled Barca\'s lead in the 30th minute with a deadly strike into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. Atletico forward Antoine Griezmann won and converted a penalty to put his side ahead at Villarreal in the 20th minute. However, Turkey striker Enes Unal headed in a deserved equaliser in the 82nd and then struck the winner from close range in stoppage time. The visitors had forward Vitolo sent off moments later for pushing Villarreal forward Nicola Sansone. Barca lead the standings on 75 points with nine games remaining. Atletico are second with 64, while Real are third on 60. Valencia are fourth while Villarreal climbed above Sevilla into fifth after Vincenzo Montella\'s side were beaten 2-1 at Leganes. The Catalans were rampant in the first half and could have taken a heavier lead into the break as Brazilian midfielder Philippe Coutinho hit the woodwork twice and his compatriot Paulinho struck a post. The unbeaten league leaders slowed down in the second half and Athletic came into the game for the first time but they rarely came close to troubling goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""We scored twice in the first half and could have really finished them off, then in the second half we took our foot off the pedal without realising,"" Barca coach Ernesto Valverde told a news conference. ""The two halves were very different, perhaps conditioned by the first. There weren\'t many chances in the second half, for us or them."" Atletico have not managed to beat Villarreal at home or away since April 2015 and were fortunate to take the lead from the spot after Griezmann appeared to go down easily following a challenge from Jaume Costa. SLACK DEFENDING Villarreal\'s players had surrounded referee David Fernandez Borbalan after that decision and vented their fury at him again in the second half when he refused to award them a penalty when Carlos Bacca went down in the area. The home side kept on pushing for an equaliser and Atletico coach Diego Simeone sacrificed Griezmann for captain Gabi with 10 minutes remaining to try and protect the lead but his side ended up losing the game due to slack defending. ""There\'s no explanation for what happened, we didn\'t defend well from the two set pieces and next time we need to be more focused,"" said Atletico midfielder Saul Niguez. ""I have the sensation that I lost us the game,"" added Simeone. ""The players made a huge effort and I couldn\'t help them with my decisions."" Ronaldo struck four goals in a game for the first time this season in Real\'s thrilling win over Girona. The Portuguese striker has now netted 22 times in the league this season, trailing Messi by just three goals. Ronaldo leapfrogged Luis Suarez into second place on the Liga\'s top scorer\'s list.

The Nerazzurri will also make a bid for Kevin Strootman if they are playing in the Champions League next season, and could offer Marcelo Brozovic or Joao Mario to Roma as part of any deal. Their final summer signing would likely be a left-back, with Domenico Criscito of Zenit St Petersburg their main target. (Gazzetta dello Sport) Giorgio Chiellini is a doubt for the first leg of Juventus’ Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. The suspected muscle strain the defender suffered against SPAL on Saturday is worse than first feared. The 33-year-old was initially considered doubtful for Italy’s upcoming friendlies against Argentina and England but is now certain to miss those games. (Tuttosport) Mario Balotelli’s agent Mino Raiola is determined to find the Nice striker a new club. The Ligue 1 side are open to selling him, but only if they get a decent fee. His current deal in France runs out at the end of the season, but there is an option for a further year, which Nice intend to exploit to get around €10m for the Italian. (Gazzetta dello Sport) France Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has denied coach Bruno Genesio offered his resignation after their midweek Europa League exit to CSKA Moscow. Speaking after their win this weekend at Marseille, Aulas said: “Bruno didn’t offer his resignation, I didn’t have to refuse that. Bruno, despite a defeat, has motivated this group of players, you can see it each day, he is doing a great job.” (L’Equipe) Talks between an American investment group and Bordeaux are advanced ahead of a proposed takeover this summer.

David,Fernandez,['https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/can-ryan-christie-star-celtic-12234150'],b'6998',"['The playmaker\'s loan at Aberdeen is coming to an end amid talk of a new one-year deal at Parkhead - but does he have what it takes to flourish for the Hoops? He may tell you he\'s not looking too far ahead, but inside Ryan Christie will know there\'s a career crossroads creeping up on his horizon. Yes, there\'s another Scotland cap in the offing and the small matter of a Scottish Cup semi-final with Aberdeen - it\'s fair to say his time at Pittodrie has been a success. He does, however, remain a Celtic player and no matter what transpires before the current campaign ends, the 23-year-old is expected to report to Lennoxtown for pre-season in the summer. An article emerged on Thursday that Christie had opened talks with his parent club over a 12-month extension to his current deal, a sign that Brendan Rodgers wants to get the measure of him in a Celtic jersey. The playmaker\'s star has risen considerably since joining Aberdeen , firstly on a short-term deal in January 2017 before agreeing a season-long loan last summer. Christie plays with an elegance not often associated with the Scottish Premiership. He can pick a pass, glide past a man and - importantly - has an eye for goal. In short, it\'s easy to see why Rodgers wants to give him a chance and it\'s equally clear why McInnes would bite your hand off to sign him full-time. But does he have what it takes to flourish at Parkhead? As Steve Tosh will tell you, talent alone isn\'t enough in Glasgow\'s east end. ""Ryan\'s situation reminds me of an ex-teammate of mine, David Fernandez,"" the former Aberdeen man recalls. ""David was fantastic for us when I was at Livingston, a class above. ""He went to Celtic but they had boys like John Hartson and Henrik Larsson. David was fantastic but you need a run of games under a manager that believes in you."" In Christie\'s case, he\'s already cited McInnes as a key factor in keeping his confidence high, and the results of that have been clear to see on the Pittodrie pitch. He\'s shown that with the boss\' backing he can produce, shouldering the burden as Aberdeen\'s main creative outlet, although his form has been patchy this season. The trouble at Celtic will be convincing Rodgers he\'s worthy of that role over a host of established internationals who are on course to deliver their manager an historic double treble. Tosh sees a lot of the Hoops\' current crop of first-team stars in Christie, but is unsure whether that\'s a blessing or a curse for the Inverness-born midfielder. ""I can only go on what Brendan seems to like and Ryan ticks a lot of those boxes,"" he said. ""He\'s a fantastic football player, he\'s very Callum McGregor-esque. ""And that could be his problem, that the players he would come up against in his position, there\'s not going to be much between him and the players holding those jerseys. ""The likes of Tom Rogic, McGregor, even Stuart Armstrong to a certain degree. ""Ryan\'s of that ilk and I think he needs the same as Armstrong did - a run of games under his belt and I\'m sure he would flourish."" Few people backed Armstrong to become a key player under Rodgers but the Celtic boss seems to revel in the opportunity to harness young talent. In Christie he will have a player with all the base ingredients and a healthy dose of Premiership experience thrown into the mix. If Rodgers wants to help write another success story in the same theme as Armstrong and McGregor then he need look no further than Christie. And, as Tosh points out, the Celtic boss isn\'t a man to chuck around new contracts on a whim. Does he already know where he wants Christie to fit in? Tosh said: ""From Brendan\'s point of view, he\'s obviously had a look at A) why Ryan was signed in the first place and B) how well he\'s done at Aberdeen. ""So the next big question for Ryan and for Brendan is to see if he can do what\'s he done at two other clubs on a regular basis at Celtic. ""He could get a run of games at Celtic and he could be a 20-goal-a-season midfielder because he\'s got that eye for finding the net. He really could be a Frank Lampard. ""But he could also go there and play 10 games it might not work for him. I do think he has the skill set and the attitude. His attitude is spot on and he comes from a good background."" There is, of course, the possibility that Aberdeen will once again attempt to tie Christie up on a full-time deal. The temptation to continue being the main man at Pittodrie may hold a certain appeal, especially if Celtic further strengthen their attacking options in the summer. But, despite being a Dons man, Tosh insists he\'d be mad not to grasp the chance make it big at Parkhead. He added: ""If Brendan says he wants to get Ryan back and have a look at him, I think it would be silly of Ryan to turn that opportunity down. ""If he gets a run of games, it wouldn\'t surprise me if that run continued and continued and he becomes a very good player for Celtic, and hopefully thereafter for the national team.""']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0
David,Fernandez,['http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/2018/03/23/caribbean-delivers-start-st-thomas-international-regatta/'],b'6997',"['Published on March 23rd, 2018 St Thomas, USVI (March 23, 2018) – The Caribbean lived up to its reputation as one of the best places on the planet to sail during the first day of racing in the 45th St. Thomas International Regatta (STIR). The nearly fifty boats, competing in four classes, reveled in the perfect conditions: 10- to 15-knots of breeze, 3- to 5-foot swells, blue sunny skies and temperatures comfortably in the 80s. With the weather throwing no curve balls, the big focus of the day for the racers was on each other. This proved formidable given the depth of talent in each class. “We’ve sailed extensively in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe, such as in the UK and the Netherlands,” says Philippe Moortgat, the Brussels, Belgian-based owner of the Swan 45, Samantaga, Moortgat has vacationed with his family for many years in the Virgin Islands during the winter holidays and without his boat. This year, he decided to combine his love of racing and the Caribbean on a trip to STIR and other Caribbean regattas. The first day of racing was indeed rewarding as without local knowledge and nearly half of his crew novices, Samantaga leads the CSA Spinnaker Racing class after two races. “I really like sailing around the island, around the rocks. It’s new to us here, but we had good wind and a very good day.” The Spinnaker 1 class is extremely competitive with only four points separating the first through fifth places. In fact, both second and third place boats, Puerto Rico’s Luis Juarbe’s Melges 32, Soca and the USA’s Robin Team’s chartered J/122, Teamwork/El Ocaso, respectively are tied on points. Ditto for the boats in fourth and fifth place, Antigua’s Bernie Evan-Wong’s RP 37, Team TAZ, and St. Thomas’ Peter Corr’s King 40, Blitz. Blitz won this class in 2017 and Corr hopes to do the same again this year. “The conditions were great,” says Corr. “But the courses today were mainly reaches. Blitz is at its worst reaching. Hopefully we won’t have long reaching runs tomorrow.” In the Spinnaker 2 class, Puerto Rico’s David Fernandez, and his team aboard his Holland 11-meter, Atorrante, didn’t take the lead. That honor belonged to Canada’s Rob Butler’s crew aboard his new Reflex 38, Touch2Play Racing. However, what the Puerto Rico-based team aboard the Holland 11 meter had was a solid third place and great fun. “Touch2Play and Boogaloo (St. Croix’s Peter Stanton’s Melges 24) were the boats we saw most on the course,” says Greg Fink, who trimmed spinnaker on Atorrante. “In fact, in the first race, we were neck and neck with Touch2Play around Buck and Capella islands. We were higher and faster and traded tacks for a while. Eventually, Touch2Play got away from us.” Three of Atorrante crew were 16-year-olds who just graduated from the Optimist dinghy: David Perez Fernandez, Kyle Fink and Fabio Santiago. There was equally close racing in the CSA Non-Spinnaker class between leader, St. Thomas’ Lawrence Aqui driving his Dufour 40, Wild Thing, and second place Hermes, a Pogo 12.5 sailed by Ontario Canada’s Irek Zubko. “At one point, it was almost like we were match racing,” says Zubko. Aqui agrees and explains, “We got into a tacking duel. They beat us at it, but we beat them overall based on handicap.” The one-design IC24 class was the largest with 14 boats. The class lead changed often through the day with St. Thomas’ Chris Rosenberg’s Bill T. emerging on top by two points after five races. One competitor, St. John’s Doug McLean, felt just getting to the start line was a victory. “My IC24 was destroyed in (hurricane) Irma. We hauled it out, built a form and had to rebuild the foredeck. Morgan Avery (one of the original designers of the IC24) was working nearby and shared with us what he would do. That was invaluable. We finally launched the boat three days ago. That was the happiest day of my life since the hurricane. We rigged the boat after that. Now, we’re now only sailing, but holding our own, often in the top five in many races today.” Event information – Racing details – Results Source: STIR Tags: St Thomas International Regatta Launched in 1997, Scuttlebutt provides sailing news with a North American focus.

At the second round, it was down to the top ten players, as five players from each group advanced; and then to the top four players. The top four who clashed were Erwin Woodye (seeded #2) vs Luis Usher (seeded #3), and David Fernandez (seeded #1) vs Johnny Betancourt (seeded #4). In the first series, David Fernandez won over John Betancourt by default; and Luis Usher won Erwin Woodye, Jr. by a 4-1 score. So, it was David Fernandez vs Goliath, Luis Usher; but after David was up, 2-0, Luis made a huge comeback and dropped David, 4-2, leaving him with his slingshot with no stones to shoot. In the end, it was Luis emerging as champ.

The text messages are from 6,000 miles away in Santiago, Chile, where he’s helping resettle a group of young Venezuelans trying to retrace his own immigrant’s journey to a better future. Between deciphering data and writing code, he fields questions that come flying fast: What’s the fastest bus line downtown? How do you apply for an immigrant ID card? Any leads on a job? “Sometimes I’m rude and tell them to look on Google, or I have to just turn off my phone because I get five messages all at once,” said the 34-year-old. The demands on Nunez-Mujica’s time and energy are part of his solitary battle to give those trapped by his homeland’s economic crisis a fresh start abroad. Since the end of last year, he has shelled out around US$40,000 of his own money helping some 40 Venezuelans – most of them complete strangers – migrate to other South America nations. The acts of generosity range from a few months of free rent at an apartment he manages in Santiago to bus fare for a surgeon so he could move to Peru with his wife and daughter. Nunez-Mujica has now launched the crowd-funded Salto Project – based on the Spanish word for “leap” – to scale up the assistance effort, convinced that the only immediate solution to Venezuela’s mess is helping those who can escape. So far he has raised $5,250 but the goal is more than $40,000. “There’s no way someone like me can do anything about the situation in Venezuela, but if I can do a little bit to help people leave that helps me to sleep at night,” he said in an interview from the offices of Slice Technologies, where he earns a modest tech worker’s salary coming up with solutions to improve the e-shopping experience. “I know it’s a drop in the ocean, but it’s something within my reach to do.” It’s a homespun solution to an ever more desperate situation. Mounting hunger, hyperinflation and an authoritarian government are increasingly driving Venezuelans abroad in one of the largest exoduses in Latin America’s history. Independent groups estimate as many as three million to four million Venezuelans have abandoned their home country in recent years, with several hundred thousand fleeing in 2017 alone. Daniel Klie, 25, is one of the recipients of Nunez-Mujica’s “micro-sponsorships”, in his case $200 for a plane ticket to Santiago. With almost no savings to his name, Klie’s first two months in Chile were torment. A college graduate with two degrees, in journalism and library sciences, he worked under the table at a butcher shop, toiling long hours seven days a week for less than the minimum wage. Then, buoyed by Nunez-Mujica’s coaching and moral support, Klie won an internship at an advertising agency and now has a full-time gig earning about $550 a month – five times as much as he made in an entire year holding down three jobs back home. “In Venezuela, trying to save money is a titanic undertaking,” said Klie. “It’s all about trying to eat and survive each day. Planning ahead is impossible.” Nunez-Mujica, who abandoned Venezuela in 2011, first for Chile and then three years ago the US, said the idea of helping others was born from the frustration he felt hearing stories and seeing pictures of friends who had lost weight struggling to feed themselves. Born into a working class family in the Andean city of Merida, Nunez-Mujica recalls going days without eating as a struggling college student in Caracas during the early days of President Hugo Chavez’s socialist revolution. He said it was only thanks to the bag of groceries provided each month by his thesis adviser that he was able not only to survive but eventually thrive while working toward a PhD in biology. Now it’s his turn to pay it forward. The goal isn’t just to rescue Venezuelans from a collapsing economy. While Nunez-Mujica has a fatalist view of Venezuela’s ability to regain its economic footing, his own experience has taught him how immigration can jumpstart one’s career and creativity. “Everyone in Venezuela lives in a state of dependency – either on the government or remittances from abroad,” he said. “But if they move abroad they have the chance at social mobility denied to them in Venezuela. There’s a multiplier effect.” Many of those Nunez-Mujica has helped came through friends of friends. Most he has never met but developed a connection with based more on intuition than any deliberate screening process. To avoid becoming too vested in what are frequently heartbreaking tales of exile, he tries his best to keep communications to a minimum, preferring text messages instead of Internet video calls. The current group he is helping plans to stay in Chile, unable to obtain US visas and with little in the way of savings to relocate to the US or Europe, the preferred destination for earlier, wealthier waves of Venezuelan migrants. Recently, with his American husband, Nunez-Mujica travelled to Santiago to meet in the flesh those he has helped evacuate. At an emotion-filled meeting in a downtown bar, the bond with people meeting for the first time was immediately apparent as Nunez-Mujica greeted Klie and three others he has helped with big hugs. The emigres laughed at their common clumsiness adapting to life outside Venezuela. For example, the experience of going to a supermarket at night without fear of being robbed or running into a military patrol. “Our country is going through a tough time right now,” said Nunez-Mujica. “But you’ve got to move on.

David,Fernandez,['https://www.iol.co.za/sport/rugby/super-rugby/superrugby-hurricanes-extend-record-fans-return-to-loftus-14193351'],b'6992',"[""Super Rugby / 2 April 2018, 1:00pm / JOHANNESBURG – Adriaan Strauss marked a South African rugby landmark in amazing style and New Zealand sides continued their iron grip over their Australian counterparts at the weekend. Here are five talking points from round seven of Super Rugby… Strauss waltzes to rare hat trick Bulls hooker Adriaan Strauss waited an average of 840 minutes to score each of his previous 14 tries during his 12 years in Super Rugby – then got three in just 40 minutes. The former Springbok skipper celebrated a South African record 149th appearance in the competition at the weekend by helping his side snap a four-match losing streak with a 33-23 home win over the Stormers. Rolling mauls gave Strauss his first two scores and the third came gift-wrapped from the Stormers, who overthrew a lineout and the hooker snatched the ball and dotted down. “Congratulations to Adriaan on his hat trick and for being a true servant of Bulls and South African rugby,” said Bulls coach and former All Black handler John Mitchell. Canes extend trans-Tasman streak to 33 The Hurricanes’ comprehensive win over the Melbourne Rebels stretched New Zealand’s winning run over Australian opposition to 33 Super Rugby games since 2016. Records tumbled in the Hurricanes’ 50-19 blitz of the Australian Conference leaders. It was the most points the Wellington team have amassed in Australia, and came after they trailed 19-8 late in the first half and then rushed on an unanswered 42 points. “The Hurricanes are the most dominant team of Super Rugby in the last couple of years, and I thought in that first half we played some really good rugby,” Rebels coach David Wessels said. “But ultimately we lost the game because they controlled the field better.” Embarrassed Umaga tries to keep the faith Coach Tana Umaga put on a brave face as he searched for something positive to say about his underperforming Blues following their 63-40 thrashing by the Sharks. “You can say the effort was there,” he offered as the Blues slumped to their fourth loss in five matches. “Scoring 40 is good,” said the former All Black skipper, before letting his true feelings known. “But leaking 60 is not. It’s not just a system thing, it’s an individual thing. “Errors, discipline, letting them off when we’ve put pressure on them, and letting them get into spots that make it difficult for us,” he said. “Obviously it’s an embarrassing one for us... We’ve got to get it right, but it’s within us. I have total faith in that.” The Blues travel to neighbouring Hamilton on Saturday to face the Chiefs for the second time in six weeks, having lost the first encounter 27-21. Folau blow for Tahs Wallaby ace Israel Folau will miss at least three games after injuring his hamstring in the opening minutes of the Waratahs’ 24-17 Australian derby win over the Brumbies in Canberra. Folau, one of international rugby’s most potent attackers, came off in just the fourth minute of the game and Tahs coach Daryl Gibson later confirmed the star wing will be sidelined for up to a month. “It looks like three or four weeks at this stage,” Gibson said. Waratahs skipper Michael Hooper added: “Izzy’s a huge weapon at all times, so I’m hoping he’s not too bad for us and for him. He’s been playing some really good rugby.” It means Folau will miss next weekend’s clash against the Sunwolves in Tokyo, followed by the back-to-back home games against the Reds and South African conference leaders the Lions. No Bull as fans flock back Adriaan Strauss was not the only smiling Bulls as the South African derby drew a 20 000 crowd to Loftus Versfeld stadium on a public holiday weekend. While the stadium was only half-full, it was a pleasing change from last year when a struggling home team were battling to draw even 10 000 supporters to some fixtures. It was a far cry from a decade ago as the Bulls won three Super Rugby titles in four seasons and “house full” signs went up regularly at Loftus. “With many people heading for the coast because of the Easter holiday, we were naturally nervous,” admitted a Bulls spokesman. “The attendance was a nice surprise.” AFP Reason for Ndaba's drastic weight loss DA slams Finance Minister Tito Mboweni over 'looney posting' WATCH: These are the people who 'looted' VBS Mutual Bank Shops shut doors as Zimbabwe financial crisis deepens Meghan's sister seeking to reconcile denied entry at Kensington Palace Sign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.

They had been clocked at 50 mph or greater, with one recorded at 104 mph. The crackdown was a joint effort between the Seagrove Police Department, Liberty Police Department, Asheboro Police Department, Randolph County Sheriff’s Department and the N.C. Highway Patrol. The Seagrove effort, “Slow Your Roll,” was part of a statewide program to make rural roads safe. Seagrove Police Sgt. Jason Auman said an additional 11 drivers were cited for not wearing seat belts, driving with a revoked license and having equipment failures. Drivers were pulled on I-73/74, South Broad Street and East Main streets in Seagrove. Seagrove Police Chief Billy Maness provided that report to commissioners this week during the April town board meeting. Mayor David Fernandez said his phone rang quite a bit with people asking what was going on. In all, there were 15 law enforcement officers and countless patrol cars participating. The depot Town commissioners approved an agreement between the Town of Seagrove and the Friends of the Museum of Traditional N.C. Pottery regarding the old Seagrove depot. Discussions started a little more than a year ago between the two organizations to relocate the depot into downtown. The wooden structure sits in a wooded area on Business 220 north of Seagrove, where Lufkin Pottery was located. The agreement is that the town will provide sewer service to the buildings owned by the Friends group and the depot in exchange for the property located between the museum and Seagrove Pottery. The town will own the depot and provide 110 square feet of space for the Friends group to set up an office space. Fernandez anticipated that the depot move will occur in mid-summer. Original plans called for the depot to be the town hall. However, those plans were scratched after Sapona Plastics owners Dean and Jack Lail gave the Luck’s Cannery building to the town. The town hall moved there last month. The depot will be home to a museum and have a large community room. The depot will also have a deck on the front to form a small amphitheater. People will be able to bring chairs and sit in the parking lot or in the grassy areas in front and enjoy performances. Fernandez hopes that area seniors will find a place to gather at the depot. Additionally, Seagrove Pottery owner Gene King is giving land to expand the size of the parking lot. Once completed, that lot will be a critical component of the town’s efforts to become a safe, walkable experience for visitors. Fernandez said that a public meeting will be held on Monday, April 16, at 5 p.m. at the new town hall to provide input for the Sidewalk Planning Steering Committee. He said that the meeting is only open to residents and business owners located within the Seagrove town limits. Town hall dedication That meeting will be held at the same time as the dedication of the new town hall. Both events will take place at the new town hall, located in Luck’s Cannery at 798 N.C. 705. Refreshments will be provided by Fresh Cuts Butcher & Seagrove Market. Tours of the facility will be given. Audit It’s taken a couple of years, but the town is finally current with its audits. Steve Hackett, CPA, told commissioners that the town is in good fiscal shape. Commissioners welcomed that news. Throughout the past few years, Seagrove elected officials have faced a slew of challenges with inconsistencies resulting from employee turnover in the town clerk position, late and incomplete reports, and late and incomplete audits. The current town clerk, Eleanor Roberts, has worked in the past year with the elected town officials, the UNC School of Government, the N.C. League of Municipalities and the N.C. Dept. of Treasury to establish proper procedures for the town operations. Choose the plan that's right for you.

EPA-EFE/DAVID FERNANDEZ Argentine club Boca Juniors got a goal midway through the first half in a 1-0 victory here over Colombian side Junior in Copa Libertadores Group H action. Boca took charge of play in midfield immediately thanks to precision passing at La Bombonera on Wednesday night, but it had difficulty penetrating the Baranquilla club's defense until Cristian Pavon struck in the 27th minute. On the play, the 22-year-old striker received the ball on the left side, created a sliver of space around one defender and fired a curving, right-footed blast that entered the goal just inside the far upright. Midfielder Pablo Perez and striker Ramon Abila then had chances to increase Boca's lead late in the first half, while midfielder Emanuel Reynoso picked apart Junior's defense with superb passing early in the second. But the momentum shifted thanks to the play of forward Teofilo Gutierrez, who began spearheading the visitors' attack and nearly equalized on a shot that traveled just wide of the mark. Junior then dodged a bullet in the 66th minute when Abila earned a penalty on a foul by defender Jonathan Avila but sent his shot from the 12-yard mark over the crossbar. A few minutes later, Junior head coach Alexis Mendoza sent on Uruguayan striker Jonathan Alvez and Yony Gonzalez in a last-ditch effort to get the ball in the back of the net, but the tying goal proved elusive. Round-robin action in Group H of the 2018 Copa Libertadores - South America's premier club soccer tournament - will resume when Boca Juniors (four points) is hosted by first-placed Brazilian side Palmeiras (six points) on April 11 in Sao Paulo. Eight days later, Junior will seek its first points when it visits Peruvian club Alianza Lima (one point).

Visitors Santa Fe cut short the winning streak of River manager Marcelo Gallardo, whose team lacked momentum and only showed some urgency in the final minutes of the second half, playing at home at El Monumental stadium. River Plate, who won the Supercopa Argentina last month by beating Boca Juniors, enjoyed most of the possession from the beginning while Santa Fe relied on the counter attack and long balls. The first half saw a lot of physical play, with Javier Pinola and Jonatan Maidana of River and Victor Giraldo of Santa Fe both seeing yellow in a first half marked by sloppy passing from both sides. The only notable chance in the first half came through a powerful strike by River forward Lucas Pratto, but Santa Fe keeper Robinson Zapata managed get his fingertips to the ball. The Colombians - coached by Uruguay's Gregorio Perez - showed their resilience in the second half as they kept River at bay to seal a goalless draw. The result puts River in second place behind Brazil's Flamengo in Group D table on two points, level Santa Fe, who are third.

""Escalation of the U.S.-China dispute has entered a new phase,"" David Fernandez of Barclays Bank in Singapore told clients in a report. The Dow Jones industrial average had another rough day, tumbling as much as 767 points at its low before recouping some of its losses and closing down 572 points, or 2.3%, at 23,932.76. Leading the decline were airplane giant Boeing, which fell 3.1%, and heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar, which declined 3.5%. Both companies are at risk because of their higher international sales and exposure to China. For the week, the Dow was down 0.7%. U.S.-China trade tensions stepped up another notch after President Trump late Thursday instructed the U.S. trade representative ""to consider"" slapping an extra $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. China responded by indicating it wouldn’t back down, saying it would fight back “at any cost,” according to a statement from the Commerce Ministry. The surprise move was a further escalation of the deepening dispute between the two economic powers, which just days earlier announced plans for $50 billion in import duties on each other’s goods. The earlier tariff threats roiled financial markets but stocks had rebounded Thursday on investor hopes that the parties would find a diplomatic solution. Comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin failed to calm investor fears. In an interview on CNBC, he reiterated that the ""(U.S.) is not in a trade war"" but wouldn\'t rule out that the current tit-for-tat between the two countries ""is not the beginning of one."" Investors fear a trade war because it will restrict the flow of goods between the nations, which will not only hurt sales and corporate profits but also dent investor confidence. Despite the short-term market turbulence, investment pros are still hopeful that a full-fledged trade war will not break out. “Our view remains that a negotiated solution is most likely, and so the tariffs ultimately won’t be implemented or will be much milder if they are,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney. ""However, negotiations could take months. In the meantime, there will be ongoing noise around the issue,” and financial markets will remain volatile."" But other investment pros are getting nervous and worry that the heated rhetoric could suggest that this is more than just negotiating tactics. ""The global trade war is moving from myth to reality,"" Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote Bank, an online bank in Switzerland, told USA TODAY in an email. , In U.S. economic news, the government reported that American employers added 103,000 jobs in March, below the 185,000 jobs analysts had forecast. Winter storms were cited as one reason for the slower hiring pace. Contributing: The Associated Press']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

Well travelled: Argentina's Jaguares and New Zealand's Crusaders at the scrum.Credit:David Fernandez The bonus-point win lifts the Crusaders to one point behind the Lions at the top of the overall standings through eight rounds. They narrowly lead the New Zealand Conference from the Hurricanes and the Chiefs. A third-straight win was the Crusaders' eighth in a row at an offshore venue. The only team to have won a final overseas, the Crusaders have built their eight titles on an ability to travel. They were at it again on Sunday after last week's dogged win at the Lions. Victory was established by a clinical first-half performance in which they were forced to make twice as many tackles as the Jaguares yet led 19-0. Bridge had a double inside the first 14 minutes, while Mataele was over soon before the break when he capitalised on a slick line-out move involving hooker Codie Taylor. Mataele was the game's standout attacking figure, beating seven defenders in total and setting up two tries with his elusive running. Tries to outside backs Joaquin Tuculet and Emiliano Boffelli gave some hope to the home crowd but Hunt, Ryan Crotty and Mataele all crossed to make it five wins from seven for the Crusaders. The Jaguares, coming off a bye after their memorable upset of the Lions, are still seeking their first win over Kiwi opponents. Five losses from seven mean they trail the South African Conference as they prepare for a road trip which begins against the Rebels in Melbourne next week.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 3:30 pm Richard Snyder died on his 13th birthday Nov. 20, 2016, days after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver in Belton. Richard Snyder died on his 13th birthday Nov. 20, 2016, days after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver in Belton. BELTON — A Temple man was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison for the Nov. 18, 2016, hit-and-run accident that killed 13-year-old Richard Snyder of Belton. Ronal Norwood, 63, was sentenced by Bell County 426th District Court Judge Fancy Jezek as part of a plea deal that stipulated he would be sentenced to not less than two years but not more than 15 years in prison — not for Richard’s murder but for the failure to stop and render aid in an accident involving severe bodily injury or death. The normal maximum sentence is 20 years, according to the Texas Penal Code. A charge of tampering with a witness was dismissed as part of the plea deal, David Fernandez, one of Norwood’s attorneys, previously said after Norwood pleaded guilty in February to avoid a Feb. 20 jury trial. Norwood agreed to put the sentencing in Jezek’s hands. The accident Richard was 12 at the time of the accident. He was riding his bicycle with friends on an Interstate 35 frontage road near his Belton home when a red 2007 Chevy Silverado pickup Norwood drove hit him. Norwood never stopped, but instead drove away — even after one of two grandsons in the pickup with him told him that there a body was in the road. Norwood later said he realized he hit something in the dark. Norwood stopped to change his tire and went home, an arrest affidavit said. He told police the next day he was driving his pickup in Belton and thought he had a blowout. Norwood was arrested and charged three days later after his truck was impounded and information was gathered. One grandson said his grandfather told him to lie about the accident. Norwood was indicted in February 2017 by a Bell County grand jury for the accident causing death charge. It wasn’t until April 2017 that Norwood was indicted on the charge of tampering with a witness. Richard was in critical condition when he was taken to the hospital. He died on Nov. 20, his 13th birthday. Sentencing hearing The sentencing hearing began Thursday afternoon and continued at 1:30 p.m. Monday in Jezek’s courtroom. Bell County Assistant District Attorney Stephanie Newell represented the prosecution. Rick Snyder, Richard’s father, took the stand first for the prosecution. He said he was a truck driver who was six hours away from home when he got word that his son was in the hospital. Snyder described the affects that Richard’s death had on his wife, Hollie. He said she is stressed and cries a lot. Hollie Snyder was called to the stand, and she hugged her husband tight before she walked to up to take her seat. She described how she found out something happened to Richard. The doctors told her repeatedly at the hospital that Richard wasn’t going to “come out of this,” but Hollie said she couldn’t process it. As Hollie talked, Norwood appeared to shake in his chair. She said she understood her son was killed in an accident, but what she couldn’t understand was why Norwood “drove away and left him there like he was a bag of trash.” Hollie described the post traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, the inability to work anymore, inability to socialize and the anxiety she and members of her family have experienced while coping with life since Richard died. She also talked about how worried she was about Richard’s friends who were with him when Norwood hit him and left him there. Hollie described them as “damaged for the rest of their lives.” Defense witnesses Fernandez called a series of witnesses — coworkers, relatives and neighbors — to the stand to testify on Norwood’s behalf. They testified about his character, love for his children and grandchildren, his merits as an employee and his church attendance. In her cross-examinations of some of the witnesses, Newell asked them if knowing Norwood lied to the police and told his grandsons to lie surprised them or changed their opinions of his character. Norwood’s sister-in-law, Martha Nuls, said that knowledge didn’t change her opinion. John Norwood, described his brother as compassionate. He asked everyone to remember his brother had already been incarcerated. He said what Norwood had done weighed heavily on him, and he asked for mercy for his brother. Closing arguments Fernandez asked Jezek to give Norwood a chance because the death was an accident and the delay in getting help for Richard didn’t affect the outcome, according to the autopsy result. “Yet, he’s still at fault,” Fernandez verified. “But no one wants to be judged by the worst years of their life.” He said there was no explanation for Norwood leaving the scene or for his lies to the Belton Police the next day. Norwood offered no excuses, Fernandez said. He asked that the punishment fit the crime. Newell asked Jezek to consider the series of choices Norwood make following the accident that happened. Norwood finally admitted he saw a child on the road in his rearview mirror. His grandsons drew pictures of what they saw in great detail as they saw in the front seat of the pickup with Norwood, Newell said. She outlined the fact Norwood left two young boys — Richard’s friends — to deal with the critically injured student on the road. Norwood then drove on a flat tire all the way on the Bell County Expo Center, fixed his tire, went home and hid his truck. And he drove back by the accident scene again. Finally, when he did go to the Belton Police Department the following day, he lied again for many hours, she said. Sentence announced The closing arguments were finished by 3:14 p.m. Monday, and Jezek wasted no time announcing Norwood’s sentence. At 3:15 p.m., Jezek told Norwood to stand and she announced his 15-year sentence. He will receive credit for the 92 days he served in the Bell County Jail. He has no right to appeal, she said. Norwood took his seat, bowed his head and put it in his hands. His shoulders silently shook. No reaction was seen among his family and friends. Hollie Snyder briefly leaned her head on her husband’s shoulder and blotted more tears from her eyes. Rick Snyder told the Telegram that the family needed time to deal with emotions before they would be ready to talk about the case’s conclusion. Fernandez had no comment after the sentence was announced. Newell said the sentence was fair. “The District Attorney’s Office worked very closely with this family for the last 17 months,” Newell said at the conclusion of the hearing. “We were seeking a term of imprisonment and believe that the sentenced imposed was fair and just considering all the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense. I would like to thank the Belton Police Department for their hard work during this investigation and the family for being patient during the pendency of criminal proceedings.” Norwood will not become eligible for parole until the actual time served plus any good conduct time earned equals one-fourth of the sentence imposed. Eligibility for parole does not guarantee that parole will be granted, according to Bell County District Attorney Henry Garza. It cannot accurately be predicted how the parole law and good conduct time might be applied to this defendant because the application of these laws will depend on decisions made by prison and parole authorities, Garza said.

EFE-EPA/David Fernandez Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy speaks during a luncheon offered by Argentine President Mauricio Macri at the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on April 10, 2018. EFE-EPA/David Fernandez Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy met with Argentine President Mauricio Macri here on Tuesday, with the two leaders saying they agree fully on the path their countries must follow toward economic prosperity, a course that includes adopting ""courageous"" reforms and creating international confidence. Macri and Rajoy met at the Casa Rosada on the first day of the Spanish premier\'s visit to Buenos Aires, the first by a Spanish prime minister in the last 10 years. In a courteous gesture, the Argentine president - before their meeting - also attended the business forum organized for the Spanish leader\'s visit, a move that Spanish sources said they especially appreciated. At the business forum, Macri and Rajoy expressed their complete agreement on the game plan that must be followed to achieve public well-being and they were generous in their praise of each other. The Spaniard encouraged his host to persevere - and vice versa - in implementing ""courageous"" and ""difficult"" reforms, because he believes that, along with budget stability, that is the formula resulting in economic growth. Meanwhile, Macri said that his government is continuing along the ""same course"" of economic reforms taken by his ""friend"" Rajoy in Spain, which he characterized as a ""very good example"" to follow, and he earnestly encouraged Spanish companies to invest in Argentina. ""We Argentines learn from our mistakes, we want to be trustworthy, credible, predictable and so we are working to improve our institutions every day and to establish very clear rules of the game,"" he said. Later, at a Casa Rosada press conference, Rajoy said that they both agreed that to generate wealth they must offer seriousness, legal security and be predictable. Macri expressed his respect for Rajoy\'s ""leadership, honesty and drive"" and for the way he has led Spain during a difficult time after a deep crisis similar to the one that he faced upon coming to power in Argentina. The two men believe they can jointly facilitate the finalization of an agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, the South American trade bloc consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Rajoy expressed his full support for such an agreement and Macri emphasized that both of them feel it is a great opportunity and believe that it will soon become a reality. The pair also expressed their agreement over the situation in Venezuela with neither one being willing to recognize the result of the upcoming May 20 election and asserting that ""the only solution"" for Caracas is to ""return the floor"" to the people ""without threats."" Macri also relayed to Rajoy an invitation for King Felipe VI to make a state visit to Argentina after the March 2019 International Congress of Spanish in Cordoba, Argentina. He also hosted Rajoy and the rest of his delegation at a luncheon attended by some 400 invited guests at the Casa Rosada. Rajoy on Tuesday began the official agenda of his trip to Buenos Aires by laying a floral tribute at the monument of Gen. Jose de San Martin, one of the heroes of Argentine independence.

He was 97. Garcia, who was born in 1921, always had a strong desire to pursue an education, according to his nephew Manuel Garcia. After returning from World War II and subsequent military service in Japan, Garcia earned both a bachelor\'s and master\'s degree, sometimes working in cafeterias to pay his room and board. Garcia went on to have a career teaching elementary and middle school students in the Taos Municipal School District for more than 30 years. Garcia\'s nephew, who grew up at a time when Spanish was essentially banned from the classroom, remembers Garcia\'s fierce advocacy for the language of his family and ancestors from Northern New Mexico. ""He would say, \'If you\'re going to speak Spanish, you\'re going to speak it correctly\'"" Manuel Garcia recalled. In the 1970s, Orlando Garcia wrote for and edited ""El Crepusculo,"" the Spanish section of The Taos News. David Fernandez, another local and longtime columnist for the newspaper, said that Garcia was ""one of the few bona fide native Taos area writers"" associated with The Taos News and that through his teaching, writing and editing stood as a guard against the erosion of ""the old, traditional base of culture and language.""According to Manuel Garcia, funeral arrangements include: the praying of the rosary at San Francisco de Assisi Church in Ranchos de Taos Tuesday (April 10) at 6 p.m.; a funeral mass, also at San Francisco de Assisi Church, Wednesday (April 11) at 10 a.m.; and interment with full military honors at the Santa Fe National Cemetery Thursday (April 12) at 10:30 a.m. Other items that may interest you Resentment is a signal for action Taos News Sneak Peek October 11-17 Role in loan questioned Politics column: Win for Kavanaugh is bad news for Pearce Local water diviner Joe Graves dies 226 Albright Street Taos, NM 87571 (575) 758-2241 taosnews.com webmaster@taosnews.com In order to read our site, please exit private/incognito mode or log in to continue.', 'Super Rugby / 10 April 2018, 12:30pm / SYDNEY - Rugby Australia (RA) has declined to sanction Israel Folau over his anti-gay comments last week and will instead continue a dialogue with the Wallabies back over his social media use. RA chief executive Raelene Castle and Andrew Hore, the CEO of Folau\'s Super Rugby team New South Wales Waratahs, met with the player in Sydney on Tuesday. The meeting was arranged after Folau, an Evangelical Christian, wrote on his Instagram page that gays would be condemned to ""hell"" if they failed to ""repent"", sparking outrage on social media and criticism from a key sponsor. Castle said Folau acknowledged he had caused ""grief to some people"" but she declined to comment on whether he had agreed to tone down his views in his social media posts. ""Israel has presented his situation to us, where his views are, where his beliefs are,"" Castle told reporters in Sydney. ""But at the same time Rugby Australia has also got a policy and a position of inclusion and using social media with respect. ""Now both of us are going to go away and continue that dialogue, and work through how we continue to use how our social media platforms in a way that can ensure that all of our stakeholders are respected in the use of social media."" One of the nation\'s top players and most marketable athletes, Folau\'s contract expires at the end of the season and RA are keen to extend it beyond next year\'s World Cup in Japan. His comments were described as ""very disappointing"" by Qantas airlines, a major sponsor of Rugby Australia, while international referee Nigel Owens, who came out as gay in 2007, said such comments could contribute to young people taking their own lives. RU said last week Folau\'s views were personal and did not represent the governing body\'s. On Sunday, Folau tweeted a passage from the Bible about the persecuted being ""blessed"". Castle declined to clarify whether the 29-year-old had breached any RA rules over conduct or social media use, or whether he would incur any penalties for further inflammatory posts. However, his comments were proving ""challenging"" for RA and its relationships with sponsors and other stakeholders, Castle said, adding that both sides would likely meet again in coming days to continue the dialogue, although there was no timeframe. ""We\'re in negotiation with Israel to extend (his contract) and we\'d really like him to stay in rugby. That\'s hugely important to us,"" she said. ""He\'s a great player and he\'s delivered some great outcomes for us. He\'s been a really strong role model in the Pasifika community. ""We also know that he\'s an athlete in demand and there\'s going to be other people looking to try and move him."" Folau said last year he would not support legislation allowing gay marriage during a nationwide plebiscite over the issue. Australia\'s parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage in December after the vote returned an overwhelming majority in favour of same-sex unions.

He added that some European countries that may have been reluctant to participate in a trade deal with Mercosur in the past now see it as an opportunity to counteract US President Donald Trump\'s free trade barriers.

(Aaron Rosenblatt/Daily Republic) FAIRFIELD — After a somewhat sloppy start to Friday’s final MEL vs. SCAC all-star basketball game at Fairfield’s Ronald D. Thompson Gymnasium, the two teams treated those in attendance to a thriller as the Monticello Empire League managed to do just enough to claim a 94-87 victory over the Solano County Athletic Conference. Both team struggled to find their shooting touch in the early going, but they made up for it late. Vacaville’s Jordan Adams drilled a trio of 3-pointers in the final 48 seconds to help stave off the SCAC. Adams finished with 14 points on the night, while his fellow Bulldog Zach Perlstein paced the MEL with 22. David Fernandez of Vintage added 14 in the win. In the losing effort, American Canyon’s Malik Ghiden led all scorers with 35 points, while Vanden’s Aaron Porcil netted 18 and Fairfield’s Hy-Keem Davis added 13. “You know what that is,” Vanden and SCAC coach Micheal Holloway said of the sluggish breakout. “Everybody thinks they’ve got it, and they don’t have it. But it was fun to get them out of their element. I know that it’s always tough because everything is so structured in the high school game and then they play in a free flowing game like this.” Vanden’s conference title placed Holloway at the helm of the all-star lineup. “It’s always an honor to coach this game and to be recognized – us and our girls program – for winning the league and taking care of our business. It’s a reward to coach in this game and to coach our player, Aaron Porcil, in this game and to coach him for the last time.” With only seven players on its roster, the SCAC was facing an uphill battle. “It’s tough because some of these guys participate in other sports and some of them just have a lot going on,” said Holloway. “It’s hard to get them all in the gym at the same time, but these seven guys showed up both days and worked hard. With the layoff (after the season), they are not really in game shape and used to playing, and a lot of them are playing AAU to try to earn a scholarship or starting to work out with the respective junior colleges that they are going to go to. “But they came out and played hard. For them to play a full 40 minutes as fast as they did and put up 87 points with a running clock is impressive.” The SCAC put up the first four points, but the MEL responded with a 12-4 run over the next five minutes to go up 12-11. Fairfield’s Joey Aranas banked in a 3-pointer and Vanden’s Aaron Porcil got two quick finger-roll layups in transition to give SCAC a 17-12 lead before Adams and Perlstein hit consecutive treys to reclaim the lead at 18-17 with 7:35 left in the half. Porcil answered with a 3 and a pair of free throws over the next minute to push the SCAC out in front again. A dunk and trifecta from Perlstein and 3-pointers from Fernandez and Wood’s Michael Wudel once again pushed the MEL out front in the seesaw battle. Tied at 40-all at the break, Ghiden flushed an alley-oop dunk off a pass from Bethel’s Dion Moore, but Fernandez eventually ripped consecutive deep 3-pointers to give the MEL a 48-42 advantage with 17:43 left in the contest. Perlstein then came up with three 3-pointers in less than three minutes to go up 63-54. However, Porcil, Davis and Aranas all put the ball in the hoop to stay within striking distance. A traditional three-point play by Porcil and a bucket from Ghiden got the SCAC within one points (83-82) with 1:13 to play, but Adams lit up the scoresheet with his long-range bombs down the stretch."", 'We all would love it if the Detroit Pistons were in the mix for the playoffs, but I for one, love NBA basketball over and above my sick dedication to the team I’ve stuck with for over thirty years. Much like the collegiate Final Four, the NBA gets much more interesting when the playoffs roll around. We break a bit from the usual format to give our writers and editors a chance to give their predictions on how the first round of the playoffs will shake out. We’ll be more than happy to hear your ideas in the comments below. It’s rough being a Pistons fan, but I for one, seek consolation in good basketball, whichever team provides it. Reminder, these are the playoffs series: Toronto vs Washington Boston vs Milwaukee Philadelphia vs Miami Cleveland vs Indiana Houston vs Minnesota Golden State vs San Antonio Portland vs New Orleans Oklahoma City vs Utah ______________________ Mike Snyder: Toronto in 7 - Beal, Porter, and what’s-his-face almost pull off the upset. Milwaukee in 7 - Boston’s magic runs out. Philadelphia in 6 - I’m a big believer in Ben Simmons. LeBron in 6 - LeBron. Houston in 5 - Gentlemen’s sweep. Golden State in 4 - I wish Denver could’ve taken San Antonio’s place. Portland in 6 - I also wish Portland wasn’t on PST. Oklahoma City in 6 - Here for Russ, staying for George. Justin Lambregtse: Toronto in 5 Boston in 6 Philly v. Miami - Philly in 5 Cleveland in 5 Houston in 4 Golden State in 6 Portland in 5 Utah in 7 David Fernandez: Toronto in 5 - Washington is a mess and their dysfunction will make the Raptors look like real contenders (they’re not). Boston in 7 - On paper, Milwaukee should win this in five or six, but Boston is a well oiled machine, and former Pistons’ Marcus Morris and Aron Baynes are going to ball out. Philly in 6 - as much as it pains me to admit it, Philly is a damn good basketball team. Cleveland in 5 - LeBron James. Houston in 5 - Too much firepower, too much Beard, too much CP3. Golden State in 6 - Don’t sleep on LaMarcus Aldridge, but it’s still the Warriors. Portland in 7 - AD can do almost everything, but he can’t stop that back-court single-handed. OKC in 7 - Toughest series of the first round, but OKC’s talent pushes them through. Steve Hinson: Toronto in 5 - Toronto’s bench dominates. Milwaukee in 6 - Giannis pulls off the upset. Miami in 7 - Spo’s playoff experience and 76ers’ injuries make for a long series upset. Cleveland in 5 - Not betting against LeBron. Houston in 4 - Rested Rockets sweep. Warriors in 4 - Quinn Cook, Future Finals MVP. Portland in 7 - Most interesting matchup of the first round. OKC in 6 - I really wish I could pick the Jazz. Lazarus Jackson: Toronto in 7 - Washington usually over-performs in the playoffs compared to the regular season, and Toronto usually under-performs in the playoffs compared to the regular season. It should be a fun series... too bad I loathe both of these teams. Boston in 5 - Brad Stevens works Joe Prunty like a speedbag. Miami in 7 - The Philly kids are alright, but this is their first time in the playoffs, against a well-tested (but not overly talented) Heat team. This is probably the worst matchup for Philly. Cleveland in 5 - The Pacers’ fairytale season deserved better than the LeBron James buzzsaw. Houston in 5 - Houston is leagues better, but I’m excited for Playoff Karl-Anthony Towns and Playoff Andrew Wiggins. Golden State in 5 - Don’t let the last two weeks (where GSW had ZERO to play for) fool you - the King stay the King. Portland in 6 - Portland has no one who can guard Anthony Davis reliably, but New Orleans has little else. OKC in 7 - This might be the closest playoff series out of all of them. The Thunder have the most to lose (in PG13) if they don’t make it out, but Utah is well-equipped to grind them down. Ryan Pravato: Toronto in 5 - The Raptors have more scoring weapons and Valanciunas will run rampant on the Wizards’ frontcourt. Boston in 6 - The Celtics have better coaching and a better defense. Philadelphia in 7 - I’m banking on Embiid playing most of the games. Indiana in 6 - Point blank, the Pacers are better and the Cavs don’t have Lance Stephenson. Houston in 6 - Just a slightly deeper and overall better roster for the Rockets. Golden State in 5. New Orleans in 6 - Don’t sleep on Jrue Holiday and Nikola Mirotic. OKC in 6 - The Thunder have more firepower, and they’re not dependent on a rookie. Jordan Bellant: Toronto in 6 Cleveland in 5 Philadelphia in 6 Boston in 5 Houston in 5 OKC in 6 Portland in 6 Golden State in 7 Jamie Delaney: Toronto in 5 Cleveland in 4 Miami in 7 Boston in 7 Houston in 4 OKC in 7 Portland in 6 Golden State in 5 _______ There you have it, from the mouths of our semi-professional heads.

American Canyon's Malik Ghiden, left, is defended by Wood's Michael Wudel during the boys' MEL vs. SCAC All-Star Boys Basketball Game at Fairfield High on Friday night. FAIRFIELD – In about as entertaining a high school boys basketball game as they come, the Monticello Empire League All-Stars rode a strong second-half performance to nip the Solano County Athletic Conference All-Stars, 94-87, on Friday night at Fairfield High. It was the final showcase of top seniors from the two leagues. The SCAC is being dissolved, losing all of its schools to other area leagues. Vanden and Fairfield will join the MEL, Vallejo and Bethel will be joining the Bay Shore Athletic Conference, and American Canyon will join Napa, Vintage, Justin-Siena, Casa Grande, Petaluma and Sonoma Valley in the new Vine Valley Athletic League, the first league to incorporate all four major high schools in Napa County. American Canyon’s Malik Ghiden led all scorers with 35 points for the SCAC, making a variety of acrobatic and athletic shots that brought the crowd to its feet. Vintage's David Fernandez eyes the hoop during the boys' MEL vs. SCAC All-Star Boys Basketball Game at Fairfield High on Friday night. “I had 35 for real? I was just playing,” said Ghiden, whose career high was 33. “I didn’t even know.” Ghiden said he didn’t show all his moves, but admitted the game “was pretty fun. I’ve always wanted to play in one of these All-Star games.” Hard to believe, but Ghiden said he was actually a little rusty, because he hasn’t been playing in game situations since the season ended with a Feb. 21 playoff loss. The talented senior said he was going to be playing somewhere at the college level next season, but has yet to decide where that will be. Napa High's Mitch Hippauf looks to make a close-range basket after getting a nice pass during the boys' MEL vs. SCAC All-Star Boys Basketball Game at Fairfield High on Friday night. Vintage High senior David Fernandez was a major contributor for the winning MEL side, making four 3-pointers from long distance, including three in a row down the stretch for his 12 points. Fernandez said prophetically before the game, “I haven’t forgotten how to shoot a three, although I haven’t touched a basketball a lot since the season ended.” Still, he said he was happy to be representing Vintage. “It’s cool to be named to this All-Star team. I didn’t really know about this game until my coach told me about it. It’ll be fun playing with guys from other schools.” The teams battled to a 40-40 halftime tie in the helter skelter, run and shoot game, which was played with 20-minute halves and a running clock. It was a rough, physical game as it became clear early on that the referees had agreed to keep their whistles largely in their pockets. Despite Ghiden’s efforts for the SCAC, the MEL prevailed thanks to the 3-point shooting of Fernandez and Vacaville’s Zack Pearlstein, who also had three treys in the second half. Napa High's Joe Carnazola rolls in a late 2-pointer during the boys' MEL vs. SCAC All-Star Boys Basketball Game at Fairfield High on Friday night. Napa High’s 6-foot-8 center, Mitch Hippauf, said before the game it was fun practicing with Vacaville head coach Duane Kamman, who was invited to coach the MEL All-Stars after his team went 10-0 in league play. “It’s a little weird playing for a different coach who has a different style, but it’s also a good opportunity to learn,” Hippauf said. “I was hoping I would be able to play in this game this year. It looks like everyone on our team has stayed in touch with basketball. The whole MEL team wants to have fun, but we decided we want to come out of this game with a ‘W.’ “You might see some lob plays put in for me tonight,” he joked. “I hope to get at least two dunks.” He wasn’t wrong, as two lobs did come his way in the contest. Although he wasn’t able to convert them into dunks, he scored on both plays on his way to six points. The Indians’ sharp-shooting guard, Joe Carnazola, didn’t have a lot of opportunities but did help the winners with two points on his trademark finger-roll in the lane. “I really didn’t know about this game until our coach let me know about it,” Carnazola said prior to tip-off. “It’s pretty late after the season, but I’ve been playing a little bit. It’s good to know I’m considered one of the top players in our league. Basically I’m just looking to have fun tonight, but I’m excited to play and it’s fun playing under a new coach.” Want to see your pet in the newspaper?

David,Fernandez,['https://www.iol.co.za/sport/opinion/folaus-anti-gay-comments-goes-against-the-grain-of-rugbys-value-system-14460538'],b'6980',"[""Opinion / 16 April 2018, 07:00am / Clinton van der Berg There isn’t a top rugby team on the planet who would turn down the opportunity to have Israel Folau in their ranks. He’s big, fast, powerful and brave. He’s also a deadly finisher with sublime attacking instincts. Too bad he’s a bigot. The Waratahs and Australia fullback caused a row with a (now deleted) Instagram post in which he said that God’s plan for gay people was “HELL . . . Unless they repent of their sins and turn to God.” Strangely, he hasn’t been censured by his employers, instead receiving applause for his “strong beliefs” and an instruction to express his views “respectfully”. That’s a staggering response to what appears like plain hate speech, and is sharply at odds with what occurred in England this week. Denny Solomono of the Sale Sharks was banned for four weeks for an alleged homophobic slur towards a Worcester player. The words were said to be the same as those which saw French centre Mathieu Bastareaud banned following a European Champions Cup match earlier this year. If there’s any doubt about the damage inflicted by remarks like Folau’s and Bastareaud’s, consider the view of prominent referee Nigel Owens, who happens to be gay and spoke of the pain at reading such toxic opinions. “Yes, you are entitled to your opinion, but one should understand what that opinion can do to young and vulnerable people’s lives, in particular ones in a bad place dealing with their sexuality… it’s not a choice of being gay. “I spent years and years trying not to be gay, because I didn’t realise I was gay until I was about 19.” Gareth Thomas, the Welsh Test centurion, was more direct, tweeting a middle finger shot that emphatically stated his feelings towards Folau. He, too, is gay. Folau tweeted biblical readings to try and justify his message, oblivious to the pain and hurt he caused to many. Social media went into overdrive, with the unambiguous message that his views are nonsense. His drivel also goes against the grain of rugby’s broad value system; a system that heartily celebrates differences and inclusivity. Rugby even has an international tournament for gay players, the Bingham Cup, named after Mark Bingham, the hero who died on board United Airlines Flight 93 when it crashed during the 9/11 attacks. (In a bizarre twist, Folau himself was the poster boy for the event in Sydney in 2014, even appearing on the cover of a local gay magazine at the time). Locally, the Jozi Cats were launched three seasons ago and play in a variety of events. They even toured overseas last year. Freedom of speech is a noble freedom, but it’s a dangerous road to go down when comments are laced in hate and prejudice. It doesn’t matter a whole lot whether you talk about your faith, but loaded remarks like Folau’s are demonstrably offside. The player’s elevated public status means he’ll catch more wind for whatever he says, but it doesn’t alter the offensiveness of his remarks. What’s his plan for you then @IzzyFolau pic.twitter.com/tWecB6M3z4 — Gareth Thomas (@gareththomas14) April 4, 2018 I’d love to be a fly on the wall the next time he shares a change-room with Wallaby loose forward David Pocock, who has long been a strong advocate for LGBTI rights. He even held off marrying his fiancé until gay marriage was legalised in Australia, so no-one can be in any doubt about his feelings on the subject. It might be easy for some to laugh off Folau’s comments, but what of those conflicted kids Owens talks about? There must be rugby fans among them, fans who agonise daily over their choices and now vilified by an extremist like Folau, who thinks it’s okay to bash out a hateful message on social media. Of course, Folau can hold whatever views he likes, but propagating such views is another matter, especially as he is held to a higher standard. That’s the lot of a celebrity player, whether he likes it or not. The irony of Folau’s remarks is that he is deeply religious, and yet his intolerance of people who are unlike him is palpable. With a view like his, he’d be better off shutting up. Decent people don’t care for his hate-filled bile. @ClintonV Sunday Tribune Like IOL Sport on Facebook Reason for Ndaba's drastic weight loss DA slams Finance Minister Tito Mboweni over 'looney posting' WATCH: These are the people who 'looted' VBS Mutual Bank Shops shut doors as Zimbabwe financial crisis deepens Meghan's sister seeking to reconcile denied entry at Kensington Palace Sign up to receive breaking news in your inbox.

That topped a consensus estimate of 6.7 percent year-over-year growth for the quarter, marking the third-straight quarter of 6.8 percent growth for the world\'s second-largest economy. Although the headline figure signals a strong start to the year for China, there will be a ""roll down in growth going forward,"" said David Fernandez, chief Asia Pacific economist at Barclays. That is as real estate investment is expected to moderate as the government aims to curb excessive speculation in the sector, Fernandez told CNBC. Beijing is also cracking down on environmental pollution from industry. The latest figures may confirm that\'s occurring, with March industrial output growth slowing to 6 percent from a year ago, compared to the 7.2 percent for the January through February period. In other data, January to March fixed asset investment growth slowed to 7.5 percent from a year ago, down from 7.9 percent in the first two months of the year. Economists had expected fixed asset investment to come in at 7.6 percent over the first three months of 2018. However, retail sales beat expectations in March, rising 10.1 percent from a year ago, beating the consensus forecast of 9.9 percent. Even though Chinese domestic demand is strong, Beijing will continue ""tapping on the breaks"" in its managed economic slowdown, said Fernandez. The country has ""that space given how quickly things have gotten off post the party congress,"" he added, referring to the 19th Chinese Communist Party Congress last October. ""They are trying to deleverage the economy, they are also trying to reign in some of that credit growth,"" Sian Fenner, economist at Oxford Economics, said Tuesday. The tightening of monetary policy and exports ""still being quite supportive of growth but not quite accelerating at the same pace"" will affect growth in 2018, Fenner told CNBC ahead of the data release. Oxford Economic\'s full-year GDP forecast for China is 6.4 percent, which is a tick down from around 6.5 percent targeted by Beijing. China\'s economy grew 6.9 percent in 2017, beating the official target of around 6.5 percent in part due to a synchronized global recovery. China\'s strong growth last year came despite widespread concerns about financial risks in the East Asian giant amid a government-led economic restructuring. The world\'s second-largest economy has been fighting debt for years as it tries to balance economic stability against the potential fallout from any sharp deceleration. Risks to the Chinese economy in 2018 include trade protectionism as U.S. President Donald Trump\'s administration bares its teeth to address the yawning trade gap between the two countries.

Kevin Gameiro's second-half penalty earned a laboured 1-0 win for Atletico Madrid at Deportivo Alaves, putting the onus on Barcelona to achieve a positive result in their clash with Deportivo La Coruna and wrap up La Liga's title race. Runaway leaders Barca only need a point in their fixture later on Sunday to be crowned champions regardless of the outcome at the Mendizorroza. But Diego Simeone's men at least maintained their slim hopes, with Gameiro netting from the spot after Fernando Torres had already fluffed his lines from 12 yards out, Mubarak Wakaso having conceded both penalties. The disjointed performance from Atleti was perhaps to be expected, Simeone leaving out the likes of Antoine Griezmann, Jan Oblak and Saul Niguez as he prioritised Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg with Arsenal, a tie which is locked at 1-1. Real Madrid can also mathematically still catch Barca, but it would require a remarkable sequence of events to deny Ernesto Valverde's side the title. It could have been a different outcome on the day had Lucas Hernandez been judged to have fouled Munir El Haddadi in the area, but Diego Costa also failed to score a good first-half chance for Atleti before Torres' missed penalty after the break, the away team finishing with 10 men after Angel Correa received a second yellow card in injury time. 90+’ | 0-1 | Full-time! Atleti win in Vitoria! #AlavésAtleti #AúpaAtleti pic.twitter.com/5VWsPrzDSy — Atlético de Madrid (@atletienglish) April 29, 2018 Atleti's performance in the early stages had all the hallmarks of a side who knew their priorities now lay elsewhere and they had a huge let off in the 16th minute. Lucas made a lung-busting recovery to atone for his failure to control a loose ball with Munir closing in on goal and seemingly bundled the on-loan Barca forward over in the area, but referee David Fernandez Borbalan ruled there was no foul. The visitors struggled to get out of first gear, although a quickly taken free-kick led to Thomas Partey firing narrowly wide from 25 yards. It took until the 42nd minute for debutant Alaves goalkeeper Antonio Sivera to be tested, Costa controlling Stefan Savic's punt over the top, turning inside Victor Laguardia and drawing the save with a low drive to the bottom-left corner. The second half was a similarly forgettable affair, Vitolo briefly lighting up the match by cutting in from the left and unleashing a vicious effort that Sivera saved brilliantly – the goalkeeper seemingly hitting his shoulder on the post making the stop and having to be replaced by Fernando Pacheco. Axel Werner made a fine fingertip save from John Guidetti's well-struck long-range effort, but it was Atleti that wasted the chance to open the scoring from the spot. Wakaso's clumsy barge on Vitolo led to an inevitable penalty that Torres saw saved low to the keeper's right by Pacheco. Incredibly, Wakaso conceded another spot-kick with 13 minutes remaining, this time handling Torres' half-volley, and Gameiro succeeded where his team-mate failed – striking straight down the middle to seal the points – despite Correa seeing red for a second yellow in injury time. 78’ | 0-1 | GOAL! @kevingameiro9 converts the penalty!#AlavésAtleti #AúpaAtleti pic.twitter.com/V980cTuU3r — Atlético de Madrid (@atletienglish) April 29, 2018 The title remains an unrealistic target, though, and Atleti's attention will be fully on the visit of the Gunners to the Wanda Metropolitano.""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

Today’s hosts have had a decent run of form recently, collecting 10 points from the last 15 available. A 4-0 win away to Las Palmas last weekend confirmed La Liga status for the side from the Basque country next season. The match sat in between two Europa League semi-final legs for Atleti, who left London on Thursday evening arguably with the upper hand on Arsenal following Antoine Griezmann’s 81st minute equaliser at the Emirates Stadium. A win in today’s match meant that there was still a slim chance that Los Colchoneros could become league champions, should Deportivo beat Barcelona in the late kick off at the Riazor. Abelardo Fernández made six changes to the side that won comfortably in Gran Canaria last week, with the suspended Rodrigo Ely, Fernando Pacheco, Martín Aguirregabiria, Ruben Duarte, Ibai Gomez and Manuel Garcia Sanchez being replaced by Antonio Sivera, Victor Laguardia, Guillermo Maripan, Adrian Dieguez, Alfonso Pedraza and John Guidetti. With European glory the main focus, Diego Simeone chose to leave Jan Oblak, Antoine Griezmann, Saul and Jose Gimenez out of the squad list for the game. Axel Werner made his first league start for the side, with Diego Costa returning to the starting 11 since a muscle injury. Vitolo and Fernando Torres also made rare starts for the visitors. Alaves looked to be the side who were wanting the victory more in the first half and could have had a penalty after Lucas brought down Munir in the box following his failure to control a loose ball, however referee David Fernandez Borbalan decided there was no wrongdoing. Diego Costa could have grabbed the opener late in the first half; however debutant Sivera successfully collected the shot. The second half continued to be a quiet affair until the 71st minute when a clumsy tackle on Vitolo by Wakaso resulted in a penalty for Atleti. Fernando Torres stepped up to take the spot kick; however substitute keeper Pacheco successfully saved the shot. Seven minutes later and Alaves conceded yet another penalty. A half volley from Torres bounced off Wakaso’s hand and Gameiro successfully converted the penalty. The match ended on a sour note for the away side, with Angel Correa sent off after arguing with the referee following a booking over a bad tackle. The result leaves Alaves in 13th place, a point above Athletic Bilbao. They travel to bottom side Malaga in next Sunday’s early kick off. After hosting Arsenal at the Wanda Metropolitano, Atleti welcome Espanyol to the capital on Sunday afternoon. Alaves: Sivera (Pacheco, 63); Alexis, Laguardia, Maripan, Dieguez; Sobrino, Pina, Wakaso (Garcia Sanchez, 79), Pedraza; Guidetti (Gomez, 72), Munir Atletico Madrid: Werner; Thomas, Savic, Lucas, Vrsaljko; Correa, Gabi, Koke (Godin, 62), Vitolo; Torres, D.

The Rockets and Warriors are huge favorites to reach the Conference Finals but both the Jazz and Pelicans showed enough fight to hopefully make things interesting. We asked our guys their predictions and also a question on the teams that didn’t make the cut. Justin Lambregtse: I’ll be bold and go New Orleans in 7. I know how crazy this sounds, but New Orleans is playing some really good basketball right now and if Steph Curry does play in this series he is not going to be fully healthy. If the long layoff between series kills the momentum New Orleans has right now then they stand no chance. Anthony Davis’ dominance would be the storyline. Ryan Pravato: Wait a minute -- where’s my prize for being the only DBB-head to pick the Pelicans over the Blazers!?! Anyway, I’m going with the Warriors in 7 in this super competitive series. Kevin Durant will be just enough of a nightmare to get on by the Pellies. Steve Hinson: Golden State in 6. The major storyline will revolve around Anthony Davis and Golden State containing him. That first round AD put up was historic - the only other player to average 30/10/2/2 in a playoff series was Hakeem in 1988 (the Rockets were actually bounced in the first round that year, pretty nuts). Playoff Davis has been awesome, I hope we get more of him. But Playoff Golden State looks pretty unstoppable. David Fernandez: GS in 5 - gentleman’s sweep. Justin Lambregtse: Houston in 6. Utah will put up a fight, but they don’t have enough to beat Houston yet. The storyline will be Donovan Mitchell continuing his rise to superstardom (this is very painful to write.) Ryan Pravato: I picked the Jazz to lose in round one, and I’m going to do it again for round two even though I’m rooting for them. Rockets in 6. The Rockets have more efficient firepower and aren’t the Thunder. This spells trouble for the Jazz, especially if Ricky Rubio is hobbled. Steve Hinson: The ultimate offense versus defense matchup, of course. I’d love to take the defensive-oriented underdog, but I just don’t see how it could work. Probably going to be Rockets in 5. David Fernandez: HOU in 5 - too much firepower and too much James Harden for the Jazz to handle. Justin Lambregtse: Portland. I think they are going to have to break up the CJ McCollum-Damian Lillard backcourt to create a roster that is better suited for the playoffs. OKC will also have a crazy offseason with Paul George likely leaving and possibly Carmelo too. Ryan Pravato: T-Wolves. In a lot of ways they are like the Pistons: mediocrity driven and very few young pieces to build on. There’s an obvious limit for this team as currently constructed. Probably need to seriously think about what they could get for Wiggins. Steve Hinson: The Thunder, absolutely. So many question marks there. Does Paul George really leave for a 35 win team whose best talent is pretty redundant with him and is years away from contending, if ever? If not, does he stay in OKC? What the hell do they do with Melo? Westbrook turns 30 next season so they need to keep going all-in. Especially if PG leaves, do they have the goods to go all-in enough? If not...do you consider trading him? David Fernandez: I’m extremely intrigued to see how the Thunder bounce back this off-season (if they can bounce back at all). What does Paul George do in free agency? How does OKC better incorporate Carmelo Anthony (knowing that he’s opting in to all that cash), or do they decide to buy him out? If they lose PG, then what? They’re running into a lot of the same issues Detroit is experiencing right now, they’re in cap hell, with a lack of first round picks to easily navigate out of their current middling situation. _________________________________________ Not too many surprises there...well only one really.

Warm, humid weather creates conditions favorable to the survival and production of many types of parasites. “Sheep and goat producers should take special precautions against the barber pole worm,” he said. “Barber pole worms are blood-sucking parasites that cause diarrhea, poor appetite, lethargy, anemia, bottle jaw and – if left untreated long enough – death.” Barber pole worms live in the true stomach, or abomasum, of sheep, goats, llamas and alpacas. A sheep or goat carrying 5,000 barber pole worms can die in a little over a month from blood loss to these worms if not treated. Barber pole worm eggs are shed in the feces. After hatching, larvae live for a period in the manure. Once they reach their third stage of development, they migrate away from the manure and climb up the grass. “Larvae usually don’t travel further than 12 inches away from the manure, and only climb about 2 to 3 inches up a blade of grass, where they wait to be eaten,” Dr. Fernandez said. “Once inside the host, they complete their development, mate, and start to suck blood and lay the next generation of eggs.” In controlling these parasites, producers should focus on minimalizing the rate of infection in their animals. “Because chemical dewormers are currently less effective due to overuse of products on the market, farmers should focus on using good management techniques that can help prevent infection in the first place,” Dr. Fernandez said. “Rotational grazing is one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of parasites livestock consume.” Rotational grazing is the practice of regularly moving livestock from one pasture to another. By moving animals between pastures, the larvae of parasites don’t get eaten and eventually die. “Producers should be careful not to overgraze their pastures,” he said. “It’s best to leave at least 3 or 4 inches of grass on a particular pasture when rotating to the next one.” Where an animal eats its feed also plays a part in the number of parasites it consumes. Hay or feed should not be put the ground. Instead, a feeder should be used to make the animals eat with their heads elevated. As long as animals can be kept from grazing or eating close to the ground, they will consume fewer parasites. “Remember that you cannot get rid of all of the worms in your herd or flock, no matter how hard you try,” Dr. Fernandez said. “Resistance to dewormers is a natural occurrence, so even though you deworm your animals, some parasites will still be alive and well.” Considering the fact that all sheep and goats carry some parasites, producers should only treat animals that truly need to be dewormed. They can determine which animals need treating by using the FAMACHA score. They should then keep track of which animals require repeated dewormer treatments and cull them from the herd. Though it may sound counterintuitive, producers should purposefully plan on leaving some parasites untreated, Dr. Fernandez said. “Untreated worms are not resistant to a particular dewormer product,” he said. “When resistant worm eggs hatch, they are surrounded by a sea of worms that are still susceptible to the dewormer. When the worms mate, the resistant worms are more likely to encounter and mate with a susceptible worm, meaning their offspring will be less resistant to your dewormer.” Dr. Fernandez said producers using chemical dewormers need to test different dewormers to determine the product that works best on their farm. Resistance to dewormers must be addressed on a farm-by-farm basis. There are a few natural products available that can be used to control barber pole worms, he said. Plants high in condensed tannins, such as sericea lespedeza, chicory, sainfoin and birdfoot trefoil, can be effective. Copper oxide wire boluses have also been used to treat barber pole worm infestations.

IT WAS the love for football and shared common values between former students of St John’s Institution (SJI) that contributed to the success of the second edition of the Fernandez Challenge Cup (FCC) football competition. The competition, in honour of two lifelong educators at SJI – David Fernandez and his late brother Vincent, saw 14 teams between batches of students from the 1980s and 1990s. There were eight teams last year. Two categories were featured at this year’s edition, with students from the 1980s and 1990s battling it out among their contemporaries at the Universiti Malaya Stadium. After completing the preliminary round group matches, the knockout rounds kicked off with the cup showdown between the SJI99 and SJI98 in the 90s category and SJI84 and SJI88 in the other category. In the cup finals, the SJI88 batch defeated SJI84 1-0 after a hard fought battle to lift the FCC while the SJI99 batch pipped SJI98 on penalties. Meanwhile, SJI86 and SJI90 were victorious in their respective plate finals. Despite leaving school many years ago, the ex-students showed flashes of brilliance on the pitch, much to the delight of David, who was their former physical education teacher and SJI football coach. “It’s fantastic to see that the boys who have left school many years ago are still playing pretty good football, and it gives me great satisfaction to see that they still love the game and want to play it. “The thing I like most is that the competition is played in good spirit, and that’s the kind of values we want them pass down to their families who came along to support them. “The fact that they are still playing will keep them healthy and if they can promote this within their families, to come out and play, I feel it will build communities,” said the educator of more than 40 years. The annual competition was organised by the SJI80s Alumni. St John’s Alumni Association president Isham Ishak said the annual competition was a testimony that the alumni was as strong as it has ever been in giving ex-students a place to belong. “They will always be welcome and we will always have a place for them,” he said, noting that there were more than 3,000 members on its database of former Johannians. “The SJI 80s alumni have played a huge role in promoting sports for the alumni. What started off as a competition for the batch of 80s has opened up to the old boys of the 90s which bodes well for the future.

David,Fernandez,['https://news.artnet.com/market/kevin-harman-takes-trash-1278410'],b'6973',"['Kevin Harman brought a dumpster to the fair, painstakingly stacking the garbage inside, and created a surprisingly beautiful artwork. Sarah Cascone, May 3, 2018 No, your eyes are not deceiving you. That is an authentic J Bass & Son trash dumpster, pitted with rust and filled with a pile of stone, cardboard, wood, and other discarded materials, arranged in a neatly stacked column—and it’s on view at Frieze New York. The piece, titled Skip 16, is the work of Scottish artist Kevin Harman, and its considerable aesthetic appeal may surprise you. “There’s all sorts of stuff in there, like old fax machines,” Richard Ingleby, of Edinburgh’s Ingleby Gallery, says to artnet News. He is showing the unconventional work with a selection of Harman’s glassworks created by layering wall paint between the two sheets of glass in a household window. The dumpster sculpture is actually the 16th in a series the artist began in 2006. Harman normally descends on random construction sites on Friday evenings, after crews have gone home for the week, and spends the weekend converting trash into art. Kevin Harman, Carved for Mountains (2018). Photo by John McKenzie, courtesy of the artist and Ingleby, Edinburgh. “When you’re an art student, you are constantly looking for material to use, and you need a space to show,” Harman tells artnet News, describing the series’ genesis. Back when he was starting out, dumpsters solved both problems, providing the raw materials for the work and a self-contained venue for a pop-up exhibition. Plus, Harman adds, “I don’t think it’s illegal.” The artist says that interactions with the locals are a vital part of making the pieces: “While I’m working, I’ll speak to all the passersby and find out a little bit about the neighborhood,” As you might expect, a grown man rooting around in the trash attracts a fair bit of attention, so the artist has developed a pretty effective deflection tactic. “I invite them all over to the opening on Sunday night when it’s finished,” he says. Kevin Harman making Skip 16 (2018). Photo by Christopher L. Cook, courtesy of the artist and Ingleby, Edinburgh. Skip 16 is the first piece in the series the artist has made in the US, and it is the first he is attempting to sell. The gallery is setting the price somewhere in the $70,000–80,000 region. (The sculptures are typically temporary additions to the landscape, quickly returning to their original purpose when a new work week starts, and the initial novelty of their presence fades.) To show this massive work at Frieze, Harman had to do things a little differently. First, there was a matter of finding the right kind of dumpster, as most of those in New York are much bigger than the kind he is used to working with in Europe. Kevin Harman making Skip 16 (2018). Photo by Christopher L. Cook, courtesy of the artist and Ingleby, Edinburgh. J Bass was the only company using a smaller model, shaped a bit like a wheelbarrow with one lower, sloping wall. The gallery arranged to have a skip overflowing with promising construction detritus reserved for Harman’s exclusive use. (If the piece doesn’t sell, the dumpster will be returned.) The artist then set up shop on the streets of Mount Vernon, just north of the Bronx, where J Bass is headquartered, and got to work. In order to give fair-goers a real taste of the process, Harman created a short film about the creation of Skip 16. First, the dumpster is emptied piece by piece, then scrubbed clean. Typically, Harman is careful to incorporate each and every bit of trash into the final piece. (With potential collectors in mind, organic material—anything that would decompose—was discarded this go-around.) The artist then sorts the trash by material and color before putting it all back together in a painstakingly arranged pile. By the end of the weekend spent working, Harman says in the video, “I just want to book a spa or something, have a shave.” The artist likens the process to creating an orchestral composition. “I’ve got all this stuff lying on the street, but I’m going to put it all in, I’m going to make this score, a beautiful thing,” he explains. “Problem-solving the material into a structure and then standing back and looking at it gives me a massive sense of satisfaction…It’s like changing your room around or folding up your clothes up in your wardrobe. You know how good that feels—it’s amazing!” See more photos below. Kevin Harman making Skip 16 (2018). Photo by Christopher L. Cook, courtesy of the artist and Ingleby, Edinburgh.

Simeone is known for his great presence on the side of the pitch, as he approaches each game with the same level of intensity. However, his high energy and protests throughout matches have resulted in the coach being sent off the field on various occasions. His first sending off was given by referee Bjorn Kuipers in the final of the Champions League, while his next dismissal was three months later in the final of the Supercopa de Espana by David Fernandez Borbalan. On that occasion, Simeone was punished with an eight-match ban after his protests and his tapping of the back of the assistant referee's head. Fernandez Borbalan was once again the referee who suspended Simeone for the second time that same season. In the 2014/2015 campaign, the Argentine coach was ejected from the game after protesting from the sidelines and was penalised with a one-match ban. In the following season, Antonio Mateu Lahoz showed him to the stands after the Atletico bench threw a ball onto the pitch in order to interrupt a Malaga attack. The Valencian referee, who could not identify the specific person who launched the ball, decided to send off the head of the bench and it resulted in a three-match ban for Simeone. In this current season, Juan Martinez Munuera dismissed El Cholo in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey and the Atletico coach was punished with a three-match ban after sarcastically applauding the referee while walking off the field. His most recent encounter with the referees occurred in the first leg of the semi-finals of the Europa League. Frenchman Clement Turpin sent him to the stands for angrily protesting his decisions and the penalty imposed by UEFA has been a four-match ban, of which one has already been completed. Therefore, the final in Lyon and Atletico's first two European commitments of the upcoming season will be without Simeone on the sidelines. The total is 20 matches of suspension, but 10 of these are yet to be served and will see Simeone miss matches in the aforementioned UEFA fixtures, as well as in Atletico's next Supercopa de Espana and Copa del Rey fixtures. © Mayo 2018 Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

David,Fernandez,['https://uapbnews.wordpress.com/2018/05/07/weed-control-in-pastures-ensures-better-grazing-for-livestock/'],b'6970',"['Will Hehemann | School of Agriculture, Fisheries and Human Sciences In Arkansas, one farmer’s weed is another farmer’s favorite forage, says Dr. David Fernandez, Extension livestock specialist and interim assistant dean of academic programs for the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff School of Agriculture, Fisheries and Human Sciences. “Many cattle producers in southern Arkansas brag about their bermudagrass pastures, when bermudagrass is actually listed as a noxious weed in Arkansas,” he said. “However, there are a number of weeds most of us can agree we don’t want to see in our pastures. Not only do unwanted weeds use nutrients our grass could be using, but they also shade out the grass, preventing it from growing.” Weeds usurp space and resources in a pasture, which can be problematic for grazing livestock. Livestock may find a particular weed unpalatable and refuse to eat it. Other weeds are thorny and can damage the mouths of livestock. Dr. Fernandez said there are several varieties of weed toxic to livestock that can overtake pastures. Livestock usually avoid toxic plants; however, animals might resort to eating these plants early in the year when they are the only green plant in sight or during times of drought when there is little or nothing else to graze on. “Bitter sneezeweed and wooly croton – also called goat weed – are toxic to livestock,” Dr. Fernandez said. “If not controlled early, these weeds can quickly overspread entire pastures. They degrade grazing and reduce the available forage by shading out grasses.” Other toxic plants grow in areas where the soil is moist. Perilla mint and hemlock, for example, are toxic weeds often found growing around sources of water or moist areas. Several varieties of spiny weeds can be a nuisance for cattle producers. Pigweed and thistle varieties – including bull, musk, yellow and milk thistles – can quickly spread to cover entire pastures due to the sheer amount of seeds each plant produces. Horse nettle, multiflora rose and greenbrier are other thorny plants that can take over a pasture at a slower pace. “For the most part, livestock avoid thorny weeds because of the pain they cause,” Dr. Fernandez said. “However, these weeds can still be a major problem because of the amount of pasture they overtake in a relatively short time.” Other weeds such as dog fennel and sedges that are not palatable to livestock can invade large swaths of pasture where soil fertility is poor. Young buck goats will eat dog fennel, but the silicates in sedges make them unpalatable to most species. When determining how to control weeds in their pastures, producers should remember that bare soil is an open invitation to weeds, Dr. Fernandez said. Weeds thrive where soil fertility is poor and forage plant cover is sparse. Producers can use soil tests to adjust the pH and fertility of their soil to help control summer weeds. They can also plant warm season annuals to improve their forage base and cover bare soil with more desirable plants. Dr. Fernandez said mowing a pasture can be an effective way to control weeds. Weeds should be mown before they have a chance to flower and set seed. Mob grazing – the practice of allowing a large number of animals to intensively graze a relatively small section of land – can be used to destroy existing weeds, he said. When using this method, any weeds the animals won’t eat will be trampled by heavy foot traffic. “Herbicides can also be used to control weeds effectively in pastures,” Dr. Fernandez said. “When using herbicides, always be sure to follow the instructions on the product label. Applying too little herbicide will not control weeds, while applying too much may kill the top of a weed but leave the roots alive to regrow later in the season.” Producers should avoid the possibility that applied herbicides will run-off into nearby waterways after rainfall. They should also avoid spraying weeds on windy days, as airborne herbicides can travel into a neighbor’s yard and kill vegetable crops or ornamental plants. Cool, still mornings can also be a bad time to spray herbicides because air currents can allow suspended herbicide droplets to drift for over a mile. For specific recommendations on the appropriate herbicides to use for the weeds in their pastures, producers should contact their local county Extension agent and review Arkansas Cooperative Extension publication MP-44for 2018. Recommendations and laws change each year, so producers should be sure to use the most recent publication, Dr. Fernandez said.

PINE BLUFF, — In Arkansas, one farmer’s weed is another farmer’s favorite forage, says Dr. David Fernandez, Extension livestock specialist and interim assistant dean of academic programs for the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff School of Agriculture, Fisheries and Human Sciences. “Many cattle producers in southern Arkansas brag about their bermudagrass pastures, when bermudagrass is actually listed as a noxious weed in Arkansas,” he said. “However, there are a number of weeds most of us can agree we don’t want to see in our pastures. Not only do unwanted weeds use nutrients our grass could be using, but they also shade out the grass, preventing it from growing.” Weeds usurp space and resources in a pasture, which can be problematic for grazing livestock. Livestock may find a particular weed unpalatable and refuse to eat it. Other weeds are thorny and can damage the mouths of livestock. Dr. Fernandez said there are several varieties of weed toxic to livestock that can overtake pastures. Livestock usually avoid toxic plants; however, animals might resort to eating these plants early in the year when they are the only green plant in sight or during times of drought when there is little or nothing else to graze on. “Bitter sneezeweed and wooly croton – also called goat weed – are toxic to livestock,” Dr. Fernandez said. “If not controlled early, these weeds can quickly overspread entire pastures. They degrade grazing and reduce the available forage by shading out grasses.” Other toxic plants grow in areas where the soil is moist. Perilla mint and hemlock, for example, are toxic weeds often found growing around sources of water or moist areas. Several varieties of spiny weeds can be a nuisance for cattle producers. Pigweed and thistle varieties – including bull, musk, yellow and milk thistles – can quickly spread to cover entire pastures due to the sheer amount of seeds each plant produces. Horse nettle, multiflora rose and greenbrier are other thorny plants that can take over a pasture at a slower pace. “For the most part, livestock avoid thorny weeds because of the pain they cause,” Dr. Fernandez said. “However, these weeds can still be a major problem because of the amount of pasture they overtake in a relatively short time.” Other weeds such as dog fennel and sedges that are not palatable to livestock can invade large swaths of pasture where soil fertility is poor. Young buck goats will eat dog fennel, but the silicates in sedges make them unpalatable to most species. When determining how to control weeds in their pastures, producers should remember that bare soil is an open invitation to weeds, Dr. Fernandez said. Weeds thrive where soil fertility is poor and forage plant cover is sparse. Producers can use soil tests to adjust the pH and fertility of their soil to help control summer weeds. They can also plant warm season annuals to improve their forage base and cover bare soil with more desirable plants. Dr. Fernandez said mowing a pasture can be an effective way to control weeds. Weeds should be mown before they have a chance to flower and set seed. Mob grazing – the practice of allowing a large number of animals to intensively graze a relatively small section of land – can be used to destroy existing weeds, he said. When using this method, any weeds the animals won’t eat will be trampled by heavy foot traffic. “Herbicides can also be used to control weeds effectively in pastures,” Dr. Fernandez said. “When using herbicides, always be sure to follow the instructions on the product label. Applying too little herbicide will not control weeds, while applying too much may kill the top of a weed but leave the roots alive to regrow later in the season.” Producers should avoid the possibility that applied herbicides will run-off into nearby waterways after rainfall. They should also avoid spraying weeds on windy days, as airborne herbicides can travel into a neighbor’s yard and kill vegetable crops or ornamental plants. Cool, still mornings can also be a bad time to spray herbicides because air currents can allow suspended herbicide droplets to drift for over a mile. For specific recommendations on the appropriate herbicides to use for the weeds in their pastures, producers should contact their local county Extension agent and review Arkansas Cooperative Extension publication MP-44 for 2018. Recommendations and laws change each year, so producers should be sure to use the most recent publication, Dr. Fernandez said. Your comment has been submitted.

David,Fernandez,['https://www.detroitbadboys.com/2018/5/9/17332874/dbb-on-3-so-long-farewell'],b'6968',"['Just when signs were pointing to Stan Van Gundy staying on in some capacity word came down that he is actually returning in exactly no capacity at all. Anyone who frequents the comments thread knows the opinions of SVG ranged far and wide and that won’t ever really change. It’s safe to say he didn’t stink up the joint but didn’t exactly leave a sweet smelling perfectly pruned garden of roses either. But time marches on, the coaching carousel never really stops spinning so we won’t dwell too much on SVG here but rather move on to where things might look in the coming months. So long SVG. We’ll always have our FAFW. Ben Gulker: Complete surprise. Sean Wheeler: Pretty surprised. Looks like SVG wasn’t willing to let go of his control of the FO. Ryan Pravato: Is my car radio playing tricks on me? That’s when I first heard the news right after work. I hadn’t checked my phone or the interwebz the whole afternoon. Oopsies. Justin Lambregtse: My first thought was “why did Gores wait so long to fire him?” Jamie Delaney: I’ve been catching up on Handmaids Tale season 2 so my first thought was “Praise Be.” Jordan Bellant: I think it was the right move. Both for Stan and for our franchise. I really like Stan and given the instructions he was given from ownership, he did a pretty good job for us. He didn’t have much margin for error and some bad luck and injuries hurt this team from getting back to the playoffs. A lot of people will hang ‘Kennard over Mitchell’ around his neck, but beyond that, it wasn’t that bad. David Fernandez: I was upset, I wanted to see to see SVG at least coach out the final year of his contract (while being stripped of PoBo title). When the Blake Griffin trade was made, I thought that guaranteed him one last year of making a run at it, and with all of the circumstances to why Detroit eventually under-delivered, was out of SVG’s control. Steve Hinson: That Stan and Tom Gores’ inability to see eye to eye on SVG’s role moving forward cost him his job. Definitely a surprise, but with the reports out about SVG’s resistance to what Gores wanted moving forward, not a huge surprise. Ben Gulker: I think Gores is all in on Blake Griffin. Everything else is up for grabs. Sean Wheeler: It’s “C.” Gores probably knows the roster is good enough to make noise in the playoffs next year, but thinks the floor could be higher in case of injury. Ryan Pravato: The problem is Gores, so there’s a good chance that his thinking is flawed (read: clueless). Justin Lambregtse: Gores is going to go with one last go with this roster. The Pistons only played 4 games with Reggie Jackson, Andre Drummond, and Blake Griffin. I would be disappointed if they didn’t give it another go. Jamie Delaney: Feels like A is the most logical, Gores-ian option considering how he handled bringing SVG into the fold. Think he’s too busy counting money in Malibu to think beyond that. I DO think the new FO will have an interesting challenge on their hands when it comes to this roster and finances (sigh). Jordan Bellant: A. I think he wants to see what we have, and then make tougher decisions in the Summer of 2019. That also gives a new front office one full year to evaluate the roster. I would much rather see that, instead of having a new front office and coaching staff tear this down before they’ve properly evaluated the personnel. David Fernandez: Gores is not a man who seems like he can stomach a tank. His team has made the playoffs one time since he purchased the Pistons back in 2011. He just moved the team to downtown Detroit, and he wants success now. His hires will reflect that win-now mentality. Steve Hinson: A, which I still think is weird. Gores said in the press release that they thought they had a roster that could be competitive in the East. So it’s strange that they want to bring in someone new to execute someone else’s vision. But ok. Ben Gulker: Budenholzer would be a perfect fit. For more, listen to the DBB podcast! Sean Wheeler: Budenholzer might have to apologize to Andre for all the hacking, but clearly knows how to get the most out of a roster with less than superstar talent. As for the FO, Chauncey is a wildcard, so there is nothing close to a comfortable choice out there. Ryan Pravato: Stackhouse for new head coach? Who knows -- it’s just going to be a helluva task with this mess of a situation. God help him (or her). Justin Lambregtse: I do not know a ton about GM candidates, so I will go with David Griffin. I would hire Mike Budenholzer as head coach. He is the best offensive coach on the market and that is what this team needs. Jamie Delaney: I think Budenholzer is an obvious favorite. People forget how stupid good Atlanta looked 3-4 years ago, their offense was, dare I say, Spurs-esque at their peak. My gut tells me Stackhouse is a close second because he might be cheaper, and he will sell tickets coming back to Detroit. Front office-wise, I like the idea of David Griffin running the show with a Chauncey/Brent Barry supporting member to learn the ropes. Jordan Bellant: I’ve made my feelings on this pretty well known. I want Arn Tellem as President of Basketball Operations, Chauncey Billups as General Manager and bring back Ken Catanella in some role within the front office. Then, I want Jerry Stackhouse as Head Coach. I’d like to see a former NBA Head Coach on the bench. Maybe Steve Clifford or Larry Drew? Also, Stack has played with guys like Adrian Griffin and Juwan Howard - I’d like to see someone like that come on to help coach the big men. Also, let’s take a year to see what we have before blowing it up. David Fernandez: I’m all in on Mike Budenholzer as coach. For the front office, the guy who’s made my ears perk up more than any other candidate is Mike Zarren (Assistant GM of the Celtics). Steve Hinson: Coach: Jerry Stackhouse. I tend to be more of a believer in G-League results, and I really like what he did with Raptors 905. Best defense in the league for two years in a row, league finals two years in a row while winning one of those. As Gulks said, give the podcast a listen - Laz did a great job of making Stackhouse’s case. Front office: Well, Jeff Bower hasn’t actually been fired yet. I don’t really think he should be. I get why Gores fired SVG - they had different ideas on the organization’s structure. Ok. But Gores is happy with the roster that’s been built. That’s on Bower. So why fire him? Simply for the sake of starting fresh? That seems a poor reason to me... My plan from A-C? Probably C. I’d want the new coach to get a sense of some of the players and their personalities, then provide their honest feedback on how confident they were that they could work with them. ——————--——--——- So that’s where we’re at...what about you all? Copy/paste the questions and share your thoughts and answers in the comments below: 1. What was the first thing that went through your head when you heard Stan was gone? 2. What’s your gut feeling on where Gores wants to take this next season: A. One last go with this basic roster and a new coach and front office B. Time to tear it down and start fresh C. Somewhere in between 3. If you were the owner who’d be your top choice for coach and for front office and what would your plan be from options A-C?']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

PAOK Thessaloniki claimed the title with 2-0. (Xinhua/Panagiotis Moschandreou) ATHENS, May 12 (Xinhua) -- PAOK Thessaloniki won the final of the Greek Cup against AEK Athens 2-0 on Saturday night at the Athens Olympic sports center OAKA. The captain of PAOK AdelinoVieirinha scored the first goal at 65\' with a foul and Dimitris Pelkas scored the second goal at 92\'. PAOK had the chance to score earlier at 23\', when the team won a penalty, but AEK goalkeeper, Vasilis Barkas repeled the shoot from Aleksandar Prijovic. Both teams finished the game with fewer players than they started due to red cards to Mauricio, Varela (PAOK) and Vranjes (AEK). PAOK won the second Greek Cup in two consecutive years, both times playing in the finals against AEK Athens. During celebrations on Saturday night the players of the Thessaloniki club wore masks with the face of the owner of the team, Ivan Savvides. The entire Greek Super League was temporarily suspended earlier this year when Savvidis stormed the field with a handgun to protest a penalty during a match against AEK. Greek football games have been marred by violence several times in recent years. The Hellenic Football Federation appointed a foreign referee , David Fernandez Borbalan from Spain, for Saturday\'s final to curb accusations of bias. More than 15,000 fans of PAOK traveled to Athens from the northern city port of Thessaloniki to support their team in OAKA stadium. Clashes erupted between AEK and PAOK fans in the center of the Greek capital and the area around the OAKA stadium. A PAOK supporter was stabbed and three police officers were injured during the scuffles, while a mini bus was burned outside the stadium, Greek national news agency AMNA reported.

The Enquirer Cincinnati Reds relief pitcher David Hernandez (37) follows through on a pitch in the seventh inning during a National League baseball game between the New York Mets and the Cincinnati Reds, Tuesday, May 8, 2018, at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. Cincinnati won 7-2. (Photo: Kareem Elgazzar) LOS ANGELES — The Reds took a five-game winning streak into Sunday’s game, despite getting fewer than six innings from the starter in four of those games. You don’t do that without some heavy lifting from the bullpen. The bullpen had thrown 20 1/3 innings during the streak and allowed two runs (0.89 ERA). The bullpen was the one area the Reds addressed through free agency in the offseason, signing right-handers Jared Hughes ($4.5 million) and David Fernandez ($5 million) to two-year deals. So far, it looks like money well spent. Hughes entered Sunday with a 1.52 ERA over 20 games and 23 2/3 innings. He had walked five and struck out 20. Hernandez entered Sunday with a 2.00 ERA in seven games and nine innings. He had walked three and struck out 11. They combined to get the final 12 outs in Saturday’s 5-3 victory over the Dodgers. “Talking through the years to so many baseball people, it’s so hard to put a bullpen together,” Reds manager Jim Riggleman said, “because it looks like (someone’s) a guy to get and then he doesn’t have the same year. “Knock on wood, to this point in the season, we’ve really hit the gold mine with those two to stabilize the bullpen and really be a challenge to the hitters. They’ve really thrown the ball good. (Saturday) was as good as Hernandez has thrown.” Hernandez went 2 1/3 innings and allowed only one hit. It was his longest outing of the year. “I was joking before the game about going three innings,” Hernandez said. “I said, ‘only if I get an at-bat.’ Sure enough, it happened. I’ve got to be careful about what I say.” Hernandez stung the ball but right at right fielder Matt Kemp. Hughes has been excellent from Day 1 of the season. Hernandez started the year on the disabled list with a sore shoulder. He wasn’t activated April 27. The recovery was longer than expected, but he’s glad he took the time to get it right. “It’s one of the things if you try to push through it, it could linger into June and July,” he said. “I feel like we had a great approach to it. We took the time to strengthen my shoulder and make necessary adjustments in my pregame routine.” “I feel great now. After every outing, it gets a little bit better, and I get more sense of what my pitches are doing. I’m mainly trying to throw strikes. NO IGGY: Riggleman’s confidence in Hughes allowed him to stay away from using closer Raisel Iglesias Saturday night. Hughes got the final five outs for his first save as a Red. Iglesias had thrown in the previous three games. “Three days in a row used to be the norm, sometimes four,” Riggleman said. “Now, it’s two, sometimes three. We were committed to not using him.” DAY FOR SCOOTER: Scooter Gennett was out of the lineup Sunday as he will occasionally be to rest his right shoulder. “Scooter’s feeling good,” Riggleman said. “We’re trying to have some maintenance with that shoulder. He’ll play the three in San Francisco, and then we have the off-day Thursday. Just trying to keep that shoulder strong. . . Day game after night game. “His shoulder is getting much better.”""]",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

This leaves us with a conference finals round that should prove a lot more interesting. The West features the matchup most saw coming just a few weeks into the season: Golden State vs Houston. According to ESPN, going by efficiency, this is the best offensive matchup in modern NBA history. Since team turnovers became official in 1973-74, there has never been a playoff series between squads that both averaged at least 112 points per 100 possessions. Damn. In the East we have the perennial favorites vs the “They Shouldn’t Be Here’s” in Cleveland vs Boston. No one saw Boston here when Gordon Hayward went down in the first five minutes of game one, and that sentiment grew when they lost Kyrie Irving for the season. Yet here they are, and Brad Stevens is quickly becoming even more revered (look out Pop, the new kid’s gaining ground in the popularity contest). While this may look from the outset like a fourth(!) straight matchup of the Cavs vs the Warriors, it’s easily the most competitive matchup in both Conference in these last four years. ESPN’s BPI actually has the Rockets with a 64 percent chance of getting to the Finals and it gives the Celtics with a 72 percent chance to make their way through. With that set up let’s take a look at how a few of our writers see this going down plus we asked a question about those unlucky four who fell to the wayside last round. (Editor’s note: All of these picks were submitted prior to Boston’s Game 1 win) Justin Lambregtse: Cleveland in 5. Brad Stevens has done a masterful job with the undermanned Celtics this postseason, but LeBron James is too good and he will continue his dominant postseason. Lazarus Jackson: Cavs in 6. My tweet about picking against LeBron in non-Warriors situations still stands. Ben Gulker: LeBron in 5. Steve Hinson: The average margin of victory for the Cavs in last year’s Eastern Conference Finals against the Celtics was 26 points. The only game the Celtics won was because Marcus Smart lost his mind and went 7-10 from three. Repeat of last year, Cavs in 5. Storyline will be similar to the Raptors’ exit, where the team feels good about their regular season but has an existential crisis after being steamrolled by LeBron. No firings or anything, but the Celtics looking in the mirror and feeling all inadequate. Chris Daniels: I’m going out on a limb and say Boston in 7. Al Horford has played amazingly well in his papa bear role, and Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Terry Rozier seem to have no fear of the spotlight. If Aron Baynes can prove as effective as he was against Philly this could be very interesting. Plus if Lebron goes out before the Finals, we’ll have an offseason to end all offseasons. David Fernandez: Cleveland in 6. This Boston team is outstanding but LeBron, and more importantly, his supporting cast really turned it up in the Toronto series. If the supporting casts looks like they did against Indy, then Boston could take this series in 7. Justin Lambregtse: Houston in 7. This will be a hard fought series and it will ultimately come down to who has home court advantage, which is the Rockets. The storyline will be Chris Paul killing the narrative that he can’t lead a team to the Finals as he takes over and leads the Rockets in scoring. Lazarus Jackson: Warriors in.... 5. I sincerely hope this series goes longer than five games, but my tweet about the Warriors still stands. Ben Gulker: Warriors in 7. Warriors will be keyed in defensively, and their offense will be better than Houston’s defense. Steve Hinson: This is what we’ve been waiting for all season. I’m going to take the Rockets in 7 because of Gerald Green’s hair. But this is a tight matchup, I could legitimately see it going either way. I think the storyline will be that this could be one of the best series that we’ve seen in quite some time. Chris Daniels: Houston in 7. This, like picking Boston is a bit of wishful thinking, but I think Houston can do this. As with Baynes in the East, a lot will ride on how effective Clint Capela can be in this matchup. And as with the possibility of Lebron getting knocked out early, the idea of the “Chosen Ones” being knocked out would make this summer an incredibly interesting one. David Fernandez: Golden State in 6. The storyline is simple: The Warriors are too good, no matter who they play against. Justin Lambregtse: Toronto from a negative stance. This was supposed to be the year for them, and they still got swept by the Cavs. They will have to determine if it is time to blow it up and start trying to build a better team for the future, or run it back next year if LeBron leaves the East and you have to deal with the up-and-coming Celtics and Sixers. Lazarus Jackson: THIS is a good question. Philadelphia, I think, is the traditional answer because of their ability to add a max-level free agent to the “core” of Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, Robert Covington, and Dario Saric, but Utah has more cap space than you’d think and Donovan Mitchell’s ascension will be attractive to other players. On the negative side, poor Toronto just fired Dwane Casey, but that doesn’t change the fundamental question of “How Do We Beat LeBron,” so it might not even matter. Ben Gulker: Philly. Right now their ceiling seems sky high. A smart offseason could push them to the next level, but throwing big money at mediocre players could cause them to stagnate. Steve Hinson: Philly’s. They relied so heavily on contributions from J.J. Redick, Amir Johnson, Marco Belinelli, and Ersan Ilyasova, all of whom aren’t under contract for next year. So do they #TrustTheProcess and let their young guys like Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot, Richaun Holmes, and Justin Anderson step up to fill those roles and risk a step backwards, or try to bring them back? Or can they finally land a big free agent? LeBron James isn’t going there, that’s just false hope. But what about Paul George? Or chasing even more young talent with a restricted free agent like Aaron Gordon, Julius Randle, or Jabari Parker? Chris Daniels: I think they’re all interesting for different reasons, but Toronto is the obvious choice for “Team Offseason Turnover.” However, the choice New Orleans has to bring back Boogie or not, plus seeing what players Philly and Utah add to their promising cores will also be fun to watch. David Fernandez: Toronto. They already fired Casey, now it’ll be interesting to see if they make any major moves from a roster perspective. ____________________________________ Those are our thoughts and predictions, what are yours?

David Schwartz, the director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, expects a lot of people will go head to Atlantic City to make their sports bets. “The reason why people come to the casino to watch the games is because they have that big game atmosphere with the TVs and you’re around a lot of other people who are also betting on the games,” Schwartz said. “So it’s very exciting. It’s really more of an entertainment thing than a dollars and cents money proposition.” But while sports wagering gives the struggling gambling town a new opportunity to draw tourists, said public finance attorney David Fernandez, it might benefit casino companies more than the city because sports gambling could be made available online. “It may not be the boom that they think it’s going to be if the online gambling takes off and becomes an alternative that folks might want to do instead,” Fernandez said. Roger Gross, the publisher of Global Gaming Business Magazine, expects the sports betting operations in Atlantic City will be more low-key than the big sports books in Las Vegas. “You’re not going to see huge rooms with hundreds of screens and things of that nature,” he said. “The times have changed since they built those huge auditorium type of rooms. Nowadays, you can bet on kiosks. You can bet on your mobile phones. You can bet anywhere else in the casino.” Gross says sports wagering may help the existing casinos in Atlantic City cope with the opening of two new casinos next month. “It does produce more revenue for the casinos,” he said. “So it gives them a little more leeway with what they can actually do and how they can survive.” The parent company of Parx Casino of Bensalem has put down a $10 million deposit to cover sports betting at its Bucks County location and the Turf Club. 1 month ago Legalized sports betting is helping to boost gambling revenues in New Jersey. 2 months ago State officials expect the launch to make a significant contribution to tourism in Delaware — where 17 percent of visitors participate in gaming. 4 months ago Want a digest of WHYY’s programs, events & stories?

You can bet anywhere else in the casino.” Gross says sports wagering may help the existing casinos in Atlantic City cope with the opening of two new casinos next month. “It does produce more revenue for the casinos. So it give them a little more leeway with what they can actually do and how they can survive.” View the discussion thread.']",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1022331.0

The special edition Foil Disc was presented to Neymar by Mitchelton-SCOTT mechanic David Fernandez in Paris, with the team\'s logo and plenty of personal touches for Neymar himself. The Neymar Jr logo as used on the Neymar signature Nike Mercurial Vapor football boots appears on the front of the bike\'s top tube and seat tube, while his \'Family\' tattoo has been added to the back of the top tube and the down tube. The bike comes with a full Dura-Ace 9150 mechanical groupset, Syncros Aero Wheels, Syncros RR1.0 saddle and custom Continental Gran Prix 4000 tyres with gold logos.

Mitchelton-Scott mechanic David Fernandez presented the PSG player with the bike. The special edition has been painted in the colours of the Brazilian flag and features Neymar\'s tattoo \'family forever\' on the top and down tubes. His own personal logo and the badge of the Brazilian federation also feature. Bernhard Eisel (Dimension Data) is making small steps towards recovery after undergoing brain surgery last month. The Austrian has been putting in some small rides on the home trainer, but remains under observation. Eisel has been out of action since a heavy crash that left him with a broken wrist at Tirreno-Adriatico in March. He had been progressing well following the accident but had been suffering with headaches. Scans revealed that he had a subdural haematoma, which required immediate surgery. After time spent in hospital, he has been making progress once again and he hopes to be back on the road again soon. ""I\'m feeling OK, and I\'ve been back on the turbo for the last three days now. We\'re talking 30-40 minutes, really gentle. I still have to take it super gentle but I\'m making progress and hoping to be back on the road outside again soon,"" he said to Eurosport, who he is working for a few days at the Giro d\'Italia. ""It\'s one scan at a time. The next scan is on the 25th then I\'ll know a bit more. I had a massive haematoma. It was really, really massive - I was shocked when I saw it. It definitely makes you think… I\'m not the youngest anymore; I have two kids at home. I still love racing, and I don\'t want to leave the sport like this; I want to leave when I want and not when someone else decides. But sometimes you can\'t decide things. But at the moment I\'m in good spirits and good hopes that I\'ll definitely race again.” Organisers of the Tour of California announced the renewal of title sponsor Amgen in a ""multi-year"" deal of unspecified length. The Thousand Oaks-based biotech corporation made its fortunes by creating recombinant EPO to treat patients with kidney failure whose bodies did not produce enough of the hormone to maintain blood levels. The company has sponsored the race since its beginnings in 2006 - a partnership that often drew questions because their drug Aranesp continues to be abused by athletes to this day. Remy di Gregorio was suspended this April after testing positive for the drug. Amgen\'s relationship with the race centres largely around the event\'s Breakaway from Cancer initiatives, and the organisers AEG have partnered with the company to launch a bike safety programme for youths. ""The Amgen Tour of California has developed into one of the premier sporting events in North America,"" said Kristin Klein, president, Amgen Tour of California and executive vice president, AEG Sports. ""Alongside our partners at Amgen, we\'ve been able to shape the race into not only one of the sport\'s most prestigious annual events, but also a platform that gives voice to important initiatives like heart health and cancer awareness.""

Photo ProvidedMurphy McCool sprays pink coloring on Pastor Matt Stump before services at Rossville-Bismarck United Methodist Church. Stump said he would dye his hair if Murphy reached his goal of raising $1,500, which he exceeded. ROSSVILLE — Matt Stump, pastor of Rossville-Bismarck United Methodist Church, jokingly told his congregations last Sunday: “This is the last time I’m challenging a kid to do anything.” Stump told Murphy McCool that he’d dye his hair pink if the student raised $1,500 for breast cancer research. “I never expected him to make that much money,” he said. Murphy, a seventh-grader at Rossville-Alvin Elementary School, not only met his goal, but he exceeded it. He ended up raising $1,629.62, which he’ll donate to the Bobette Steely Hegeler Cancer Care Center in Danville at a later date. Murphy said he was “very pleased” with how much money he raised. He decided in August to do something to help people with cancer. His grandfather died of liver cancer, and he knows people in his church who have survived cancer. Stump issued his challenge in August, and Murphy began his fundraising in October. His fundraising efforts included: setting pink flamingoes in people’s yards in the Rossville and Bismarck area, having a hat day at Rossville-Alvin and Bismarck-Henning elementary schools (where students paid $1 to wear a hat) and holding a bake sale at the bank in Rossville. Getting into the spirit, Michael Koester, a physical education teacher at Rossville, sprayed his hair pink to support Murphy. And then, Stump made good on his word and let Murphy spray the pastor’s hair pink. Stump preached at both Rossville and Bismarck churches with pink hair. Stump said Murphy took the church’s mission statement — to love Jesus Christ and love others in ways that will transform our lives, our community and our world — and ran with it. He told Murphy, “This is what ‘love others’ looks like. He took that to heart.” Murphy stepped up and worked hard with his fundraisers, Stump said, adding, “You give a kid a goal and hope he reaches it, and Murphy exceeded it.” Murphy is the son of Clint and Mary McCool of the Rossville area.

GEORGE (News4 Utah) - St. George Police say a case they first notified the public about in March, has been solved and a suspect charged. Police say the suspect harassed multiple teenage girls over two school years. The victims were Pine View High students and police say it was a quick thinking parent of one of those victims who helped police find the suspect. ""Obscene comments were made to these students to the point they both had reported this to myself and the St. George Police Department,"" said Pine View High School\'s Resource Officer Michael Koester. Koester says one student was victimized three times and with each incident says she reported more details and recognized the vehicle. ""The family of the victim seen this truck out on the roadway near their residence and was able to follow it to a nearby store, where I received a phone call they were following it. I was able to get police officers over there, and we were able to identify the subject,"" said Koester. That man is 31-year-old Christopher Alder; who Washington City Fire Department confirms is a part-time firefighter. Police says Alder confessed to harassing the students in an interview. He was charged December 19th. Police say they are grateful to the students who told Officer Koester. ""Incidents like this actually highlight why it\'s such an important thing to have officers at our schools. So in the event that something like this happens, or anything that makes them uncomfortable or scared, they know they have someone they can go to that can help them,"" said St. George Police Spokesperson Lona Trombley. Alder was cited and released on four charges of disorderly conduct. St. George police remind parents the importance of talking to children about what they should do in a situation like this, to discuss safe places they can run, to kick and scream if someone tries to get them into a vehicle, and to always notify police.

Michael,Koester,['http://www.hillsdale.net/sports/20180502/wildcats-top-academy-litchfield-at-home-jamboree'],b'6954',"['PITTSFORD — It was a good night for the home team when Pittsford hosted Litchfield, Tekonsha, Lenawee Christian and Hillsdale Academy for an SCAA Jamboree on Wednesday. The Wildcats came out on top in both the boys (79 team points) and girls (107) categories, with Hillsdale Academy in second (69, 67) and Litchfield in third (37, 34). Lenawee Christian took fourth (29, 10) and Tekonsha took fifth in the boys category (5), with no girls team. A late-breaking thunderstorm prevented the teams from finishing all of their scheduled events. “It was pretty competitive. It was too bad about the weather,” said Litchfield head coach Dave Tefft. While the Terriers took third overall, sophomore Tristan Morton performed well individually, scoring second in the 100m dash (12.09) and the 400m dash (55.82). Pittsford’s Ben Sprunger followed Morton in third in the 100m with a time of 12:36, and Hillsdale Academy\'s Joel Brady nabbed the bronze in the 400m (59.13). Hillsdale Academy athletes led the 1600m run with Nick Rush taking first (4:49.25) and John O’Connor finishing in 5:09.12 for third. Pittsford returned the favor in the 110m hurdles. Michael Koester took first for the Wildcats (16.96) and Kimball Hughes came in third (21.02). The Academy\'s Levi Socha squeezed in the middle for a second place finish (18.57). The Wildcats and the Colts traded leads in the 400m and 800m relays. In the 400m, the team of Alexander Bastien, Koester, Sprunger and Skylor Osborn led Pittsford to a first place finish (46.47), with the Academy team composed of Ryan Van Havel, Derek Vander Hoff, Nolan Sullivan and Socha coming in second (50.44). The 800m, however, split in the Academy’s favor with Peter Kalthoff, Ian Calvert, Brady and Connor Oakley leading the Colts to a 1:40.6 first place time. Bastien, Sprunger, Jeremy Britton and Trevor Stockford were close behind (1:43.67). As the relays got longer, Pittsford got stronger. In the 3200m variety, Wildcats Ethan Spahr, Kody Smith, Todd Kuhn and Ricker Probst (9:39.59) downed the Academy relay team (9:52.06). When the events shifted toward strength, Pittsford continued to lead with Kimball Hughes (44\'7.75"") and Trevor Stockford (69\'10"") scoring personal records in shot put and discus, respectively. Nolan Sullivan (42\'0.25"") , of Hillsdale Academy and Corey Hall (37\'5.75"") , of Litchfield, followed in shot put, and Litchfield’s Connor Ewers (67\'7"") and the Academy’s Nick Treloar (61\'5"") trailed in discus. The Colts had an edge in height, however. Peter Kalthoff led the high jump competition with leap of 6\'2"", besting Pittsford’s Michael Koester (6\') and Ricker Probst (5\'7""). The pole vault carried Kalthoff’s teammate Jacob Krutsch even higher (12\'), with Jeremy Britton, of Pittsford, trailing at 10\'6"". Kalthoff performed in the long jump, as well, scoring a third place finish with a leap of 18\'9.5"". He was outperformed, though, by Morton (19\'1"") in second and Osborn (19\'3.5"") in first. On the girls side, the Wildcats were even more dominant with Alison Toner (13.82), Gabby Richards (13.96), Jordyn Cole (14.06) and Rachael Patterson (14.13) taking first through fourth in the 100m dash. Toner put in a strong showing in the 400m dash as well, taking second (1:04.51), leading Hillsdale Academy’s Helen Schlueter (1:06.51) and trailing the Academy’s Anna Roberts (1:03.49). Toner was back on top in the 100m hurdles (16.84), with the Colts’ Isabella Socha and Wildcat teammate Kaleigh Bonner (19.26) trailing. “That was a pretty tough day,” Pittsford head coach Brian Smith said of Toner’s schedule. The junior athlete won three back-to-back events, and took second in a third. “She’d never run the 100 before so to have her get the fastest for us, that stood out quite a bit.” Renee Osborne turned in a first place performance for Pittsford in the 1600m run with a 5:57.21 finish. The Wildcats took first in both the 400m and 800m relays, with Cole, Patterson, Richards and Makayla McDaniel (53.46) winning the 400m and Cole, Richards, McDaniel and Toner taking the 800m. Hillsdale Academy’s relay team won the 3200m with an 11:56.06 final time, beating out the nearest competition—Pittsford’s Bonner, McKenzi Ellenwood, Alisa Strachn and Sierra Voelzke (12:30.99) by more than half a minute. Discus was Litchfield’s time to shine with Allie Vanous (120\'4"") and Kailey Gamble (103\'9"") taking first and second. Thunder reared its ugly head before the completion of the meet, preventing Vanous and Gamble from competing in shot put. Tefft said that Vanous’ goal is to finish the year as state champion in both discus and shot put, a reasonable goal given that both she and Gamble are in the top 10 in the state. “They’re a good one-two punch,” Tefft said. Freshman Makenna Banbury led the Academy to a win in the high jump (4\'9""), with Pittsford’s Lindsey Clarke and teammate Anna Roberts matching Banbury’s height, but coming in second and third due to number of attempts. Patterson and Mollie Smith took first and second for Pittsford in the pole vault, both with heights of 8\'6"". Socha was six inches lower and a spot behind with a vault of 8\'. Van Havel and Roberts won gold and silver for the Academy in the long jump with bounds of 15\'8"" and 15\'7"" respectively. Clarke took bronze (14\'11""). The Colts will race again on Friday at Onsted. The Wildcats and Terriers will get back in action the following day, competing in the Quincy Invitational. Choose the plan that\'s right for you.

He could be seen plowing, planting, threshing, logging and giving sleigh rides with his horses and equipment. ""His generosity was enormous and his plows, carts and bobsleds have enhanced the experience of countless visitors to OWW over the years,"" his nomination stated. His nomination mentioned he loved helping people with problems they were having with their horses or equipment, as well as teaching at driving clinics the JCDHA held. ""His dedication to preserving the art of horse-powered work and farming was absolute. His knowledge was acquired during a lifetime of experience and perseverance. His desire to share his knowledge and passions was all-encompassing … He loved his horses and what they could do, and wanted to show as many people as possible,"" stated his nomination. Berner also helped out in his community and at his church. He is survived by his wife Carol, daughter Nina (Michael) Koester and grandchildren Eric and Melissa Koester.

Courtney Anarian Brown, 36, Paris John Earnest Devine, 25, and Raymond Christopher Seay, 39, were indicted Thursday on charges of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine. Brown and Devine also were charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime resulting in death. Authorities say Brown fatally shot Ramone Thomas, of St. Louis, while the men were attempting to burglarize a mobile home in the 700 block of Chancellor Lane. The homeowner came home during the burglary and confronted those inside, police said. The owner, Chad Coffman, 36, was charged with possession with intent to distribute over 500 grams of meth and being a felon in possession of a firearm. The burglars ran off, but during their escape, Brown apparently fired a shot at the homeowner, striking Thomas instead, according to charges. Devine is also charged in an armed carjacking that took place Sept. 28 in St. Louis. Kathleen Marie Hydar, 30, was indicted on a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

The Isle of Man is considering a radical bill that would legalize abortion up until birth. If this bill becomes law, doctors who refuse to commit abortions could be imprisoned. Dear Monsignor Devine, I was deeply saddened by your letter to the Chief Minister that was published in the “Isle of Man Today” (15 February) and also made available to churchgoers. Your words grieve me as a woman, as a Catholic, and as a pro-life advocate. I am grieved as a woman, because abortion is never good for women. Killing their unborn child does not help any mother, under any circumstances. On the contrary, recent studies show that: The list goes on. Often the real pain unfolds years later, when those who “supported” a woman in “her choice” are no longer around. That expectant mothers are presented with a real “choice” is the great lie of our age. The overwhelming majority of women who turn to ARCH, our post-abortion counselling service, say that they felt they had no choice. Many women feel betrayed – not because those around them failed to support them in their decision to have an abortion, but because they feel they have been pushed into one by the false compassion of their husbands, boyfriends, and even priests, who have taken a step back instead of offering the real support which would have protected them and their child from an irreversible tragedy. Your words grieve me as a Catholic, because they deform our faith. Every abortion kills an innocent human being created in the image and likeness of God, and loved by Him from the very moment of conception. To take the life of an innocent child is always a grave sin crying out to Heaven – and this takes place over 200,000 times each year in Britain. The number of children who have died worldwide as a result of legalised abortion is greater than the number of deaths in all the wars in recorded human history. The world is in desperate need of hearing the Church proclaim the truth, clearly and boldly, to provide the opportunity for conversion, repentance and liberation from sin. I converted from Protestantism, in large part because of what the Church teaches concerning the truth about human life and the family. It is heart-breaking for me, and countless other converts, when the words of our spiritual fathers distort the beauty of some of the very things which attracted us to the one true Church. Your words grieve me as a pro-life advocate, because it is impossible for pro-life citizens to counter the attacks of secular powers against human life if Catholic Church leaders give those in power the green light to “make difficult decisions on our behalf”, even when those decisions involved the destruction of innocent human life. I was born and raised in Estonia, where widespread abortion forms a part of the Communist legacy. Now living in the UK, it is deeply saddening to find leaders here, including faith leaders, freely accepting the ideas that have led to the killing of more unborn children in my home country than there are people living today. It is the attitude displayed in your letter which has allowed abortion to continue for 50 years in Britain. If our faith leaders fail to take an unequivocal stand in defence of the unborn and their families, how can we convince anyone else to take abortion seriously? Perhaps your comments were made in the context of the recent Abort 67 campaign, in which graphic images of abortion were displayed. If so, you may have wished to apologise for the use of such methods within the pro-life movement, because you were concerned that it might detract from the Church’s witness to the reality of abortion. Graphic images of abortion are very disturbing and make us wish to distance ourselves from what we see. However, one must also ask what the real problem is: Showing the pictures or what those pictures show? By proposing abortion up to birth, virtually on demand, and by threatening doctors who have a conscientious objection to abortion with criminal sanctions, the bill that is being debated in the House of Keys is among the most extreme pieces of legislation on abortion ever seen in Europe, and, indeed, the world. You seem to be under the impression that perhaps a “more balanced” version of the bill could be adopted. The experience of most countries that have provided abortion in limited cases is that this soon leads to abortion on demand. Once we accept that pain and suffering can be eliminated by eliminating people, there is no logical place to draw an end. I am only a lay woman, and have no formal authority to correct you. But I pray in earnest that Our Holy Mother would enkindle a true and lively faith in your heart, with real love for the teaching of the Church that you serve. The priestly character has a unique dignity and grandeur: we depend on our priests, especially at this dark hour for the family and for the Church, to teach the faith in season and out of season, and to guide us to eternal life in Heaven. I pray that you may recover the strength and courage needed to teach the truth, guide and protect the flock trusted to your care, including the most vulnerable of children and their mothers.

In more than two decades working with a number of the Dublin District Schoolboy League’s (DDSL) top clubs, he has helped to develop dozens of players who’ve gone on to carve out careers in the game — both abroad and at home in the League of Ireland. Having started out with Kilnamanagh, Bolger enjoyed significant success at the unfancied Tallaght side before moving on to Cherry Orchard. After six years on The Lawns in Ballyfermot, ex-Ireland international John Devine asked him to link up with the likes of LOI legend Mick Neville and former Brighton midfielder Gary Howlett at Shelbourne. There, he took over an U11s team that possessed bags of talent including Anthony Stokes, Robert Bayly, Simon Madden, Mark Byrne, Eoin Doyle and Gary McCabe, who — barring Bray Wanderers midfielder McCabe — all earned moves to British clubs. Stokes hasn\'t fulfilled his potential. Source: INPHO “That was the best side I’ve ever been involved with,” Bolger tells The42. “They were unbeaten in the league for five years. Simon was a great schoolboy player at centre-half. His reading of the game was exceptional. He’s a really good character too.” Stokes was the pick of the bunch, and by 15, the striker had joined Arsenal. Highly-rated by Arsene Wenger, he worked his way through the ranks and enjoyed a productive loan spell at Falkirk, but the Dubliner only managed one first-team appearance for the Gunners before Roy Keane brought him to Sunderland for £2million in 2007. Disciplinary issues have followed him throughout his career, and although Stokes spent six years at Celtic along with spells with Hibernian, Blackburn Rovers and current club Apollon Smyrni of Greece, the nine-time-capped Ireland forward has been unable to live up to the early promise. “Stokesy was the most talented teenager to come out of this country — absolutely,” claims Bolger, who even rates his ability as a youngster above Ireland’s all-time record goalscorer. “But there are so many boxes you have to tick. It’s not about just having it down there [points at feet], you’ve got to have that fire in your belly. You have to want to be a footballer, be prepared to listen and take things on board.” Bayly, meanwhile, moved to Leeds United at 14 but picked up a gambling habit and, after stints at several LOI clubs, the former midfielder was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison last week for transporting almost €200,000 worth of cannabis. “Bocker was a bit of a wild boy,” Bolger says of the 30-year-old, “but he was a lovely young fella.” Bayly in action for Leeds United against Portsmouth midfielder Pedro Mendes.

And while Doran and Gunning both agreed to join Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea won the race to sign talented midfielder Clifford. A teenage prodigy, he led the Blues to their first FA Youth Cup victory since 1961 in 2010 — scoring the decisive goal against Aston Villa in the final. With owner Roman Abramovich ploughing millions into the Chelsea’s academy, it was an important milestone for the club and they have lifted the trophy five more times since then. Thing haven’t gone so well for Clifford, however. A rake of loan spell and short-term moves followed and he wound up playing non-league football before returning to Ireland to join Dundalk a little over a year ago. Having admitted suffering from depression in a recent interview with the Irish Independent, he is currently serving a six-month ban for breaching betting rules in the UK but hopes to make a comeback in April. It’s another cautionary tale for aspiring players and parents who believe earning a move to a big club is the be-all and end-all. “Conor was brilliant,” says Bolger. “Unbelievable vision, the only thing he lacked was pace. As a midfielder, he just saw everything. “I think something like seven managers came through while he was there. He would be called up to the first team but they weren’t giving the youth players a chance, they just wanted to bring in their own players on big money. That would have been very disheartening. “If young players have too much time on their hands, they will turn to other things to distract them like drinking and gambling. Drink is a major problem when young footballers go away. They want to be out and girls are throwing themselves at them. They’ve nothing else to do.” Glen Macauley celebrates scoring for Liverpool\'s U18s against Man United. Source: Nick Taylor/Liverpool FC Now with St Joseph’s Boys, Bolger also nurtured the talents of Glen MacAuley, who is lining out for Steven Gerrard’s U18s having joined Liverpool in June 2016. They still have some way to go, but he has tipped the 17-year-old striker and two more of his former players — Mipo Odubelo and Festy Ebosele — for the top. Both of Nigerian descent, Tallaght native Odubeko is with Manchester United’s academy, while Enniscorthy’s Ebosele opted for Derby County. “There were other clubs looking at him and he could’ve gone to a bigger one, but he just liked it at Derby. That’s a really important factor when young lads go away, it has to be the right fit for them.” Bolger has won somewhere in the region of 20 schoolboy league titles to date, but he believes player development is main priority and how you achieve that is by having those best-equipped to improve young footballers in place. “I’ve been very successful in schoolboy football, and it’s not that I have a magic wand or anything,” he explains. “The key is to always have the best coaches. I know my limitations and you have to have the right people in to look after teams. ” Bolger at The42 headquarters last week. Source: The42 Underage football in Ireland is going through major changes right now as the FAI brings in the U19, U17 and U15 National Leagues, with U13s on the way. Uncertain about where the establishment of these new set-ups leaves them, a number of schoolboy clubs have raised issue with it and Bolger is wary himself. “I was never up for this National League introduction,” he says. “I thought it was done for financial purposes. For as long as I’m involved in football, the DDSL were always trying to get their hands on some of the money clubs received for players going away. The schoolboy clubs need that for facilities and to keep them running. “I envisage the clubs becoming sort of kindergartens. If you look at the players that have come through DDSL, it has been a great set-up and there are some brilliant people involved.” His own club, St Joseph’s Boys, linked up with Bray Wanderers, while similar partnerships have been agreed between LOI clubs and many of the top schoolboy sides. Despite his reservations, Bolger plans to row in behind the changes and continue to do what he loves best. “It’s not going to change and this is the way they’re looking to move forward,” he adds. “If this doesn’t work, schoolboy football will collapse in the country. It has to work. “There are some clubs doing good work out there, like Shamrock Rovers, who have taken a big step and are making an impact under Shane Robinson. If you look at them, they’re employing ex-LOI players, but just because someone had a good playing career doesn’t mean they’re going to be a great coach. “At the end of the day, we should be all aiming for the same thing — for kids to come through and progress into the international squad.” The42 is on Instagram!

A similar request by Central High School special education teacher Cheryl Franco was also fully funded. She was looking for $2,161.69 to cover the cost of 14 Chromebooks. They are all now on their way. From glue, scissors and sticky notes, to wireless microphones and other equipment for Hillside’s drama troupe, you can see more fulfilled requests here. Franco explained on the site, used by teachers around the country to fund projects their school district cannot afford, that Central’s diverse student population includes “students from over sixty countries and more than eighty different languages. Our students come from various backgrounds and face many challenges in and out of school.” Wrote Franco: “When writing a paragraph on the Chromebook, or answering comprehension questions, students will be able to focus on their ideas and not the quality of their penmanship. With Chromebooks, I will continue to support lessons that meet the needs of all learners and offer my students a better means of engaging in the classroom and achieving their potential in the 21st Century classroom.” The $40,000 donation from the BJ’s Charitable Foundation fulfilled 36 classroom projects in Manchester, benefiting more than 2,118 local students. “Every teacher and student should have the resources they need,” said Kirk Saville, executive director of the BJ’s Charitable Foundation. “At BJ’s, we’re committed to helping families thrive by providing essentials to students and teachers, and we’re thrilled to fund all DonorsChoose.org projects in Manchester.” Safe Station update: Overdoses up, fatalities down Trump: ‘This scourge of drug addiction will stop.

The Rams, facing a do-or-die situation in the second game of their best-of-three Division I title series against Hendricken, jumped out to the lead early and never relinquished the advantage en route to a 7-2 victory that forced a winner-take-all third game at Meehan Auditorium at 7:30 Monday night. Hendricken, the two-time defending champion that had lost to La Salle in all three of the Rams-Hawks regular-season meetings this season, had handed the Rams a 3-1 setback in the first game of the series on Friday night. Now, for the second time in four years, La Salle and Hendricken will need a third game to decide the championship. La Salle won its first state hockey title in 38 years with a victory in the third game of the series in 2015. La Salle, taking advantage of two Hendricken penalties in the first five minutes of play, scored two early power-play goals for a 2-0 lead and stayed at least one goal ahead the rest of the way. The Rams' Brayden Edwards opened the scoring 3:16 of the opening session and Zenas Kennedy made it 2-0 at 5:44. Hendricken did manage to cut its deficit to one goal by the end of the first period as the Hawks' Shawn Catala scored with 25 seconds remaining in the first period. But the Hawks ran into penalty trouble again in the second period. Hendricken was handed two penalties within 54 seconds midway through the session, giving La Salle a two-man power-play advantage for 1:06. It didn't go to waste. John Devine scored the third Rams goal with 14 seconds still remaining on the first penalty when he slid home a loose puck behind Hendricken goaltender Patrick Gribbin. La Salle still had 54 seconds of a man-advantage and it only took the Rams 34 seconds to capitalize. Robert Doorley scored the Rams fourth power-play goal of the night at 7:50 of the second session. “Our power plays have been a highlight stat for us all year,” said La Salle coach James Mello. “We have been converting around 25 percent all season. When you have those kinds of stats it really makes an impact. “It was a big momentum swing when we got that one early,” Mello added about the Rams first goal just over three minutes after the start of the game. “The kids needed it from last night. My kids love working the power play.” The Rams increased their lead to 5-1 when Edwards scored his second goal at 8:45 of the second period. Hendricken did cut a goal off its four-goal deficit on Peter Krekorian’s tally midway through the third period, but Kennedy quickly struck back with his second goal of the night only 1:14 after Krekorian’s tally. Edwards pushed the Rams' final margin of victory to five with his third goal of the night and the Rams' fifth power-play tally late in the third period. Choose the plan that's right for you.

I don\'t know whether Robbie Keane can sing tenor - he can certainly sing ballads, as he sang a few at his birthday bash in House a few years ago - but he scored a ferocious amount of goals during his career, and was clearly a brilliant footballer. So Robbie managing ATK in the Indian Super League was a no-brainer (and as obvious as getting a tenor to be the tenor in a quartet, no?) The former Republic of Ireland striker flew in from India last weekend. On Sunday, he and wife Claudine and her family went Wilde. I mean, rather, that they had dinner in The Westbury\'s Wilde Restaurant. Afterwards, Robbie, Claudine et al made the short distance to 37 on Dawson Street where they went upstairs in the exclusive establishment to join the Irish rugby team in celebrating their historic Grand Slam win at Twickenham the previous evening. Robbie and Claudine Keane being in House is hardly historic as they are regulars. Cork people already think their city - and indeed themselves - to be the centre of the known universe. So they won\'t be surprised that all roads lead to Cork on April 20 for the Mustard Seed Ireland\'s Charity Luncheon at Rachel\'s on Washington Street. The proprietress, Ms Rachel Allen, will, of course, be cooking up a storm for the guests who will include some sporting greats (Tomas O\'Leary and Alan Quinlan (above), both former Ireland rugby internationals; Kevin Kilbane, former Ireland soccer international and Damian Cahalane, Cork senior hurler, among many others) and a comedy great, Barry Murphy of Apres Match fame. He was the true star of the celeb-packed Sunday Independent\'s Living magazine Christmas party at the InterContinental hotel last year. No - not Leo Varadkar. An Taoiseach was there, as was Joe Duffy, Marty Whelan, Liam Cunningham and Camille O\'Sullivan among others. But I\'m talking about Twink\'s four-legged VBF Teddy who was also the star of the launch of Harvey Norman\'s Interiors Spring Summer 2018 collection last Wednesday night in its flagship store in Tallaght. In a night of true style, courtesy of guests in attendance like Roz Lipsett, Sarah McGovern, Irma Mali and January Winters - to say nothing of former Xpose host, Aisling O\'Loughlin - the chic canine was the fashion highlight of the evening, well turned-out up in a grey knitted outfit. Teddy\'s pal Twink was proud as punch that her daughter Naomi is working on Cake Boss, one of America\'s biggest TV shows. (As well as an exclusive first look at Harvey Norman\'s new collection, the guests got some tasty treats and Australian wines.) Equally proud was Natasha Rocca Devine, daughter of footballing deity John Devine and bona fide goddess Michelle Rocca. Interiors goddess Natasha pitched up straight from an interiors project in Grand Canal Dock that she is working on with property guru Owen Reilly. Natasha, who graduated last year from the KLC School of Design and Architecture in London\'s Chelsea Harbour with a masters in interiors, spent Paddy\'s weekend in Kilkenny with her VBF Aisling Burke, who runs the successful ""Teeth Whitening Fairies"" clinic. Gnashers whitening? Did anyone tell Teddy? Her namesake, Helen of Troy, married King Menelaus of Sparta and was reputed to have been the most beautiful woman in the world... One of the fairest women in Ireland, Helen Cody - Helen of Portobello - married her beau, architect Rory Murphy, last Tuesday in a low-key affair. The internationally acclaimed fashion designer told me: ""It was the most magical day spent with our closest friends and family - from the celestial voices of Anuna, to the stunning Appassionata blooms, in what we think is the most beautiful venue, Dublin\'s City Hall. We walked through the streets afterwards to La Maison for an intimate dinner to celebrate a very special day. ""It couldn\'t have been more perfect,"" added newly-wed Helen, whose illustrious client list includes Ali Hewson, Amy Huberman, Sinead Cusack and Stephanie Roche (Helen\'s creation for Ms Roche at the Ballon d\'Or awards ceremony in Zurich in 2015 made headlines all around the world.) ""I wore a Suzie Monaghan cashmere cardigan and my embroidered silk organza skirt,"" said the bride. Helen also designed in New York, styled Mary McAleese for the 1997 presidential election, won The Irish Designer Of The Future award on The Late Late Show in 2000 as well as winning, among many other accolades, The Irish Designer of the Year at the Kerry Fashion Week Irish Fashion Industry Awards in 2015. Rory proudly attended the latter bash in March of that year at the Europa Hotel in Killarney. ""Rory is very handsome. He looks like George Clooney,"" Helen told me in an interview in 2015. ""Rory is my best friend. We have proper, considered conversations about design and the whole process. And everybody who\'s met him loves him."" Ditto Helen of Portobello. I get all Garbo when I receive a dinner invitation or to have food, however delish, at an event. When songwriter Howard Dietz once asked Greta Garbo to dinner the following Monday, Garbo replied; “How do I know I’ll be hungry on Monday?” So it was when I was invited to the 5th birthday party of Black Door Piano Bar at No. 58 Harcourt Street last Friday. I wasn’t hungry. So I didn’t go, despite Black Door being a regular haunt of the likes of The Coronas, Shay Given, Dave and Rob Kearney, Vogue Williams, and even, I’m told, our beloved An T Leo Varadkar. Rugby star Robbie Henshaw, designer Brendan Courtney, model Gail Kaneswaran, fashion maven Sonia Reynolds, uber-stylist Sonja Mohlich, and star of Damo and Ivor: The Movie, Andy Quirke were expected. The latter’s sister-in-law Rosanna Davison was spotted in her favourite Indian restaurant in Dublin last Wednesday. I speak, of course, of Rasam in Glasthule. And of course Rosanna was dining a deux with her husband, Wesley Quirke. Do they ever stay in? If they are not in Nisheeth Tak’s Rasam, they are in Mauritius or further away. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were secretly penning a screenplay. Rosie and Wes: The Movie.

The 72-year-old east Belfast man announced the divorce in a statement on his official website and Twitter account. It said he had been granted the divorce in Dublin last week from the former Miss Ireland. He added: ""At my age, I have found it to be a hugely wearying, protracted experience and I\'m relieved that it has finally reached a conclusion."" The statement thanked Van\'s family and close friends ""for providing respite from the storm over the past eight years"". The statement continued: ""You know who you are and I\'m eternally grateful."" Negotiations about the divorce settlement between the multi-millionaire singer and his wife have been lengthy, and no details have been released. As yet there has been no comment from the former Mrs Morrison who was crowned Miss Ireland in 1980. Van was seen a week ago having lunch in a cafe in Holywood not far from his Co Down home. Van - who is to support crooner Michael Buble at a headline performance in Hyde Park this summer - has released three albums since September 2016. The Morrisons have two young children - daughter Aibhe (12) and son Ivan (10). Van and Michelle were last photographed together in public in June 2016 in Belfast where they and their children attended the funeral of the singer\'s mother Violet in Bloomfield. Van met Michelle, who had previously been married to Arsenal and Republic of Ireland footballer John Devine, at a dinner party in Leixlip Castle in the early 1990s thrown by Desmond Guinness. They quickly became a high profile celebrity couple on the social scene around Dublin, and were married in the mid-90s. The closeness of their relationship at the time was reflected by Michelle\'s photos appearing on the covers of two of Van\'s albums, No Prima Donna in 1994, and Days Like This the following year. But the state of the marriage became the subject of frenzied media speculation after reports that he had fathered a son with American Gigi Lee. Michelle was said to have been shocked by the claims. However, Van denied them and instructed top PR man John Saunders to dismiss the story and to say he didn\'t know Ms Lee. A statement was released on behalf of Van saying the claims about the baby were ""completely and utterly without foundation"". It added: ""For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison with whom I have two wonderful children."" It later emerged that the Texan had worked as a manager on a number of Van\'s tours. A court case brought in Dublin by Saunders against the singer was settled ""on terms that include a letter that the plaintiff John Saunders acted with integrity and on the express instructions of the defendant Van Morrison"". Gigi Lee and baby son George Ivan Morrison died within nine months of each other in 2011. Van\'s first wife Janet \'Planet\' Rigsbee, the mother of his daughter Shana, featured on the cover of his 1971 LP Tupelo Honey. They later divorced. Yesterday it was announced that Van will join Buble on July 13 as part of the British Summer Time festival. Buble\'s headline slot marks his return to performing following a career break while his son battled cancer.

If you love hockey in Rhode Island, this is what it’s all about. Four teams battling for state titles in winner-take-all Game 3s Monday night, March 26, at Meehan Auditorium at Brown University. In the opener, Coventry meets Barrington at 5:30 p.m. in Game 3 of the Division 2 best-of-three series. Following is the nightcap between Bishop Hendricken and LaSalle, which duke it out for the rights to the Division 1 title in the final game of their three-game series. Dominic RobidouxBarrington Coventry makes it a Series in Game 2 OT Barrington had a solid Game 1 opening win, 5-2. Coventry scored the game’s opening goal when Patrick Egan scored short-handed 1:21 into the opening period. Barrington, however, scored the game’s next five goals. Jacob Andreozzi, Drew Sirmalis, Luke Rudman (two) and Dominic Robidoux had those goals that spanned from 5:49 of the first period through 1:25 of the third. Matt Spears had a huge night for the winners with four assists. Robert ThayerCoventry Kolye Bankauskas had Coventry’s final goal, but Barrington goalie Matthew Hosey was solid outside of that. In Game 2, Coventry evened things thanks to Robert Thayer’s goal 24 seconds into overtime on feeds from Kyle Larivee (two) and Bankauskas for a 2-1 win. It capped a great night for Coventry, which got 45 saves from goalie Thomas Julian. The teams traded goals in the middle period, accounting for the only scores in regulation. Robidoux started things on feeds from Spears and Rudman 10:52 into the middle period. Coventry answered 1:01 later when Egan took passes from Kyle Wheeler and Larivee and deposited it on a power play. LaSalle shows up for Game 2, evens things up Bishop Hendricken made a huge statement in Game 1, handing LaSalle its first loss to a Rhode Island team since Dec. 2. The 3-1 win came thanks to goals in the third period from Hendricken’s Jack Dean and Ben DeFelice, which broke a 1-1 deadlock heading into the last 15 minutes. Hendricken’s Dylan Webber had put his team up, 1-0, 7:38 into the opening period. LaSalle’s Brayden Edwards evened things up on a power play on assists from Ryan Schwender and John Devine 2:28 into the middle period. But that was LaSalle’s only goal. Patrick Gribbin earned the win in net for Hendricken. Game 2 was a different story as the team that destroyed its opponents all season showed up and won, 7-2. LaSalle took a 2-1 lead after one period and opened it up to 5-1 after two periods. Hendricken didn’t do much to stop the LaSalle train in this one, the killer moment coming in a middle-period span of 1:39 when the winners had three goals. Edwards led the way with a hat trick, and Zenas Kennedy added two goals. Devine and Robert Doorley had single goals for LaSalle, which got 28 saves from Justin Spencer in the win. Shawn Catala and Peter Krekorian had the goals for Hendricken.

Rocca appeared on the cover of Morrison’s 1995 album “Days Like This”. The album cover for Van Morrison\'s ""Days Like This"", featuring Michelle Rocca. In 2015 the Irish Independent reported that Rocca had been publicly pursuing a legal battle with her neighbors over the sea view from her and Morrison’s home in Dalkey, South Dublin, as a planned development would overlook the family home. She had stated that her fight had as much to do with Morrison’s privacy as her family’s. Morrison released a statement saying he did not live in the house and that the couple had been separated since 2013. Rocca pulled the legal case shortly after. Morrison and Rocca were last photographed together in June 2016 in Belfast, at the funeral of the singer\'s mother Violet, in Bloomfield. Last week Morrison’s statement said that he found the divorce process a ""hugely wearying, protracted experience"". Van ""The Man"" Morrison.

Morgan was the MBL Gabilan Division co-Player of the Year in the fall. Contributed Stevenson's Will Morgan, center, signs his letter of intent to play water polo for UCLA, an NCAA Division I program. Contributed There were water polo offers from other programs with financial rewards for Will Morgan. Yet, only one college was on his radar. So when the Stevenson School sniper got a phone call from UCLA men’s water polo coach Adam Wright, the dream of playing for a nationally ranked program became a reality for Morgan. “It’s something I could not have imagined,” Morgan said. “I was surprised UCLA was interested in me. It still seems so surreal. I questioned if it actually happened after the call.” An invitation to compete for the Bruins this summer in Croatia brought reality into focus, along with Morgan signing his letter of intent on the Stevenson campus. “I think it began to sink in when coach emailed me the summer program,” Morgan said. “This was my dream school. I couldn’t see myself anywhere else.” Last fall Morgan produced 118 goals for the Pirates, who reached the Central Coast Section Division II quarterfinals. He finished as the school’s all-time leader in goals with 301. “I’ve been a scorer at Stevenson,” said Morgan, who had a season-high 11 goals in a game last fall. “I’ll still be a scorer at UCLA. But being a facilitator is a big part of the sport at the Division I level.” While Morgan did not receive an athletic scholarship, he is a recruited walk-on, which gives him a roster spot, and a chance to earn a water polo scholarship in the future. “Water polo scholarships are rare in college,” Morgan said. “There just are not that many out there. But there will be an opportunity to earn one. It’s something I’ll look forward to.” The 6-foot-1, 175-pound Morgan is an explosive swimmer with a powerful right arm. He often fired shots from five to eight meters out on the outside as a sniper. “I’m a driver,” said Morgan, who was the Monterey Bay League Gabilan Division co-Player of the Year last fall and the Pacific Division Player of the Year in 2015 as a sophomore. “My job at Stevenson has been to score goals.” Morgan has been consumed with the sport for the last four years, playing on a club team in Walnut Creek, making the commute twice a week year-round. In fact, videos of Morgan playing on his club water polo team prompted Wright to watch him play in person last summer. “I wanted him to see me at a high level,” Morgan said. “I initiated the process. After he came out, he offered me the chance to commit. All I could think about is all that work paid off.” UCLA won the national championship last year. Two years ago, it was riding a 60-game unbeaten streak. “The program is in a good spot,” Morgan said. “It’s one of the most successful water polo programs in the nation. If you had told me my freshman year that I’d be playing water polo at UCLA in four years, I wouldn’t have believed you.” On his official visit to the Westwood campus, Morgan felt an immediate connection with the current core of players. He felt welcomed and wanted. “I felt like I could fit in,’’ Morgan said. While Morgan is fast in the pool and has a cannon for an arm, it’s the physicality of the sport that has always attracted him to the game. “It can get real rough,” Morgan said. “What you can’t see under water is the most dangerous part of the game. But that’s also one of my favorite parts of the game.” Having already qualified for the Central Coast Section swimming championships in the 50 yard freestyle and 100 free this spring, Morgan is living the water as he continues his water polo regimen in between swim practices. “I’ve put an immense amount of time and effort into this sport,” said Morgan, who won Mission Trail Athletic League swimming titles last year in the 50 and 100 free. “This is going to push me to another level.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

He was the mercurial and secretive music genius, while she was the stunning former Miss Ireland with an intriguing past. Together, they may not have looked like a hand-in-glove pairing, but they created a fabulous combustion. And the couple everyone wanted to know about had a lupine hunger for privacy. They may have withheld the finer points of their romance from public appetite, but the pair were nonetheless regulars on the 90s social scene. Against the backdrop of newly minted glamour, the incongruous pair smiled (or scowled) in front of cameras. The gossip columns found the couple - flitting from Lillie\'s to Renards to Cooke\'s Café in Dublin - to be pure catnip. There were reportedly food fights in La Stampa and drinks with Jagger in the Shelbourne. That Van was long known as a recluse only added to the fun. They posed a united front for the cameras, certainly, but this month marked the official end of Van and Michelle. On a statement posted on his official website last weekend, the Belfast troubadour confirmed that he was granted a divorce from Michelle. And after drawing a veil over the romance for so long, his candour was something of a surprise. ""At my age, I have found it to be a hugely wearying, protracted experience and I\'m relieved that it has finally reached a conclusion,"" he said. Van also thanked his family and close friends ""for providing respite from the storm over the past eight years"", noting: ""You know who you are and I\'m eternally grateful."" Details are scant about the protracted negotiations, and Michelle herself has declined to comment publicly. Either way, Van\'s statement means that the curtain is finally down on one of the most intriguing and explosive marriages ever to hit Irish showbiz circles. Back in 1992, their courtship got off to a heady start. The pair met thanks to the Honourable Desmond Guinness, initially laying eyes on each other at a dinner party at Leixlip Castle. Michelle had enjoyed a level of fame at that point as an RTE presenter and could even lay claim to a moment of notoriety when she hosted the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest with Pet Kenny wearing an adventurous \'Medusa\' updo in front of a global audience of 600 million. Van, of course, was long venerated the world over thanks to his critically acclaimed albums Astral Weeks, Moondance and Irish Heartbeat. By the time they met, Michelle was already a mum of three: she\'d had daughters Danielle and Natasha with her former footballer husband John Devine, and Claudia with former fiancé Cathal Ryan (Van and Michelle would go on to have two children, Aibhe in 2006, and Fionn in 2007, keeping Aibhe\'s birth secret from the press for nearly seven months). In court, when Michelle successfully sued her ex Ryan for assault in 1997 (although they had seemingly reconciled before his death in 2007), she told the jury that Van ""helped put a roof over my head when Cathal cancelled the lease on my house"". Van - who himself had a daughter, Shana, with ex-wife Janet Rigsbee - proved a tower of support during those turbulent times. That Van and Michelle craved privacy only served to fuel public interest. When she lived in Dalkey, Michelle took a court case, eventually settled, against her neighbours alleging their landscape alterations breached her privacy. There have been other bumps in the road: after a tabloid story broke alleging that Michelle had an affair with racing manager Angus Gold in 1996, the two broke off their engagement. In 2010, they officially married. Van posted a brief statement online: ""For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity,"" he said, ""I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison with whom I have two wonderful children."" Some time later, and two years after the birth of the couple\'s son Fionn, another statement was posted to the singer\'s official website that blindsided everyone. Referring to Van\'s American tour manager Gigi Lee, the statement read: ""Gigi and Van Morrison are proud to announce the birth of their first-born son, Little Van, born Dec 28, 2009 - the spitting image of his daddy. He is a dual citizen of Northern Ireland/UK and the United States."" Van\'s publicists claimed that Van\'s website had been hacked and that the birth of George Ivan was pure fabrication. Publicists insisted at the time that Van and Michelle were still very much together, and very happy. It was then claimed by the Morrison team that Van had never heard of Gigi, the women who had, oddly enough, worked on his 2009 Astral Weeks series of concerts and was director of many of his companies. The plot thickened considerably when a photo of Gigi and Van surfaced alongside a rumour that Van had set up home with Gigi and George in Northern Ireland. Both he and Gigi went to the High Court in Belfast to prevent details about where she lived with her son and details about his physical appearance being published. But tragedy was just around the corner. George died in January 2011, aged 13 months, from hyperglycaemia and obesity after slipping into a diabetic coma. Nine months later, Gigi died, aged 44, at the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in October 2011, having been diagnosed with throat cancer before she was pregnant. Van and Michelle legally separated in 2013 - something that only surfaced in the High Court in 2015 via a statement issued by Van, when Michelle had taken her Dalkey neighbours to court. However, the pair were photographed together in June 2016 at the funeral of Van\'s mother Violet, hinting at a civil relationship (or at least, an impasse) of sorts. These days, Michelle reportedly works as a motivational teacher. Van, industrious to the last, released his 38th studio album last December. And the supposed storm that he sought respite from, finally, appears to have calmed. Irish Independent Caitlin McBride Zendaya is a formidable force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.

The Padres earned a place in the top division of the new, five-league Pacific Coastal Athletic League. (David Royal/Herald Correspondent) Carmel's Serena Valdez Clemek moves the ball upfield against Pacific Collegiate during an MTAL game in January. Both teams will play in the new Pacific Coastal Athletic League's Mission Division next season. (David Royal/Herald Correspondent) Realignment creates optimism, nervousness and, hopefully, equity. The arrangement for the 2018-19 winter sports season in the newly formed Pacific Coast Athletic League, which will merge both Monterey Bay Leagues and the Mission Trail Athletic League and add St. Francis and Ceiba College Prep of Watsonville, was announced by league commissioner Tim McCarthy on Thursday. The super league will sport five divisions for boys and girls basketball, four in boys and girls soccer and three in wrestling. No one will face a bigger challenge next winter in boys basketball than MTAL champion Carmel, which was bumped up to the PCAL’s top tier, the Gabilan Division. “I hadn’t see the list,” Carmel coach Kurt Grahl said. “Certainly it will be a big challenge. But if you want to build a program, you want to play against the best. From that standpoint, I’m excited about the opportunity.” The Padres, who reached the Central Coast Section Division IV semifinals last year, will be in a division that will includes defending MBL Gabilan champion Alisal as well as Monterey, Monte Vista Christian, Palma and Salinas. All of those teams reached the postseason last year. “Obviously, league titles are good goals to have,” Grahl said. “But I’d rather play better competition and get an honest look at where we are at instead of finding out in round one of the playoffs.” Last season the Padres were 13-1 in the MTAL and 19-7 overall. Two of those nonleague losses came from Monterey by five points and Salinas by 10 points. “We feel we’ll be able to compete with them,” Grahl said. With good reason. Carmel will return the MTAL’s Player of the Year in 6-foot-6 freshman JT Byrne and high-scoring sophomore guard Kai Lee. The newly formed Mission Division, the second tier, will feature Christopher, Alvarez, Pacific Grove, San Benito, St. Francis and defending MBL Pacific Division champion Seaside. All but the Haybalers went to the postseason last year. “I’ll miss the MTAL because of the rivalries,” Pacific Grove coach Dan Powers said. “Not having Carmel and Stevenson in our league is kind of weird. But I’ll be honest, we wanted to be in the Gabilan Division.” That would have likely occurred had the PCAL gone to a four-division, seven league format, which was discussed but shot down by the merger committee. Making the biggest jump for girls will be MBL Pacific champion Notre Dame, which moves up to a Gabilan Division that will include Gilroy, Monte Vista Christian, North Salinas, San Benito and defending MBL Gabilan champion Seaside. “I’m more than excited about it,” Notre Dame coach Nick Kinion said. “No doubt it’s a stacked league. It’s what we were shooting for. We played to try and get to this level. I don’t feel we’re out of place.” Four sophomores started for the Spirits last year, including MBL Pacific Division Player of the Year Kelly Kinion and all-league guard Angela Leavitt. All six teams in the division went to the postseason last season. The Mission Division will include Alisal, Christopher, Alvarez, North County, Salinas and Watsonville. The Cypress Division will feature Carmel, King City, Pacific Grove, reigning MTAL champion Soledad, Stevenson and St. Francis. Making the biggest jump in boys soccer will be Soledad, which despite not winning the MTAL title last year, was bumped into the Gabilan Division. There it joins Northern California Division II champion Alisal, Alvarez, North County, San Benito and Watsonville. Soledad was unbeaten in the MTAL last year and reached the CCS D-II semifinals. Its two losses all season came from Alisal and Mt. Pleasant in the section playoffs. The Mission Division will showcase defending MBL Pacific co-champions Salinas and North Salinas, as well as Christopher, Gilroy, Monterey, Pajaro Valley, Palma and defending MTAL champion Gonzales. The PCAL Gabilan for girls soccer will feature reigning MBL-G champion San Benito and perennial power Salinas, North County, Gilroy, Alisal and Christopher. The MTAL got split up into three different divisions with defending MTAL champion Pacific Collegiate, Carmel, Greenfield and King City lumped into the Mission Division with Alvarez, North Salinas, Notre Dame and Watsonville. Pacific Grove and Soledad are in the Cypress Division along with Monterey, MVC, Pajaro Valley, Seaside and St. Francis, while Stevenson and Santa Catalina are in the Santa Lucia Division with Anzar, Ceiba, Gonzales, Marina, Oakwood, Trinity and York. The Gabilan will be loaded for wrestling with Alisal, Alvarez, Gilroy, MVC, Palma, Salinas and San Benito all in the mix. John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337.

The rubber match took place on Monday night at Brown University. The results of that game were unavailable at press time. La Salle is the 1 seed with a league record of 14-1 while Hendricken is the 2 seed at 11-4. The Hawks won Game 1 by a score of 3-1 on Friday night. Hendricken junior forward Dylan Webber scored the first goal of the game at 7:38 of the first period after an assist from freshman Drew Haxton. At 2:28 of the second period, La Salle went on a power play and sophomore Brayden Edwards lit the lamp, tying the game at 1. The teams went into the second intermission deadlocked at 1. Hendricken had a man advantage five minutes into the third session and junior forward Jack Dean put the biscuit in the basket for an unassisted tally at 10:44 and gave the Hawks a 2-1 edge. In the final minutes, La Salle pulled its goalie to try to tie the game, but it backfired when Hendricken senior Benjamin DeFelice scored an empty-net goal with 10 seconds remaining in the contest and made it 3-1. Hendricken junior goaltender Patrick Gribbin was a stalwart in net in Game 1 where he made 24 saves, including a pair of sensational stops during the final three minutes of the opening period. The Hawks were blown out in Game 2 by a score of 7-2. La Salle’s Edwards scored a hat trick in that game. Five of La Salle’s seven goals came on the power play. Hendricken got goals from juniors Shawn Catala and Peter Krekorian. Aside from the three scores from Edwards, La Salle got two goals from sophomore star Zenas Kennedy and one each from John Devine and Robert Doorley. Gribbin and Spencer each had 28 saves each in that one.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:39 pm John Kingston, Winchester resident, speaks at his campaign headquarters in Woburn. Kinston, a Republican Senate candidate, hopes to unseat US Senator Elizabeth Warren in November. John Kingston, Winchester resident, speaks at his campaign headquarters in Woburn. Kinston, a Republican Senate candidate, hopes to unseat US Senator Elizabeth Warren in November. Even though Republican United States Senate candidate John Kingston wasn’t born in Massachusetts (he’s a native of Connecticut), he has plenty of ties to the area, even before he moved to Winchester 20 years ago. Kingston said during a recent phone interview that his father grew up in Watertown and his grandfather grew up in Everett. He, in fact, mentioned visiting Boston many times before choosing to attend Harvard Law School in 1991. He must have fallen in love with the area, as he lived in both Somerville and Cambridge before settling down in Winchester. When asked about the town he now calls home, he had nothing but positive things to say. “It’s a lovely town with wonderful people,” he remarked, adding that it’s been a great place to raise his four children. He talked about the “good schools” and the “great experience” his children had, not to mention the “committed and compassionate” teachers, especially at Lincoln Elementary School. “It was a classic neighborhood school,” he said when asked what made it so special. “It’s the kind of school you can walk to.” Those young, Lincoln School students have now grown up, with two of them helping Kingston in his bid to unseat Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. His 19-year old son has been on the campaign trail and his daughter is based at the campaign headquarters in Woburn. Even though he lives in Winchester and works out of an office in Lexington, he said he chose to base his headquarters in Woburn because it offered him more room to grow. “I kind of outgrew the Lexington office,” he admitted, “and the campaign just needed more room.” His new headquarters on Montvale Avenue gives him plenty of growing space as the campaign gets bigger (he already has “big teams of volunteers”) and the primary and general election get closer (the primary is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 4 and the general election is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 6). The new building is also more convenient, as it affords him an easy six-minute commute home, and more commercial, he acknowledged. Price was most likely never an issue, as Kingston said that he’s already raised $3M for his campaign. (His Republican challengers, of which there could be several, have only raised 1/10th of that, he said. Right now, his opposition appears to be State Rep. from Whitman Geoff Diehl, Beth Lindstrom, Darius Mitchell, and Heidi Wellman. He may also face off against several candidates running as Independents, such as Shiva Ayyadurai, Joshua Ford and even Woburn resident John Devine. Devine most recently lost to State Rep. Jim Dwyer.) Kingston said the big money will come later and he’ll probably need all the financial support he can get, especially if he’s successful in the September primary. Senator Warren has reportedly raised approximately $15M for her 2018 reelection bid. Back in 2012, when she first ran for office, she raised upwards of $40M. However, Kingston may not be banking (no pun intended) on money to win this race. When asked why he thinks it’s time for Warren to step aside (or be moved aside), he felt that she was one of the main “dividers” in Washington. He thought voters were tired of the leadership in Washington not helping and not leading. “We deserve better from our leadership,” he stressed. “We don’t need polarizing leaders who will divide us.” The biggest question in Massachusetts is always whether or not a Republican candidate has a legitimate chance. But history has shown that a conservative can win here, most recent examples being Gov. Charlie Baker and former Gov. Mitt Romney, plus former Senator Scott Brown. Kingston pointed out how much tougher it is for a Republican to win during a presidential election because more people (and more Democrats) come out to vote. However, mid-terms are different. “There’s a history of Republican success during non-presidential elections,” Kingston pointed out. The Winchester resident may have something else working in his favor, besides running during a non-presidential year: he is not a life-long politician. If residents are tired of the same-old career politicians, someone who has spent his life exploring other avenues may have a real shot. It worked for Donald Trump. Kingston became motivated after the 2016 election (an election that seems to have either inspired people into action or angered them into no longer caring). He told a story about being out with his wife on Valentine’s Day last year during a romantic dinner and deciding at that time to bring up his desire to run for the US Senate. He knew it would be high risk and high reward. He also knew asking his wife at this particular time could end badly for him. Thankfully, his wife got on board immediately. Even a couple days later when he brought the subject back up, his wife said she still supported his decision. She’s been so supportive that she’s been with him on the campaign trail. This trail has taken him all over the state, from Pittsfield to the Cape. He said that while residents living in western Massachusetts are a little different than those living in the eastern part of the state - “they have somewhat of a different way of life” - everyone has a story to tell. “It looks like a small state on the map, but it feels like a big state when you campaign,” Kingston remarked. “I’ve been able to hear some great stories all around the state.” The Senate hopefully said that he received “tremendous” support from the start. He mentioned having 450 people at his campaign event, which he described as a lot for a first time candidate. He also mentioned traveling to 237 caucuses already. “No one else could do that,” he said. He might be right. As he’s raised 10 times more than any other Republican, he clearly has a leg up on the competition. Perhaps this is why the Republican candidate is already looking to the first Tuesday in November. It’s not that he doesn’t take his primary challengers seriously; rather, he’s simply focused on the bigger prize. While his opponents will garner some support, Kingston ultimately feels as though he’s the only one who can unseat the incumbent. “The primary will want someone electable,” he said about his chances. “I can work across the divide and I think voters will respond to that.” He talked about having a diverse audience for his kickoff event. Fitting, as it will take more than just white conservatives to help elect the Winchester resident. Kingston also noted, when asked about Republican support from the more established members of the party, that it would come later. He mentioned being old friends and speaking with Gov. Baker and Gov. Romney and believed they would be very supportive in the future. While he’ll most likely need all the support he can get, Kingston will also need a strong message to present to voters. And in Massachusetts more than maybe anywhere, that message can’t be “I stand firmly behind the President.” With Sen. Warren 100 percent opposed to almost everything Pres. Trump does, Kingston can’t simply stand on the opposite side of the fence and hope there are enough Trump supporters to push him over the goal line. Therefore, his message is one of unity. “I will unite with anyone to do right and no one to do wrong,” he said, quoting orator and abolitionist Frederick Douglass. “I will work with anyone to help the people of Massachusetts.” In politics, sometimes right and wrong can be relative terms. Sen. Warren has advocated for many things that half of America would claim are right and the other half wrong. It’ll be a fine line for Kingston to walk should he become successful in his Senate bid. The Winchester resident, though, is undeterred. “I’m buoyed by the conviction that I’m doing the right thing,” he said, adding that his faith is very important to him. He also stated that he was aware of the cost of coming forward, of stepping into the public eye. However, he has a “fundamental concern” that Washington is broken. He wants to bring the best to Washington and work on immigration issues, taxes and health care. When asked where he sees himself in the future, Kingston said that “I see myself commuting back and forth to Washington.” He added: “I feel the energy and excitement. I’m more convinced and motivated than ever.” He’s been running a general election campaign since day one, not because he doesn’t see his Republican opponents as legitimate challengers, but because he’s “ready for the big dance and Sen. Warren.” “Don’t put your money, blood, sweat and passion into something unless you feel like you can win,” he offered. If Sen. Warren isn’t paying attention, either because she’s too busy attacking the President or too busy trying to become President, Kingston felt he could steal some votes from frustrated residents. As Martha Coakley showed twice, once in her bid to become Senator and again in her bid to become Governor, just being a Democrat in Massachusetts doesn’t guarantee you anything. You have to earn it. Kingston is hopeful he can earn voters’ trust and support come September and again in November. Your comment has been submitted. Reported There was a problem reporting this.

The injuries also threatened to end Ben Davis’ passion for mixed martial arts. For two years Davis didn’t compete at a national level in MMA, instead turning to coaching football at Seaside High. Yet, the passion and fire remained. As he regained his health and strength, the Marina resident put his hat back in the ring in 2015 in the heavyweight and super heavyweight divisions. Nine fights later, the 41-year-old holds both belts as a world champion. Davis will put one of them on the line Saturday when he fights in Gladiator Challenge Redemption at Thunder Valley Casino Resort outside Sacramento. “He told me two years ago this might be his last fight,” said Seaside head football coach Al Avila, who is Davis’ corner man. “But that was six fights ago.” In part, because Davis is 9-0 since returning to the ring with Avila in his corner, crushing fighters half his age in bouts that have not lasted past the first round. “I’m undefeated since coach Avila got in my corner,” said Davis, who used to train at Kaijin Mixed Martial Arts in Santa Cruz. A coincidence? Well, both hold two black belts in karate. Both share a passion for martial arts. Once upon a time Avila was a street fighter. “If you look at how I’m beating these fighters, nobody has made it past a minute with me since Al’s been with me,” Davis said. “I’m putting them away.” A former world kick boxing champion, Davis has been fighting for 22 years, sporting a 46-9 record at various levels. Yet, he’s been a different fighter since his return to the ring three years ago. “I can’t train like a caveman like the younger guys,” Davis said. “You have to think and make quick adjustments. But I am the aggressor.” Avila calls Davis a brawler. “He’s a straight brawler,” Avila said. “He brings it from the get-go. If he gets rocked, he doesn’t panic. He just readjusts and goes back to work.” Lately, there have been few adjustments for Davis to make. In his last fight in November, he found himself matched up against a 325 pound former Los Angeles Rams lineman. “He was a last-second replacement,” Davis said. “I remember telling coach Avila I’m little worried about this guy. Al looks at me and says ‘you know what they say about big guys? Timber.’” Davis, who weighs 252 pounds, disposed of the fighter in under a minute to retain his super heavyweight title. “The car accident forced me to let my body heal up,” Davis said. “I did not compete for two years. Since I came back, I’ve been wrecking people. I think I’ve found the fountain of youth.” And an inner strength that he credits Avila for. Davis has learned to remain calm on the eve of a fight, not letting the adrenaline kick in until fight time. “A lot of it has to do with coach Avila,” Davis said. “He can put me in a zone. When I was in my twenties, I was pumped up all night. With a touch of my face, he can bring me back down after the fight. He won’t turn me loose until the fire in the belly is gone.” Father time hasn’t caught up to Davis, who continues to show lightening quick reflexes in the ring, as well as a powerful punch that have sent fighters to the ground. “I’m beating guys that I shouldn’t be beating,” Davis said. “When we’re warming up in the waiting area and I’m hitting the bag, these fighters have a deer in the headlights look. I’ve never felt anything like this.” Davis does his conditioning in the morning and bag work and sparring in the evening. In between workouts, he has spent the last five seasons coaching football at Seaside. The offensive play-caller last year, Davis is going to be the head junior varsity and freshman coach this coming fall. “There are correlations to the sports,” Davis said. “You have to be the aggressor in football if you want to succeed. Every play in football is a battle.” The objective in MMA is to lay out an opponent either by knockout of submission. While Davis will check on his opponent after a bout, there is no guilt for punishing him. “He’s getting a good check to fight me,” Davis said. “The way I look at it, he would do the same thing to me if he could.” Prizes for fights can bring as much as $20,000 for Davis, which isn’t bad when you consider his last nine fights haven’t lasted a full minute. “He’s been knocking everyone out,” Avila said. “He’s making my job easier. I know how to keep him focused. We make adjustments real quick. I know his strong points. I can’t do this anymore. But the knowledge is still there.” Davis has suffered his share of injuries over the years, including a broken nose four times, a fractured face and broken hands. Lately, he’s walked out of the ring unscathed. “It’s dangerous getting in there with a 25-year-old kid,” Davis said. “He’s thinking I’m going to knock this old man out. The sport has slowed down so much for me. I can see what he’s doing before he even thinks about doing it. They don’t see it coming.” Since joining forces with Avila, Davis has averaged three to four fights a year. Thoughts of retirement are on hold. “You can’t beat father time,” Avila said. “I’m hoping he’ll know when it’s time. But he’s shown no signs of slowing down. He’s punishing these fighters fast and not getting in harm’s way.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

Being one of the founders of Pete & Jake’s Hot Rod Shop, the landmark ‘1970/80s-era hot rod aftermarket parts and chassis business, Chapouris was among the best when combining professional-level promotion and showmanship with a high-quality parts business. Throughout his 50-year career, Chapouris not only had a knack for developing and manufacturing hot rod parts that people needed but, along the way, he also opened up many new avenues for car enthusiasts to express themselves. His history includes building hot rods for rock stars (with multiple vehicles for ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons), restorations of iconic hot rods (including the Doane Spencer roadster), and vintage race cars, such as Alex Xydias’ So-Cal Speed Shop belly-tank racer from the January 1949 cover of HOT ROD. It was through working with Xydias on the belly-tank restoration the next phase of Chapouris’ life would begin with the re-creation of the SO-CAL Speed Shop (located in Pomona, California), which included partnerships with GM on their Bonneville salt flat racers as well as multiple SO-CAL Shops franchises located across the United States. Cars built under Chapouris have been regularly featured for their design in museums and in retrospectives of the hobby, and one recently won the America’s Most Beautiful Roadster (AMBR) award at the 2012 Grand National Roadster Show, one of the highest honors for design and workmanship there is in the custom car world. Looking at things in a new way was standard operating procedure for Chapouris, so when Sean Devine, a writer in his mid-30s, wanted Pete and the SO-CAL crew to rework his recent purchase, it opened up yet another avenue for Chapouris to become immersed. Sean is the offspring of John Devine, a GM executive as well as a former customer of Pete’s (which included a ’66 Chevelle), and cars were always in Sean’s life one way or another. Looking for something a bit different, Sean wanted to upgrade a first-generation (1966-1977) Bronco in a way no one else had done- a job tailor-made for Chapouris. Under Pete’s guidance, Sean’s 1972 Bronco would become a hybrid of both the off-road and hot rod worlds. Devine bought the truck online and, though worn out and under powered, its bones were pretty good, with straight metal and no rust to speak of. The build would encompass every aspect of the Bronco, from the suspension and drivetrain to body modifications, custom paint, and one-off upholstery. Work began by boxing the frame with 3/16-inch plate and re-welding factory welds on the chassis. A new factory rearend went in, augmented with a limited slip differential, 31-spline axles, and a Hellwig anti-sway bar. Pro-Comp shocks and the rear brakes remain at stock specification, but the fronts are a retrofit using pieces from Tom’s Bronco Parts. The spindles and steering are OEM (the box is a rebuilt ABS unit), though the brake master cylinder is upgraded with a CPP Hydra Stop unit, used in conjunction with Wilwood’s adjustable proportioning valve and an OEM pedal assembly. The gas tank is a 25-gallon unit from Tom’s Bronco Parts, and the hot rod steering column comes via Flaming River. It is topped with a factory steering wheel refurbished and redesigned by Gabe’s Custom Upholstery. The truck rolls on black Robby Gordon XD Series 17×9 wheels, wrapped in Toyo MP295/70R17 rubber. For the powerplant, John Beck, a record-setting Bonneville and dry lakes racer who works at Vintage Hot Rod Design & Fabrication in Chico, California, started with a 5.0 block, and set it up for a displacement of 347 cubes using a 3.400-inch Eagle crank and 4.030-inch KB Performance pistons with Mahle rings. Comp Cams provided the timing set, ARP handled the main and head bolts, and the V-8 was topped with an Edlebrock intake, an MSD Atomic EFI, Spectre’s cold air intake tubing, a K&N air filter, MSD ignition and wires, Ford Motorsport valve covers, and a 100-amp alternator. SO-CAL Speed Shop fab’d the exhaust system, and this Bronco’s exhaust note sounds like no other. The transmission is a C4 outfitted with a Dana transfer case, assembled by Remac Transmission in San Dimas using a B&M Pro-Ratchet shifter, a Tom’s Bronco Parts twin-stick, and a driveshaft from Reel Driveline. One of the tricks Chapouris designed into the body was using a second set of front fender wheel openings that were sectioned into the opposite rear quarters (using the driver’s front on the passenger rear, and the passenger’s front on the driver’s rear). It stretches up the wheel openings just enough without being overtly noticeable, and SO-CAL’s Evin Veazie performed the meticulous metalwork. Other tricks include narrowing the bumpers, so the ends don’t extend beyond the edge of the body, and relocating the mounts so the bumpers now tuck in tight to the body. After the body work was done, the Bronco was rolled next door to Mick’s Paint in Pomona, California, and several coats of PPG Mercedes Iridium Silver was applied. Once finished, a subtle goldenrod pinstripe was added by Murietta’s Dr. Design down the side just above the top reveal line, as well as some classic hot rod lines added to the glovebox door. More hot rod influences can be found in the interior, with the aircraft gauges mounted on top of the dash’s face (rather than behind it), the light bar and Vintage Air AC controls hidden inside the glovebox, and nine more toggle switches mounted in three panels above the driver attached to the SO-CAL fab’d six-point roll cage. Chapouris designed the interior, and the dash pad is covered in the same Ultra brown leather as used by Gabe’s Custom Upholstery on the outboard portion of the custom bucket seats. The inboard seat material is vintage Vietnam-era US Army canvas, with its minor color flaws intentional in their placement. Gabe’s also created the soft top for the Ford, though there is also a removable hardtop that Sean can use at his discretion. Diamond Rubber Products made the Bronco’s floor covering and a ‘197 Chevy’s rear mirror was utilized, too. SO-CAL’s Justin Veazie wired up the ride, which included the Marshall amp converted into the bluetooth-based stereo’s speaker box that’s mounted under the dash. Before its final delivery, the Ford was turned over to Jon Ciauri, who added an external oil cooler to the transmission to help it run cool. He aldo did the final “tuning” on the truck’s wiring to get everything running as good as possible. Once finished, Sean says “It was worth the wait.” Hoping to get it up on some Park City off-road trails near his home in Utah, Sean is aware of the truck’s historic pedigree because of Chapouris’ involvement, and the Bronco is something he’d like to give to his son one day as a fitting family heirloom. The Bronco also proved to be the last project Chapouris would complete, as he passed away just three weeks after these photos were taken. But Pete’s legacy burns as bright as was his talent, and it’s vehicles like Sean’s that will be a perfect way to remember him for many years to come.

(WKRG) - Some scary moments outside a Pensacola church after a mother and her two small children were hit by a car walking to Easter Sunday services. Outside St. John Devine Baptist Church, church members are still unnerved by what happened right outside the sanctuary’s front door. ""Oh my goodness, it’s unreal just unreal,"" said church member Doris Browning holding back tears. Other church members said word spread fast after the crash happened. ""Nobody and their kids should get hit by a car and on Easter Sunday morning and it’s a big thing and a hurting thing to know that this has happened to someone,"" said church member Carolyn Jenkins. A Pensacola Police spokesman says it happened as a mother and her seven-month-old and five-year-old children were crossing near the intersection of 6th Avenue and Jordan Street. The three were then taken to Sacred Heart Hospital. ""Looking at the car that struck them it had a shattered windshield so it could have been a lot worse,"" said Pensacola Police Spokesman Mike Wood. Some people who go to this church say there needs to be more done on the street nearby to make it safer and easier to cross and get to the church. ""In my opinion, the city is responsible for getting the parishioners from one side of the street to the sanctuary,"" said church member Plumie Tart. At last check Sunday afternoon, the mother her two children were listed in stable condition at Sacred Heart according to a police spokesman. No word on any charges in this case so far. Mother and two children hit by car as they walked to church in Pensacola.

Mann Lake today is in peril. It is all that is left of the once great Alvord Lake. The history of Mann Lake dates from about 1871 when Philip Mann founded Mann Lake Ranch and in 1875 formed a partnership with Captain Andrew Smith as Smith & Mann and the Bar G Iron. Around 1880, John Devine and W.B. Todhunter (Devine & Todhunter) had purchased the holdings of Abbott & Whiteside, which by then included Mann Lake, lying in the foothills on the east side of Steens Mountain. Devine’s Alvord Ranch lay east in the Steens Mountain foothills and west of Alvord Desert. In 1885, Devine & Todhunter were running four ranches: Island, Juniper, Mann Lake and White Horse. Apparently Smith & Mann became indebted to John Catlow, a gold miner who struck it rich and invested in cattle (he knew miners had to eat). There is evidence Catlow purchased the Smith & Mann Bar G Iron as Catlow’s ranch manager, David Shirk, is reported to have driven Smith & Mann cattle to Catlow’s ranch on Trout Creek before Catlow sold out. In the last year’s of the cattle baron’s success, Henry Miller’s Pacific Livestock Company owned them all; however, Roaring Springs Ranch (once headquarters for Peter French in the 1890s) today is a producing livestock industry and lies west of Mann Lake. According to Mike Hanley of Jordan Valley, who brings his restored stagecoach to the annual Round-Up Westward Ho! Parade, and other historians, Mann Lake is all that is left of the once great Alvord Lake. Dr. Dorys C. Grover Pendleton Stay on topic - This helps keep the thread focused on the discussion at hand.

Joel Rosenbaum — The Reporter Fairfield Police Sgt. Josh Kresha (right) is debriefed by Sgt. John Devine after he demonstrated the department’s use of force simulator for members of the media following a press conference with police chiefs from around northern California who were expressing their concerns over new legislation about use of force. Joel Rosenbaum — The Reporter Police chiefs from Vacaville to Citrus Heights to San Rafael to Watsonville and points in between gathered Monday at the Art Koch Training Facility in Fairfield to denounce pending legislation regarding an officer’s decision to use force. A bill authored by assembly members Shirley Weber, D-San Diego, and Kevin McCarty, D-Sacramento, would reportedly raise the standard for legal review of such actions — after the fact. “This legislation as proposed puts communities at risk,” advised David Swing, Morgan Hill police chief and president of the California Police Chiefs Association, which hosted the press gathering in partnership with the California Peace Officers Association. “Evaluating the use of deadly force from the perspective of hindsight and narrowing the justifiable homicide defense will lead to officers pulling back on proactive policing, resulting in increased crime throughout the state.” Officers must often make split second decisions, he added. “Requiring officers to wait for backup and causing officers to second guess themselves on life and death decisions will lead to an increase in the number and severity of victims injured,” he continued. Officers often are engaged in dangerous, challenging and chaotic situations, emphasized Ronald Lawrence, Citrus Heights police chief. He reminded the audience of the Columbine massacre where 15 people were killed 20 years ago, calling it the incident that changed police policy where officers were mandated “to no longer wait for backup, to immediately run out to neutralize the threat, to save lives.” In any given situation, officers don’t know who’s armed, with what, or what the outcome will be. “While tragic the use of force, the use of deadly force, is at times a necessary reality of police,” Lawrence said. “No law or politician can change that reality.” San Rafael police Chief Diana Bishop shared a page from her own experience. She spoke of a call where a suspect had fled a traffic stop, broke into a home and held occupants hostage then appeared before an officer, which was her, in a creek bed. She ordered him to show his hands and he pulled a gun on her. “Can the officer use deadly force in that situation against this man?” she asked. “Does the officer have to wait for another officer to get there? Does the officer have to verbally persuade the man to drop his gun? “Does the officer have to wait for another officer who has a less lethal weapon? What does this officer do?” Fearing for her life, she fired. And missed. The suspect ran to where children were playing, grabbed a 6-year-old boy and ultimately held a gun to his head. Officers tried reasoning with the suspect, to no avail. “Would the next step here be a less lethal weapon?” she asked. “Would the 6-year-old have to wait until the police exhausted their checklist?” He didn’t. Another officer took the shot and killed the suspect, saving the little boy. Officers willingly put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve people they don’t even know, Bishop said. They react, they play defense, they follow strict guidelines. But, no one’s perfect. “We are human beings. We are your sisters and brothers, your friends and your neighbors. We do the best we can, sometimes in very trying situations but always with good hearts.” Swing said police are more than willing to engage in the conversation, to start a dialogue. But, they need a seat at the table. Police are often asked for more transparency and inclusiveness, he emphasized, but neither was shown regarding this proposed legislation. Officers, said Watsonville police Chief David Honda, must definitely be held to a higher standard. But measuring that after the fact is not the answer. Madera County Sheriff Jay Varney, first vice president with the California Peace Officers Association, agreed. The “reasonable force” doctrine has been on the books and held up to legal challenges for more than 30 years, he said. “We all took an oath to protect and serve our communities. So to assume an officer does not consider all other reasonable options prior to engaging in deadly force is simply not reasonable and it’s inaccurate,” he pointed out.

Holding signs with slogans such as ""I Am Housing Insecure"" and ""30,000 Priced Out and Counting,"" the residents filled the council\'s chamber Monday night. Richard Simmons, a Vietnam veteran, told council members he ""wanted to put a face"" on the data that show rents are rising. ""When I moved into my apartment, I was paying $550 a month, or 40 percent of my income,"" he said. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you\'ll never miss a local story. Simmons said his apartment complex in Matthews has been sold, with new owners making small cosmetic changes. ""They painted the countertops and put in new appliances, and my rent is now 70 percent of my income,"" Simmons said. ""There is little left for food, utilities or a car. It\'s unfair to ask me, at 72 years of age, to leave my apartment."" That\'s the predicament Richard Simmons, 71, finds himself in. He wonders how much longer he can afford his apartment on a fixed income when his rates have gone up about 40% in five years. Council members and Mayor Vi Lyles have said building more affordable housing is a priority, and it\'s been one of their most discussed issues. After the Keith Lamont Scott protests and riots, city leaders said they would build or preserve 5,000 affordable housing units in three years instead of five years. The city said it\'s on track to meet that goal. But the city\'s Housing Trust Fund is almost depleted. And there is a debate among council members about whether the city should focus on building housing for the poorest residents or whether to build so-called ""workforce housing"" for people earning up to 80 percent of the area median income. That would be about $56,000 a year. John Devine, a home remodeler, said the city needs to do more. He urged council members to seek $50 million for the Housing Trust Fund, rather than the $15 million the city usually asks voters to approve every two years. ""These injustices contribute to social unrest,"" he said. ""The chamber and city government act as though stadiums and fancy restaurants make us world-class."" He also criticized the city for not putting more pressure on developers to include affordable housing in their developments. He cited a project under construction near Pearl Park in midtown that received $4.4 million in city and county money in exchange for building roads and other infrastructure. Sharon Edwards, who lived in the Twin Oaks apartment complex near NoDa, said she was speaking to offer support for people who are facing eviction or those who can no longer afford rising rents. ""I am here to give my help to people who need it,"" she said. ""So many people are getting kicked out of their places."" Another woman, Martina Lowery, said she had to sleep in her car and in a church after being pushed out of her apartment. ""I lost my home, I stayed in my car,"" Lowery said.

Sign up for email newsletters', 'By Richard Parks Celtic fans have taken to Twitter to demand the club end the contract stalemate with Tom Rogic and get him tied to a new deal before it is too late. Rogic, 25, has a deal with the Scottish champions that runs until the summer of 2019 and his future is shrouded in significant doubt amid reports he has rejected an extension and is ready to quit in the coming months. The Daily Record claimed last month that the Australian attacking midfielder, 25, remains in discussions with Hoops chiefs about a new agreement and that an offer has been tabled, but the player has refused to commit and the club are in the dark as to what his intentions are. Rogic has struggled with injuries this season but demonstrated his calibre with goals in each of the last two matches against Rangers to lift his haul for 2017-18 to seven goals and eight assists from 35 appearances in all competitions. Since joining the club in 2014, the player, who, Australian outlet The World Game recently reported is valued at £3.4million, has scored 29 goals and supplied 22 assists from 126 Celtic appearances. Fans on social media are virtually unanimous in calling for Rogic to get a new deal even though he is not always a first choice for Brendan Rodgers’ side. Many called on the Hoops to hand the attacker a lifetime contract, with one urging chief executive Peter Lawwell to pull out all the stops to get the deal done. Here is a selection of their messages on Twitter: Gee Tam Rogic a contract for life #hunskelper — Eck Muirhead (@EckMuirhead) April 16, 2018 Offer Tom Rogic a lifetime contract — Cami (@CamiKool92) April 16, 2018 Rogic needs to sign a new contract pronto… should be offering what ever it takes to get that big man to stay with us ???????? — Peàrse Johnston™ (@PearseJohnston) April 16, 2018 It’s a must that @CelticFC get a new contract for @Tom_Rogic sorted.

(Orville Myers - Monterey County Herald file) Carmel’s Hansi Rigney, shown running along a recreational trail in Seaside in 2010, won her age group at the Boston Marathon on Monday. (Orville Myers - Monterey County Herald file) The euphoria that Hansi Rigney felt crossing the finish line in her 105th marathon was accompanied by numbness and pure misery. As gratifying as winning her age division for the second straight year at Monday’s 122nd Boston Marathon was, the conditions were as challenging as any race the 76-year-old has run. “The pictures don’t paint a true story,” Rigney said. “There wasn’t a minute where it didn’t rain. The wind was blowing, with gusting head winds. It was 35 degrees and puddles of water two to three inches deep.” Rigney knows the elements for Boston in April can be fickle. She’s run the world renown marathon in 85-degree heat and with snow on the ground from the night before. “It’s been cold before,” Rigney said. “But not like this. It was a record. I can take the heat much better. The wind and rain hitting against us felt like little pellets. It was miserable.” And while all marathons are a physical test of courage, this 26-mile, 385-yard adventure challenged the Carmel resident’s mental capacity. “My body didn’t feel right,” Rigney said. “I couldn’t feel my feet. My legs went numb. I couldn’t feel my tongue. The conditions never got better. I really didn’t think I was going to finish.” In fact, Rigney was forced to walk portions of the final six miles when her body cramped up and she felt dizzy. “I’ve never walked before,” Rigney said. “I felt like I was going to collapse. My legs weren’t lifting. I was not in control of my body. It became mind over matter.” Despite all the setbacks and the poor conditions, Rigney still broke five hours, finishing in 4:55:17, her slowest of the 14 she has run at Boston. “Given the conditions, it was a good finish,” said Rigney, a former world class speed walker. “I was on target to run 4:33:00, but the last six miles was a struggle. The last six are always the hardest.” Rigney, who expects to compete next Sunday in the Big Sur Marathon, had pills to help with the cramping. But her salt tablets melted in the rain. “I had to change my pace and figure out how in the world am I going to finish this,” Rigney said. “I don’t want to exaggerate how hard this was, but there were times I couldn’t see straight.” Fear of fainting forced Rigney to walk for stretches over the last few miles. When she regained her vision, she reset her goals and pushed along. “I remember thinking my kids are tracking my progress,” Rigney said. “I don’t want to collapse and be taken off on a stretcher to the medical tent. I didn’t want to embarrass them.” The feeling of crossing the finish line never felt more rewarding for Rigney, who needed to lean on her husband after the race because of her balance. “I still felt dizzy,” Rigney said. “My tongue was still numb. I couldn’t even eat a banana. But there is that feeling of euphoria when you finish a marathon.” Quick to recover, Rigney and her husband went to the hotel for the award ceremony, not knowing if she evened placed, let alone defended her title. “I remember them calling the runner-up’s name,” Rigney said. “Then I didn’t recognize the next name the way it was pronounced. It wasn’t until he said Carmel, California, that I said ‘Oh my gosh, that’s me’. It was a nice surprise.” Normally crowds two and three deep flank the 26.2-mile course, turning the event into a city holiday of sorts. While those who braved the elements provided encouragement to the runners, distractions were not a good thing for Rigney on race day. “I was so focused on myself and my body,” Rigney said. “It’s always fun to have people call out your bib number. But our numbers were gone from the rain. My only focus was on the need to finish.” The conditions were so bad that the Boston Red Sox canceled their annual Patriots Day game, the first time that has occurred in the history of the event. “You can’t always believe the forecast,” Rigney said. “And things can change quickly, for better or worse. It got worse. The rain came down even harder as the day went on.” A five-time champion in her age division for Boston, Rigney has already turned the page and has her focus set on Big Sur next week. “Boston is a tradition,” Rigney said. “It’s the most prestigious marathon. It’s the oldest in the United States. Big Sur is in my back yard. The conditions are bound to be better than Boston.” If Rigney had her way, she’d prefer the races be six days apart, as they have been in the past, instead of 13. “I actually feel six days between the two is easier than 13,” Rigney said. “You just take a couple of short runs and go. When you have 13 days, you do more. I’ll get some pool work.” Of course, not getting back to her Carmel home until Wednesday because of flight delays means Rigney hasn’t had much sleep since Sunday. “I didn’t sleep well Monday night because I was sore,” Rigney said. “And last night we were stuck at the Los Angeles airport when there were no flights to Monterey. So I tried to sleep on the floor at the airport. But it was hard.” Rigney, who didn’t run her first marathon until her mid-50s, has her sights set on running five this year. She will also run Berlin, Chicago and Sacramento, where set the course record by 10 minutes last year in her age division. If there are aspirations to become the oldest runner to complete Boston, Rigney has some more miles to put in over the next decade after 85-year-old Katherine Beiers of Santa Cruz completed the event. “She’s amazing,” Rigney said.

(Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Monterey Peninsula College’s Alissa Foster makes a catch in the outfield against Hartnell College in Monterey on Thursday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) Monterey Peninsula College’s Catalina MacDonald makes contact for a base hit against Hartnell in Monterey on Thursday. (Vern Fisher - Monterey Herald) The hope was this would be a potential title-clinching celebration of a conference softball championship for Monterey Peninsula College. Yet, those plans were altered on the van ride home Tuesday when the Lobos learned that they had sealed up their second consecutive Coast Conference South title by virtue of the second-place team losing. “Celebrations are not our style anyway,” said MPC softball coach Keith Berg, after Thursday’s 3-0 win over Hartnell. “We want to be the team that acts like we’ve done this before.” In this case, that’s true. Still beating your rivals for a conference championship would have been extra sweet, as was the case last year when MPC defeated Hartnell. Except the Panthers ruined that by defeating San Jose City on Tuesday — the one opponent that had defeated the Lobos in conference play this year. This time — the final meeting of the year for both teams — was about pride. Also for the Panthers, it was about giving outgoing Hartnell coach Andy Watt a win in his final game against MPC after 28 years. But MPC’s Sally Bowles had other ideas as the sophomore hurler tossed a two-hit shutout in posting her 14th win of the season. “We’re not a fluke,” said Berg, whose stints as a softball coach have included Illinois State, Saint Mary’s and North Salinas High, where he coached future Olympian silver medalist Monica Abbott. “This is back-to-back championships.” And the potential for a second straight 30-plus win season for the state-ranked Lobos (27-6). Along the way has come a school-record 15-game win streak, which ended eight days ago at San Jose City. “I guess you could say it was a wake-up call,” said Bowles, last year’s conference Pitcher of the Year. “I don’t think we got complacent. But we had to remember what got us to this point and that is we’re a team that fights.” Bowles, who came into the game with a 1.46 earned-run average, has split time in the circle this year with Shayla Castaneda, a move she welcomed coming into the spring. “It’s been nice,” Bowles said. “I think I got a little burnt out towards the end of last year. And it’s made us better. Shayla and I are different pitchers. It makes both of us more effective. And I get to play a position when I’m not pitching.” Bowles has made the most of her extended plate appearances this season, hitting .330 with three homers and 30 RBIs. “We overused Sally last year as a pitcher,” Berg said. Bowles has been more effective with a livelier arm this spring. It was evident by limiting the Panthers to three base runners in a game that last 95 minutes, as she engaged in a pitchers dual with former Carmel High hurler Danielle Caoili. “All my pitches were working today,” Bowles said. “I had good movement. My placement was good. I felt my off-speed pitches were keeping them off-balanced.” While Bowles wouldn’t say the Lobos are playing with a chip on their shoulder, there is a sense of redemption on the players’ mind — several of which were a part of last year’s 30-win team that fell in the first round of the state tournament. “No doubt, we expected more last year,” Bowles said. “We do think about it a little. But this is a different team. The freshmen that have come have really stepped up. This team has a lot of fight in it.” The Lobos, who have been ranked as high as No. 4 in Northern California, should receive a home series in the opening round of the playoffs, particularly if they run the table and win their final three games, including a doubleheader Saturday against Diablo Valley. Hartnell, meanwhile, will likely be home for the postseason after falling to 14-17 overall. Watt, who won four conference titles during his tenure, is setfor retirement. “It’s just time for someone else to do this,” said Watt, before the game. “When I took this job, I was a football coach. I never thought I’d be a softball coach for 28 years.” Both Bowles and Caoili were working on shutouts until the fifth inning when the Lobos erupted for three runs on what probably should have been the final out of the inning. Overly aggressive base running by the Lobos found two of them near second base after Catalina Macdonald had singled. Yet, when Macdonald was able to get out of a rundown, two runners game sprinting home for the games’ first two runs. Seaside High product Malia Usrey followed with a sharp single to score Macdonald, which was more than enough run support for Bowles. “We tend to rely to heavily on our pitchers,” Berg said. “We’re not hitting as well as we did earlier. The swings have gone long. And we’ve faced some good pitching.” Bowles was helped out by her defense as Castaneda made a lunging catch in foul territory at first base, while right fielder Lauren Salvati made a pair of running catches with the sun directly in her face.

That ends Tuesday when the Hartnell College softball coach will manage his last game in the maroon and gold. “Someone else needs to do this,” Watt said. “It’s time. So much has changed in 28 years.” Such as the facilities at Hartnell, which are now some of the best in the state with its synthetic-turf surface. Gone are the days of manicuring an infield, mowing the outfield lawn and laying down chalk for the batter’s box and down the base lines. Watt recalled when he took the program in 1991 how the Panthers softball field was nothing more than a dirt infield covered in weeds. No outfield fence, no scoreboard, no dugouts. “The dugouts were brought in by a forklift and taken away at the end of the season,” Watt said. “They were covered in graffiti. Homeless people used them. We didn’t have a scoreboard or a fence. When we finally got a scoreboard, we had magnet numbers for each inning.” A portable fence eventually made its way to the Panthers’ palace, where Watt would have to take portions of it down when Hartnell hosted its annual Throwers Meet in track and field. “These guys were coming from all over the world to chase a world record in the discus,” Watt said. “The fence was about five-feet in front of the record. I didn’t want to be the reason a record wasn’t achieved.” Watt, 60, made use with what he had and ran with it. He never recruited players outside the area, always focusing on local talent as a foundation for the program. “I always felt recruiting outside the area was cheating,” Watt said. “I guess I’m just old school. I always stuck to our boundaries. You could go to your local high school and recruit kids. I remember packing 15 players in a van. It was a great era.” Watt, who began his career at Hartnell as a defensive backs coach in football, never anticipated spending nearly three decades coaching softball. “I never thought I even be a softball coach,” said Watt, whose sidekick as an assistant in Gino Sigala, is also stepping away. “I was a football coach. I was asked to coach softball. It’s been a long ride, a fun ride with Gino.” A ride that has seen the Panthers win five conference titles and finish second eight times during his tenure, including last season. His 1993 team won over 30 games and was inducted in the Hartnell Sports Hall of Fame. “We got hired at the same time,” Hartnell athletic director Danny Teresa said. “We coached football together. Back then, you did two sports. So Andy took on softball. I did baseball.” While Watt hasn’t kept track of his coaching record, he has averaged more than 15 wins a season, which puts him well over 400 wins for his coaching career. “The program has been consistent in his 28 years,” Teresa said. “There haven’t been many down years. He will be sorely missed at Hartnell because of the type of person he is. He has unbelievable patience. He is the most generous, kind and caring person I’ve ever met.” Hartnell, who is 16-17 this season, has one game left in the season. It’s chances of reaching the state tournament are slim. Yet, when the season began, Watt was worried about even fielding a team with just seven players, before the number grew to 11. Hartnell was forced to forfeit a game when a player got hurt during a game, leaving them with just eight. “This has been a difficult year,” Watt said. Yet, the Panthers have had a strong second half, having gone 8-4 in their last 12 games, while sitting in third place in the Coast Conference South Division. “If I have a legacy, it’s that I’m proud of the kids we helped develop,” Watt said. “We took kids that weren’t always successful in high school and turned them into players. I always enjoyed being the underdog.” Contact John Devine at 831-726-4337.

Now that the novelty has worn off, that rate is more like 0.05 percent. Add augmented reality (AR), however, and it may be a different story. Taking a page from the leader of the free world, companies like Blippar and Oath want to use AR to make digital ads great again. But, like Trump’s presidency, can it last? Chris Bell, regional commercial director of APAC at AR company Blippar, said in a recent blog post that the opportunity with these ads is to marry the high reach of display media with the interactivity, personalization and realism of AR. Blippar rolled out its AR ad unit in May 2017, which it said uses a smartphone or desktop camera to deliver interactive, contextually relevant AR experiences from banner ads. Since then, Bell said brands have seen a 30 percent greater engagement rate, and dwell time has increased by more than 11 times. While the specific engagement rates for these efforts are unclear, Blippar has worked with Jaguar Land Rover and Honda to give users an inside look into a new car and to deliver a “fanciful” holiday experience, respectively. Blippar is not alone in trying to spruce up digital ads through AR. Oath, formerly known as AOL and Yahoo, is offering its own AR ad format in the U.S., aiming to spice up email banner ads on the Yahoo Mail app. Oath tested the unit with Pottery Barn and The Home Depot, which allowed consumers to see what furniture and holiday decorations would look like in their homes. As a result, consumers spent an approximate average of two minutes interacting with the ads, and the Home Depot campaign had a 12.5 percent CTR. (Pottery Barn would not share its CTR.) John DeVine, chief revenue officer of Oath, said his goal is to create ads consumers want to see, much like ads in magazines like Vogue. Home Depot tested AR ads during the holiday season to show consumers what a Christmas tree and its decorations would look like, hoping to excite customers about its selection. “Holiday decorations are a personal reflection of your own style, so we wanted a way to showcase the decorating options available and to make sure customers were comfortable and confident,” said Erin Everhart, senior manager of media strategy and mobile at Home Depot. Everhart said Home Depot has been using AR since 2013 in applications that allow customers to pick patio sets and paint colors. The Home Depot app also allows customers to visualize products like vanities, faucets, lighting and décor. But this was the first time it ran AR ads in an actual ad unit. “We know that a person’s home is going to be their biggest investment, and the products they choose [are] a direct reflection of who they are,” Everhart said. “We can empower them by using technology to build that confidence to make sure the product they’re buying is the right one before they make that commitment.” When consumers tapped on the Pottery Barn ad, they were able to see how furniture could fit in their homes. This, in turn, made the process of choosing these bulky items a little easier, said Felix Carbullido, CMO of Pottery Barn parent Williams-Sonoma. “What’s really cool was because of the camera on your phone and the AR kit we leveraged, everything is actually to scale,” he said. He explained that if viewers tapped on an ad for a leather chair, the chair would be dropped in the room using AR, and “you could get a realistic idea” about how it would look and fit, which are “the two things that we’re excited about with AR.” Continue Reading Pages: 1 2']",0.0,1.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,1016936.0

For Brett Hearn, the task was simply to pick up from where he left off in 2017. By virtue of winning his heat race, Andy Bachetti started from the pole while Hearn was fourth. In a matter of a couple of laps, Hearn was already up to second and pressing for the lead. Further back, Kenny Tremont Jr. was moving forward from the ninth starting spot, but the going was tough. Cautions for Kolby Schroder stalling on the backstretch and Chad Jeseo nosing into the inside wall on the frontstretch closed the pack up. A multi-car incident in turn 3 involving Mike King, Kyle Sheldon and Wayne Jelley gave Hearn one more chance to plan his attack. On the restart, Hearn made his move. It did not take long for the 12-time track champion to snatch the advantage away. Tremont followed Hearn past Bachetti into second. From there, Tremont did everything he could to keep pace with Hearn. A late caution for a crash in turn 2 for Jeseo closed the pack up for a six-lap shootout. However, Hearn got an excellent start and pulled away to take the win. For Hearn, the familiar is a big benefit. “[We raced] the same car we’ve used for the last couple of years,” Hearn said after the race. “We know what we’re dealing with and how we want it to feel. We were real fast in hot laps, so it was appropriate that we won tonight.” Hearn has indicated that the car he raced Saturday night will be exclusively used at Lebanon Valley this season. Additional Teo chassis will be used for Hearn’s racing at Albany-Saratoga Speedway and in Super DIRTcar Series races. Tremont was second and stated afterward that he just needed that little bit more to win. Bachetti was third, followed by Eddie Marshall and J.R. Heffner. In the Sportsman feature, the primary move for the lead was made on the very first lap. Todd Buckwold started on pole and charged into the first turn. Unfortunately, Buckwold lost control and spun to bring out a caution. Chris Curtis was able to sweep past into the lead. In the chain reaction that followed, Chris Lynch was hit and broke a shock that ultimately forced him to retire. Curtis was just about the class of the field all night. Behind him, Whitey Slavin moved his PMC chassis up to second after fighting with Kevin Ward. The scariest incident of the night occurred on a lap 15 restart. Michael Sabia had a part in the front end of his No. 7 fail early on, forcing him to manhandle his car. Despite that, he was able to keep himself in fourth. On a lap 15 restart, it completely broke. The failure pitched him directly into the wall, then into a series of pirouettes in front of most of the field. Buckwold, Alan Houghtaling, Nikki Ouellette and Paolo Pascarella were all involved in the crash. Everyone was OK, but Houghtaling and Sabia were out. Curtis was able to hold on over the final five laps to take a convincing victory over Slavin and Ward. Peter Carlotto finished fourth, followed by Adam Gage. In Pro Stock, Ed Bishop’s switch to No. 11 from No. 144 paid some dividends. A heat race victory gave him the pole, but Rob Yetman was alongside. Yetman wasted no time in snagging the lead, claiming it on the very first lap. The event was clean until Jason Casey broke his rear end on lap 12 to bring out a yellow. Shortly after the restart, a multi-car crash in turn 3 involved Scott Kilmer, Tom O’Connor, Tom Dean and Pro Stock debutant Dave Stickles. O’Connor dropped out as a result, but the others continued. Over the final few laps, a swell duel for second broke out between Canaan, Conn.’s Jay Casey, Bishop and Jason Meltz. On the final lap, Meltz made a move to the inside in turns 3 and 4 that allowed him to go from fourth to second. Meanwhile, Yetman could not be denied as he extended his record with his 52nd career Lebanon Valley Pro Stock win. It is also the 100th Pro Stock victory of his career. Meltz was able to snag second, followed by Jay Casey and Bishop. Nick Hilt rounded out the top five. In Pure Stock, John Devine, Chad Arsenault and Gary O’Brien each claimed opening night victories.

He is charged in a two-count indictment involving the smuggling from Cuba of Seattle Mariners outfielder Leonys Martin, who previously played for the Texas Rangers. The bail agreement with prosecutors also permits Hernandez to travel for agent work. Hernandez works for Praver Shapiro Sports Management, which in November announced a joint venture with Magnus Media run by entertainer Marc Antony.

John,Devine,['http://www.montereyherald.com/sports/20180424/college-football-mpcs-hunter-raquet-commits-to-fresno-state'],b'6928',"['Hunter Raquet makes a break for it while playing quarterback for Monterey Peninsula College. The former San Benito High quarterback has commited to play for Fresno State in 2019. MPC/contributed Hunter Raquet looks to pass for Monterey Peninsula College. The former San Benito High quarterback has commited to play for Fresno State in 2019. MPC/contributed Hunter Raquet understood there wouldn’t be a high demand for a wishbone quarterback coming out of high school. Yet, he also believed he had the tools to be a college quarterback. So did Monterey Peninsula College football coach Mike Rasmussen. “The things I saw on video were his athleticism,” Rasmussen said. “You could see arm strength and fundamentals. He just needed a different system that would help him grow in a passing game.” Yet, not even Raquet imagined his rapid development would earn him a football scholarship in 2019 to Fresno State. “I had to pinch myself to make sure this is real,” Raquet said. “When your first choice of colleges calls you to talk, it’s unbelievable. I’m so humbled by the whole situation.” In his first season at MPC, Raquet evolved into one of the top community college quarterbacks in the state, throwing for nearly 2,500 yards and 23 touchdowns in nine starts. Just a year earlier, he was a running quarterback at San Benito High, whose main responsibility was to hand the ball off. “I knew the process was going to be a lot harder for me than for others,’’ Raquet said. “We weren’t a passing offense at San Benito. And I was fine with it. I just wanted to win. There was no spotlight.” That changed for the 6-foot-4 signal caller upon arriving last fall at MPC, where he showcased his arm. He took the starting job in the third week of the season, going 7-1 as a starter in the regular season. “Hunter had all the tools,” Rasmussen said. “But he had to earn the position, which he did. He grew throughout the course of the season. He still has to get better. It’s still a process.” Rasmussen, who groomed current Dolphins quarterback David Fales at MPC, will get Raquet for one more season, as the quarterback won’t officially sign until November. “It’s an interesting dynamic when you commit early,” Rasmussen said. “The decision he made is for a founded reason. He could have had more offers. But he found the right offer.” The accuracy that Raquet showcased on those rare occasions when called upon to throw at San Benito came to the forefront last fall for the Lobos, as he threw just eight picks in nearly 300 attempts. During the Lobos’ bowl game, the 18-year-old threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for a touchdown. “All I had to do at Hollister was read what the defensive line was doing,” Raquet said. “When I got to MPC, I struggled a little bit learning defenses, being aware of an opponent’s entire defensive scheme.” While there was never any intention of leaving MPC after a year, making a decision this soon gives Raquet insurances on his future. “I’m still going have to improve on my game,” Raquet said. “I have a lot of unfinished business here at MPC. I want that conference title, a bowl game win. But I’m a little more relaxed.” Raquet received a call after the season from the Fresno State receivers coach, which turned into a visit and a meeting with head coach Jeff Tedford. It didn’t take much to sell the program. “I liked the fact that he was honest with me,” Raquet said. “Coach Tedford said, ‘You need to grind.’ For me, Fresno reminds me of Hollister. Everyone rallies around everyone.” Last year the Bulldogs were 10-4, winning the Mountain West Conference’s West Division before falling to Idaho State in the conference championship. The Bulldogs went on to beat Houston in the Hawaii Bowl. Two of their losses were to national champion Alabama and nationally ranked Washington — both on the road. Quarterbacks that have come out of Fresno State as No. 1 picks in the NFL include Trent Dilfer and David Carr, while current Raiders signal caller Derek Carr was a second-round selection. “My expectation when I get there is to compete for a job,” Raquet said. Rasmussen does have a connection with Fresno State, having worked with Tedford nearly three decades ago when both were assistants at Fresno. “I know the Fresno State program well,” Rasmussen said. “I think it’s a great fit for Hunter. Plus it’s his school of choice.” There are four current quarterbacks on the Bulldogs’ spring roster, including a senior and two redshirt freshmen. “Coach Rasmussen told me last year he would work with me and get me to the next level,” Raquet said. “He saw glimpses of me. He took a chance on me. It’s something I’ll never forget.” John Devine can be reached at 831-726-4337. Sign up for email newsletters']",0.0,1.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,1016936.0

Winds E at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 80%.. Thunderstorms likely. Low 69F. Winds E at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 80%. Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:29 pm Barter Theatre’s current production of “In the Heat of the Night” accomplishes what many plays attempt and almost always fail to do: Provide a good, riveting story along with social commentary. This play, especially under the more-than-capable direction of Jasper McGruder, is a wickedly twisted murder mystery woven into a coarse tapestry of blatant 1960s racism. Virgil Tibbs, a black Pasadena, California, homicide detective has come to Argo, Alabama, to tie up some family business and is just about to leave when he is arrested by Sam Wood, a local deputy, and accused of murdering Charles Tatum, a white real estate developer who had plans of building an integrated housing development in Argo. Tibbs is played by Amara Aja with just the perfect mixture of sarcasm and professional cool. Tibbs is arguably one of the most difficult parts in theatre as he has to be at once calm and collected with little more than a raised eyebrow when he encounters Deep South racism, even when being attacked by three members of the local KKK. Chief Gillespie, as portrayed by Rick McVey, comes across as being somewhere south of real bright and not completely sure how to take Tibbs. He seems to realize Tibbs is a much better cop and, while he is certainly prejudiced enough, his prejudice leans more toward curiosity about blacks than actual hatred. The same can be said for Sam Wood, the deputy who is himself not exactly the shiniest grit in the bowl. Played quite well by Justin Tyler Lewis, Sam seems at times to be almost admiring Tibbs especially when Tibbs encourages him to use his talent to advance out of small town police work. Zacchaeus Kimbrell is Pete, also a deputy, but one that is thoroughly racist to the core and a member of the local Klan. Kimbrell is not exactly right for the part but he does his best. The play gets a bit confusing at time because several of the other actors in this production play multiple roles that sometimes overlap so that you are not sure if the actor is character A or B or C in any particular scene. As the play ends one kind of hopes that the white characters, especially Chief Gillespie, has an epiphany about race but, to the play’s great credit, this epiphany that would be thoroughly false at best does not happen. As they part Tibbs offers his hand to Gillespie who pauses for a second, but then doesn’t take it. Some play-goers might be offended by some of the blunt words including … yes, THAT word … but after all, it was 1960s Alabama and to have the white characters using any other word in its place would just make the play seem silly. “In the Heat of the Night” is certainly more well-known as an Oscar winning movie or as a television show but neither, in my opinion, was better than the stage version, especially this one. It leaves one not only entertained but pondering whether we’ve changed all that much during the past half-century. Sure, the “Whites Only” signs are no longer displayed on toilet doors or in diners but have they been destroyed or just stuck back in a room somewhere? Interesting to think about. Isn’t it?

(WDBJ7) GMOs are a topic that's been sparking debates for quite some. But what are they? “It stands for genetically modified organism. So it's anything that has been modified in a lab by humans,” said Kathleen Reed of the Virginia Cooperative Extension in Roanoke. Kathleen says one reason plants are being modified is to allow farmers to spray less pesticides. “But there's also a lot of things GMOs can be used for. Whether it's increasing drought tolerance of plants, especially now that our climate's changing. That's something that we need to think about, that not all plants are adapted well to growing. “You also see plants that are going to grow more per acre, so they're going to produce more plants, which as we're increasing our world population we need to think of solutions for how we're going to be able to feed the 9 billion people that are expected to be on our planet in 2050,” she explained. The main GMOs you'll see around these parts are corn and soybeans. “Those are typically going to be in processed foods because those are products that are ground up and put into lots of products that are put into those kind of foods. So they're going to be the foods you're going to see in the middle aisles more or less where you're going to have your processed products,” Kathleen said. Kathleen says most of the produce you consume is not a GMO. “When you're shopping in your produce aisle, especially your broccoli and your lettuce and all of those kind of things that you're buying that are whole fruits and vegetables are not going to be genetically modified.As far as the research behind the health or health consequences of GMOs an overwhelming majority of scientific evidence and research shows that GMOs have no adverse effect on health,” she explained. If you still have concerns about GMOs here's what you can do. “I really encourage people to maybe shop locally a little bit or try and buy your produce from a farmer that you can ask him about where they're getting their seeds from or their practices. And then you can also grow your own, so maybe think about having a little garden plot or growing a container of tomatoes in your backyard or on your porch,” Kathleen said.

Kathleen,Reed,['http://www.stthomastimesjournal.com/2018/03/13/trucker-charged-in-fatal-hwy-401-crash-a-no-show-in-st-thomas-court'],b'6920',"['ST. THOMAS — The fiancee of a London man killed in a Highway 401 median crossover crash broke down in court Monday when she learned the trucker charged in the collision was a no-show. Kathleen Reed dropped her head and cried out after Justice of the Peace Anna Hampson adjourned the hearing for Mohamed Duale, who has travelled to his native Somalia. Reed was so distraught she had to be carried out of the St. Thomas courtroom by her daughter and a police officer. “I’m extremely, extremely disappointed that this is being held over again,” Reed said in an interview. “This is delaying my pain.” Reed’s fiance, Gary Lent, was killed Feb. 16, 2017, when his transport truck collided with another truck that had crossed the 401 median near Union Road. The fatal crash has spurred Reed to campaign for concrete median barriers along the 401. Mohamed Duale, the driver of the other truck in the crash, was charged under the Highway Traffic Act with careless driving. He was expected to plead guilty Monday. But he has been in Somalia since November. Duale’s lawyer said Duale was forced to extend his stay because his father suffered a stroke. Hampson scheduled a pretrial for May 16, two weeks after the date that Duale’s lawyer told her Duale plans to return to Canada. Hampson said Duale’s absence could cause a loss of confidence in the justice system. Reed questioned why Duale was allowed to leave the country while he was facing the careless driving charge. Assistant Crown attorney Craig Sigurdson said in an interview that because the charge is under the Highway Traffic Act, there’s nothing to prevent Duale from leaving the country. “This is a very serious situation, someone died,” Sigurdson said. “But it’s a traffic ticket.” It’s rare that someone would be restricted from travelling even if they were charged with a more serious offence under the Criminal Code, he said. “There has to be a risk that the person is going to flee before they start seizing someone’s passport.” If Duale returns, then the case will go ahead with the guilty plea as planned. If he doesn’t return, a warrant could be issued for his arrest, or a trial could be held in his absence, Sigurdson said. Since the crash that killed Lent, Reed has been on a mission to improve safety on the 136-kilometre stretch of Highway 401 between London and Tilbury that doesn’t have a concrete median to prevent vehicles from crossing over into the oncoming lanes. Reed planned to put up a memorial cross for Lent on the highway, but was denied by Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation, which said it could distract drivers. With the help of a St. Marys construction company, Reed had a concrete barrier installed in front of her south London home. “If this concrete median barrier was there, I would have Gary here with me today,” Reed said in a December interview. She joined forces in the campaign to get barriers installed with Alysson Storey, a Chatham woman whose friend Sarah Payne and her daughter Freya were killed Aug. 29 in a crossover crash near where Lent was killed. The province announced in February that a concrete median barrier will be installed between London and Tilbury, but it could take up to four years for the work to be completed. © 2018 St Thomas Times Journal.

Updated: October 10, 2018 @ 4:38 pm Susan Boland Butts By Susan Boland Butts Susan Boland Butts It’s difficult to lose someone during the holiday season. Especially someone you’ve cared about for over 45 years. Someone who has been a part of the life of your organization his entire adult life. Someone whose family you know like you know your very own. Well, that recently happened at Hi-Hope. Our good friend, Ben (name changed to protect his confidentiality) passed away after having lived to 62 years of age. He was a part of our weekday community access program all of his adult life and had lived in one of our group homes for the past decade. At Hi-Hope, one of our primary goals is to allow individuals, like Ben, to age in place. With Ben, we succeeded. Despite how his needs changed over the years, we continued to adjust our support to meet his individual needs. Ben and his counterparts are living longer than ever due to medical advances and opportunities to live in community-based settings, like the group homes offered at Hi-Hope. The need for residential programs in our communities to support individuals like Ben continues to grow at an alarming rate. There are hundreds of individuals in Gwinnett waiting on funding through the Medicaid Waiver program to receive services, including residential supports. Ben is representative of so many adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who are not only aging, but who are outliving their natural caregivers – their parents. The estimated number of individuals with an intellectual and developmental disability in Georgia is nearly 120,000. Of those, 19% live with a caregiver who is 60 years or above. These parents, who many times need the same kind of supports their adult children need, also face physical, psychological, social, and financial challenges. This statistic plays out at Hi-Hope, as well. Nearly one quarter of the individuals we support live at home with an aging parent or other family caregiver. Ben was blessed – his siblings watched their mother, who had reached the age of 80 at the time, continue to try and care for Ben, even at a time when she herself needed similar support. They worked with her to make the difficult decision to move Ben into Hi-Hope’s group home program. Not long after, she passed away, but did so with the peace that her son had a loving home of his own and the support he needed to live a meaningful life. At a time of the year when your thoughts turn to home and family, know that at Hi-Hope, we are providing a home and a family for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities in our community. Susan Boland Butts is executive director of the Hi-Hope Service Center. The Hi-Hope Service Center cultivates community for adults with developmental disabilities by connecting them with integrated opportunities for learning, work and leisure. Through weekday community access, supported employment and residential group homes, the center supports 139 adults as they contribute their unique gifts and special abilities to our community.

Operatunity brings its celebration of all things Irish St Columba Presbyterian Church, 480 Ti Rakau Dr in Botany on Thursday 25th January at 11am. Performers will include Susan Boland, John Cameron, Bonaventure Allan-Moetaua, Karl Perigo, Bryony Williams, and violinist Jessica Hindin. Tenor Bonaventure Allan-Moetaua and Violinist Jessica Hindin star in Operatunity’s first show of 2017 and met through Operatunity. They toured and performed together several times before romance sparked on Operatunity’s European Romance tour three years ago. Recently, while escorting a trip to Hawaii for Operatunity Travel, Bonnie popped the question and to the delight of their fellow travellers, they announced their engagement on the final night of the trip. Violinist Jessica Hindin completed her musical studies at University of Auckland before travelling to Ireland to fiddle in a traditional Irish show in Galway. While she was there she successfully auditioned for Barrage, an international touring world music show based in Alberta, Canada. After almost six years of touring, which included television appearances in Great Britain, Europe, USA and China she returned home to New Zealand. She has performed on stage alongside well-known entertainers including Harry Connick Jr and Elaine Page, and Kiwi singers Boh Runga, Hayley Westenra and Ladyhawke. Her string quartet has been part of the band for many other televised shows including New Zealand’s Got Talent, and X Factor. In 2015 she was appointed Musical Director of Sistema Aotearoa, a music program in South Auckland providing an avenue for social change through free orchestral musical education for over 400 primary aged children. Jess spent many years touring North America with an Irish fiddle band and we are delighted to showcase this hidden talent in our Irish show. With so many New Zealanders boasting Ireland as part of their ancestry, a concert that showcases the best of the Irish music and the irrepressible Irish spirit warms the heart and rekindles those Irish roots! With Irish dancing, famous haunting ballads, funny ditties and limericks, singalongs, Irish jokes and breakneck fiddling, the Luck of the Irish promises to be a show to please anyone who has Irish in their blood or a little bit of Irish in their hearts!

Osteoporosis is a silent disease affecting one in two women and one in four men over the age of 50 in Ireland, although all age groups can be affected. Osteoporosis is preventable and treatable at all stages. Therefore it is important to address your bone health, especially if it is hereditary. There are usually no warning signs an individual has developed osteoporosis and it is often only diagnosed when a bone is fractured. How Osteoporosis Clinic Ireland can help Osteoporosis has been called “the silent disease” because bone loss occurs initially without symptoms. Many conditions can be associated with the development of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis Clinic Ireland can help to improve your bone health. The clinic's expert staff will provide specific nutrition advice based on symptoms, weight-bearing exercises to target the improvement of bone density, and bone density scanning to determine osteoporosis risk index. In addition, supplements will be given, based on the client's needs, and testing is available to identify individual requirements. The DEXA scan will be explained. The clinic offers preventative measures for those predisposed to osteoporosis, and testing tailored to individual requirements. Registered general nurse Karen Byrne will review and explain your DEXA scan, and provide an ultrasound bone density scan to monitor your progress on an ongoing basis.

Susan,Boland,['http://www.njherald.com/20180319/a-different-kind-of-pet-care'],b'6912',"['FREDON -- A pet is a part of the family. Pets often take up space on the bed, in a loving way, and greet their owner at the door after a long day at work, so it almost goes without saying that leaving home for a few hours or days can cause undue stress on a pet. Luckily, two local women have come to the rescue, offering a full-service pet care in Sussex County called When U R Not There Pet Care for those on vacation or pulling 12-hour shifts at work. The founders, Mary Scuralli, of Green, and Sue Boland, of Fredon, have vowed to give both the owner and the pet complete peace of mind. The premise behind their company is rather simple, but is a welcome addition for those uneasy with bringing their pets to the local kennel or left without any other options. Scuralli and Boland -- who have always loved animals but never had any as children -- offer dog walking, pet sitting, dog running and pet taxi services. Included in those services, all held at the owner\'s home, are feeding, playing, litter scooping, trash clean-up, gathering of mail and newspapers, fresh water refills, watering plants, ear scratches, and belly rubs. A welcome addition to each service is an email or text update of the pet, including photos that both women will take and send to the owners throughout the time spent with the owner\'s pet. Scuralli says Boland even gets a little too into the photo taking and will dress up the pets in festive items, such as a green bow for St. Patrick\'s Day or a red neck bandana for Valentine\'s Day, before snapping a picture for the owner. ""Just a little seasonal fun,"" Boland laughed. The women don\'t typically go to a client\'s house together, unless there are numerous animals involved, and offer services that range from a standard, 15-minute visit for $15, ideal for cats or puppy potty breaks, to an overnight stay, a $75 charge per night. It was 17 years ago when Boland and Scuralli first met, both having worked for Literacy NJ, a non-profit that offers adults the opportunity to increase their literacy skills. Although Scuralli still works for the organization, Boland eventually went on to work for the Township of Fredon, where she currently serves as the secretary for both the Land Use Board and the Board of Health and handles dog licensing for the township. The duo had always spoken about their love of animals, but it was in May 2016 when their dream to start a pet care service came to fruition. They etched out their business plans -- Scuralli joked that Boland actually did all the work -- and opened up business. ""We had both taken care of friends and family members\' animals, so we knew there was a need for it,"" Boland said. While some people knew the women were starting their business, word has spread on social media -- the women have an active Facebook page and website -- and find themselves quite busy. Although it tends to vary, the women find the summer months to be the busiest time of year, with vacations planned while children are out of school. To become familiar with a home and a pet\'s level of comfort, the women each hold complimentary initial assessments, where they meet with the owner first inside their home. ""It allows us to meet the owners, meet the animals and know what door to walk in, the demeanor of the animal...,"" Boland said. Scuralli said they will typically fill out paperwork, including important information such as the age and breed of the animal; fears, such as kids or other animals; medications taken; places they will hide; feeding schedule; and their typical routine. Although the women never had pets as kids, that isn\'t the case now. Boland has four of her own dogs and three cats, plus Xander, a seeing eye puppy from the Seeing Eye of Morristown. Boland has been involved with the program the past seven years and Xander is her sixth dog. Scuralli is also no stranger to pets; she has two dogs, two cats and five rabbits. Whether it\'s a trip to the veterinarian\'s office or an overnight stay, the women focus on making sure life is easier on both owner and pet. In fact, Boland adds an additional perk to the job: ""Playing or running with a dog is better than paying for the gym!"" The women offer full services to the Newton and Andover areas, typically within a 10-mile radius, but also offer limited services to locations such as Byram, Fredon, Hampton, Lafayette, Hardwick, Newton, Sparta, Augusta, Allamuchy, Blairstown, Frelinghuysen and Stillwater. ººº To find out more details about what When U R Not There Pet Care has to offer, including pricing, visit www.whenurnottherepetcare.com or visit their Facebook page: www.Facebook.com/WhenURNotTherePetCare.']",0.0,1.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,1019349.0
