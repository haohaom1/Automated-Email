Sara,Burns,1529,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/08/27/news/security-tight-man-charged-fredericton-shootings-appears-court,"I'm already signed up. The man accused of killing four people, including two police officers, in a shooting spree this month moved slowly and tentatively as he made his first court appearance Monday. Matthew Vincent Raymond said nothing as he faced a Fredericton judge on four counts of murder in the deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. Raymond, 48, wore orange jail clothing and leg shackles as sheriffs officers helped him cautiously exit a sheriff's van. Raymond looked down at the ground for much of the morning's events, but observers noted he is slim, has short hair, is balding and has a greying beard. The court appearance was the first time the media has been able to provide visual images of Raymond, other than a fuzzy yearbook picture from his teenaged years. The police officers and civilians were gunned down Aug. 10 outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. It ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen, according to court documents. On Monday, Regional Sheriff George Oram cautioned everyone in the courtroom against any outbursts. Members of the victims' families were among about 70 people assembled in the packed courtroom for his appearance. They left without speaking to reporters. Security at the courthouse was tight, and a large section of parking lot was cordoned off, with sheriffs' vehicles used to block some of the view of the courthouse entrance where Raymond was brought in. The defence presented provincial court Judge Julian Dickson with a piece of evidence but the judge imposed a publication ban on anything to do with it. Dickson adjourned the case until Sept. 24. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. Thousands of police officers and first responders from across the continent travelled to Fredericton to attend a regimental funeral for Burns and Costello. Friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered varying memories of the accused murderer. Some have recalled how he retreated for long periods of time into video games, while others recall a pleasant supermarket co-worker. Recent accounts describe an increasingly isolated loner who was ejected from a bicycle shop and a cafe for erratic behaviour.

Sara,Burns,1529,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-benefit-concert-october-1.4801639,"A benefit concert featuring only Canadian artists will take the stage in Fredericton in October. The concert was set up by Bell Media and Newcap Radio to show support for the city of Fredericton, which was shaken earlier this month by a shooting that left four people dead. On Aug. 10, a gunman killed Const. Robb Costello, 45, Const. Sara Burns, 43, and civilians Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Headliners for the Oct. 6 concert are Matt Mays, Matt Andersen, Neon Dreams, Classified, and Tristan Horncastle. The five-hour concert at the Aitken Centre will feature more than a dozen Canadian artists, a news release said. Fredericton's own David Myles will MC the event. Myles was in Halifax when he heard the news of the shooting. ""It was a surreal day,"" he said. ""This doesn't happen. How does this possibly make any sense?"" He said it was decided to hold a benefit concert because music can bring people together. ""Music can unite people in really difficult times,"" he said. ""That's what this event is about."" ""Additional performers will be announced in the coming days,"" the release said. Myles said he isn't sure how many artists will join the headliners but he said it will be a packed lineup. ""It looks like it's going to be quite full evening."" Proceeds from the concert will go to the Chalmers Hospital Foundation, the Canadian Red Cross, and the New Brunswick chapter of the Canadian Mental Health Association. Tickets will be available Aug. 29 at the Aitken Centre box office or online at auc.unb.ca. The box office is open from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Friday.

Sara,Burns,1529,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-election-campaign-leaders-day-8-1.4802553,"The New Brunswick Progressive Conservatives say they will expand the province's ocean-based ""blue economy"" if elected next month. That would include focusing more effort on fisheries exports, tidal power and the marine transport industry, said PC Leader Blaine Higgs, describing it as an ""untapped"" ""trillion-dollar global market."" ""The Liberals have failed to take advantage of the economic opportunity represented by our enormous coastline,"" he said Thursday during a campaign stop in Bouctouche at Pays de la Sagouine. ""Team Higgs will make it a priority, which will create jobs and attract tourism to coastal communities around the province."" His was one of a handful of election promises made by political party leaders on Day 8 of the campaign. The Liberals focused on their plan to combat climate change, while the NDP talked about transitioning the province to green energy. The Green Party discussed the inroads they've made across the country and the ""groundswell"" of support they've seen in New Brunswick heading into the Sept. 24 election. Higgs said a PC government would instruct NB Power to work with coastal communities to develop proposals for offshore renewable energy projects and create incentives for ocean-based research and product commercialization at post-secondary institutions. It would also promote New Brunswick's coastal communities to businesses and investors around the world to attract more marine transport business and grab a greater share of the tourism market, he said during the morning announcement. Later, Higgs attended a meet-and-greet with local candidates at the Bouctouche Mall and some private meetings before heading back to his home in Quispamsis for the night. Liberal Party Leader Brian Gallant started his day in Edmundston before heading to the Delta Fredericton to make his platform announcement. ""A re-elected Liberal government's plan to protect the environment will force big businesses that are large greenhouse gas emitters to pay their fair share, will phase out electricity generated by coal by 2030, and will make sure New Brunswick consumers do not pay one more cent at the pumps or on their power bills,"" he said. It came after days of criticism by Higgs, who has vowed not to impose a ""job killing"" carbon tax, to fight one in court that is federally imposed and if he loses, to rebate consumers or lower taxes by an equivalent amount. The federal government has said the provinces must impose a levy on carbon, with a goal of reducing emissions to 30 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030 to comply with the Paris climate treaty. On Jan. 1, 2019, Ottawa will impose its own carbon tax, which it calls a ""backstop,"" on provinces that don't meet its standard. ""We are the only party with a plan to avoid new costs for consumers,"" said Gallant. Since April, 2.3 cents of New Brunswick's 15.5-cent-per-litre gas tax has been shifted into a climate fund to be spent on environmental initiatives. That share will increase every year over five years to 11.64 cents Although Gallant has previously refused to broach the possibility his plan would be rejected by Ottawa, he said Thursday he would ""fight"" any imposition of a federal carbon tax ""backstop"" on New Brunswick. The Liberals would also push ahead with the more than 100 action items in their 2016 climate change plan, ensuring the province embraces clean technologies and green jobs and helping New Brunswick households become more energy efficient, he told reporters before travelling to Maugerville, Moncton and Dieppe. NDP Leader Jennifer McKenzie, who was in Saint John for a second day Thursday, criticized another plank of the Liberal platform — a four-year NB Power rate freeze for residential customers and small businesses. She called the election promise ""irresponsible."" ""Ignoring the advice of the Energy and Utilities Board is very foolish. We saw what happened in Ontario when the government put politics ahead of good advice. Power rates in the long run will go up substantially unless there's a good solid plan behind what you're doing."" She contends the NDP has put forward forward such a plan. Investing in green energy infrastructure, tapping into wind, solar, hydro, tidal, geothermal and nuclear power, will reduce electricity prices ""significantly,"" she said. Given the province's ""wonderful resources,"" ""we should be able to transition to a green economy very quickly and very effectively if we have the political will to do it."" An NDP government would also invest in other green infrastructure, such as public transit and electrical vehicle charging networks across the province, said McKenzie, who was accompanied by Nova Scotia NDP Leader Gary Burrill. They toured the Social Enterprise Hub, an uptown office where non-profit groups and social enterprise businesses share resources and collaborate on community initiatives, visited King's Square and the City Market, then went canvassing in the Saint John Harbour riding with volunteers. A meet-and-greet with party volunteers was slated for 5:30 p.m. at the NDP office. Green Party Leader David Coon was accompanied by federal Green Party Leader Elizabeth May for a second straight day and met with reporters on the front lawn of the legislative assembly Thursday morning to discuss the campaign to date. May said she is ""quite confident"" Coon will be re-elected in the riding of Fredericton South and return to the legislature with a caucus of Green MLAs. Coon is currently the party's only member in New Brunswick, but May, who has also been campaigning this week with Memramcook-Tantramar candidate Megan Mitton, and attending fundraiser events, said she is seeing a ""groundswell"" of support for the party in the province and across the country. She noted when she was first elected federally in 2011, there hadn't been any other Green candidates elected in Canada. Today, there are eight sitting Green party representatives. ""I think New Brunswick will show a big breakthrough,"" she said, crediting in large part Coon's ""hard work"" and ""spectacular record."" Coon also believes this could be a ""pivotal"" election for the Greens. People are "" tired of the flip-flopping back and forth between Liberals and Tories. They don't see that much difference between them,"" he said. ""So they're looking for an alternative and they're trying to determine now where's the place they can put their vote, who can they trust their vote with, who's going to treat their vote respectfully."" The Green Party's slate of candidates increasingly represents the makeup of the province, he said. More than half of them are women, three are Indigenous, there are millennials and even an octogenarian. Coon and May were later scheduled to visit the downtown Garrison Market to meet with local vendors, then attend a memorial concert at 7 p.m. at the Charlotte Street Arts Centre in honour of the two fallen city police officers. Fredericton Police Force Constables Robb Costello, 45, and Sara Burns, 43, were shot and killed on Aug. 10, along with civilians Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. Accused gunman Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 24. People's Alliance Leader Kris Austin spent Thursday campaigning door-to-door in his riding of Fredericton-Grand Lake. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Michael,Gordon,1528,https://www.thisisanfield.com/2018/08/michael-gordon-the-man-who-runs-liverpool-and-deserves-credit-for-reds-rise/,"When Liverpool supporters think of the senior figures at Anfield, the names of Jurgen Klopp and John W. Henry are the main ones that spring to mind – but there is another whose influence is perhaps even greater than anyone else at Anfield. Michael Gordon, a director at Liverpool FC and president at the Reds’ ownership group, FSG, has greater influence on Merseyside than principal owner Henry or club chairman Tom Werner. Gordon was appointed to the Liverpool board of directors upon FSG’s purchase of the club in October 2010 and at the time was, according to a report in 2014, the “member of the ownership group with the most grounding in soccer” and therefore “quickly became a critical figure in the daily running of LFC.” It was said that the Milwaukee-born businessman “runs Liverpool” and is “in many ways the member of the ownership group who is most directly responsible for the day-to-day activities” of the club. Since then, Gordon’s influence has grown at Anfield, with the American leading the decision-making process that saw Brendan Rodgers sacked, Klopp recruited, and the appointment of the club’s first sporting director when Michael Edwards was promoted in November 2016. According to those inside the club, it is no coincidence that Gordon’s growing influence has coincided with the major strides made on and off the pitch at Anfield in recent years. Gordon has increased his shareholding to become the second-largest shareholder at FSG, after principal owner Henry, and is extremely hands-on despite being primarily based on the other side of the Atlantic. This summer, Klopp called Gordon ‘his man’. “Mike is my person,” said the boss. “He’s our man, in FSG he’s the LFC man. “He’s doing an outstanding job and has a big heart for LFC, that’s how it is. He loves the club and wants what’s best for it – that’s the truth.” Gordon, as well as being key to major dealings at the club, also deserves credit for other developments that have improved the club overall. While Liverpool’s owners haven’t got it all right since their takeover eight years ago, they have admitted their mistakes and it’s Gordon who has been key to learning from those and leading the improvements from top to bottom. “The one person who has made a fundamental difference is Mike,” a source inside the club told This Is Anfield. “If you track the changes and improvements – transfers, on the pitch, to move for Jurgen, away from Rodgers, to a big-name top class manager – Gordon’s influence has coincided with all the other (good) things.” Liverpool’s work in the transfer market since the appointment of Klopp has been widely praised, acquiring top class players to improve the squad – and, perhaps crucially, not settling for second-best options. The 53-year-old has driven Liverpool’s transfer strategy and is an advocate of showing discipline over transfers, preaching of “staying true to your principles.” He played a key role in the signing of Virgil van Dijk from Southampton, and has spent an increasing amount of time on Merseyside – although, even when in Boston is still very hands-on and in regular contact with Klopp and Edwards. Gordon, whose background is in finance, is described as “big-hitter”. He made his name as partner with Jeffrey Vinik, who owns NHL side Tampa Bay Lightning and was previously on the board of directors at Anfield until 2013. Gordon’s role at Liverpool has increased since 2014 after he and Vinik closed their Tampa-based hedge fund to focus on other activities – Vinik with his NHL side and Gordon with Boston Red Sox and Liverpool. “Mike Gordon is one of the best human beings you could possibly meet,” Vinik said shortly after that decision. “He’s very smart, very thoughtful and really outstanding at solving problems and finding solutions to difficult issues. I think the world, of course, of John and Tom. But there’s no question Michael has been a very important component of what FSG has been able to do.” He prefers to remain behind the scenes, rarely speaking publicly and maintaining a low-profile, but Gordon is very much the main man at Liverpool.

Michael,Gordon,1528,https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Mark-Mathias-elected-education-board-chairman-13191657.php,"By Sophie Vaughan Caption Close WESTPORT — Information technology executive and town Maker Faire founder Mark Mathias is the new chairman of the Board of Education following a unanimous vote by his fellow board members. “I’ve long believed the most important thing we can do in life is to prepare our youth for the future,” Mathias said in accepting the board’s nomination. A Democrat, Mathias has served on the school board for 15 years and fills the chairmanship vacated by fellow Democratic Michael Gordon who resigned from the board in June citing a busy schedule. Republican board member and Vice Chair Jeannie Smith filled in as acting chair over the summer and nominated Mathias for the chairmanship at Monday’s meeting. “He’s truly the expert in keeping us centered as a board of ed when we face challenging and unexpected circumstances,” Smith said in nominating Mathias, adding he is not only a valued member of the BOE but an active Westport resident. There are currnetly four Democrats and three Republicans serving on the board. Seven years ago Mathias founded Maker Faire Westport, a showcase of creativity that is now the state’s largest single-day event and last year attracted more than 13,000 people to town, Smith said. Mathias and his wife, Kim Mathias, have two children — Nicole and Nick and have served as a host family for A Better Chance of Westport, a program that provides academically gifted, economically disadvantaged and highly motivated young men of color the opportunity to live in town and study at Westport public schools. “I appreciate Mark’s nearly 15 years of service on the board and, in particular, the creative energy he brings through the use of technology, steam (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics), and innovation and most importantly, I appreciate that he shares the board’s passion for and commitment to always doing our very best to meet the needs of the children we serve,” Elaine Whitney, a Democratic BOE member said in seconding Smith’s nomination of Mathias.

And while the ensemble’s founding members (David Lang, Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon) are not part of the travelling sextet, their creative spirit resonates through every Bang on a Can project. This week’s Melbourne concert by the All-Stars paid tribute to Lang, Wolfe and Gordon (who are still the group’s artistic directors) by including compositions by all three in the program. Lang’s dramatic Cheating, lying, stealing set the tone for the evening, its choppy rhythmic accents and frequent tonal shifts requiring incredible precision on the part of the players. Wolfe’s Believing featured Gregg August’s propulsive, jazz-inflected double bass and a virtuosic solo from Ashley Bathgate on cello and wordless vocals. In Gordon’s piece, For Madeleine, cello, clarinet (Ken Thomson) and electric guitar (Taylor Levine) slid eerily – and with increasing, siren-like urgency – over rippling piano and vibraphone (Vicky Chow and Paul Tanner). Australian composer JG Thirlwell’s Anabiosis unfolded like an imaginary soundtrack for an extremely dark cartoon - with fractured rock rhythms, ominously discordant smears and hairpin turns that the players negotiated with breathtaking synchronicity. Philip Glass’ Closing (from Glassworks) swelled and sighed with unruffled beauty, before the group took us on a wild and thrilling ride through Steve Martland’s Horses of Instruction, Thomson literally leaping with vigour on saxophone as the group surged to a gleeful finale.

Updated: November 14, 2018 @ 3:37 pm Crossville, Tennessee Former Gov. Phil Bredesen speaks to a gathering of Cumberland County residents on the issues affecting senior citizens. Former Gov. Phil Bredesen speaks to a gathering of Cumberland County residents on the issues affecting senior citizens. When Phil Bredesen, former governor and candidate for U.S. Senate, sat down with a group of retired residents in Cumberland County, he expected he’d hear about concerns regarding healthcare costs and the solvency of the Social Security program. Instead, he heard about grandparents raising grandchildren, the scourge of the opioid epidemic on the community, and the lack of access to drug treatment and prevention. “One of the biggest problems we have in this county is the drug problem…There’s probably not a person in this room that’s not been affected by this drug situation,” said Tom Pelfrey. “We need some sort of system where people can get treated.” Pelfry said drug addiction impacted the local workforce and removed individuals from their homes and families. The grandparents often step in to care for children when parents cannot care for them. Linda Carr added many seniors were not financially prepared to take on the cost of raising children at that stage in their lives. “They were prepared to retire with the income they needed, but they weren’t prepared to raise another generation,” she said. “Cutting Medicare and Social Security isn’t just cutting my generation. You’re cutting a whole other generation.” Jane Powers, a local attorney, added she’d seen an increase in the number of seniors filing for bankruptcy protection. “They cannot afford to raise their grandchildren and send their own children to some sort of care,” she said. “Never before have we had seniors declaring bankruptcy like they are now.” Bredesen had attended a roundtable discussion in Mount Juliet earlier in the day that dealt with concerns regarding opioid abuse. “It’s pretty striking to come here to talk about Medicare and Social Security and you want to talk about opioids, which underlines the extent to which it’s become a deep, serious problem,” Bredesen said. “Have any of you seen something that worked well?” Bredesen said he’d like to see a focus on prevention of opioid addiction, such as considering outpatient physical therapy and mental health services. Jim Petty, local pharmacist, said recent legislation in the state is causing many pain clinics to close, impacting patients with legitimate prescriptions. “It’s getting dangerous to be in our position because they’re going to get that somewhere,” Petty said. He said the state needed to look at legislation requiring pain clinics to decrease the dose patients receive. “The DEA has come out with a plan to decrease the quantity of opioids that are produced, and that’s going to make things a lot more tense in the pharmacy,” Petty said. Bobby Randolph, a board member with Volunteer Behavioral Health, said the organization didn’t receive a lot of funding to provide drug treatment services. Bredesen said there is evidence that long-term out-patient treatment could be more effective than short-term hospitalization. He also would like to see more discussion of best practices for opioid prescribing to help stop addiction on the front end. Affordable healthcare was a concern for many present, from supplemental insurance to cover what Medicare does not to the cost of providing employee health plans as a small business owner. Petty said, “I’ve had to cut the insurance I’ve paid for years and years and years. I just can’t afford the steep increases.” Dennis Hatler said many resident’s he’d spoken with were against privatizing Medicare and Social Security and support expanding Medicaid in Tennessee. In 2017, 16 percent of Cumberland County adults age 18 to 64 were uninsured. Efforts to expand Medicaid in the state have been unsuccessful, however. Advocates point to the loss of $1.4 billion in annual federal funding for a program and financial pressure on hospitals — particularly those in rural communities. At least eight rural hospitals in Tennessee have closed since 2010 and dozens more are in danger of closing, according to the Tennessee Justice Center. Bredesen said Medicaid expansion had been heavily politicized; however, he said not expanding coverage meant many people with serious illnesses delayed getting medical care. It’s also been difficult for rural communities to recruit physicians, particularly specialists. “Healthcare in general would benefit from more emphasis on getting started earlier in the process,” Bredesen said. Bredesen also said he’d like to see the government negotiate prices with drug companies, something currently prohibited by law. He’d also like to address laws that allow drug companies to extend the patent on drugs and increase prices. He did not favor price controls, however, saying he likes to allow the market to deal with such issues when possible. Carr said she’d once been told there could be significant administrative savings by simply standardizing the form used to seek insurance reimbursements. She asked if that had been considered. Bredesen touched on Medicare and Social Security, including proposed cuts to the programs discussed by current lawmakers. “Social Security is an important piece of the retirement package for virtually every American, and it is the retirement package for 50 to 60 percent of Americans,” he said. He said something needed to be done to restore the trust fund through an increase in the tax or an appropriation. Heather Mullinix is assistant editor of the Crossville Chronicle.

Most Popular in Careers 1986 Early education in chemistry Born to a journalist and an educator in Virginia Beach, Va., Andrew Davis says his parents were supportive and lovingly amused by his interest in the sciences, watching as he would “play with increasingly complicated technical toys and books.” He began his schooling at a local Hebrew day school, but his public high school is where he learned to love chemistry. “We had a chemistry teacher who would let us perform almost any experiment we wanted to—within reason—with the caveat that we had to explain why whatever happened happened.” 2005 Finding a good fit Davis stayed nearby for college, majoring in chemistry and minoring in materials science at the University of Virginia. Early on “there was a research group in the chemistry department that let me latch on and do a little bit of computational chemistry work, which was really great because it convinced me that I had no interest in computational chemistry,” he says. After graduation, happenstance led him to the corner of chemistry that would define his career. Davis did research in the summer of 2008 at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, working in the polymer science and engineering department. “I was lucky to be a part of it,” he remembers. He ended up staying there for five years, eventually getting his Ph.D. Sign up for C&EN's must-read weekly newsletter Contact us to opt out anytime 2014 Far from home Davis’s first job was at the research laboratories of 3M in Minnesota, where he was a senior research engineer working on adhesives and photochemistry. His time in industry, especially the focus on results, left a lasting impression. “Measurables are something that I still think about from my industry days,” he says. After two years, Davis and his partner, a crop and soil scientist, wanted to relocate to the East Coast to be closer to family. They narrowed down a list of cities that could solve their two-body problem. Washington, D.C., made the list. Davis set up a job alert on USAJobs, a government recruitment platform. Then came a life-changing alert: The Library of Congress was looking to hire a polymer chemist. 2016 Transition to preservation Davis now works as a chemist in the Library of Congress’s Preservation Research & Testing Division. His training, while a good background for his position, was not preservation specific. So he learns from those around him: art historians, cultural heritage experts, preservationists, even other chemists. “It takes a little bit of figuring out how to adapt, say, a polymer science technique ... to cellulose-based papers in the library. But it gives a different vantage point and new ways of answering the same question.” In contrast to his time in industry, Davis enjoys being able to share the nitty-gritty of his research with scientists in industry and academia. “I think that’s one reason why I enjoy being at the library so much is that the library’s bigger mission is making knowledge accessible, making its collections accessible.” Know a chemist with an interesting career path?

They received colored pencils or a new box of crayons in recognition of their participation in the Mini 4-H/CloverBud program: L-R- Kaci Hill, Olivia Raye Knopp, Julie Hawkins, and Creegan Jones. The 2018 Vermillion County 4-H Achievement Program was held recently in the 4-H Community Building at the Vermillion County Fairgrounds. Over 150 people were in attendance. Each year, the Vermillion County Farm Bureau awards the Jeff Shew Memorial Award to an outstanding first year 4-Her who has completed all projects taken, participated in a variety of club and community service activities, and turned in a completed “My Record of 4-H Achievement”. Nominees for the 201 Jeff Shew Award were Ryan Akers, Ava Akers, Bailey Dowdy, Kori Hill, Rudd Howard, Garrett Pate and Laney Walters. This year’s recipient of the Jeff Shew Memorial Award is Kori Hill of the St. Bernice 98’ers 4-H club. Hill is a fourth-grader at Ernie Pyle Elementary. She is the daughter of Kurt and Kelli Hill. The 2018 Vermillion County 4-H Member of the Year is Nolan Willhite. He is a 2018 graduate of South Vermillion and is a 10-year member of the Shining Shamrocks 4-H Club; he was a six-year member of 4-H Jr. Leaders. He also received $100 sponsored by Nancy Towner. Willhite has started his freshman year at Purdue University and is the son of Melanie Willhite and Brian Willhite. Connie Warner was recognized as being the 2018 Vermillion Co. 4-H Leader of the Year. Under her leadership, the Shooting Sports program has remained strong. Her leadership within Shooting Sports has welcomed and recruited more coaches to the Shooting Sports team. To be considered for a National Achievement Medal, a 4-Her must have earned an “A” grade on that project’s record sheet. Participation in club, county and state workshops and activities, leadership within a project area as well as a current copy of “My Record of 4-H Achievement” on file also are considered in making selections.

Sign Up In keeping with her vision to deliver quality, and to provide easy access to dental care in Guyana, Dr. Theodora Madekurozwa, founder of Smile Guyana Dental Services, opened a new clinic on Monday, at Le Ressouvenir, East Coast Demerara (ECD). The facility, which comes at an investment of between $30-40 million Guyana dollars, was declared open by Junior Minister of Health Dr. Karen Cummings. The clinic, which is located at Lot 3 Public Road, Le Ressouvenir ECD, next door to the Grand Coastal Hotel, complements the services provided at two other locations, at Middle Street, Georgetown and at Main Street, New Amsterdam, Berbice. According to Madekurozwa, the decision to open a new clinic was to cut the travelling time of her patients and it is her wish that Guyanese can access premium dental care closer to their homes. “The whole idea here was to have a clinic that functions at a level Middle Street functions. It is a satellite clinic with all the services, and most clinics out [of Georgetown provide services that] are basic. We find a lot of patients travelling to Georgetown for services that can be brought to them and we are trying to do that,” the founder and lead dentist at the clinic explained. This new facility boasts five surgical rooms, a panoramic x-ray room, a spacious waiting room, a play area for children, and a breast feeding and changing room for babies and nursing mothers. “The services include implants, precision dentures, crowns, bridgework, orthodontics and periodontal services which is a big thing in Guyana with basic dentistry,” she outlined. The orthodontic service is provided at all the clinics by Orthodontist Dr. Harry Hanoman. Touching on the investment, which is partly funded by a loan from Republic Bank, the founder explained that the borrowed funds went towards the renovation of the new clinic, the purchase of equipment, and the payment of duties, taxes and transportation. At the opening ceremony on Monday, Madekurozwa said the expansion of her services is evidence that “big things can have small beginnings… I am not Guyanese, but I have learnt the true meaning of what it means when they say ‘one one dutty build dam’.” She recalled working with the Dental School and in the Public Service in Guyana after graduating in Zimbabwe. She told attendees that it was her frustration while working at the Dental School which led her to start a private practice. “It is our vision to have other facilities like this in other parts of Guyana, maybe not run by us, but take the guidance from us. We need facilities like this in the major towns,” she said, while advising that dental clinics are an excellent choice for a business venture. She told Stabroek News that while it is her dream to see dental clinics across the country, it is also her dream to create an avenue to provide implant services at an affordable rate. The clinic’s lead dentist explained that she has already started the discussion with a government minister. “Guyana has long history of extracting teeth and the young people don’t want dentures, but implants are not so affordable… My dream has not been achieved, it is to see implant dentistry offered at a very low cost in Guyana,” she disclosed. Further, Madekurozwa complained of the challenge she faced in getting connected to the Guyana Power and Light (GPL). “GPL had me running around for four months, go here! Go there… only two weeks now I was able to get the electricity… it is not encouraging business atmosphere when you have to run around… I was still paying the bank for a place that was not making a dime over that four months…” she stressed. The clinic was open to the public from yesterday. Former President Donald Ramotar and former Prime Minister Samuel Hinds, along with his wife Yvonne, were among other dignitaries who graced the opening and congratulated Madekurozwa and her team on the new venture.

Rick,McVey,1521,http://www.caswellmessenger.com/business/article_968d5b20-ab11-11e8-9b04-7ff828380ba6.html,"Photograph by Adam Powell A collection of fire trucks from throughout Caswell, Person, Orange, and Rockingham Counties convened at Prospect Hill Volunteer Fire Department this past weekend for ISO rating testing with the North Carolina Office of Fire Marshal. The ISO rating process is intended not only to help local rural fire districts improve their service, but also to potentially lower homeowner insurance rates in the community. Posted: Tuesday, August 28, 2018 6:27 pm Caswell County undergoes fire ISO inspection testing By Adam Powell Messenger Editor caswellmessenger.com On the morning of Saturday, August 25, a large collection of volunteer firefighters from throughout Caswell County and surrounding communities made their way to the Prospect Hill Fire Department for the first round of testing in the county’s ISO inspection process. Caswell County, despite being entirely made up of non-municipally funded volunteer fire districts, is undergoing the ISO inspection process in order to improve its service to the local community, while also potentially reducing the home insurance liability on local consumers. The ISO inspection process has been two years in the making, as local firefighters countywide have been undergoing specialized training in order to help maximize the ISO rating scores that were tested over the weekend. ISO representative Tom Ramp joined numerous state fire officials at Saturday’s testing. Also on hand were a pair of Caswell County Commissioners - Sterling Carter and Rick McVey - as well as County Manager Bryan Miller. It’s a unique thing to see rural volunteer firemen, without necessarily the pressure that larger municipally-funded fire districts have to maintain certain ISO rating, undergoing training and testing that typically only takes place within larger, more heavily-populated fire districts around the state. It seemed to inspire the state fire inspection officials on hand at Saturday’s testing. “It’s been a long time coming. I’ve got more training hours up here in Caswell County than I’ve got at my own fire department back home,” Vernon Ward, Senior Field Inspector for the North Carolina Office of State Fire Marshal said. “I’ve been up here the last two years, helping get this going. “We’d like to use you all as an example with other counties to do this. Because this really helps us out, and hopefully it helps you all out,” “I want to thank you all a whole lot for getting prepared and doing this as a whole. I think in a month or so, when we come back, I think we’re gonna see good fruit to bear,” Ward added. “Vernon has got a property tax assessment from the county office, but I took care of it for him,” Vernon Massengill of the Yanceyville Fire Department joked. “We do this from Murphy to Manteo,” added Derrick Clouston, Deputy Director of Fire and Rescue Training at OSFM. “And to see this type of dedication in what you’re doing for your community and your county, it’s unreal. On behalf of (N.C. Insurance) Commissioner (Mike) Causey, and the whole Office of the State Fire Marshal, we just want to say thank you for having our staff here. Thank you for the warmth you’ve shown us.” “We’re looking forward to seeing what kind of fruit this bears,” Clouston added. “Because I’m gonna tell you - this is unheard of, what you’re doing. You’re making history. And I want to congratulate you on being willing to step forward and do this is a community. We just want to thank you for all your help and all your hard work.” Fire districts across North Carolina are given insurance ratings from 1 to 9, with 1 being the best possible score. Some of the factors that go into Ratings Inspections includes Emergency Communications, Fire Departments, local water supplies, and community risk reduction. Scores of 1 typically only go to large urban fire districts. In North Carolina, the Charlotte Fire Department holds the only Class 1 ISO rating. Seven fire districts across the state hold a 2 ISO rating - almost all large, densely populated cities such as Raleigh, Durham, and Greensboro, among others. Numerous rural fire districts across the state have an ISO rating of 9 - the lowest possible score. Factors that typically result in a 9 ISO rating include long distances to make service calls, a lack of water supply, and districts only having one or two fire trucks to respond to calls. Although multiple Caswell County fire districts have a rating of 9, the ISO inspection process could move certain local districts up to an ISO rating of 7, which could save homeowners approximately $75 dollars per $100,000 of home value in home insurance premiums. “We’re doing just like we’ve been practicing for two years,” said Massengill to the assembled firemen. “Today’s the day we’ve been working for for a long time. You’ve practiced hard. You’ve done well. We just need to show these guys. Don’t be scared of these (state inspection) guys. I know most of these guys. Most of these guys have been in the position we’re in. They want to help us.” Some of the fire departments that were represented at the ISO inspection included Yanceyville, Prospect Hill, Providence, Roxboro, Yanceyville, Hurdle Mills, Boonsboro, Cherry Grove, Leasburg, Casville, Williamsburg, CEFFO Fire/Rescue, Semora, Pelham, Ruffin, and Milton. Caswell, Orange, Person, and Rockingham Counties were all represented. “I’d like to thank the out-of-county guys. I think we’ve got Williamsburg here. Ruffin is here. Hurdle Mills is here. Yanceyville Road and Roxboro, and CEFFO,” Massengill said. Testing field sites were located at Ridgefield Road, Baldwin Farm, Kimbro Road, and along Old Highway 62. The dump site was at Kimbro Road, while the fill site was along Old Highway 62. Tests included filling trucks, dumping trucks, driving the truck against a running clock, handling hoses, and dealing with suction, among other challenges. Drivers were timed in 200-foot increments, whether they were dumping items or filling up. At the fill site, the timing started when the trucks started moving, prompted by a whistle. When the truck was filled up, the drivers were able to leave. At the dump sites, inspection officials monitored how quickly - and how safely - the firefighters conducted their dumps. Upon leaving Ridgefield Road, there was a dump tank along the Painter Road extension. “We just need you to get rid of your water - most of it - before the next fill site,” Massengill explained. “The biggest thing is safety,” Ward said. “There’s a lot of trucks moving, a lot of stuff going on. So the priority of this whole exercise is safety. You want to get good times. You want to do things correctly. But we’ve got to do it safely.” Fire personnel handling hose and setting up drills during the field site setups were required to be in boots, bunker pants, helmets with chin straps fastened, and gloves. Observers were required to wear traffic vests. “We’ve got to record these times. Of course, the better the time, the better,” Ward continued. “But the biggest thing is being safe.” Massengill thanked the Prospect Hill Fire Department not only for helping set up the ISO inspection by getting everyone together and organizing the trucks, but by providing a meal for the firefighters and the state inspection officials. “I’d like to thank Prospect Hill Fire Department. These guys have been so good as to do this. They got all our trucks lined up,” Massengill said. In approximately a month, the ISO officials will be back in Caswell County to provide data from the testing session, and to let local fire officials know the areas in which they need to improve to get better ISO ratings in the future.

Michael,Gordon,1518,https://www.journal-topics.com/articles/chicago-wolves-celebrate-25-years-on-ice-in-rosemont/,"Serving Chicago's Great Northwest Suburbs Wednesday, November 14, 2018 By Lauren Barry | on August 28, 2018 A Chicago Wolves mask on display in Chicago. Photo courtesy of the Chicago Wolves. This month, the Rosemont-based Chicago Wolves professional minor league hockey team celebrates its 25th anniversary with an art installation along Michigan Avenue in Chicago. When the Wolves first came on the scene in 1994, they were part of the International Hockey League. The IHL was absorbed by the American Hockey League in 2001, marking the Wolves’ first win of the AHL Calder cup. As part of the IHL, the Wolves won the Turner Cup in 1998 and 2000. Since joining the AHL, the team won the Calder Cup a second time during the 2007-08 season. Over the years, the team has also nabbed six conference championships, nine division titles and won over 1,000 games. A total of 605 players have been on the roster for the past quarter of a century, 58 percent of which went on to play in the National Hockey League. Outside of winning titles, the team has championed charity efforts, particularly though its Adopt-a-Dog program, and worked to help those in underprivileged areas as well as supported the Epilepsy Foundation of Greater Chicago. To commemorate the team’s successes, fifteen 54-in. by 74-in. decorated Wolves goalie masks will be part of the art installation along Michigan Avenue, with one one “anniversary” mask State Street. Each mask features a different design worn by a former Wolves player. Of the 15, four were designed by former Wolves art director Don McClelland. “We are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary of playing at Allstate Arena,” said Wolves President Michael Gordon of the team’s home rink in Rosemont. He said the masks will also be on display at the arena as well as other Chicago-area locations throughout the season. Goalies Kari Lehtonen, Drew Macintyre, Ondrej Pavelec, Stephane Beauregard, Wendell Young, Jordan Binnington, Matt Climie and Pheonix Copley will be represented by the masks lining Michigan between Ontario Street and the Chicago River. They include tributes to Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Harry Caray and the Chicago skyline. “Each of these 15 goalie masks are impressive on their own, but together they create a truly memorable experience,” said Wolves co-founder and co-owner Don Levin. Already, five of the masks were featured during an Aug. 13 event in Chicago’s Pioneer Court, 401 N. Michigan Ave., followed by a private alumni event at the Chicago Sports Museum.

Michael,Gordon,1518,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/29/no-more-excuses-gold-coast-titans-must-now-succeed/,"TITANS Graham Annesley was incredibly optimistic when, having navigated five years of minefields and scandals the breadth of which no other club had endured in that time, he declared: ""I think the club is well positioned to be one of the real forces in the competition in the years ahead. ""And I’m talking as early as next year on the field,"" he added at his resignation media conference on Monday. ""The Titans will play in finals; they will win grand finals."" The NRL must have felt the same to have given the Titans life support for almost three years until longtime benefactor Darryl Kelly was joined by former chair Rebecca Frizelle, and their families, to take ownership of a club that critics from afar claimed should have been allowed to die a natural death. Annesley, the former NRL deputy to David Gallop who is returning in a similar capacity beside Todd Greenberg, feels deeply the Gold Coast is a league heartland that not only deserves sustained success but is now in the position to provide it. There is no doubt the Titans of October 2018 when he departs will have in place more attributes for ongoing success than the Titans of October 2013 when he arrived upon the invitation of former managing director and founder Michael Searle. Certainly better governance, transparency and – words Annesley and the board have often used – facilities and player pathways. Yet, for not just Titans fans but league followers all over, the time has come for the rhetoric about the club’s ""new future"" to be converted into one simple facet every club is judged on – on-field performance. Despite all the developments, the areas upon which clubs are generally judged remain static – performance and popularity. After all the hype that surrounded the Titans when Searle led them into the Telstra Premiership in 2007 and they had average crowds of 21,489 at Carrara, then the incredible achievement of making the finals in 2009-10, on the field the Titans have not moved forward in the past five years when it comes to results. They finished 9th in 2013, 13th in 2014 and 2015, eighth only eliminated from the finals due to NRL-confessed refereeing shockers in 2016, 15th in '17 and a best-possible 12th this season. Since 2010, the Titans are equal last when it comes to finals-seasons with just one appearance in eight years – equal with Wests Tigers and Parramatta. Membership is still the smallest in the NRL at around 13,000 while home crowds have remained respectable at around the same number, better than nearly a third of the competition. This is not to detract from the off-field progress made in tumultuous times but to state that – objectively – it’s now time for the proof to be in the pudding for all that hard work as the Titans enter, in 2019, into a defined new era. They will have a new CEO in place of Annesley, a second-year coach in Garth Brennan, an experienced and highly respected executive chairman in Dennis Watt in his second season, as is the case with head of football Phil Moss. Facilities at Parkwood are second to none in the NRL, their stadium at Robina is as good as any other, and they enjoy committed and resilient owners who are in for the long haul. And next year’s roster compares to those from their finals seasons when Mat Rogers, Scott Prince, Luke Bailey, Preston Campbell, Anthony Laffranchi, Ashley Harrison, Greg Bird, Clinton Toopi and Brad Meyers were firing. In 2019 they have three incumbent State of Origin players in Jarrod Wallace, Jai Arrow and Tyrone Peachey, a NSW squad member in Ryan James, an Australian representative in Shannon Boyd, Kiwi stalwart and ex-Storm premiership winner Kevin Proctor, a halfback earning near the million-dollar mark in Ash Taylor and one of the finds of 2018 in AJ Brimson. The building blocks are in place. There is a place for the Gold Coast in the NRL despite what ill-informed detractors say. It is the country’s sixth largest city, has over 6000 players in its catchment area to draw from and a first-class organisation. And they deserve credit in having the fundamentals right after what they have had to endure: Kelly’s money saved them from bankruptcy before Searle walked with a hand behind his back in August 2014, with coach John Cartwright accompanying him, then the drugs scandal of 2015 that led to six players no longer at the club charged by the Crime and Corruption Commission. After the financial disaster of a good idea turned bad transaction that was the Centre of Excellence, the Titans walked away from exorbitant rent as a tenant of the building it built and was a nomad for two seasons, training out of porta-cabins at The Southport School then the carpark of Burleigh Bears Leagues Club. The NRL was forced to bail out the club in the wake of the drugs scandal, then came the infamous reneging of Daly Cherry-Evans who was replaced as a marquee signing by Jarryd Hayne in a move that proved an on-field failure. Add the acrimonious sacking of coach Neil Henry. All the while Annesley bravely and forthrightly fronted heated media conference after conference, never seemingly flinching. It is an attribute that will be well served in his new NRL role. Balancing that is the 10-year free lease of the facilities at the well-developed Parkwood golf course which is an outstanding deal. The dud stadium deal with Stadiums Queensland has been overcome and good local players who were once easy prey for rival NRL clubs have headed home, and new local talent developed. Henry was at the forefront of that in enticing Wallace, Keegan Hipgrave, Proctor and Arrow while Brennan has followed in attracting Michael Gordon and Jai Whitbread and also fast-tracking the development of Brimson, Moeaki Fotuaika and Phil Sami. ""Off the field we are in as good a shape as we have ever been,” Annesley said. ""Financially we are sound, we have great corporate governance, great owners, an excellent playing roster that will be further strengthened next year. We have a new young coach who is determined to see the club succeed. ""We have done a lot of hard yards at the Titans and I think it’s time for someone to come in here with fresh ideas. ""The club is here, it’s strong and it has survived. It is going to thrive in the future and it is thriving right now. ""The club was in all sorts of difficulties when I got here. I came in with my eyes open. The situation was very dire, this club could have folded, and it was only the support of people around me made sure it didn’t happen. ""We will go as close as we ever have of breaking even after losses of $3 million-plus for several years."" It’s all good news. However, Annesley won’t be the only one who will be watching expectantly from afar to see whether (or let’s hope when) all that has been put in place at the ""new Titans"" comes to the forecast fruition in the one place they will be most judged on – the competition ladder.

Diamond – once branded the unacceptable face of banking due to his sky-high pay packets – could be hit by a rebellion over his role as chairman at Atlas Mara’s annual meeting tomorrow. Disgraced: Bob Diamond was once branded the unacceptable face of banking due to his sky-high pay packets Shareholder advice groups Glass Lewis and ISS claim he is not independent enough for the job because he co-founded the firm.

By 5 p.m. Tuesday, the deadline to file for office, most City Council hopefuls had collected the 150 signatures they needed to qualify for the November ballot. Mayoral candidates are security guard Charles Webster Baer, disability rights advocate Brian Douglass, attorney Michael R. Hughes, photographer Joshua Langlais, current City Councilor and software company owner Bill Moseley and current City Councilor Sally Russell, who has worked in marketing and for nonprofits and has served as Bend’s mayor pro tem since 2017. Candidates for position 5, now held by Councilor Nathan Boddie, are Andrew Davis, director of student life at Central Oregon Community College; Gena Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association; and Victor Johnson, a musician and preschool music teacher. Current City Councilor and Wabi Sabi owner Barb Campbell, Navy veteran and frequent candidate Ron “Rondo” Boozell and stay-at-home mother Sarah McCormick are running for position 6, now held by Mayor Casey Roats. Boozell was arrested last week for failing to pay child support and is expected to remain in jail through the election, which will be held on Nov. 6. While the positions are nonpartisan, the Deschutes County Democratic Party already has endorsed Russell, Goodman-Campbell and Campbell, and the Central Oregon Federated Republican Women have claimed Moseley, Davis and McCormick as their candidates.

More info: Privacy Policy WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - US intelligence officials who told the New York Times they had high-level intelligence sources in the Kremlin were probably bluffing to bolster their discredited allegations about Russia interfering in the 2016 US elections, retired CIA case officer Philip Giraldi told Sputnik. ""Senior US intelligence officers would never so casually and publicly admit they had high-level intelligence sources in the Kremlin,"" Giraldi said on Monday. ""That is the most elementary of procedures."" The New York Times reported on Friday, citing unnamed US intelligence officials, that US sources in the Kremlin who had warned about Russian intervention in the US 2016 presidential election were now remaining silent about any possible Russian plans to intervene in the upcoming congressional elections in November. ""This New York Times exclusive reads like a very bad TV or comic book plot,"" he said. The story appeared to be an effort to lend credence to the repeated but entirely unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had interfered in the US 2016 election, Giraldi noted. ""Getting such a lie out through the New York Times to the American public may also be an attempt to add credence to the fact that no evidence existed to support the allegations that Russia ever ordered or attempted to affect the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election at all,"" Giraldi said. The New York Times article was filled with inaccuracies and outright lies, Giraldi stated. ""The New York Times report is filled with lies and half-truths. In this it is reminiscent of the notorious Judith Miller and Michael Gordon article that was part of the propaganda build up and justification for war with Iraq in 2003,"" he said. ""It is far more likely that US intelligence officials are trying to pull off a double bluff and convince the Russians that they have agents there in order to set off a fruitless and distracting counter-intelligence search,"" he said. Also, contrary to insinuations in the New York Times article, there was no evidence to indicate that Russia was trying to kill US sources or intelligence agents, Giraldi added. READ MORE: Moscow Slams Reports of Re-Establishment of Anti-Russia Spy Body in US ""Nor is there any evidence at all that President Putin or the Russian government is killing spies. The individual case of Sergei Skripal is filled with unresolved doubts and questions and there is no hard evidence at all to blame it on Moscow,"" he said. Philip Giraldi is executive director of the Council for the National Interest, a group that advocates more even-handed US government policies in the Middle East.

Bill,Alfond,1513,http://www.colby.edu/news/2018/08/27/colby-opens-mixed-use-residential-and-retail-facility-on-main-street-in-downtown-waterville/,"August 27, 2018 The 100,000-square-foot complex is the first College-owned residence downtown since Colby’s move to Mayflower Hill in the mid-20th century Marking an important moment in the history of Colby College and the City of Waterville, the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, housing 200 students, faculty, and staff, opened this month in downtown Waterville. Part of a broader revitalization effort undertaken by the College, city leaders, and local businesspeople and community organizations, the complex is bringing energy to downtown and will ultimately deepen the connection between the Colby community and the broader Waterville community. Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons as night falls over Waterville. Photo: Copyright Trent Bell Photography. “This project grabbed my interest because I was a Waterville boy, and I have always wanted to see Colby and Waterville be more closely tied together,” said Trustee Bill Alfond ’72 who, along with his wife, Joan, made a leadership gift toward the effort. “I see this as a bridge between two things I love—the College and the city.” The student residential experience at Alfond Commons will be centered around a robust civic engagement program that ties the students’ academic pursuits to their work with local organizations. Through their research, coursework, and service, students will participate in efforts of nonprofits and other organizations and contribute expertise and analysis to help the community better understand a range of issues and how to solve complex challenges. “The opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons marks a pivotal moment for Colby and the city it has proudly called home for two centuries,” said President David A. Greene. “This development is a critical step in physically reconnecting the city and the College and helping to support a vibrant Main Street for businesses, residents, and visitors.” Student lounges in the Alfond Commons allow for conversations and space to study. Photo: Copyright Trent Bell Photography Civic Engagement Re-envisioned With the opening of the Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons, Colby is implementing a new and innovative program for civic engagement and community partnerships. Students residing in the complex are required to participate in civic engagement activity that will connect them to community organizations, enhancing their learning and contributing to the important work of these groups. “We are developing a set of experiences that support our local partners while at the same time preparing our students to be active participants who will create positive change in the communities,” said Dean of the College Karlene Burrell-McRae ’94, who oversees the efforts. “Our hope is that this program can become a national model for civic engagement.” Commitment to Downtown Increasing residential density on Main Street has been a central element of a broad strategy to make Waterville a lively, welcoming place for residents and visitors. In the past three years, Colby has renovated a historic bank building that now houses the global tech company CGI, as well as Portland Pie Co. on the retail level. Colby is currently developing plans for a hotel that will be located at the other end of Main Street and bring more visitors to downtown, and Colby has partnered with Waterville Creates! on a center for contemporary art and film, also on Main Street. “A primary goal of our downtown efforts has been to catalyze outside investment and commercial growth, bringing energy and a sustainable economic model to the city,” said Vice President of Planning Brian Clark. “We expect the opening to add to the incredible momentum we are seeing in Waterville, with new businesses opening, new jobs coming to the city, and overall growth in population and real estate activity.” The Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons is located on the site of a former parking lot, where buildings were demolished during urban renewal. It marks the first new construction on the downtown section of Main Street in more than 50 years. Supporting Community and Commerce The first level of the complex was designed to support community organizations as well as businesses that will complement the existing mix on Main Street and benefit from being located in brand-new retail spaces with up-to-date infrastructure. Camden National Bank will be moving into the southeast corner of the building this fall. Colby’s investments in downtown, which currently total $65 million, have begun to catalyze additional activity. In the past year the downtown area has seen more real estate transactions than in several previous years combined, which is resulting in both new jobs and an increased property tax base. Building Details The living room in one of the 52 student apartments in Alfond Commons. The Bill & Joan Alfond Main Street Commons includes 52 student apartments and eight faculty/staff apartments. Student apartments either include four or six single-occupancy bedrooms and two bathrooms, a living area, and a kitchen to allow students to prepare their own meals. The complex includes academic and study spaces, including a classroom on the second floor and a reading room on the fifth floor, two two-story social lounges for students, two laundry rooms, a small fitness room, and a yoga/wellness studio. On the ground level, the Chace Community Forum provides a large meeting and event space that will be available to community partners at no charge. The Waterville City Council and planning board will also hold their meetings in the new space. Camden National Bank will move into the building this fall, and other retail tenants are currently being identified. A Colby-owned parking lot on Appleton Street will be the primary parking for students, and residents are encouraged to park on campus and use the continuously running shuttle to and from Mayflower Hill. Student residents of Alfond Commons are in their junior and senior years and were identified based on their commitment to civic engagement. The majority of students will move into the building Sept. 3 (Labor Day). A ribbon cutting will take place Sept. 6 at 10 a.m., followed by a reception and student-led tours.

Steve,Cummings,1511,http://www.teamsa.co.za/solid-la-vuelta-start-for-africas-di-data-team/,"African outfit Team Dimension Data for Qhubeka got their La Vuelta cycle tour up and running in Spain on Saturday. The first stage of La Vuelta was won by Rohan Dennis (BMC Racing Team), who clocked the fastest time in the 8km individual time trial. In second place was Michal Kwiatkowski (Team Sky) followed by Victor Campenaerts (Lotto Soudal). It was a sunny afternoon spent on a flat and fast course, which only had a slight kick 5km in. Steve Cummings produced a strong ride for Dimension Data to finish in 10min 08sec, 29 seconds off the winning time and South Africa’s Ryan Gibbons also clocked a respectable time of 10:14. Ben King was the team’s best rider of the day, though, placing 24th on the stage and finishing with a time of 10:08, just milliseconds ahead of Cummings. Ninth on the overall team classification was a respectable performance by the African team on today’s specialist course. Dennis, with his time of 9:39, pulled on the first red leader’s jersey of the race, and will start Sunday’s second stage with a six-second buffer over Kwiatkowski.

Ensemble Offspring's Claire Edwardes.Credit:Heidrun Lohr In the main auditorium, the Elision Ensemble presented Richard Barrett's world-line, its title drawn from a term in physics that describes the path of an object in four-dimensional space-time. The work mixed slabs of distorted sound from lap guitar, with fractured sonic fabrics from piccolo trumpet, percussion, electronics and flugelhorn that seem continuously to explode away from the frames of reference one uses to bring order to things. Barrett's music is always difficult to parse, which is perhaps what gives it its intriguing interest. Preceding this was a lap-guitar work by Aaron Cassidy in the ""howl"" tradition of Ginsberg and Hendrix and a quiet solo violin piece by Liza Lim titled The Su Song Star Map. Ensemble Offspring dedicated its contribution to the music of Steve Reich starting with Radio Rewrite, a reworking of two songs by Radiohead using Reich's rhythmic phasing techniques. They concluded with a taut, concentrated performance of Reich's major work Double Sextet, with an arrangement by Claire Edwardes for xylophone and vibraphone (with pre-recorded tracks) of the same composer's Vermont Counterpoint. The main auditorium component of the festival concluded with the hyperactive, stylistically eclectic music of New York's Bang on a Can All-Stars. David Lang's Cheating, Lying, Stealing was morbidly repetitive, not to mention topical, while Michael Gordon's Gene Takes a Drink took a Baroque-style chordal arpeggiation on the cello, and spread it out stylishly to other instruments. Melbourne-born J.G Thurlwell's Anabiosis was a wild frenetic ride, like a machine out of control, while Julia Walton's Believing pitted noisy, grungy accompaniment and virtuosic xylophone playing against an urgently expressive solo cello line. After Philip Glass' Closing, Steven Martland's Horses of Instruction characterised the aesthetic of the group and the event by, in clarinettist Ken Thomson's words, grabbing influences from different places and taking control, to create a work of driven energy and outrageous quirkiness. The above is but a sample of the adventures of a day. May there be many more. Our weekly podcast giving you insight into the stories that drive the nation. Listen now Copyright © 2018

(Photo: Michael Gordon) (JAMAICA OBSERVER) – St Andrew South Member of Parliament (MP) Mark Golding says he is arranging with Crime Stop for a $500,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the culprit(s) in the murder of 14-year-old Yetanya Francis in the constituency between Thursday night and Friday morning. Golding made the disclosure on social media site Facebook yesterday, stating that he would provide more details on the reward soon. The teenaged girl, who resided in Trench Town and attended the Kingston Technical High School, reportedly left home to purchase food about 8’o clock Thursday night but did not return home. Her nude body was found partially burnt in the said community the next morning. According to reports, there were signs of rape and strangulation. Yetanya’s killing revived memories of the brutal slaying of 17-year-old Mickolle Moulton in the neighbouring community of Arnett Gardens on August 6 last year. Mickolle, who was a Meadowbrook High School student, and her 12-year-old sister were shot in their bedroom by someone who pointed a gun through a window. Your email address will not be published.

Andrew,Davis,1508,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/SAVOR-Locanda-The-Dearborn/63877.html,"How low-key is Locanda? It's actually housed inside a Residence Inn ( although it's a separate space within that establishment ). However, this place is a little treasure. The restaurant is the brainchild of chef Antoine Cedicci, who was behind the Italian spots Pane Caldo ( famed for its window-display seating of one table while the rest of the spot seemed virtually secluded ) and Trattoria Ultimo. Locanda specializes in seasonal dishes, rotating its menu weekly in addition to offering daily specials. Starters include items such as parma-and-duck prosciutto and sautÃ©ed fresh wild mushrooms. The tuna terrine ( with mesclun and lemon-oil vinaigrette ) was creamy without a fishy taste; the beets ( roasted in sea salt, and served with burrata and honey-lime vinaigrette ) were tasty and refreshing; and the parmesan ravioli were simply delightful, accented with crispy prosciutto and corn sauce. Of course, Locanda has pasta dishesand the king-crab ravioli in saffron-fennel sauce was one of the most memorable items I had eaten in ages. ( Moreover, it's pretty affordable, at $18. ) Thankfully, there aren't too many dishes ( to spare the indecisive ), but they include gnocchi with braised beef short rib ( with a gluten-free option ), butternut-squash tortellini and fruitti di mare ( assorted seafood with squid-ink tonnarelli and light tomato sauce ). Entrees offer some variety. The roasted duck breast, with cherries, was expertly done. However, there are also options like chicken with wild mushrooms; and grilled lamb chops, with rosemary and mustard sauce. Lastly, desserts should definitely be sampled. The justifiably named ""magic cake"" is a three-layered item based in vanillabut the fig-and-goat cheese gelato just didn't do it for me, ""forcing"" me to return to the cake. #FirstWorldProblems ( You can also try the peach tart, flourless cake and tiramisu. ) By the way, ""locanda"" means ""inn,"" in Italian. Antoine said he always wanted to open his own hotel, and Locanda is his ""inn"" where he felt he could take care of guests, offering great food and accommodations. Mission accomplished. The Dearborn ( update ) I've visited The Dearborn ( 145 N. Dearborn St.; www.thedearborntavern.com/ ) a few times over the last couple years ( for business and/or pleasure )and I'm happy to report that the quality of the Block 37 spot's cuisine has not flagged one bit. I witnessed this during a recent lunchtime visit as co-owners Amy and Clodagh Lawless, along with Chef Aaron Cuschieri, continue to serve top-quality food and drinks. ( The Loop spot opened in June 2016. ) I loved the housemade parmesan gnocchi ( served with morel mushrooms, snow peas, white and green asparagus, heirloom cherry tomatoes, spinach, edamame emulsion and grana padano ) as well as the kicky Midwest fried chicken ( with a maple mustard glaze and hot sauce ). However, there are so many other fun items on the menu, ranging from the Not Billy's Scotch Egg ( with spicy pork sausage ) to the Veggie Dagwood to the grilled pear-and-Gruyere sandwich. BTW, The Dearborn is planning a Prohibition-themed party for the release of its Dearborn Gin, in collaboration with North Shore Distillery's husband-wife team Derek and Sonja Kassebaum. The eventon Monday, Sept. 10, at 5 p.m.will feature one complimentary cocktail for guests showcasing the custom spirit, plus party bites by Cuschieri. Local jazz a the )ensemble Brooklyn Britches and The Whispers will perform live, and you will take home custom Dearborn shot glasses, while supplies last. ( Be sure to RSVP. ) Note: Restaurant profiles/events are based on invitations arranged from restaurants and/or firms.
