Sara,Burns,1507,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/brookside-drive-barbecue-following-fredericton-shooting-1.4799189,"Hundreds of people showed up to the courtyard of the 237 Brookside Drive apartment complex in Fredericton to show community strength and raise money for the Canadian Red Cross in the wake of the deadly shooting two weeks ago. John Stewart, who helped organize the event, said there was hardly any food left by the time the barbecue ended on Saturday afternoon. ""We're just giving back to the community, we're taking back the community, and we're not going to look back,"" he said. Since the shooting that killed two civilians, Donnie Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, and two members of the Fredericton Police Force, Robb Costello, 45, and Sara Burns, 43, outside the apartment buildings, Stewart said the community has really come together. He was in his apartment during the shooting, and said talking to his neighbours has really helped him deal with what happened. Before Stewart would just wave or say hi to a neighbour, but now he knows people by name and can have a conversation with them. ""The night we were allowed to come back home, there was a few people who said you know I'm never walking through that area again, and that night they were out there talking, laughing, moving on,"" said Stewart. Clarke Greene was also in the building at the time of the shooting. He used to live in an apartment there, and was back hanging out with a friend on Aug. 10. Greene said having a fun event in the apartment complex courtyard helps take back the space in people's minds. ""This gets word out to the city that despite the fact that we undergone a recent tragedy, we're not allowing it to drag us down. We are pushing forward with our lives,"" said Greene. ""When events like this happen it's important to stand together. It's important to be arm in arm, hand in hand."" A few of the police officers who responded to the call on Aug. 10 showed up for the barbecue and received an emotional round of applause from the people there, who thanked them for their service. Amid listening to music, eating hot dogs and playing lawn games, people stopped by at the Red Cross table to donate money. Yves Paradis has been a volunteer with the Red Cross for six years and helped people who had to evacuate from their homes. ""This is the first time in six years that I've seen an event this well attended,"" said Paradis. ""I know it's been a big effect on the community but wow. That's all I can say is wow."" Stewart said he estimated they raised over $1,000 for the Red Cross at the barbecue, between cheques and cash people dropped into the donation bucket. ""When we were evacuated and told we couldn't go home they were right there,"" he said. ""We want to help somebody next time they are in the need like we were.""

Imports and exports were both up for the year to July, but the deficit widened because imports rose more, Statistics NZ international statistics manager Tehseen Islam said. Annual imports for the year to July were $60.7 billion, up $6.9 billion or 13% from the previous year, while annual exports were $56.2 billion, up $5.7 billion. ""The rise in imports in the past year reflect large rises in both imports of petroleum and products, and in mechanical machinery and equipment."" Exports of dairy and meat products led the exports rise. The deficit for July was $143 million, narrower than market analysts’ picks of deficits between $400 million and $500 million. ASB senior economist Mark Smith said the annual $4.44 billion deficit saw imports grow 13%, which outstripped the export growth of 11%. ""Looking at the year ahead, we expect the annual trade deficit to narrow gradually,"" Mr Smith said. The low import figures appeared to be largely attributable to the Marsden Point shutdown for maintenance, with oil import values down 8.2%, seasonally adjusted, on the month. ""Despite this, higher prices for crude oil and the weaker New Zealand dollar contributed to imports of petroleum and products hitting $6.5 billion for the July 2018 year, a 30% increase on the year prior,"" he said. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said New Zealand’s trade deficit for July of $143 million was better than expected but was partly offset by a downward revision for June. Seasonally adjusted exports jumped 6.3% in July, with a sharp rise in volumes across most commodities. This suggests the strength in July may have been a matter of timing, with more shipments than usual during the month. ""There was also a strong lift in dairy export prices for the month, but recent dairy auctions indicate that this will soon reverse,"" Mr Gordon said. simon.hartley@odt.co.nz

Michael,Gordon,1506,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/27/hawks-and-eagles-owe-afl-finals-appearances-to-coaching-excellence,"Hawthorn appear immune to rebuilding, while the Eagles have overcome serious adversity Craig Little Sun 26 Aug 2018 14.00 EDT Last modified on Sun 26 Aug 2018 15.25 EDT Let us now praise Alastair Clarkson and Adam Simpson. Let us start with Clarkson. Football, like every sport, has its what-ifs, its sliding doors if you will. After a 43-point loss to the Essendon in round six back in 2010, a fuming Jeff Kennett tramped into the Hawthorn rooms to berate his coaches. As detailed in the late Michael Gordon’s Playing to Win, Kennett drew a rough, upside-down pyramid on the whiteboard in the pre-match briefing room, listing the coach, CEO and himself at the bottom. “It’s not about the president and it’s not about the board and it’s not about the coaches or even the players,” Kennett roared, before pointing to the top of the inverse pyramid. “We’re here for these people!” When the dressing-down was done, Clarkson was asked if what Kennett had drawn on the whiteboard was a box. “I think it was a coffin,” was the reply. What if Kennett had sacked Clarkson in 2010? Or in April last year, when one of Australia’s most excitable drummer boys for the scorched earth policy called for a complete rebuild? More than once has Kennett questioned Clarkson’s capacity to coach the Hawks, but through it all, Clarkson has been profoundly unflappable and quiet in the way those you want to have beside you if a brawl starts going down are quiet. It’s almost as if he and Kennett were on a see-saw, the ballast of the President’s barbs lifting Clarkson to more success. And so it was late last week, when much of the country’s political journalists were luxuriating in the lurid details of another leadership spill in Canberra, as Kennett took the opportunity to stoke the flames of an altogether different rivalry when speaking about former Hawk Lance Franklin on Nova. “I’ve known Lance for many, many years, he’s a great guy and he’s grown tremendously over the years, but he’s never played well against Hawthorn,” said Kennett. “He’s never played well.” For Clarkson, Kennet’s timing was again less than ideal coming just days before Hawthorn and Sydney played each other for a spot in the top four. “It was just a little bit like our footy club, the gold is pretty good but the brown is a little bit dark sometimes,” Clarkson said. “I think it’s all part of the intrigue of the game. I don’t think he [Franklin] needs any motivation to play against the Hawks.” As it turned out, it wasn’t a concern as Franklin was a late withdrawal with a groin injury, which isn’t to say that Clarkson didn’t have anything to worry about. Sydney had the run of play for the first half, and early in the last quarter led by two goals. But the Hawks kicked the last three goals of the game to secure the double chance for the seventh time in eight years and will play Richmond in a final for the first time since, well… ever. Clarkson now finds himself in charge of a team that is composed and precise, with terrific players across every line. But when asked to explain Hawthorn’s greatest strength, former premiership player and Fox Footy analysit David King said: “It’s not Isaac Smith, Jaeger O’Meara or even Luke Breust. It is sheer tactical brilliance.” Hawthorn’s current five-year strategic plan that takes in 2018-2022 is titled “Dare to Be Different”, but for the Hawks, it’s largely same as it ever was. While the fortunes of most football teams are cyclical, the evidence indicates that last year may simply have been a caesura in another successful Hawthorn era. As for the top of Kennett’s inverted pyramid-slash-coffin: show me a fan of the Hawthorn Football Club and I’d grant that I was looking at someone who enjoys football with the pure delight of a child. And now of Adam Simpson, and the delight of coaching the Eagles to second spot on the ladder (and two home finals) despite losing Nic Naitanui to a knee reconstruction, Josh Kennedy to a shin injury and Andrew Gaff to a moment of madness. “We started the year really well, went through a bit of adversity in the back half – obviously losing some games and losing Nic [Naitanui], and then the whole Gaff incident was difficult,” said Simpson who was a senior assistant to Clarkson at Hawthorn. “There seems to be a really good spirit amongst the club, and the players are driving that.” Certainly, the players have performed above anyone’s expectations. There were no footballing Cassandras over summer saying beware the Eagles, despite their sixth-place finish in 2017. Like Clarkson, there is something blunt about Simpson that tells you not to touch anything without his permission, particularly the character of his team. This was evidenced when broadcaster Basil Zempilas asked him if the Eagles had an “arrogance issue” and if his players were able to “do what they want to do” in the wake of the Andrew Gaff incident. “I think you’re getting caught up in the media storm mate, so I think we’ll leave it at that,” said Simpson. The prevailing take-no-shit style of Simpson befits one of the more no-nonsense teams in the AFL, led by the 100-gamer Jeremy McGovern who on Sunday afternoon took his 77th intercept mark of the season, breaking the AFL record. Up front, the Eagles are no less arresting, with Jack Darling kicking four goals on Sunday, the exciting Liam Ryan three and Simpson all but confirming that full-forward Kennedy will be available for the qualifying final against Collingwood. Oh, and then there’s Nathan Buckley…

Michael,Gordon,1499,https://www.greenwichtime.com/local/article/Greenwich-hires-parking-consultant-13181059.php,"By Ken Borsuk GREENWICH — The town has announced an independent consultant is coming in to take a look at the Parking Services Department. The hire has been expected since former Parking Services Director Rita Azrelyant’s position was eliminated last November. First Selectman Peter Tesei said then a consultant would be brought in. SP Plus Corporation, which is based out of Chicago, submitted the winning bid and is under contract with the town for $92,500 in the first year. The contract includes language allowing it to be renewed annually for a total of five years. SJ Plus’ team, led by its Vice President for Municipal Services Robert Kamper, will be “reviewing current operations, processes, policies and staff assignments to inform the development of an updated, efficient plan of operations, and to assist with the implementation of upgraded technology and equipment to enhance services,” according to a statement from town officials. “It was determined that SP Plus presented a creative, cost-effective solution that is in the best interest of the town,” Tesei said in a Friday press release announcing the hire. The firm already has begun working with the town administrator, community members and staff in the Parking Services Department, according to town officials. The department has been under great scrutiny since the April 2017 arrest of Parking Services account clerk Michael Gordon. Gordon was charged with multiple crimes after what police called “an elaborate series of fraudulent transactions.” Since then several changes have been made, including to cash handling practices in the department, providing more oversight. Several consultant’s reports have pointed out problems in the department and called for solutions. “We’re moving to a much more secure operational department that will employ best financial and operational practices for the town,” Tesei said earlier this month. “Processes are now in place to avert the theft of town resources.” In March, Azrelyant filed suit in state Superior Court saying the town “acted with reckless disregard” in firing her. Azrelyant claims in her suit she was retaliated against by Tesei and Town Administrator Ben Branyan for speaking out against problems she saw in the department, charges the officials have called unsubstantiated and “patently false.” kborsuk@greenwichtime.com

Jamie,Forese,1498,https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/finance-leaders-say-ai-will-soon-replace-half-of-banking-sectors-jobs/,"A former Barclays chief executive has joined the Bank of England’s chief economist, Citigroup’s investment chief and other leading bankers in predicting that the sector could soon lose swathes of jobs to technology. Customer services, middle and back office roles − making up 50% of all jobs in the sector − are in line to be replaced entirely by computers, Antony Jenkins has claimed, adding that the workforce would have to become more entrepreneurial. PwC report: AI will create more jobs than it replaces by 2037 AI will be business-critical in five years Why robots should ‘report’ to HR He told the BBC: “We’ve already seen something like 25% of branches close between 2011 and 2015; my expectation is at least another 50% of branches will close over the next five to 10 years. Jenkins, now the chief executive of banking and technologist firm 10x, said: “Similarly I think we’ll see something like a 50% or even greater reduction in the people employed in the industry.” The big four banks (Barclays, Lloyds, RBS and HSBC) currently operate 4,500 branches in the UK, having axed 4,000 in the past decade. If Jenkins’ prediction comes to fruition the UK would, within 10 years, be left with fewer than 2,500 branches of the big four. Also this week the Bank of England’s chief economist Andy Haldane forecast on the BBC Today programme that a “fourth industrial revolution” of technological change would lead to a “hollowing” out of the jobs market and may see rising inequality, social tension and many people entering poverty. We needed to learn the lessons of past industrial revolutions that the country was unprepared for, he added. Haldane said: “That hollowing out is going to be potentially on a much greater scale in the future, when we have machines both thinking and doing − replacing both the cognitive and the technical skills of humans.” It was vital, he said, that people were given the training to take advantage of the new jobs that would become available as part of a “new technological wave”. If the country was not to suffer a vast amount of “technological unemployment” jobs focusing on face-to-face interaction and negotiation would need to be created. Citigroup’s investment bank president Jamie Forese this week told the Financial Times that the bank would shed up to half of its technology and investment staff in the next five years. He said: “We’ve got 20,000 operational roles. Over the next five years could you make it 10,000?” Sales and research could be key areas where banks would continue to hire people, Forese forecast, but: “What people are doing, the type of work being done by the human rather than the machine will change.” Many straightforward roles, such as data-entry in banking, would be replaced by automation. John Cryan, former CEO of Deutsche Bank told a conference in Frankfurt last September: “In our banks we have people behaving like robots doing mechanical things − tomorrow we’re going to have robots behaving like people,” he said. “We have to find new ways of employing people and maybe people need to find new ways of spending their time … The truthful answer is we won’t need as many people.” Tara O’Sullivan, chief marketing officer at corporate learning provider Skillsoft, told Personnel Today that the technological revolution would disproportionately affect roles more often carried out by women: “It will be women who bear the brunt of the implementation of these technologies.” She said that estimates by the US-based Institute for Spatial Economic Analysis, revealed that twice as many women as men would lose their jobs because women are typically working in areas that are most likely to be automated. “We’re talking jobs like cashiers, office and administrative roles,” she said. O’Sullivan said she’d like employers to recognise it was their responsibility “to reskill and upskill their employees. We cannot allow millions of women to be laid off without offering an alternate career. We need to provide employees with access to learning which they take can take at their own pace, where and when it suits them, and offer them various options of how to learn.” Comment Name (required) Email (will not be published) (required) Website Artificial intelligence (AI) will create as many jobs as it displaces over the next 20 years, but there will be...

You can also post comments, and manage your email subscription. Lost your password? Only one active session is allowed per subscriber. You don't have an account? Sign Up Five days after it held internal party elections, the People’s National Congress Reform (PNCR) last night revealed its 15-member Central Executive Committee with nearly half of the old members replaced and Christopher Jones coming out on top. The executive sees seven new members and they are: Thandi Mc Allister, Gary Best, Richard Van West-Charles, Dr Karen Cummings, Basil Blackman, Edward Collins and Aubrey Norton. Returning are Jones, Winston Felix, Amna Ally, Clement Corlette, Cheryl Sampson, Mortimer Mingo, Jennifer Ferreira-Dougall and Genevieve Allen. The table below shows the last serving executive (left) and the recently elected members and the votes obtained in last Saturday’s elections. After midnight on Sunday, Minister of Public Health and former Vice Chairman Volda Lawrence was announced winner of a three-person race for the post of Chairman of the party. She had secured 346 votes against Minister of State Joseph Harmon’s 287 and Minister of Legal Affairs Basil Williams’ 183 votes. Annette Ferguson secured the position as first Vice Chairman and Dr. George Norton second Vice Chairman. Unopposed, President David Granger and Minister of Communities Ronald Bulkan returned to the positions of Leader and treasurer, respectively. The List of Executives comes as a shock to some Alliance for Change members who told this newspaper that they believed that although Van West Charles was not an active member of their party, they believed he was a supporter. One official of the AFC said that he only learned of the Guyana Water Inc Head’s position in the PNCR when he heard over the weekend that he had accepted a nomination. During the APNU+AFC elections campaign in 2011, Van-West Charles had announced that he was joining the Alliance for Change. “After those elections he was not an active member but I did not know that he had gone back to the PNC. Do I think he should have formally informed us? Not really but it still is shocking the manner in which it was all revealed,” the AFC official said. Norton and Best were presidential advisers on youth empowerment and environment respectively but late last year President Granger announced that their contracts would not be renewed and they would be offered “executive positons”. Norton is now Director of Migration at the Ministry of the Presidency’s Department of Citizenship and Immigration. It is unclear what role, if any, Best plays in the current administration. However, he is present at many public forums on oil and gas and the environment. Dr. Karen Cummings is the Minister within the Ministry of Public Health. A Director of Go-Invest, Basil Blackman has been a longtime member of the PNCR and also represents diaspora interests. No stranger to the party is Thandi Mc Allister, who has been serving as a representative for the youth arm of the PNCR for many years. She has been vocal about issues pertaining to youth and their development. Meanwhile, Public Relations Officer of the party Kim Chung told this newspaper that some persons from the former CEC declined nomination. City Mayor Patricia Chase-Green is one of those not on this year’s list. A FREE roundup of top Guyana news stories, photos and more you might otherwise miss. Delivered every morning.

John,O'Neil,1495,https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Alt-Pop-Band-Exnations-Glow-On-Debut-Ep-Tiny-Sound-In-The-Dark-20180824,"Alternative pop trio EXNATIONS bring light to a darkness on their debut EP ""Tiny Sound In The Dark,"" out TODAY. The band, comprised of Sal Mastrocola, Taylor Hughes, and John O'Neill, combines two obviously opposite emotions in their music and meshes them together to create a relatable (and danceable) sound. Although self-defined as a 'sad' band, their color palette remains pastel, splashing hues of pale pink and aquamarine throughout their graphics, seemingly representing the dance-able side to their music (and exploring the clear contrast between both emotions). Dream-like, somewhat hazy, synthy; ""Tiny Sound In The Dark"" is a more-than-promising debut release, laced with sparkle and anticipation. The elements of pop music are clear, but what's even more fascinating about EXNATIONS is the anthemic sense of empowerment the trio produces on their first effort. To promote the EP release, EXNATIONS has a string of four EP release shows this month to promote ""Tiny Sound In the Dark,"" sponsored by idobi radio's Spinning Thoughts. About the release of ""Tiny Sound In The Dark"", the band states: eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'broadwayworld_com-under_first_paragraph','ezslot_0'])); ""Tiny Sound in the Dark is the most immediate collection of songs I've ever had a hand in. The band gave ourselves permission to lean into the unabashed energy and aesthetic of our favorite pop music in a way that still feels true to where we came from. As a guy who has been in punk and emo bands for my whole life, the sounds, textures, and themes we explored on this record brought such a jolt of new energy and enthusiasm to my songwriting process. This EP is the first of many permutations of that enthusiasm and love. We hope you love it"" EXNATIONS are a sad yet danceable brand of guitar-flecked synth pop out of Brooklyn, NY and Baltimore, MD. The group consists of members Sal Mastrocola(vocals/guitar/synth), Taylor Hughes (drums/synth) and John O'Neil(bass).

Joel,Cutler,1494,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180824/reynoldsburg-17-upper-arlington-14,"Isaiah Thomas had maybe 30 seconds late in the fourth quarter Aug. 24 to figure out what had gone wrong as the Upper Arlington receiver he was covering caught a 39-yard pass to keep a wild game alive. Thomas, a junior cornerback for the Reynoldsburg High School football team, quickly atoned, intercepting Golden Bears quarterback Sammy Sass inside the Raiders’ 20-yard line to foil a last-ditch UA comeback and preserve a 17-14 season-opening win. “(UA’s Steven Bair) just beat me the first time and I just had to get back into coverage. I’d been looking back into the backfield too much,” Thomas said. “On the second play, I knew they were going to try me again so I had to get back deep. They picked on me the first time. I just had to go up and get the ball.” Purdue-bound receiver Mershawn Rice’s seven catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns led Reynoldsburg in an early showdown between Division I, Region 2 playoff hopefuls. Rice caught a 57-yard touchdown pass from Michael Whatley on the second play of the second quarter, moments after Sass’ 21-yard touchdown pass to Bair gave UA a 7-0 lead. Rice also caught a 53-yard score late in the third quarter to give the Raiders the lead for good. “We made a lot of mistakes but we overcame them. Upper Arlington gave us all we could handle,” Reynoldsburg coach Buddy White said. “If they didn’t have a safety back, Mershawn could get behind the defense and he was bigger than the corners who were covering him. We felt like we had an advantage there and we took it.” UA did not get untracked offensively until the fourth quarter. The Bears punted eight times in their first nine possessions, but put together two solid drives late to make it a game. Sass scored from 2 yards out with 4:30 to go to make it 17-14, and UA began its final drive at its own 19. The 39-yard pass to Bair put the Bears at the Raiders’ 49 before Thomas’ interception. “Sammy kept his poise. His presence there with us down (17-7) and then giving us a chance at the end, that’s what we expect from him,” UA coach Joel Cutler said. “This was a slobberknocker. This was pretty much the game I expected.” dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave ========== UA—Bair 21 pass from Sass (Raish kick) R—Rice 57 pass from Whatley (Tully kick) R—Rice 53 pass from Whatley (Tully kick) R—Co.

Andrew,Davis,1493,https://www.dualshockers.com/sega-pax-west-lineup-2018/,"While most people are still recovering from the tidal wave of gaming news at Gamesom2018, SEGA has announced its lineup for PAX West next weekend including a few sought-after titles. SEGA will be taking the floor with a robust lineup that’s not too dissimilar from their Gamescom display. The legendary company will be unleashing their iconic Blue Blur in his upcoming racer Sonic Team Racing allowing players to test drive the newly revealed track Ice Mountain and choose from Team Sonic, Team Dark, Team Rose, and Team Vector. Classic turn-based strategy series Total War will feature a playable demo for its upcoming installment Total War: THREE KINGDOMS ahead of its release next year. Joining these will be the tactical RPG epic Valkyria Chronicles 4 and the chaotic combat game Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise. There’s also toe-tapping fun to be had with Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight and Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight. SEGA’s lineup is rounded off by the addition of Shin Megami Tensei Liberation Dx2. Along with the wealth of games on the floor, SEGA will also be delivering a panel featuring director of localization Sam Mulle, associate localization producer Andrew Davis, and UE PR manager Sarah Wellock entitled “A SEGA Perspective: Bringing Japanese Games to the West.” To top it off there will also be stage presentations every 30 minutes throughout the weekend. PAX West kicks off seven days from now and will run from August 31 – September 3 in Seattle, Washington.

Sara,Burns,1492,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-shooting-brookside-drive-1.4797461,"John Stewart was preparing his morning cup of coffee in his Fredericton apartment two weeks ago when he noticed a police vehicle with two armed officers standing outside his window. He had no idea a gunman had opened fire just minutes before at the apartment complex at 237 Brookside Dr., killing Fredericton police officers, Robb Costello, 45, and Sara Burns, 43, and Donnie Robichaud, 42, and his girlfriend, Bobbie Lee Wright, 32. The alleged killer, Matthew Raymond, was released from hospital on Thursday and transferred to a provincial correctional facility, according to New Brunswick's Department of Justice. He is expected to make his first court appearance in Fredericton on Monday. Curious about the officers outside his home, the 38-year-old Stewart left his apartment in Building C — one floor below the alleged shooter's — to find out what was going on. In the back stairwell of his apartment building, he came across two police officers, who ordered the resident to get back inside. He then went to wake up his son Parker,15 , to get dressed. Then he heard shots. Residents were later escorted to safety at the York Funeral Home, a nearby Tim Hortons and then a bus eventually took them to the Willie O'Ree Place. ""That's not your typical Fredericton morning,"" said Stewart, who moved into the apartment building eight months ago. With assistance from the Canadian Red Cross, Stewart, along with other tenants from the apartment complex, stayed at the Fredericton Inn for four days while police completed their investigation. Now residents in the area want to thank everyone who helped them, including Fredericton police, the Canadian Red Cross and ordinary members of the community. On Saturday, the neighbourhood will be holding a barbecue. The residents came up with the idea during their stay at the Fredericton Inn and have received support from businesses across the city and the City of Fredericton. ""We want to give it back because we are a community now and we want to thank them for bringing us together and being there in our time of need,"" he said. The barbecue will take place between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Stewart said everyone in the community is invited. The Red Cross will also be there accepting donations. There will be music on the site and games for kids. Stewart said the barbecue is open to the public. ""We want to give back, we want to take back and we don't want to look back,"" he said. Stewart said residents in the area have grown closer in the past two weeks. Before the shooting, neighbours would occasionally talk to one another or nod if they saw one another in the courtyard. Now they gather in the courtyard to talk about the events of Aug. 10 and how they're coping with the aftermath. He can remember more than a dozen residents standing in the courtyard after they returned home four days after the shooting. ""It's a completely different neighbourhood,"" he said. ""It's really a community now."" Stewart said returning home to his apartment was an adjustment. And residents are a lot more conscious about their surroundings keeping hallway doors open instead of letting them slam shut every time a person walks through the building. ""We are the lucky ones, we are the ones that are fortunate enough to have gotten out,"" he said. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Michael,Gordon,1491,https://talksport.com/football/414648/liverpool-sale-manchester-city-owners-cousin/,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. Club would welcome investment but told Sheikh Khaled they do not want to sell up, even for record price A cousin of Manchester City’s owner Sheikh Mansour failed in a stunning bid to buy Liverpool, it has emerged. According to the Daily Mail, Sheikh Khaled Bin Zayed Al Nehayan held talks with Reds chiefs in late 2017 and early this year and subsequently launched a £2billion offer to buy the Merseyside club. It would have constituted the most expensive takeover in the history of football, but was knocked back by Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group. Sheikh Khaled is an Emirati member of the family who govern Abu Dhabi. He is not as wealthy as his cousin Sheikh Mansour, City’s billionaire owner, but is understood to be one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the Gulf states. Midhat Kidwai, one of Sheikh Khaled’s trusted advisors, reportedly met Liverpool chairman Tom Werner in New York for talks over a potential buyout. But the Mail say the deal never reached the stage where major shareholders John W Henry and Michael Gordon met any of the interested parties and Liverpool, while they would consider taking on a minor investor, are adamant the club is not for sale. A Liverpool statement released to the Mail read: “FSG have been clear and consistent: the club is not for sale. “But what the ownership has said, again clearly and consistently, is that under the right terms and conditions we would consider taking on a minority investor, if such a partnership was to further our commercial interests in specific market places and in line with the continued development and growth of the club and the team.” Liverpool were taken over by FSG – then known as New England Sports Ventures – in 2010 at a cost of around £300million. Under their American ownership, the Reds have won only one League Cup but have made major progress and challenged for all the major honours, reaching the finals of the FA Cup, Europa League and Champions League, while also finishing as runners up in the Premier League.

Michael,Gordon,1491,https://www.nbr.co.nz/story/annual-trade-deficit-widens-most-nine-years,"A $6.9 billion jump in the cost of imports to $60.7b in the year to July – a rise of 13% – has pushed the annual trade deficit to widest in nine years, Statistics NZ says. Nearly a third of the increase was due to higher crude prices as total imports of petroleum and products rose $1.5b to $6.5b. The value of exports rose 11%, or $5.7b, to $56.2b, leaving an annual deficit of $4.4b, This is worth 7.9% of exports and is the widest annual deficit since March 2009. “The rise in imports in the past year reflect large rises in both imports of petroleum and products, and in mechanical machinery and equipment,” Statistics NZ’s international statistics manager Tehseen Islam says. Dairy and meat products led the exports rise.Deficit in JulyThe monthly figures for July show a deficit of $143 million compared with a surplus of $92m a year earlier. This was better than expected and was partly offset by a downward revision for June, Westpac economist Michael Gordon says. Exports rose $729m, or 16%, to $5.3b compared with July 2017. Dairy products rose 21%, or $269m, to $1.5b compared with a year earlier, the highest value for all months since December 2017. Milk powder (up $136m) and milk fats including butter (up $116m) were the main contributors. The rise in milk powder exports was price-driven. In contrast, the rise in milk fats including butter was quantity driven. Forestry products, and meat and edible offal were the other main export contributors. Mr Gordon says the strength of exports in July may have been a matter of timing, with a greater-than-usual number of shipments during the month. “There was also a strong lift in dairy export prices for the month but recent dairy auctions indicate that this will soon reverse.” Oil prices jumpImports surged 21% to $964m to $5.5b, the second-highest monthly import bill after November 2017. “Crude prices are much higher than they were at the same time last year,” Mr Islam says. “These price increases have driven an increase in values, as quantities are much the same.” Oil prices on international markets have eased slightly in recent weeks but remain at high levels. Brent crude is trading just under $US75 a barrel after going as high as $US78 in June and July. The New Zealand dollar has since fallen against the US dollar, wiping out the benefits of lower prices since then. A $107m increase in mechanical machinery and equipment including computers also contributed to the imports rise in July. JP Morgan economist Ben Jarman says while the July export performance has not been as weak as expected, the trend shows a continuing drop in the terms of trade. “This highlights the consistent underperformance of agricultural export groups in the context of higher oil prices (agriculture usually demonstrating a decent correlation with oil),” he says. “There is also little sign to date of the 12% decline [in the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar] lifting trade receipts. “We expect the trade balance to come under further pressure from here as the agricultural sector is held back by supply constraints (earlier dry weather, M.Bovis infestation) and as the terms of trade are falling.”

Michael,Gordon,1491,https://www.falkirkherald.co.uk/whats-on/falkirk-musician-to-unleash-new-album-material-at-stirling-gig-1-4789160,"Falkirk’s very own renaissance man, singer songwriter and film maker, Adam Stafford will unleash his creative vision in the city of Stirling next week. The multi-talented musician, the driving force behind critically acclaimed outfits like Y’All is Fantasy Islands and Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo, is performing songs from his most personal album to date at the latest Strange Behaviours event in the Tolbooth, Jail Wynd, on Thursday, August 30. Adam himself describes Fire Behind the Curtain as having sections where “choirs yelp and screech, beatboxing courses through cosmic k-holes and guitars sound like saxophones trapped deep in the wasp machine”. A Strange Behaviours spokesbloke said: “Adam is a peerless creative juggernaut, blending a capella experimentalism with an unusual sway for melodic, hook-laden pop choruses, always unique and always catching you off guard. “He is known for his intense live performances which incorporate soul-pop and post-punk with layering of vocal loops, textural soundscapes to dizzying effect. Usually performing solo, this show will be a rare opportunity to catch Adam with a bassist/keyboardist player in tow as he promotes Fire Behind The Curtain. “It’s a critically acclaimed double album of Neo-Classical compositions and avant-garde instrumentals, written over an eight-year period and inspired by Adam’s love of Meredith Monk, Michael Gordon and US minimalism.” This solo venture for Adam is just one of the high points of this artistic force of nature’s extremely prolific career in music and film – he has directed a music video for the Twilight Sad, and has played alongside that band and a host of other big names including King Creosote. From his 2006 debut LP In Faceless Town’s Forever, released under the Y’all is Fantasy Island banner, through his work with Sweethearts of the Prison Rodeo right up to this year’s Fire Behind the Curtain – which saw him collaborate with another acclaimed Falkirk songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Robbie Lesiuk – Adam has always experimented with new sounds and approaches to music. The recording process for Fire Behind the Curtain started in October last year when Adam and Robbie enlisted the help of The Pumpkinseeds and Modern Studies cellist and arranger Pete Harvey and a nine-piece choir and brought to life an emotive piece of music which referenced Adam’s ongoing struggle with depression. Joining Adam at next Thursday’s Tolbooth gig will be PAWS frontman Phillip Taylor, who will be playing an acoustic set, giving fans a chance to hear new PAWS songs stripped back to their bare essentials. Rounding out this Strange Behaviours line-up is Death Bed – or songwriter Innes Nolan, as he is also known – playing an acoustic set for the lucky punters. The music starts at 7.30pm. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.

Steve,Cummings,1490,https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/steve-cummings-terrible-year-theres-no-sugar-coating-392023,"Brit puts poor year down to a multitude of changes as he aims for a possible stage win at the Vuelta a España Steve Cummings at the Volta a Catalunya 2018 (Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images) British rider Steve Cummings puts his “terrible” 2018 season down to multiple factors including a change in his race programme at Team Dimension Data. Cummings, who currently has a chest cold, is starting the Vuelta a España in Málaga on Saturday with the team after a tough year. The goal is to help Louis Meintjes win the race overall. “It’s been a s**t year. A terrible year,” Cummings told Cycling Weekly by telephone from the south of Spain in Andalusia. >>> Vuelta a España 2018 start list: Nibali, Sagan, Porte, Quintana among starters “There’s no use of sugar coating it. I’m not being negative, but I’ve not been near my potential. It’s sad for me and sad for the team.” Cummings won stages of the Tour de France in 2015 and 2016 and both the British national road race and time trial titles in 2017. He knows the highs and can recognise the lows, but says a 2018 race programme that saw him miss Tirreno-Adriatico and take part in other races like the Tour de Romandie did not suit him. “They wanted to take a risk with a race programme that didn’t work. That’s been the main reason. There’s more intricacies than that but… If you have been training for one way for many years and then you start changing… “I thought we had a good recipe that was working well. I didn’t want to change. Even now at the Vuelta. If you asked me at the start of the year the races I wanted to do, the Vuelta wasn’t on my list. Cummings has had a big change in race programme in 2018 (Photo: Chris Catchpole) “I am happy to be here but it’s just like the whole season has been like that. The only time I really was going well was July then they didn’t select me for the Tour de France. I didn’t understand that.” The 37-year-old has coped remarkably well considering the change in programmes and setbacks. Recently, he just recovered from a fractured fibula head in his left leg suffered in the Tour of Austria. “Normally, I start with one race before Tirreno-Adriatico. Tirreno-Adriatico, Milano-Sanremo, País Vasco. I wanted to do the Giro this year because of the extra week ahead of the Tour. I would’ve asked to do the Giro, that was the only difference,” continued Cummings. “It’s about races that suit me and then timings between races to have time to work in the best way I can. Some guys work best under load. I’ve understood what’s best for me, the blue print, then to change it and do other stuff just didn’t make sense.” The change in programme led to breathing issues that needed to be resolved by a specialist. In certain parts of central Europe, Cummings has always suffered in his career. As a result, he always tailored his race programme to avoid those areas. “I did Romandie for the first time this year. I had a massive breathing problems, it affected me in the Dauphiné, but with a specialist he fixed it,” he added. “But then if I didn’t go to Romandie, I probably won’t have that problem at all, but I’m just doing what’s best for the team.” Dimension Data was hit with a number of injuries in the team this year, including Mark Cavendish suffering several setbacks. As a result, the team needed to shift its healthy riders around and fill race rosters. And it needed WorldTour points. Cummings has won two stages of the Tour de France since riding with the African team (Sunada) “I’m a rider who needs a lot of work, objective driven, but if I’m not working properly then I’m not going to get the best out of myself,” Cummings said. “The secret for the last few years has been hard work and consistency, good planning, but if you take good planning away it’s more difficult to find consistence and train properly because it’s not clear what you are preparing for. “I’m not a big risk taker, I ride at the back. I take calculated risks because I have to. But if something’s not broken then there’s no need to fix it.” Cummings has won stages in both the Tour and the Vuelta in his career. His goal is to get through the Vuelta with Meintjes, perhaps win a stage, and “decompress” after 2018. In 2019, a Giro stage victory in his adopted home country of Italy is his “big objective.” He added, “but for sure, I need to go back to following a proper plan.” Cycling Weekly magazine November 08 2018 issue, on sale from Thursday priced £3.25 Get our free email newsletter By submitting your information, you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy & Cookies Policy.

Steve,Cummings,1490,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/opinion/letters/saving-broadleaf-trees-could-stop-fires-1.23411113,"August 23, 2018 10:14 PM Forest fires are expected to get worse but what can we do? The leading idea seems to be spend more money removing fuel from our forests. While this may be practical in some urban interface areas, on a landscape level this idea is completely impractical if not laughable. As Quesnel Mayor Bob Simpson recently said, ""That's long past gone as a strategy and we need a whole new forest management regime."" We couldn't agree more. For decades our forest management regime has revolved around managing for climax tree species, those being mainly lodgepole pine and to a lesser degree white spruce and Douglas fir. To get there, we've become dependent on glyphosate-based formulas like VisionMax which we spray from helicopters to wipe out the so-called weeds, those being the broadleaf deciduous trees like trembling aspen, birch and cottonwood, and shrubs like willow and alder. This has been backed up with decades of research showing this strategy will increase forest yields of tomorrow justifying quicker cutting today. Much of our AAC calculations are based on yield models presuming broadleaf suppression. This seductive allure of ""vegetation management"" has become enshrined in Canadian forestry, taught in our universities, and entrenched in the professional forester's way of doing things, not to mention the reams of red tape created by Forest Ministry planners to codify the parameters of broadleaf elimination. On average we spray around 15,000 hectares of broadleaf a year, much of it in the Prince George Forest District, and as of 2017 we've sprayed 1,800 square kilometers in the Prince George Forest District alone, not including manual brushing, which is also significant. But nature is never so simple. What our forest managers and planners seem to have overlooked is that broadleaf is nature's fire break, and by eliminating the trees and plants that can counter forest fires, we've inadvertently created flammable landscapes of conifer monocultures whose combustion will likely limit optimistic yield models not to mention impose costs on our society's mental and physical health, as well as incur greater expenses fighting fires and losing property. Perhaps we are exaggerating the effectiveness of aspen and broadleaf to counteract fires. But when you review the evidence, it becomes hard to oversell it. According to a 2001 study by Steve Cummings et al, pine forests are 8.4 times, or 840 per cent, more likely to burn compared to deciduous forests based on historical data. Black spruce stands were even more flammable while white spruce were slightly less. In any case, these are exponential terms. A more sophisticated modelling exercise carried out by Canadian Forest Service scientists shows that the low flammability of broadleaf forests remains static, even as drought conditions grow more severe. Another federal government study showed aspen stopping dead a raging conifer crown fire in extreme fire conditions. We have these studies on our website www.stopthespraybc.com. Of course every tree, being wood, can burn, and aspen is no exception, especially in early spring when dry grass and undergrowth can burn intensely, as the Fort MacMurray fire demonstrated. But once the leaves are out and the undergrowth is greened up, the absence of pitch and high moisture content gives aspen and the other broadleaves serious fire-stopping or slowing power. That's why firefighters tie their firebreaks into deciduous stands. Given the reality of worsening forest fires and the predictions this will only grow worse, we need practical solutions and having a patchwork of fire-retardant tree species spread across the landscape is the best if only practical solution available to us. Better yet, not only is this idea free, but actually saves us money by not requiring us to spend it spraying and contaminating our forests with a probable carcinogen that does not break down the way we've been told it would. But government regulations remain incredibly restrictive. The most broadleaf you are allowed is five per cent in a reforested block. It is these restrictive and ridiculous rules that need to change.

Steve,Cummings,1490,http://www.wbay.com/content/news/Oshkosh-riverwalk-expands-491599801.html,"OSHKOSH, Wis. (WBAY) - Another stretch of the Oshkosh riverwalk is now open, this one in the morgan district. The expansion allows even more access to the Fox River in an area that's recently seen a lot of new construction. The completion of the latest phase adds about a half mile to the riverwalk on the south shores of the Fox River, and this new stretch is expected to be very popular. Shortly after the ribbon-cutting ceremony, people were walking, bicycling, inline skating, or simply sitting to watch the boat traffic. Construction on the first phase of the riverwalk started in 2018. There have been several expansions since then. This latest one cost about $1.8 million. It was paid for through a DNR grant and local tax increment financing. This is an area that was once industrial. People we spoke with said the transformation is amazing. ""Lived in town 13 years now, and every few years there's another piece we get to enjoy. And we get to come and wander along the lake, and my kids and I love taking a walk out along here, and we get up here all the nature up the way. You don't get a lot of in the middle of the city,"" Oshkosh resident Adam Bellcorelli said. Mayor Steve Cummings added, ""It's a huge transformation and compared to other cities on the Fox. We have the most accessible waterways as far as Winnebago, Butte des Morts, the river. It's easy to get to as far as the boat launches. You can't do this in Appleton, it's hard in Green Bay, so it's just a cool thing happening in the city of Oshkosh."" Others expect the riverwalk to boost local tourism. Amy Albright of the Oshkosh Convention and Visitors Bureau said, ""If you're not familiar with Oshkosh you can walk through, see all of the bridges. There's restaurants you can actually stop at, have a bit to eat, keep going. You can ride your bike, you can walk, you can rollerblade, dogs, kids, kind of the whole everybody is welcome."" We're told the riverwalk is now 80 percent complete. Work on the next phase running towards Winnebago will take place between now and 2020.

Michael,Gordon,1472,https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2018/08/20/640189310/new-music-new-stories-from-century-old-celluloid,"Tom Huizenga When crumbling reels of century-old silent film are paired with brand new music something magical and dreamlike can happen. The latest collaboration between filmmaker Bill Morrison and composer Michael Gordon, The Unchanging Sea, creates a mesmerizing new narrative from 17 ocean-centric short films, dating from 1897 to 1928. Until the early 1950s, film stock was made from cellulose nitrate, which was both highly flammable (remember the scene from Cinema Paradiso when the theater catches fire?) and prone to deterioration. With age, celluloid breaks down and blisters, leaving images looking like they are under attack by hordes of man-eating amoebas. These fantastical images, from the dawn of cinema, are catnip to Morrison, who edits the old clips with a director's efficiency and a poet's sense of expressive detail. While the surreal and sometimes disturbing images in The Unchanging Sea are not unlike our own dreams, there's something oddly comforting in watching the film decompose on screen. The bubbling decay is especially appropriate as it casts a watery spell. Morrison's characters seem to wash up on shore and recede into the ocean's depths. Gordon's sumptuous and undulating score, commissioned and performed by the Seattle Symphony, is equally dramatic, though not overly pictorial. Waves of ominous chords from the depths of the piano come crashing in as the sun rises over an endless ocean. The heroine, napping on a shoreline boulder, is introduced with long, sighing figures in the winds. Within her dream – and the film's 30-minute span – she will find love, wealth and tragedy. Hollywood blockbusters these days are shot through with so many computer-generated special effects and whiplash edits that the brain grows weary. Funny then, how these 100-year-old films, without dialog, fancy lenses or lighting, appear so fresh you can't take your eyes off them. The Unchanging Sea comes out Aug. 24 via Cantaloupe Music. Deceptive Cadence covers the world of classical music. Hosted by Tom Huizenga and Anastasia Tsioulcas, it's an open space for discussion, discovery, music listening and news. Want to know more?

Rookie hooker Wayde Egan is also expected to be given a far more increased role as the Panthers look to fine tune their title run leading into September. The Warriors have suffered a major blow with Blake Green ruled out for Friday’s match at Mt Smart Stadium, but Tohu Harris returns. A win for the Panthers keeps their top four hopes alive while a loss would almost certainly see them finish in the bottom half of the top eight. Panthers forward Viliame Kikau has also been cleared to make the trip to New Zealand despite fears an immigration bungle would prevent him from travelling. The Rabbitohs welcome back several of their backline stars including Greg Inglis, while the Storm are reeling from the injury crisis suffered against the Eels, and Will Chambers’ suspension.

Toafa Sipley Analysis: The Tigers are largely unchanged for their must-win clash with the Sea Eagles, but Chris Lawrence returns to the starting line-up.

Sione Katoa 19. Kaide Ellis 20. Adam Keighran 21. Liam Martin Analysis: Cameron Ciraldo has made his first positional changes since taking over as head coach, switching Tyrone Peachey from fullback to five-eighth and moving Dallin Watene-Zelezniak to the custodian role. Wayde Egan replaces Sione Katoa in the No.9 jersey. Blake Green is a late scratching for the Warriors, and Mason Lino will take his spot at No.6. But Tohu Harris is a huge inclusion for the home side. North Queensland Cowboys v Parramatta Eels at 1300SMILES Stadium, 7:55pm (AEST) Cowboys: 1. Te Maire Martin 2. Kyle Feldt 3. Justin O’Neill 4. Kane Linnett 5. Gideon Gela-mosby 6. Jake Clifford 7. Johnathan Thurston 8. Matthew Scott 9. Jake Granville 10. Jordan McLean 11. Gavin Cooper 12. Coen Hess 13. Jason Taumalolo Interchange: 14.

Cameron King 15. Tim Mannah (c) 16. David Gower 17. Brad Takairangi Reserves: 18. Ray Stone 19. Oregon Kaufusi 20. Josh Hoffman 21. Bevan French Analysis: The Cowboys welcoem back Matt Scott and Jason Taumalolo for Johnathan Thurston’s last home game. Cameron King moves to the bench for the Eels after being omitted last weekend, and Bevan French is still only an outside chance of making the final team list. SATURDAY Canberra Raiders v South Sydney Rabbitohs at GIO Stadium, 3:00pm (AEST) Raiders: 1. Brad Abbey 2. Nick Cotric 3. Michael Oldfield 4. Joey Leilua 5. Jordan Rapana 6. Blake Austin 7.

Jason Clark 17. Junior Tatola Reserves: 18. Richard Kennar 19. Tyrell Fuimaono 20. Dean Britt 21. Mawene Hiroti Analysis: With Joseph Tapine out, Elliott Whitehead will return to his preferred back-row role. The Rabbitohs welcome back a host of their backline stars, with Greg Inglis, Alex Johnston and Campbell Graham all named in the run-on side. Gold Coast Titans v Melbourne Storm at Cbus Super Stadium, 5:30pm (AEST) Titans: 1. AJ Brimson 2. Anthony Don 3. Konrad Hurrell 4. Brenko Lee 5. Phillip Sami 6. Kane Elgey 7. Ashley Taylor 8.

Jai Whitbread 20. Leilani Latu 21. Brendan Elliott Storm: 1. Billy Slater 2. Suliasi Vunivalu 3. Justin Olam 4. Curtis Scott 5. Josh Addo-Carr 6. Cameron Munster 7. Brodie Croft 8. Jesse Bromwich 9.

Albert Vete 21. Jahrome Hughes Analysis: Cameron Smith has been named to play despite succumbing to a back injury last week, but it seems Melbourne aren’t entirely confident, with three playmakers named on the extended bench. With Will Chambers out through suspension, Justin Olam comes into the side, and Tim Glasby replaces the injured Nelson Asofa-Solomona. Sydney Roosters v Brisbane Broncos at Allianz Stadium, 7:30pm (AEST) Roosters: 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Latrell Mitchell 4. Joseph Manu 5. Blake Ferguson 6. Luke Keary 7. Cooper Cronk 8.

Patrick Mago 19. Troy Dargan 20. Gehamat Shibasaki 21. Sam Tagataese Analysis: Luke Keary is back for the Chooks, pushing Ryan Matterson back to the bench. The Broncos are unchanged from their last-start win over the Rabbitohs. SUNDAY Cronulla Sharks v Newcastle Knights at Southern Cross Group Stadium, 2:00pm (AEST) Sharks: 1. Valentine Holmes 2. Sosaia Feki 3. Josh Dugan 4. Kurt Capewell 5. Edrick Lee 6. Matt Moylan 7. Chad Townsend 8. Andrew Fifita 9. Jayden Brailey 10. Matt Prior 11. Luke Lewis 12. Wade Graham 13.

Luke Yates Analysis: Kalyn Ponga has again been named at five-eighth and Nick Meaney at fullback despite Connor Watson’s likely return from a groin injury. With Cronulla’s two starting centres unavailable through injury, Josh Dugan will push in from the wing and Kurt Capewell will come off the bench. And Wade Graham returns from his knee injury. St George Illawarra Dragons v Canterbury Bulldogs at Jubilee Oval, 4:10pm (AEST) Dragons: 1. Matthew Dufty 2. Nene Macdonald 3. Euan Aitken 4. Timoteo Lafai 5. Jason Nightingale 6. Kurt Mann 7.

Jason Nightingale returns to the wing in place of Jordan Pereira, and Kurt Mann has retained the No.6 jumper. Matt Frawley will again partner Lachlan Lewis in the halves after their big win over the Warriors.

Derry Foundation for Arts in Education golf tournament on Aug. 11. The William E. Derry Foundation for Arts in Education held its fourth annual golf outing on Saturday, Aug. 11, at Shewami Golf Course. More than 70 golfers enjoyed a beautiful sunny day included 18 holes of golf, followed by dinner, basket raffle, silent auction and presentation of awards. The winning foursome was Cory Clark, Jacob Derry, Andy German and Joe German. The runner-up foursome was James Crook, Rich Kustwin, Mike McCann, and Todd Robinson. Jacob Derry won closest to the pin; Hunter Keith won longest drive, and Mike McCann won longest putt. Derry received a sand wedge, Keith a driver, and McCann a putter for their winning shots. The Derry Foundation, a non-profit organization was founded by the sons of Bill Derry, former art teacher in the Milford school district. Its primary goal is to honor his passion for the arts as well as keep arts alive and thriving in today’s classroom. Each year the Foundation awards a scholarship to a college student studying the arts. This year’s recipient of a $2,500 scholarship was Laura Hanson of Chebanse, who attends ISU. The Sam Fanning Dedication to Education award went to Dick Ronna, a veteran educator from the Pekin school system. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!
