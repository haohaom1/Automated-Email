Bob,Diamond,1924,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/martin-taylor-financial-policy-committee-interview-bank-of-england-financial-crisis-barclays-a8620746.html,"Log in using your social network account Log in directly with The Independent Try Independent Minds free for 14 days Hi {{fullName}} The Bank of England regulator talks about Bob Diamond, Sir John Vickers and reform of the financial system with Ben Chu in his first national media interview as a member of the Financial Policy Committee Martin Taylor presses his fingertips together, leans back in his chair and stares into the distance in contemplation. I’ve just suggested to him that if he’d fired Bob Diamond two decades ago the whole history of the global financial crisis might have been different. After a microsecond of thought, Taylor breaks into a smile. “I like to think the financial system didn’t hang on a binary choice of mine in 1998 – that would really be solipsism in the highest degree!” he chuckles. Fair enough. But the Apprentice-style fire-or-not-fire decision scenario was real enough. Taylor himself described it in an article for the Financial Times a few years ago. Taylor was the chief executive of the Quaker-founded British bank Barclays. And Bob Diamond’s investment banking division had blown up due to an unexpected sovereign default in Russia, forcing the group to register a large loss. What made it worse was that tight trading limits for Russian debt set by the bank’s board had been deliberately bypassed by Diamond’s traders. The ambitious American banker, humbled, was offering his resignation. Taylor turned it down believing that Diamond was too important to lose. Diamond, of course, went on to drive Barclays into the very heart of the global credit storm that unleashed disaster on the world and the UK economy in 2008. And he became one of the public villains of the crisis thanks to his spectacularly ill-judged suggestion before the Treasury Select Committee in 2011 that the “period of remorse” from bankers “needs to be over”. “Looking back on it I think I made the wrong call,” Taylor tells me, sitting in his rather spartan office on the upper floors of the Bank of England’s City of London headquarters. “But it was more about Barclays than the financial world as a whole.” Tieless, glasses nestling in his blazer pocket, wearing comfortable slacks, 66-year-old Taylor resembles a country solicitor more than a former City titan or the influential regulator he is now, as an external member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The only hint of financial services about him is a faint pinstripe on that dark blue blazer. I’d wanted to interview Taylor for some time, and not only for his juicy insider knowledge on Barclays. He’s also been at the heart of some of the major post-financial crisis reforms and institutions. He served on the Independent Commission on Banking (better known as the Vickers Commission, after its chair, Sir John Vickers) which was set up by George Osborne to decide whether or not to split up investment and retail banking in the wake of the crash. And since 2013 he has been a member of the FPC, which is charged with sniffing out financial crises, like a Bloodhound, before they happen and orders the inflation of banks’ capital buffers when they seem to be getting too relaxed about risk. Taylor’s time with the commission is drawing to an end. He has informed the Treasury he will step down no later than June 2019. So it seems a reasonable time for him to reflect a little in public, not just on his time on the FPC but on the decade since the crisis. The first question is, how much has really changed in our financial system over the last 10 years? Taylor’s answer is unequivocal, trenchant even. “I don’t know whether to laugh or be irritated by it but one of the things I’ve found about a lot of the writing about the tenth anniversary of the crisis is that lots of them basically said ‘nothing’s changed’. But actually almost everything has changed,” he says. “The industry has changed profoundly. The relationship of regulatory supervisors to industry has changed profoundly. The incentives have changed. The rules on pay have changed. The rules about liquidity in banking have changed. I think there’s been an extraordinary policy response. And I think there’s been some cultural change. Those who wrote it’s all the same, I don’t know where they’re looking. They don’t see the world that I see.” I decide this is not a good time to divulge that I myself recently wrote an essay lamenting the timidity of the reform effort. We move on. Lots of banks have been fined huge sums by regulators over various scandals, from interest rate rigging to insurance mis-selling. Plenty of bosses have departed under a black cloud. But virtually none of the top bankers during the crisis whose institutions foundered and incubated gross misconduct – not even Fred Goodwin of the Royal Bank of Scotland – have been struck off from the Financial Conduct Authority’s “approved persons” list. Inclusion on it is needed to work in the industry. Doesn’t that, I suggest, represent a gross failure of nerve by regulators, a blow to genuine accountability? Taylor’s not having it. “I think on the whole that the people at the top of institutions that went wrong in the financial crisis, they lost their jobs, they lost a lot of money, they lost their reputations. I think the idea that they didn’t suffer is a strange one. Imagine what it’s like to be in their shoes – it’s not great actually,” he says. “I don’t think having the FCA write something on your tombstone is necessarily the be all and end all.” A new book on Barclays’ roller coaster history by the writer Philip Augar relates that when Taylor was in charge he wanted to split off the troublesome investment banking division. Indeed, he resigned after failing to win the support of the board for his radical restructuring plans. The Vickers Commission was asked to look into that very question, not just for Barclays but the entire UK banking sector. Yet Vickers stopped short of recommending a clean break and proposed a somewhat complicated “ringfence” of banks’ retail arms instead. Why didn’t Vickers go the whole hog? Wasn’t this a missed opportunity, especially from Taylor’s perspective? “I’ve done lots of work for government. If you’re on one of those committees, the ideal space to get to is somewhere where there’s an overhang on a Venn diagram and where what you think is a proper solution is something that government and parliament is going to accept,” explains Taylor. So did he think that a full split proposal might not be welcomed by the government and risked being rejected? “I was certainly conscious of it,” he says. “Finding a resolution to something does just mean recommending something. Recommending an ideal solution which government then does not enact is useless. Equally, finding an inadequate solution the government enacts is useless too.” But he’s adamant that ringfencing, finally due to come in next year, is an acceptable solution to the problem of banks funding their casino trading habits with ordinary depositors’ savings. “I remember when we reported it in September 2011 and said we wanted these things to be done by the beginning of 2019, a lot of people laughed and said, ‘This is for the long grass and it’s never going to happen’. And you know what? It’s three months away and it’s happened,” he says. Born 8 June 1952 in Burnley, Lancashire 1965-1969: Eton College 1970-1974: Balliol College Oxford, reading Oriental Studies (Chinese) 1974-1982: Reuters and Financial Times 1982-1993: Courtaulds (textiles company) 1994‐1998: Barclays chief executive 2000‐present: non‐executive director of RTL Group 2010‐11: member of Independent Commission on Banking 2013-present: external member of Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee 2015-present: director at CiBO Technologies Yet, on the subject of Vickers, there’s been an unusually public disagreement between the Bank of England and Sir John on the question of banks’ capital requirements. The FPC has mandated UK banks to have a capital buffer [shareholders’ equity to absorb potential losses] of at least 4 per cent of total assets. But Sir John, essentially, thinks that’s too low – and a floor beneath what the Vickers Committee itself proposed. What does Taylor think of the concerns of his old chair? “John has been vocal about the systemic risk buffer. I’m comfortable that where we’ve got to, we’ve got a system with about as much equity as Vickers proposed, and arrived at in a slightly different way, and with an awful lot more debt that is convertible into equity,” he says. “Would I prefer in an ideal world for some of that debt to be equity? Yes I would. But I think we’re in the right place.” I point out that even Mervyn King, who was the Bank’s Governor when Taylor joined the FPC in 2013, is now saying that banks should have substantially more capital than the regulatory minimum. “Mervyn’s a friend and I’ve known him a very long time. He was Governor of the Bank for 10 years and deputy governor for five and chief economist before that and he didn’t actually do it in those 20 years,” says Taylor, slightly mischievously. “If you’re a macroprudential regulator your default setting is to fall asleep worrying about the banking system and to think a little bit more capital would be nice. And the next time you think maybe a little more. We don’t want more capital to make supervisors sleep better – we want more capital to have the appropriate amount of resilience in the system.” Often central bankers and regulators are surprisingly gregarious in person but automatons when they write anything down. With Taylor it’s almost the other way around. As an interviewee he’s rather hesitant, diffident even. Our talk is punctuated by long pauses for thought. At a couple of points he asks, almost plaintively, “Don’t you think?” Rather disappointingly, he refuses to talk at any length about Barclays, where activist investor Edward Bramson is now pressing the bank to get out of investment banking, just as he urged all those years ago. Yet a supremely self-confident intelligence shines out of Taylor’s speeches for the FPC, which are crowded with erudite and witty historical references to imperial China and the French revolution. Their substance is usually the magisterial brushing aside of the latest anti-regulation fallacy propagated by the financial lobby. And there have been some Exocet newspaper articles. Along with the one that lifted the lid on the history of Bob Diamond at Barclays was a particularly memorable broadside in 2009 which castigated his former banking colleagues for paying massive bonuses to staff out of illusory paper profits during the bubble. His mordant conclusion: “The system was brought down not because risk management was deficient (though it was), nor because greed was rampant (though it was), but because bankers could not count.” Perhaps that unusual self-confidence with the pen reflects his origins in journalism, and his editing of the Lex investment column for the Financial Times in the early 1980s. Before I leave, I suggest to Taylor that it’s inconceivable that anyone today could progress from journalism to senior banker to regulator in the way that he did. “It was inconceivable then!” he laughs. “I had a very strange career. But I think people ought to change sector. One of the problems I found towards the end of my business career was I was dealing with people who knew everything about a rather narrow area. You want people like that – [but] you don’t want everyone to be like that. Because otherwise it’s quite hard to see where connections are made.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

Bob,Diamond,1924,https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/chinese-oil-tycoon-buys-a-bunch-of-pricey-nyc-property-and-then-disappears/,"Ye Jianming is a 41-year-old Chinese oil tycoon who went on a spending spree, picking up some of the spendiest real estate in New York City. He spent $83 million and had plans to buy $80 million more but he disappeared in early 2018. Ye had ties to the intelligence unit of the People's Liberation Army according to sources close to him. The properties he bought or expressed interest in included a penthouse he purchased from a top Wall Street banker, and a townhouse that formerly belonged to a billionaire friend of Donald Trump. In May 2017, Ye spent $50.55 million to buy former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond's penthouse at 15 Central Park West. The 5,278 square foot apartment has four bedrooms, a library, and an eat in kitchen. In June 2017, he dropped nearly $33 million on a 4,028 square foot apartment on the 86th floor at 432 Park Avenue. The unit was then put up for rent for $80,000 a month. ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images Ye paid cash for both of these properties. Last December, Ye entered into a contract to buy an $80 million townhouse owned by the NHL's Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola at 12 East 69thStreet. Viola was briefly the nominee for Secretary of the Army. The 20,000 square foot townhouse has its own movie theater. The deal would have set the record for the most expensive townhouse ever sold in New York City at the time, but the deal fell apart in early 2018 at about the same time as Ye went missing. Ye is not the first high profile, wealthy, Chinese person to go missing. Actress Fan Bingbing has been missing since last summer. Casino tycoon Yang Zhuhui went missing in August. Zhou Chengjian, a Chinese billionaire with a net worth of $1.4 billion, went missing on January 6, 2016. Club Med owner Guo Guangchang went missing on December 10, 2015. Ye is reportedly under investigation in China. Ye is the chairman of Shanghai based CEFC China Energy, which has been expanding abroad aggressively in the past several years. It acquired $9 billion worth of shares in Russia's Rosneft energy giant, more than $1 billion in investments in energy companies in the Czech Republic, and more deals in Abu Dhabi, Romania, and Singapore. Ye's company has also purchased pricey real estate in Shanghai. With Ye's whereabouts unknown, his empire is under threat. CEFC has been selling off assets and canceling deals. In November 2017, a former Hong Kong official named Patrick Ho, who was one of Ye's top contacts in the Chinese government was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on allegations of bribing African leaders through a charity that was funded by Ye's CEFC. Ye wasn't named in the indictment. Ho is challenging the charges against him. On news of his disappearance, shares in companies tied to CEFC China Energy plunged on the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen stock exchanges and wiped out $630 million in market value in one hour. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved",0.0,5.0,0.4166666666666667,0.0,1015016,0.6338125555783158,1,2018-11-13 12:57:00,True,Priority Mail
Michael,Gordon,1923,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/man-who-stole-money-from-b-c-parents-of-bantam-age-hockey-players-sentenced-1.23488093,"November 5, 2018 05:48 PM KELOWNA, B.C. — A man who stole money from a hockey association and the parents of bantam-age hockey players has been sentenced to one year in jail, but was set free the day of his sentencing because he'd already served the time. Loren Reagan and his former business partner Michael Gordon Elphicke created the Okanagan Elite Hockey Association in Penticton, B.C., in 2010 with the intent of sending hockey players and their parents on a tour of Europe. The court heard Monday that families paid $5,500 per traveller for the European tour, minus the amounts they raised by selling raffle tickets for meat draws, which were operated without the required gaming licence. Court heard the hockey association collected $130,000 in trip deposits and raffle proceeds between July 2011 and January 2012, but only $15,000 of that money went toward the European hockey tour. Reagan's three-week trial was scheduled to begin Monday morning in Kelowna, but instead the Crown and defence presented a joint submission and Reagan pleaded guilty to theft over $5,000. The Crown and defence proposed a jail sentence of time served, followed by two years' probation and a standalone restitution order of $80,000 to the 16 families that fell victim to his theft. Reagan has spent eight months and eight days in jail, totalling 12 months and 12 days with enhanced credit. He was arrested in Calgary in March after failing to show up for trial in 2017. British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Mark McEwan accepted the joint submission, but expressed frustration at the jail sentence. ""I am not happy with the length of this term,"" he said. ""This seems to be very slight for what he's done."" Reagan and Elphicke were accused of fraud over $5,000, theft over $5,000 and unauthorized management of a lottery scheme. Elphicke was sentenced earlier this year to two years' house arrest followed by three years' probation and was ordered to pay $117,000 in restitution to the 16 families. The charges of fraud and unauthorized management of a lottery scheme against Reagan were stayed by the Crown following sentencing. Reagan is not required to report to a probation officer, and he is not permitted to work or volunteer in any capacity that involves fundraising during his probation. He addressed the court Monday, expressing his remorse. ""I'd like to apologize for the circumstances,"" Reagan said. ""It was poor management on my part and I regret that dearly."" The intent to put on the European trip was genuine, defence counsel Kim Russell said in court. ""This was not a scheme that was devised from the outset to bilk the complainants of their money,"" he said. The reason the trip never happened was because Reagan and Elphicke were not good businessmen, said Russell. Reagan was also involved in a plan to build a dormitory for hockey academy students in Penticton. ""That's where a large part of the theft arises, is the use of funds from the (hockey association) towards the dorm project for permits and various expenses related to that,"" said Russell. ""And that was unbeknownst to the parents."" The dorm project consumed $40,000 of the money paid and raised by parents, while $20,000 was used by Elphicke for personal use, and $30,000 to $40,000 for Reagan's personal use. › or view results Your City Matters - City of Prince George Updated: November 9, 2018 November 11, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 11, 2018 November 11, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 13, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 12, 2018 November 12, 2018 Find out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-13 12:57:00,True,Priority Mail

Bernard,Osher,1922,https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/garchik/article/Admiring-Bergman-Swedish-film-master-and-13368811.php,"In this centenary of Ingmar Bergman, the great Swedish director’s admirers — both professional and personal — have been traveling the world, bringing him to life by telling tales etched in their memories. He wasn’t exactly an easygoing man, said Katinka Faragó, who has been described as his “right hand.” Faragó has been in the Bay Area since late last week, speaking and being interviewed at Bergman-centric events hosted by the California Film Institute, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive and San Francisco State. She worked with the filmmaker for more than 30 years, beginning in a menial role while she was a teenager and serving eventually as script supervisor, production manager and producer. The first event on her busy Bay Area agenda was dinner on Friday, Nov. 2, at the home of Honorable Consul General of Sweden Barbro Osher and Bernard Osher. Place cards indicated we were dinner partners, and as we sat down and said hello, I asked how she had met Bergman. “Is this an interview?” she asked. From the tone, it sounded as though she wasn’t exactly ready for that, so I closed the cover of my notebook, which was in my lap. But after what seemed like a rebuff, she described going to meet him, and the advice she’d been given by other staffers who’d known him well. “If he stares at you, you stare back. If he spits at you, you spit back.” I opened my notebook and started scribbling, as the conversation lurched forward. In 1960, five years after she came to work with Bergman, she recalled, James Baldwin went to Sweden to interview Bergman for Esquire magazine. “He had a cold,” she said. “Bergman said, ‘I am not going to see him.’” (Almost 60 years later, she said, she still feels uneasy — worried about her boss’ disapproval — when she has to cough.) So Bergman “didn’t do the interview the day they had said. Absolutely not.” Instead, he asked Faragó to take Baldwin to a projection room in the studio and show him the 1913 silent movie “Ingeborg Holm,” and to translate into English its titles, which were, of course, in Swedish. The movie, a tragic tale about the misery of a poor family, was so moving, she said, that she started to cry. Overcome with emotion, she was unable to translate, she said. “I am sorry,” said Baldwin, “could you please tell me what’s going on?” The Baldwin profile that came out of their initial conversation was forwarded to me by Amanda Doxtater, a Scandinavian scholar at the University of Washington, who was at the dinner, too. Baldwin paints a vivid picture of Bergman. When the writer and subject meet, Bergman is solicitous about Baldwin’s flu, and then gets right to the point: “Well, are you for me or against me?” The writer also quoted an unnamed woman he describes as having worked with the filmmaker for several years. “He’s improved,” she says of Bergman, “but he was impossible. He could say the most terrible things, he could make you wish you were dead. Especially if you were a woman.” In conversation, Faragó described watching Bergman and the director Andrei Tarkovsky (for whom she worked later in her career), walking past each other at the Filmstaden, where they were both working. Bergman had expressed an eagerness to meet Tarkovsky, who had moved to Sweden from his native Russia. But walking by each other, neither so much as acknowledged each other’s presence. It was a lavish dinner on an enclosed patio high up in an apartment near downtown. All around us was the glimmer of lighted windows, and a bit farther away, silhouettes flickering around the Jim Campbell sculpture atop the Salesforce Tower. Near its end, Faragó clinked on a glass to call the guests to attention. “I am just trying to prove that I am not mute,” she said, “by saying thank you. I’ve been so well taken care of.” And then, it was that time when the guests stand up, collect themselves and prepare to go home and put on their pajamas. “You must be jet-lagged,” I said to the guest of honor, who’d arrived from Europe the day before. Definitely not, she said.
