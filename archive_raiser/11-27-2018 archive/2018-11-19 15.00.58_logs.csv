Michael,Gordon,1949,https://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/act/two-canberra-journalists-take-their-place-in-media-hall-of-fame-20181116-p50ggj.html,"Two prolific Canberra journalists - The Canberra Times' former editor-at-large Jack Waterford and the late Gay Davidson - have been inducted into the Australian Media Hall of Fame. The pair joined a list of 46 other media greats - including TV legend Ray Martin, the renowned war cameraman Neil Davis and former political editor of The Age and The Australian Michael Gordon - to be added to the Hall of Fame at a gala event in Melbourne on Friday. Gay Davidson, first woman bureau chief in the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery, interviewing Frank Crean in his office, Parliament House, Canberra, 1975Credit:National Library of Australia The Media Hall of Fame is a decade-long project of the Melbourne Press Club that only last year expanded to include NSW, and this year finally included the country’s other states and territories. Waterford’s citation comes after a 43-year career with The Canberra Times, where he famously began as a copy-boy and eventually became editor-in-chief. Along the way, he was named Australian Journalist of the Year in 1985, and through persistence and example, taught Australian journalists to use Freedom of Information laws as a matter of course. Jack WaterfordCredit:Graham Tidy Although he has nursed a lifelong case of imposter syndrome, Waterford said his inclusion in the list had been “awfully flattering and nice”. “It renews some sort of sense of being of a vast profession - something that's given an awful lot to me,"" he said. ""I've always thought I fell into this trade by accident. I've got a lot more from it, from my colleagues, from my readers and my friends than probably I've ever put into it myself, and I've always also said that I was going to stay in the trade until I got found out. [The Hall of Fame] is going to yet again increase the price of finding me out and throwing me out.” His erstwhile colleague Davidson, who died in 2004, had the distinction of being the first female political correspondent for a major newspaper in Australia and, by extension the first woman in the Canberra Press Gallery, where she famously insisted on a ladies’ lavatory. The New Zealand native was also a prolific writer with a deep understanding of politics, public policy and economics, reflected in her writing. “Gay was a damn fine journalist in everything she did at The Canberra Times - she invented and laid the pattern for Gang Gang, the column on page 3,” Waterford said. “She knew an awful lot about health and health politics, and she was terribly well connected to the bureaucracy. If you ever went over to the home she shared with her then-husband Ken Davidson, it was sort of veritable salon of journalists, public servants, politicians there, talking freely and essentially off the record, about things that you ought to know about.” Davidson was also a passionate public health campaigner, driven in large part by the death of her 13-year-old daughter Kiri from complications from a childhood case of measles in 1984. She would go on to use her expertise and contacts to make politicians, health officials and the public far more aware of the risks of measles, then regarded by many as a harmless childhood disease. She eventually left the profession to work in public relations, and worked on various boards and local causes. ""She was a New Zealander originally, but a real Canberra citizen,"" Waterford said.

A draft agreement on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union has been reached between representatives of both sides, alongside an Outline Political Declaration on a future relationship. It remains to be seen whether the British government is able to survive, and gain parliamentary support for the deal. Here, though, academic experts consider what adoption of the 585-page draft Withdrawal Agreement would mean. Read about its implications for Northern Ireland, citizens, sovereignty, the transition, the UK economy and the EU. Katy Hayward, Reader in Sociology, Queen’s University Belfast The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has clearly had a powerful influence on the UK’s negotiating position over the past few months. The revised Withdrawal Agreement text reveals an extraordinary effort to allay the concerns of unionists in Northern Ireland. This effort is not merely tokenistic. Most notably, it entails a major shift from the EU side to allow the inclusion of an all-UK-EU customs arrangement as a legally secure backstop. The text says that the backstop will only kick in if a future permanent agreement that avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland can’t be secured. The scenario in which, at the end of the transition period scheduled to end in December 2020, the UK stays in a customs union with the EU is outlined in the text’s Protocol on Northern Ireland/Ireland. Its primary purpose, therefore, is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. But by making this an all-UK arrangement in order to avoid checks “in the Irish Sea”, Theresa May has risked the wrath of the hardline Brexiteers in her own party. Read more: Brexit backstop: this is why it's so hard to talk about a Northern Ireland deal As part of the backstop, the protocol does allow for a minimal level of regulatory harmonisation between Northern Ireland and the EU necessary for the free movement of goods across the Irish border. This is stressed to be envisaged as a temporary arrangement, involving a small fraction of the EU rules that currently apply in Northern Ireland. But the DUP may well believe that its blood-red lines have been drawn too thickly to allow this. After achieving so much, the DUP’s stance and determination to vote down the deal in parliament could yet compound the risk of a no-deal scenario of the UK, the most disastrous effects of which would be felt in Northern Ireland. Michael Gordon, Professor of Constitutional Law, University of Liverpool Parliamentary approval for the deal is a legally required part of the ratification process. This follows the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 which stipulates that parliament must have a “meaningful vote” on the deal. The House of Commons, in particular, must now positively approve the lengthy, technical Withdrawal Agreement, as well as the shorter, and much more vague, political declaration concerning the future UK-EU relationship. This debate in the Commons will provide a forum for different lines of critique of the draft deal, and the consequences of rejection are not clear. For while different groups of MPs may object to the terms of the deal in similar ways – a common theme so far being the UK’s loss of influence over the EU rules it must accept in the transition period and perhaps beyond – there is no prospect of agreement about an alternative to the PM’s attempted compromise. Read more: What happens if parliament rejects a Brexit deal? Some MPs may reject this deal in favour of no deal at all. Others want a further referendum with the option to remain in the EU. Others want a general election and a change of government. In principle, all of these options remain open if the Commons voted against the deal. But it is not clear which (if any) can attract majority support – or whether there is sufficient time (without extending negotiations) for new national votes, before March 29, 2019. A particular point of legal controversy likely to be discussed in parliament relates to the “backstop”, which serves as a potential bridge from the transition to Britain’s future relationship with the EU. This could see the UK enter a “single customs territory” with the EU, and remain subject to aspects of EU law, without a unilateral exit clause for the UK. Critics say this interferes with the sovereignty of parliament. But, to me, this is misguided. As a matter of domestic law, the UK parliament could always act outside the proposed review procedure, which makes any decision to end the backstop arrangements a joint matter to be decided with the EU. But if the UK did act unilaterally, it would have to accept significant international consequences, and almost certainly lose any chance at negotiating a future free trade agreement with the EU. That would be an expensive choice to make, but in this sense parliament should not see the backstop as a limit on its legal sovereignty. Phil Syrpis, Professor of EU Law, University of Bristol In legal terms, the Draft Withdrawal Agreement is quite an achievement. It enables the UK to leave the EU, while at the same time preserving some – but not all – the advantages of EU membership. The overall structure is as follows. First, the UK enters into a period of transition, during which a) the UK will not participate in the governance of the EU, and b) EU law will remain applicable in the UK. Transition ends on December 31 2020, though the Joint Committee – co-chaired by the UK and European Union to oversee the withdrawal process – may “adopt a single decision extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]”. Next, with both parties alert to the fact that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot establish a permanent future relationship, there are complex provisions on the so-called Irish backstop. These provisions are, as the EU made clear throughout, to apply “unless and until” they are superseded by subsequent agreement. These provisions establish “a single customs territory” between the EU and the UK, including a number of “level playing field” commitments, which will, while the backstop is in place, limit the UK’s ability to diverge from EU standards. Finally, the Outline Political Declaration expresses the (non-legally binding) intention to replace the backstop with an agreement which ensures the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland. To the extent that the Withdrawal Agreement refers to union law, it is to be interpreted in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Time will tell how this compromise solution, similar in many ways to the EU’s current relationships with Turkey and the Ukraine, will be assessed. I rather feel that there may be too much entanglement with the EU here for Brexiters to swallow; and too much of a step down from single market membership to satisfy Remainers. Adrienne Yong, Lecturer at The City Law School, City, University of London The text of Part Two on Citizens’ Rights in this version of the Draft Withdrawal Agreement is largely replicated from the version published in March 2018. This is unsurprising given that the UK and EU indicated in March that EU citizens’ rights was one of the few things that were agreed upon by both parties early on. As such, there are few surprises on this front. The main point to highlight is that the rights to reside, entry and exit for EU citizens and their families largely derived from the Citizens’ Rights Directive 2004/38. If an EU citizen has not yet lived in the member state for the five years needed to get permanent residency, or arrives during the transition period (after March 29, 2019 and before December 31, 2020), then the agreement allows them the right to reside, assumedly subject to the rules under the EU’s settlement scheme. Children born after the UK’s withdrawal are also protected. What is still unclear is whether those known as “Zambrano carers” of British citizens, namely citizens from outside the UK who care for British citizens and who they depend on, are covered by the agreement. It may well become a case-by-case analysis of whether they fall under the definition of a “family member” under Article 9 of the Draft Withdrawal Agreement. Nauro Campos, Professor of Economics, Brunel University London The draft Withdrawal Agreement would guarantee a transition period during which the UK economic relationship with the EU remains unchanged. A no-deal, disorderly exit will be avoided, at least until the end of the transition period. Business will very much welcome this. It means it will not have to spend resources trying to minimise the severe economic disruption and significant negative effects of a disorderly exit. Another aspect I suspect will also be welcome is the proposed “single customs territory”. This will remain in place from the end of the transition period until “the future relationship becomes applicable”. This means the UK’s tariffs and rules of origin are aligned to the EU’s and operate in an “agreed level playing field”, covering labour rights, tax, competition and environment. One concern is how frictionless trade in goods will actually be. Another concern is that the single customs territory applies to goods not services. The latter of course includes financial services and the foreign investment inflows that come with them. Although the Draft Withdrawal is mostly silent on services, the Outline of the Political Declaration document is more explicit, as it states the goal of “ambitious, comprehensive and balanced arrangements on trade in services and investment”. Under financial services, it stipulates that equivalence assessments shall start as soon as the UK departs. The stated goal is to have them concluded “before the end of June 2020” (after which a decision to extend the transition period cannot be taken). For business, the good news the deal brings is that short-term uncertainty has been minimised. Given the still very real possibility of a no-deal Brexit, this is arguably the best feature of the agreements. Yet the ad hoc and short-term features of these interim agreements do not bode well for long-term investment planning. The bad news is old news: a large part of the UK economy (financial services) still doesn’t know what the future entails. The informed consensus remains that Brexit will make the UK permanently poorer over the long run and the agreement does little to change it. What the deal does is to establish that the economic costs will be smaller than in the case of a no-deal and that they are spread over a much longer period of time. Maria Garcia, Senior Lecturer, Politics, Languages & International Studies, University of Bath The Withdrawal Agreement sets out mechanisms to enable the smooth continuation of trade during the transition period (until December 2020), through the creation of a “single customs territory” made up of the UK and the EU customs union. During this period UK commercial policy would have to be in line with EU commercial policy, and the UK cannot make any trade deals with countries outside the EU. The exact shape of the future relationship beyond 2020 will be the outcome of negotiations that will only start once the Withdrawal Agreement is approved by both the UK and EU. It is not sketched out in detail in either document that makes up the deal on the table. But the list of topics when it comes to economic partnership beyond the transition period is comprehensive and in line with what the EU includes in modern free trade agreements (digital trade, intellectual property, government procurement, goods and services are all mentioned). The outline for future relations represents the special nature of this future agreement as it emphasises zero tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restriction on all goods, and an ambitious customs arrangement. How the customs arrangement will work after the transition period will be subject to negotiations and the degree to which there is alignment between UK and EU regulations. This would cover arrangements such as the levels of pesticides used in food and the chemicals allowed in paints. It should evolve from the single customs territory established during the transition period. But there is no reason to believe that the UK cannot have an independent trade agreement policy when the transition period ends. This depends on what long-term relationship the UK negotiates with the EU. The references to services in the draft agreement indicate a desire on both sides to maintain as open a services trading regime as possible, although it is unclear what the ultimate negotiated outcome will be after the transition period. Indeed, the wording is not dissimilar to that found in other trade agreements (national treatment, non-discrimination, arrangements on professional qualifications), but the actual degree of market access normally appears in lists and annexes with exclusions, which, of course, have yet to be negotiated. An important aspect is the inclusion of a commitment to begin work on equivalence assessments for financial services immediately after Brexit day, so as to limit disruptions to the sector. Both texts represent a compromise geared at minimising business and economic disruptions while the parties hammer out the practicalities of a future long-term arrangement. Nieves Perez-Solorzano Borragan, Senior Lecturer in European Politics, University of Bristol There has been cautious optimism in the European Union about the draft Withdrawal Agreement. As the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, put it, for the EU, negotiating Brexit is about limiting its negative effects. In this spirit of damage limitation the draft text delivers on the EU’s key priorities: an orderly Brexit, a mechanism to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and no “cherry picking” once the UK leaves on March 29, 2019. The challenges ahead for the remaining 27 EU member states – the EU27 – are threefold. First, to ensure that the UK signs on the dotted line. This is something the EU can only do so much about beyond watching events unfold on the other side of the channel. If a crisis situation requires it (such as a new general election in the UK) and if this is in the interest of the EU, it can extend the article 50 negotiation period. And it can continue its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario. Second, to ensure that the disciplined unity that has defined the EU27’s approach to the negotiation process continues until the agreement is finally concluded. Concerns have been raised by some national representatives (the Netherlands, France, Germany and Denmark) about the lack of detail on the functioning of the single EU-UK customs territory, and on whether this confers advantages to the UK on environmental or social regulation. On the other hand, Spain has seen its position strengthened by the incorporation in the text of structures for bilateral co-operation on Gibraltar. It’s also worth remembering that for the agreement to be concluded by the EU Council, not all governments need to agree to it. It will require a qualified majority, which means support from 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU27 population. Finally, this draft text is just a stage in the long marathon of negotiating UK-EU relations. During the Brexit negotiations, the EU has benefited from a favourable asymmetrical balance of power set up by article 50. Once the trade negotiations start, there will be a level playing field that will likely require a change in negotiating tactics. – For more evidence-based articles by academics, subscribe to our newsletter.

CHICO, Calif.—An army of searchers moved through the rubble of Paradise in a desperate search Friday to find more victims of California’s worst fire on record as the number of people missing skyrocketed. The death toll from the devastating Camp fire rose to 71 Friday, while the number of people reported missing jumped to more than 1,000, authorities said. Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea told reporters at a Thursday afternoon news conference that search crews had recovered eight more bodies in the burn area. The number of people unaccounted for rose to 1,011, up from 631 on Thursday evening, after authorities combed through additional 911 calls, emails and other reports generated at the peak of the chaotic evacuation. Honea said that number may include some people who are counted twice or others who may not know they were reported missing. The staggering toll was announced as President Donald Trump made plans to visit California to meet with people affected by the wildfires. It would mark his second trip as president to the nation’s most populous state. The Camp fire is by far the worst wildfire in recorded California history. By Thursday evening, the blaze had chewed through 141,000 acres and 11,862 structures, destroying an entire town in hours. Officials said it could take weeks to complete the search for victims. Thousands of survivors are without homes, living in shelters and tent cities. Mandatory evacuation orders were lifted in some areas and reduced to warnings as fire crews on the front lines boosted containment to 40 percent. “What that means is, if conditions change and fire begins to threaten that area, you have to be ready to go,” Honea said. The fire is also causing a major public health problem as smoke choked huge swaths of Northern California, including Sacramento and the Bay Area. Dozens of schools across the region canceled classes as authorities urged residents to remain indoors. At a town hall meeting in Chico late Thursday, Denise Davis showed up to reconnect with her community. There, the 53-year-old Paradise resident saw a neighbor whom she last saw in a driveway carrying someone else’s dog during evacuations. This community, she said, is why she’s coming back. “That’s why we’re going to rebuild,” she said. Jim Broshears, the town’s emergency operations center coordinator, told the audience of more than 100 that the town will rebuild. “We’re determined to start rebuilding the community — from you, up,” he said. “You are the foundation of the community.” But Mark Brown, the deputy incident commander for the fire, said the breadth of the devastation was like nothing he’d ever seen. “It’s at the scale of unprecedented magnitude,” he said. In Southern California, fire officials were optimistic Thursday that improved weather might help them get the upper hand against the devastating Woolsey fire. The blaze has charred 98,362 acres and claimed three lives in Los Angeles and Ventura counties since it broke out last week. More than 500 structures have been destroyed. Firefighters stopped the fire’s expansion and increased containment to 62 percent by Thursday evening. The gains came as strong winds that battered the region for three days finally diminished — a welcome development for those on the front lines. “I think we’re all hoping today will be a turning point for us in this fight,” said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Chris Anthony. “But we’re not ramping down. This is a huge fire, and there’s still a lot of containment that needs to be done.” Authorities are urging residents to stay cautious as the rainy season approaches and to prepare for potential mudflows in burned-out areas. Rain could arrive in the Los Angeles area late next week, according to extended weather forecasts. But meteorologists with the National Weather Service said it’s too soon to tell how much — if any — rain to expect. Across Northern California on Friday, people were dealing with unhealthy air quality from the fire. Unrelenting smoke smothers everything in Chico. The acidic and sour haze hangs on hair, skin and clothes. Some evacuees don’t have access to showers and clean towels, and the smoke from the deadly Camp fire feels impossible to escape. Hair is like a sponge and absorbs the smoke, said Holly Little, owner of Bleached Salon. The small salon on Manzanita Avenue is one of several offering free hair washes, blowouts and more to evacuees. At the nail counter, Paradise resident Laina Floraday was getting a free manicure Friday after finding out about the service from a friend. Floraday fled the Camp fire with her two young children, including one who has special needs, and her three dogs. Her house, her childhood home that she bought, was destroyed. Her husband spent four hours trapped near Pentz Road Market and eventually got out. “It was traumatizing,” Floraday said. She swapped stories about the fire and its aftermath with Megan Killingsworth, another Bleached Salon owner. Killingsworth said the salon started offering the services because she and Little felt helpless. “We don’t have money to give people,” she said. Her phone buzzed with texts from displaced people seeking to book appointments. Before leaving, Floraday took a free dry hairwash sample and an air mask from the salon. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) At JCPenney’s hair salon at the Chico Mall, an elderly woman — an evacuee from the fire — was getting her hair washed Friday in one of the salon’s black chairs. Her head was back, her eyes were closed. A few hundred people, men and women, have come in for the salon’s free hair services since the fire broke out, assistant manager Michelle Alconero said. She said it wasn’t a corporate decision — stylists decided to offer the services to evacuees. “It’s a moment to be normal,” Alconero said. “There’s a lot of stress.” ——— (Santa Cruz reported from Chico, Tchekmedyian and Panzar from Los Angeles.

The Titans (4-7) travel to Mooresville Friday night in the first round of the State 4A Playoffs. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titans freshman Grayson Blackwelder (3) makes a tackle during the Titans' win over West Caldwell Oct. 25. The Titans (4-7) travel to Mooresville Friday night in the first round of the State 4A Playoffs. Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. In the past, when the McDowell Titans have made the state playoffs, they’ve almost always been matched up against a highly seeded, powerhouse metro team in the first round. Guess what. The 12th-seeded Titans (4-7) face yet another difficult draw in the opening round of the State 4A Playoffs (small 4A) when they visit the No. 5 seed Mooresville Blue Devils (8-3) tonight (7:30 kickoff). At first glance, Mooresville’s 8-3 mark might not seem overwhelming. But take a closer look and you’ll realize appearances can be deceiving. All three of the Devils’ losses have come in the I-Meck Conference, which could make a valid case as the toughest in the state at any level. Mooresville has lost to Mallard Creek (10-0), Vance (9-1) and Hough (9-2). Vance’s only loss was to Mallard Creek; Hough’s two defeats came at the hands of Mallard Creek and Vance. Starting to get the picture? Suffice to say, the Titans face an uphill battle, especially on offense. Mooresville has only given up 228 points all year, with 50 of those coming in the loss to Mallard Creek, favorites to reach the 4AA state title game. “They’re very good,” said McDowell head coach Andy Morgan. “They might be the best defense we’ve played all year. I have a buddy at Vance and he told me they were one of the best defenses Vance played. They’re not huge, but they’re extremely athletic.” The Blue Devils are no slouches on offense, either. “Offensively, they run the football well,” said Morgan. “They have a quarterback who completes about 65 percent of his passes and has about 2,000 yards. They have multiple tailbacks that can hurt you. At receiver, they’re just incredibly athletic.” The Blue Devils rely heavily on junior quarterback Hunter Deberardino (6-1, 175). Deberardino is 128-of 233 for 1,854 yards and 20 touchdowns with nine interceptions. The top ground gainer is senior Quamir Connor (5-8, 185), who has rushed for 639 yards and six scores on 109 carries. Senior wide receiver Treymin Jackson (5-9, 165) has 25 receptions for 498 yards and six touchdowns, but the Blue Devils spread the wealth around; they have five other players with at least 200 receiving yards apiece. The Blue Devils have several quality front people on both sides of the ball, but senior tackle Damarcus Mills tends to jump out at you on film. Mills is 6-foot-7, 325 pounds and plays with a nasty streak. He has multiple offers from big-time D-I programs. Mooresville’s strong points even extend to the kicking game. Junior Isaac Riffle is 37-of-38 on extra points and 7-of-9 on field goals, with a long of 44 yards. He also averages nearly 38 yards per punt. Morgan said his team would have to take care of itself first and worry about the opponent later. It’s been two weeks since the Titans took the field for their regular-season finale at Freedom, a 40-13 loss. In the interim, McDowell has made progress despite a running battle with Mother Nature for practice time. “The weather has been awful, but we’ve been going ‘team’ pretty much and shoring things up,” said Morgan. “This late in the season, you just want to make sure you’re in the right place and have a good game plan on both sides of the ball. “We have to go out and execute. We have to take care of what we do before we can worry about the other team.” That means quarterback Adam Randolph will need to get untracked early against the Blue Devils. Randolph – in the midst of a record-breaking campaign – is 133-of-200 passing (67 percent) for a school-record 1,953 yards and a record-tying 18 touchdowns with 12 interceptions. He needs only 47 yards to become McDowell’s first-ever 2,000-yard passer. When Randolph takes to the air, he has two of the school’s top three career pass-catchers as targets. Dakota Effler (33 receptions, 505 yards, 6TDs) and Andruw Randolph (38-589-7TDs) are Nos. 2 and 3 respectively in all-time receiving yardage at MHS. Running back J.C. Olivo (23 receptions, 332 yards, 2TDs) and tight end Richard Handy (20-308-3TDs) have also gone past the 300-yard mark for the season. Olivo is also approaching the 1,000-yard mark on the ground, with 930 yards and nine TDs on 188 attempts. The senior is battling a nagging ankle sprain, but has not missed practice and should be able to go tonight. The only other injury of note is an ankle sprain sustained in the loss to Freedom by sophomore offensive guard Nehemiah McMillan. McMillan has started every game, but Morgan said he’s questionable for tonight. Andrew Davis (87 tackles), Johan Ayala (65), Brycen Seymore (63), Drew Green (60) and Bryce Allison (59) are the Titan’ top defenders. Allison, a senior defensive tackle, also leads the club in tackles for loss (8) and sacks (6), and is tied for the team lead in fumble recoveries (2) and caused fumbles (1).

Andrew,Davis,1947,https://wtop.com/baltimore/2018/11/baltimore-police-union-approves-new-labor-contract-with-city/,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Baltimore’s police union has announced that members have accepted a new labor agreement with the city that will increase civilian oversight of the troubled police department. The Baltimore Sun reports rank-and-file members voted Tuesday to accept the proposed agreement. Mayor Catherine Pugh and City Solicitor Andrew Davis called the vote a victory for both sides. The three-year contract includes 3 percent annual raises for officers and a return to five-day work weeks with 8.5-hour shifts, instead of four 10-hour shifts. The contract also offers “patrol incentive” bonuses amid patrol understaffing. The contract requires two civilian volunteers to serve alongside three officers on oversight panels. Some department members had resisted increased civilian oversight. Aside from a temporary contract earlier this year, the department has been without a long-term contract since the last one expired in June 2016. ___ Information from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

Bernard,Osher,1946,https://cccadvocate.com/10154/campus-beat/scholarship-grants-abound/,"By Cindy Pantoja, Opinion EditorNovember 14, 2018Filed under Campus Beat The 2019-20 scholarship application season has started and with more than $180,000 in funding available in scholarships through the Contra Costa College Foundation, students should already be filling out their applications. Any money is good money when trying to pay for college and scholarships offer students free money — usually awarded on a competitive basis. Recipients have to demonstrate hard work, volunteerism, leadership and community service in order to be selected. “Students are at the center of this scholarship process,” Foundation Development Officer Sara Marcellino said. “This is money donated from people who want our students to get an education.” At CCC, there are three ways to get a scholarship — through the Contra Costa College Foundation, the Kennedy-King Scholarship and external (off-campus) scholarships. According to the campus website, CCC Foundation Scholarships are a financial resource provided to students by the generosity of local businesses, community groups, alumni and a variety of other private donors. Currently, the Foundation offers 70 scholarships for students who want to study at CCC and for students who plan to transfer to a four-year university. The Foundation scholarship application process begins Nov. 1 and closes Feb. 18. Students have to fill out one online application at contracosta.edu/scholarships and the system will match them with the right scholarships. Only students who submit a complete application will be considered candidates for Foundation scholarships. Contracosta.academicworks.com lists the Bernard Osher as one of the scholarships offered by the Foundation and awards one student $1,100. The recipient must be enrolled at least half-time (six or more units) and have completed 24 or more units at CCC. The Kennedy-King Scholarship is a fund that awards recipients with an annual $5,000 scholarship. It is for students who will transfer to a four-year accredited U.S. college or university to obtain a bachelor’s degree. Students can download an application at kennedyking.org and have until Feb. 18 for submittal. “I don’t know about scholarships, but I would like to know more because I’m about to transfer,” business management major Frenchie Lee said. External scholarships are a financial resource offered by organizations outside of the CCC Foundation. These scholarships may be offered to students at the local, regional, statewide or even nationwide level. The Horatio Alger Association Scholarship is listed on contracosta.edu as a trusted external scholarship. It awards $10,000 to a student who will graduate from a high school in California in 2019 with a minimum 2.0 GPA and can demonstrate financial hardships. This past May, The Advocate reported about a malfunction in the system which granted scholarships with specific criteria to the wrong candidates. It left students, such as those in the nursing department, without the opportunity to get specific scholarships. A new requirement criterion was added to the selection system last term and the website is expected to work as it should this term. “We are constantly working on the website trying to make it user-friendly. Over the summer, we were able to address and fix previous problems,” Marcellino said. Scholarships come to those who apply early and take the time to fulfill all the requirements. It is a task that requires time and effort. Many on campus know that students struggle with this process and workshops are available to help. English department assistant professor Maritez Apigo said, “In our workshops, English professors help students with any stage of writing the UC personal insight questions. During the spring semester, we will be offering the same services to students on their scholarship essays.” The workshops are held in the Library and Learning Resource Center. Students need to be registered in English 875N-2854, which is free, in order to use the services offered in LLRC-121. Students often get caught up in the application process and it is estimated that filling out an application takes about two hours. However, there are other requirements such two letters of recommendation, college transcripts and proof of community service work that would take more time to acquire. Apigo said, “Don’t procrastinate. Let your true self and personality come out in your responses. The universities want to get to know you in a personal way. It’s something they can’t do from your transcripts and other parts of your application.” Tags: ccc scholarships, College scholarships, Contra Costa College Foundation, financial aid, grants, llrc, scholarship applications, scholarships If you want a picture to show with your comment, go get a gravatar.

John,O'Neil,1944,http://www.wwnytv.com/story/39497345/chloe-ann-oneil-fondly-remembered,"A sixth grade teacher turned political leader, a trusted adviser, a tireless volunteer. That's how people were remembering Chloe Ann O'Neil a day after her death. “Anytime there was a need she would be there...She definitely was the go-to person no matter what you needed,” said Chris Caringi, former Parishville deputy clerk. The crash that took O'Neil's life comes 26 years after the one that took the life of her husband, John. That tragedy in 1992 hit the town hard, just as this one is now. “She has influenced and touched so many lives. She will never leave us. We are going to have her forever,” said Caringi, former Parishville deputy clerk. John O'Neil represented the 112th District in the state Assembly. When he died, Chloe Ann, a teacher in the Parishville-Hopkinton Central School District, ran for the office and won. She served 5 years and became a political mentor to many. “I've always been able to reach out to her, seek advice from her, and sometimes even when I wasn't seeking advice from her, she made sure to reach out to me and discuss various matters,” said Rodney Votra, Parishville town supervisor. The last place many saw Chloe Ann O'Neil was at the Parishville Town Hall on Election Day. She was the Parishville election coordinator. She helped out at fire department auxiliary events and volunteered at Canton-Potsdam Hospital. The town is already taking steps to memorialize O'Neil. A small plot of land at the center of town will be made into a park and it will be named for Chloe Ann and her husband, John. A fitting tribute to two who did so much to shape life for the better. Arrangements are with the Garner Funeral Service in Potsdam.

Steve,Cummings,1941,http://www.comicsbeat.com/matt-chats-celebrating-the-end-of-wayward-and-beginning-of-champions-with-steve-cummings/,"The Beat The News Site of Comics Culture 11/13/2018 4:30 pm by Matt O'Keefe Leave a Comment After discussing the Wayward finale with Jim Zub last week I was thrilled to also get to speak with artist Steve Cummings about the series. His penciled-only line art stands out from anything else on the shelves, creating an otherworldliness perfectly suiting the mysterious world of Wayward where new secrets are discovered with every issue. Beyond that, Japan feels fully realized thanks to Cumming’s intimate knowledge of the location, making the setting feel like a major element of the series instead of just window dressing. I spoke to Steve about those subjects, how his life has (or hasn’t) changed with a successful Image series, and his upcoming stint on Champions. Keep reading to find the answers to those questions and more I usually find comics that go from pencils to colors to look unfinished, but I don’t get that feeling at all with Wayward. Is there anything you do differently to make that work so well? Thank you for noticing. I don’t have a secret penciling method other than to try and aim for the feel of inked line weight when I draw. To get that effect I use no only .5 lead mechanical pencils but also .2, .3, and .4 as well as B lead for getting thicker lines the quickest. You live in Japan so I imagine it was easy enough to find reference for scenes set there, but you’re a long way from Ireland! How did you prepare to draw that setting in Wayward? You are right about that! For Japan, I was able to just head outside and find a suitable location to take pictures at. I was aiming to include a lot of Showa period buildings and streets and it helps there is still a lot of that local to me but for Ireland, I was out of luck. Fortunately, we were working with a writer from Ireland for our backmatter named Ann O’Regan for the sections dealing with Ireland and she was very helpful in getting me reference photos for locations and explaining details about Irish yokai. How familiar were you with Japanese mythology prior to drawing Wayward? I am familiar with the local mythology but we were dealing with folklore. A lot of that has been envisioned by Japanese creators over the decades, most notably Mizuki Shigeru, so they feel almost like they have had the Disney treatment here. For that reason, it is honestly hard not to be familiar with at least some of them but with the more popular creatures. We did end up using a lot of the less well-known ones and that made it an interesting learning experience. Did your personal interpretation of the myths inform how you drew the supernatural aspects of the story? We gave all the creatures we used our own twist (no matter how strong that was). The goal was to make them our own and I think we achieved that goal completely! Is it a fine line balancing the manga elements in Wayward with the use of a more Western drawing style? You know, that didn’t even cross my mind while working on this. I just drew the book as I wanted to in the most comfortable art style and I am really happy with the results. The group of characters looks genuinely older at the end of the series than they did at the beginning. Was that a conscious effort on your part? Yes! I did aim to make them feel more world-weary and battle-damaged. They had been through a lot and some of them had considerable physical changes (Shirai) occur in the course of the story. What have you learned as an artist over the course of illustrating 30 issues of Wayward? The thing I learned that was probably the most important was to turn off the computer while drawing because it is a giant distraction. Beyond that, it was to force me to get outside and exercise in order to help feel good. Sitting this much isn’t good for the body. Art-wise I became more comfortable with different sizes of mechanical pencil and learned to use them for certain specific parts of the art and that helped me speed up. Being a slow artist by nature that was a big help in getting all those dense pages done. How has your experience been so far on Champions? It has been great! Because Jim is involved it feels like a continuation of the Wayward experience I had over these last 4 years. And honestly, it was since the very next day after drawing the last page of Wayward I was working on Champions! In both cases, the writing style was the same so it made the transition smooth and comfortable. Has your life changed with a successful, steady career drawing comics? It hasn’t really. I still wake up and start drawing and finish in the evening which is the same thing I have been doing since the early 2000’s. But a taste of doing creator-owned in a big way makes me excited to jump back in and do another series!

Steve,Cummings,1941,https://www.theinertia.com/surf/nazare-big-wave-surf-raw-footage-portugal/,"On November 9, Nazare went wild. It’s one of the most incredible places on earth. A massive underwater canyon funnels deep ocean swells directly towards the now-famous lighthouse. The vantage point has provided a glut of photos and video that has turned Nazare into a worldwide phenomenon, as has the record-breaking surfing. “The waves follow the direction of the canyon,” says Steve Cummings (also known as Jacuzzi Surfer), “and you can literally watch waves begin to form miles away, and then suddenly make a sharp turn.” All the usual suspects turned out, including Garrett McNamara, Rodrigo Koxa, Andrew “Cotty” Cotton, Sebastian Steudtner, Francisco Porcella, Carlos Burle, Justine Dupont, Lucas Chumbo, and more.

John,O'Neil,1940,http://www.wwnytv.com/story/39491451/former-assemblywoman-chloe-ann-oneil-killed-in-crash,"A law enforcement source confirms former state Assemblywoman Chloe Ann O'Neil was killed in a two vehicle crash in Franklin County Thursday morning. State police said the 75 year old Parishville was killed in the collision, which happened at the intersection of State Route 11B and County Route 5 in the town of Dickinson. O'Neil was elected to the state Assembly in 1993, weeks after the December death of her husband, Assemblyman John O'Neil, who was also killed in a car crash. She was elected to fill his vacancy and served in the post until 1998. Troopers said a car driven by 29 year old Angel Oliver of Bombay was traveling southbound on County Route 5 and failed to yield the right of way to O’Neil's vehicle. According to police, Oliver's car struck O’Neil’s vehicle on the driver side causing O’Neil's vehicle to roll over and come to rest on the passenger side in a ditch. Oliver was transported to the University of Vermont Medical Center at Alice Hyde in Malone, where she is being treated for minor injuries. O’Neil was pronounced dead at the scene. She had been a longtime teacher in the Parishville-Hopkinton Central School District. Her husband was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1981 to 1992.

John,O'Neil,1940,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/12/kitty-oneil-obituary,"Anthony Hayward Mon 12 Nov 2018 09.59 EST Last modified on Mon 12 Nov 2018 12.14 EST Kitty O’Neil, who has died aged 72, was a trailblazer for women in the Hollywood stunt industry. After becoming the first woman to join the elite team at Stunts Unlimited, in 1976, she was a double for the stars of two hit American TV series. Standing in for Lynda Carter in Wonder Woman from 1977 until 1979, she memorably leapt head first from a height of 127ft from the roof of the Valley Hilton hotel in Sherman Oaks, California. As she landed on the pool terrace after performing a flip in mid-air, O’Neil hit a life-saving air bag with precision. The superhero – the first woman to feature prominently in American comic books – was then seen apprehending a villain leaving the hotel. The fearless stunt artist was confronting the bad guys again (they were invariably male) in The Bionic Woman (1976-78) when she doubled for Lindsay Wagner as Jaime Sommers, who had been rebuilt with bionic legs, right arm and right ear, following a near-fatal skydiving accident. The character used her human-made superpowers while serving as a government intelligence agent – and performing stunts such as flipping a dune buggy that were all in a day’s work for O’Neil. Women doing stunts in Hollywood could be traced back to “damsel in distress” actors performing their own hair-raising exploits during the silent-film era, although the job of stunt performer was overwhelmingly taken by men – who doubled for both male and female stars (and still do). The Stuntwomen’s Association of Motion Pictures was formed in 1967 and O’Neil’s brilliance helped to make the Hollywood establishment take women seriously. However, female stunt artists still face discrimination, allied to the challenge of doing the same work as men while often wearing skimpy outfits that allow no room for padding. Away from television, O’Neil set a string of land, air and water records. In 1976 she became the fastest female driver by hitting 512.71mph in a hydrogen peroxide-fuelled three-wheel machine, the SMI Motivator, in the Alvord desert, Oregon – a record that still stands. She also set two women’s speed records on water – skiing at 104.85mph in 1970 and piloting the jet-powered boat Captain Crazy at 275mph in 1977. She broke her own 1979 women’s high-fall record – the Wonder Woman stunt – by jumping 180ft from a helicopter on to an air bag that, she said, looked like a postage stamp from that height. All these daredevil achievements came against a backdrop of O’Neil having lost her hearing when she was four months old after contracting measles and smallpox. “Because I was deaf, I had a very positive mental attitude,” O’Neil explained. “You have to show people you can do anything.” She was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, to Patsy (nee Compton) and John O’Neil. Her father was an oil prospector turned US army air forces major. After Kitty became deaf, her mother taught her lip-reading and how to speak, and she learned to play the piano and cello by sensing subtle changes in vibrations. At the age of 12, Kitty took up diving and won local and state competitions. In 1962, on moving to Anaheim, California, she trained with the Olympic gold medal-winning diver and coach Sammy Lee while attending Savanna high school. She won the 10-metre competition at the 1964 Amateur Athletic Union diving national championships, but her hopes of representing the US in that year’s Olympics were dashed when she broke her wrist and also suffered spinal meningitis. She subsequently switched to water-skiing, then car racing and cross-country motorcycle racing. When she severed two fingers in a bike accident in 1972, Ronald “Duffy” Hambleton, a fellow racer, took her to hospital and gave the go-ahead for them to be re-attached. The couple lived together for several years and Hambleton introduced her to the stunt performer and coordinator Hal Needham, who had co-founded Stunts Unlimited. She joined his racing team and he trained her as a stunt performer. After working on the film Airport 1975 (1974), O’Neil doubled for Lee Grant drowning in a sinking jet plane in its sequel, Airport ’77 (1977), and was set on fire during a graveyard seance for September 30, 1955 (1977), a fictional drama about fans’ reactions to James Dean’s death. Her other films included Damien: Omen II (1978), The Blues Brothers (1980) and Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), the last of these directed by Needham and starring his friend Burt Reynolds, in which she drove the lead car jumping over trucks. Her fame was honoured with a Kitty O’Neil action figure made by Mattel and the TV movie Silent Victory: The Kitty O’Neil Story (1979), with Stockard Channing in the lead role and O’Neil performing some of the stunts. Although she declared herself to be afraid of nothing, O’Neil retired from stunt performing in 1982 after the deaths of several friends, then lived with Ky Michaelson, designer of rocket-powered vehicles, in Minneapolis. In 1993 she moved to Eureka, South Dakota, with her new partner, Raymond Wald, who died in 2009. Her marriages to John Piazza (1967) and Thomas Justice (1980) both ended in divorce. • Kitty Linn O’Neil, stunt performer, born 24 March 1946; died 2 November 2018

John,O'Neil,1940,http://www.mayonews.ie/comment-opinion/down-memory-lane/32930-the-unsolved-murder-of-the-tiernaur-scotsman,"County ViewJohn HealyWhen a dour, austere Scottish grazier took up residence in Tiernaur, Newport, a century and a half ago, little did he realise that it was akin to signing his own death warrant.James Hunter had taken the lease of 4,300 acres of Tiernaur from one Henry Smith, and set up home in Newfield with his wife, Helen, where soon after his daughter Joanna and son, Simon, were born.The vast tract of land was one-third arable; much of the rest was leased to impoverished tenants, whose rents would provide Hunter with a steady income. However, the lease had omitted to mention that the same tenants had turbary rights – the right to harvest and save turf – on Hunter’s bogland, free of charge, a concession going back many years. Hunter was unhappy with this so the owner, Smith, agreed to pay him a small rebate, on behalf of the tenants, in return for the turbary rights.Come 1861, and the land leased to Hunter was sold on to Rev Dr Richard Gibbings, a Fellow of Dublin University. An impasse soon developed when Hunter now demanded a higher rebate than he had been getting from Smith, and Gibbings flatly refused.This prompted Hunter to start putting pressure on the tenants, charging them with trespass on his bog. He took as his specific target John O’Neil, a neighbour, one of the more prosperous of his tenants. He sued him for trespass, believing that the other tenants would soon fall into line.In pursuing this course, Hunter was too stubborn to realise the dangerous path he was embarking on. Agrarian unrest was becoming widespread; hostility towards graziers on the part of subsistence tenants was on the increase; bitterness between Protestant and Catholic clergy was reaching a new low. There was huge resentment against the landlord class. Hunter had already been warned by many of his peers that he was putting himself in grave danger with his harsh treatment of his tenants.When the case came before the County Assizes in 1869, Hunter was awarded five shillings damages against John O’Neil. But worse still was that £48 in legal costs – a fortune at the time – was charged against O’Neil, who was neither able nor willing to pay. The unrelenting Hunter returned to court to get an Ejectment Order against the tenant, and a distress warrant allowing him to seize O’Neil’s hard-won autumn crop.He was to pay a high price for his victory. On the following Sunday, he chose to keep watch over the seized crops rather than attend church in Newport. His wife and son travelled by sidecar driven by Thady Kean, but the car broke down on the return journey to Newfield. Kean rode on ahead to the house to get a replacement car, and Hunter insisted on returning with him to where his wife and son were waiting at the roadside. Hunter drove the car back, but as he slowed to enter the byroad to his home, a shot rang out and he fell dead into his wife’s arms.Up to fourteen suspects were arrested in the aftermath of the murder, but the authorities were up against a wall of silence. A reward of £700 for information went unclaimed. When finally five defendants went on trial at Newport Petty Sessions, the Crown offered no further evidence. They were all discharged.Sitting in support in the crowded courtroom were Fr Richard Prendergast, PP, and Fr John Concannon, who – to the annoyance of Lord Sligo on the bench – broke into applause as the verdict was announced.

Sara,Burns,1936,https://www.vancourier.com/another-delay-in-case-of-man-accused-of-killing-four-people-in-fredericton-1.23497402,"November 14, 2018 08:16 AM FREDERICTON — There is yet another delay in the case of a Fredericton man accused of murdering two police officers and two civilians in an August shooting spree. Provincial court Judge Julian Dickson has adjourned the case until next Wednesday for a decision on a request for an assessment to determine if Matthew Raymond is fit to stand trial. Dickson has imposed a publication ban on any information or arguments dealing with that application. Last week, the case had been adjourned to allow the courts to appoint new defence counsel for Raymond. That new counsel is Moncton-based lawyer Alison Menard. Raymond is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright on Aug. 10 outside an apartment complex on the northside of the city. Raymond had said he felt he was not being defended by his first lawyer — Nathan Gorham — and tried numerous times to fire him. During a previous court appearance, Raymond suggested Gorham was withholding evidence that would allow him to be ""exonerated"" immediately because of temporary insanity. ""Mr. Raymond's obviously mistaken belief that Mr. Gorham could present evidence to exonerate him at this stage of proceeding suggests that possibly he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings,"" Dickson said last week. ""Mr. Raymond's statements also suggest to me that he is not able to communicate meaningfully with counsel or to understand the role of counsel."" During previous court appearances, Raymond had a long greying beard, but was clean shaven Wednesday. Unlike previous appearances, he did not try to speak to the judge. Raymond is alleged to have fired from his apartment window with a long gun, killing the two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip, and the two police officers as they responded to the scene. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. › November 18, 2018 November 17, 2018 June 1, 2018 November 19, 2018 September 14, 2018 October 22, 2018 December 1, 2016 May 2, 2018 November 17, 2018 November 13, 2018 December 6, 2012 November 19, 2018 November 19, 2018 November 19, 2018 November 19, 2018 November 19, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 November 17, 2018 November 17, 2018 The official Canucks blog of the Vancouver Courier You want stories about bags of chips?

Michael,Gordon,1935,https://www.kalb.com/content/news/Inmates-show-off-musical-talents-at-Raymond-Laborde-Prison-honor-special-guest-500347641.html,"COTTONPORT, La. (KALB) - For those whose lives were marked by a mistake that led them to prison, it doesn't have to be the end of the line. Not when music can be part of their rehabilitation. That's the story for some inmates at the Raymond Laborde Correctional Center in Cottonport who are learning to play guitar from local music master, John De Chiaro. One of those is Michael Gordon. ""I broke the law and I came to jail,” said Gordon. “I didn't hurt anybody, but I did break the law."" Gordon has had a knack for playing music and entertaining for quite some time. But he didn't realize how much he needed it until he was behind bars. ""I didn't want to be on this world anymore,” remembered Gordon. “But that's changed since I’ve gotten here. I see things in a different way."" That’s where De Chiaro’s lessons comes in. He meets with Gordon, and other inmates, once a week to teach them a thing or two on the strings. ""These guys can't wait to get their hands on a guitar, to practice, to get ready for this concert,"" expressed De Chiaro. They practiced a bit of classical and modern pieces, even threw in some Mozart to perform in a concert on Monday night. De Chiaro said it's just as rewarding for him. ""After 40 years of full-time teaching, I have never felt more wanted or appreciated as a teacher than here,” said De Chiaro. So how did this all start? It's not a hard answer to come by. Everybody you ask gives credit to the same person; Sara Simmonds. ""I had lunch with Sara one day, and she asked if I would be interested in going down to a prison,"" remembered De Chiaro. ""Sara did this,” expressed Gordon. “She brought him (De Chiaro) up here to play a little thing so we could see what it was like."" Simmonds was instrumental in getting the program kicked off, even providing the guitars for the inmates. Not to mention years earlier helping to get a chapel built in the prison. ""I don't know how all this started, but it just opened up,” said Simmonds. “And the ball started rolling and just kept going. They're so good to me when I come down here. They're glad to see me. And I’m glad to see them too."" And after you do so much, naturally the favor is returned. Sometimes in the form of a homemade gift like an inmate-made plaque, or, more suitable for this case, a song titled “I Know an Angel.” “Oh my heavens, just unspeakable joy,” expressed Simmonds when asked about the gesture. “Unspeakable joy."" Once the concert was said and done, it was an accomplishment in many ways for the musicians. ""You can't just write people off,” said De Chiaro. “They may have made a mistake somewhere down the line. But it doesn't mean that don't have a lot to offer. And that's the beauty of something like this. You can see what they have, what makes them tic you know."" But the biggest thing for Michael is that De Chiaro and Simmonds don't see him as an inmate, or even a musician. They see him as Michael Gordon, a person. ""That's hard to find in this world, brother,” expressed Gordon. “Convicts don't find people to back them up. It's hard."" And that's worth more than any song. ""I believe in this program,” said Gordon. “I believe it's going to do some good. I really do.""

By Jordan S. Rubin Justices Stephen G. Breyer and Clarence Thomas squared off Nov. 13 with dueling writings stemming from the high court’s refusal to take up several death penalty cases. The rejections also spurred Justice Sonia Sotomayor to write separately on the issue, as she has done several times already this term. The case of Michael Gordon Reynolds as well as several other petitions recently denied called on the court to apply its 2016 decision in Hurst v. Florida. In Hurst, the court said Florida’s death penalty scheme violated the Constitution because it required a judge rather than a jury to find the aggravating circumstances necessary to impose a death sentence. Florida’s Supreme Court has applied Hurst retroactively to capital defendants whose sentences became final after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2002 decision in Ring v. Arizona, where the court said Arizona’s death penalty scheme violated the Constitution because it required a judge rather than a jury to find the aggravating circumstances necessary to impose a death sentence. But the state top court has declined to apply Hurst retroactively to defendants whose sentences became final before Ring. Breyer questioned the state court’s 2002 cut-off and used his separate writing—styled a statement “respecting the denial of certiorari""—to discuss broader concerns about the death penalty. He noted the court has denied review in over 80 similar cases in recent weeks. Breyer said Reynolds’ case and others raise multiple issues: “the unconscionably long delays that capital defendants must endure as they await execution,” the pre-2002 retroactivity issue, and the question whether the Eighth Amendment requires a jury rather than a judge to make the ultimate decision to sentence a defendant to death. Taken together, these issues raise the question whether the juries in these cases truly rendered a “community-based judgment that the sentence constitutes proper retribution,” Breyer wrote. Had jurors known about these issues at the time of sentencing, “some might have hesitated before recommending a death sentence,” Breyer said. “At least a few might have recommended a life sentence instead,” he said. “The result is that some defendants who have lived under threat of execution for decades might never have been sentenced to death in the first place.” Breyer called on the court once again to take on the constitutionality of capital punishment generally, a prospect it declined last term. Thomas devoted his concurrence in the denial of review to rebutting Breyer’s concerns. He began with a recitation of the facts of Reynolds’ case. The defendant murdered “nearly an entire family” in 1998, Thomas noted, going on to recount the vicious details of the crime. In light of Reynolds’ actions, Thomas has “no such worry” similar to Breyer’s that the jury’s decision for retribution was proper. Thomas then said Breyer’s broader concerns are unwarranted, including Breyer’s concern about the death penalty generally. “The only thing ‘cruel and unusual’ in this case,” Thomas wrote, “was petitioner’s brutal murder of three innocent victims.” Sotomayor acknowledged that Reynolds and others have been convicted of “gruesome crimes.” But she dissented from the court’s refusal to hear their cases because, she said, “it is this Court’s duty to ensure that all defendants, even those who have committed the most heinous crimes, receive a sentence that is the result of a fair process.” The case is Reynolds v. Florida, U.S., 18–5181, review denied 11/13/18. Copyright © 2018 The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.

Michael,Gordon,1935,https://www.courthousenews.com/florida-death-penalty-cases-trigger-diverging-high-court-opinions/,"WASHINGTON (CN) — Three Supreme Court justices defended their votes Tuesday after the court rejected its 84th death-penalty case in recent weeks involving the same claim against Florida. As with the preceding cases, the challenge here by Michael Gordon Reynolds sought retroactive application of Hurst v. Florida, a 2016 ruling in which the Supreme Court found the Sunshine State’s death-penalty scheme unconstitutional because it required a judge rather than a jury to find the aggravating circumstances necessary to impose a death sentence. Though the Florida bench has retroactively applied the Hurst holding to capital defendants whose sentences became final after 2002, capital defendants like Reynolds whose sentences became final before 2002 have been denied relied. The basis for the cutoff is Ring v. Arizona, a 2002 decision in which the Supreme Court ruled against a similar death-penalty scheme in a different state. With the Supreme Court rejecting the challenge today by Reynolds, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that a more prudent course of action would be to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty itself, “rather than attempting to address the flaws in piecemeal fashion.” Though Breyer raised the possibility that Reynolds may not have been sentenced to die if the jurors had to confront various issues with the death-penalty scheme, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that the facts of Reynolds’ case should “alleviate [his] concerns.” “The only thing ‘cruel and unusual’ in this case was petitioner’s brutal murder of three innocent victims,” the opinion from Thomas states. Thomas noted Reynolds was convicted of murdering nearly an entire family in 1998. He began with the father, bashing in Danny Ray Privett’s head with a piece of concrete as Privett relieved himself outside of the family’s camping trailer. Not wanting to leave any witnesses, Reynolds “entered the trailer, where he brutally beat, stabbed, and murdered Privett’s girlfriend, Robin Razor, and their 11-year-old daughter, Christina Razor,” the Thomas opinion states. “Only petitioner knows whether Robin had to watch her daughter die, or whether Christina had to watch her mother die,” the opinion continues. Thomas added that “the sole surviving family member, Danielle, ‘was spared only because she was spending the night with a friend.’” Speaking to Breyer’s concern about how long it takes for the death penalty to be administered — saying it could take 40 years after the jury’s verdict — Thomas called this “a reason to carry out the death penalty sooner, not to decline to impose it.” “It is no mystery why it often takes decades to execute a convicted murderer,” Thomas added. “The ‘labyrinthine restrictions on capital punishment] promulgated by this court’ have caused the delays that Justice Breyer now bemoans.” Thomas also balked at Breyer’s concern about unequal treatment: that Reynolds will still be executed while others sentenced to die in the same manner have been awarded resentencing. “Whether he deserves to be sentenced to death has nothing to do with whether a different person who engaged in different conduct might be entitled to be resentenced on procedural grounds,” Thomas wrote. “Moreover, if petitioner had been resentenced, and was again sentenced to death, I have little doubt that Justice Breyer would instead be fretting that the original jury failed to consider his belief that resentencing “sharpens’ ‘death row’s inevitable anxieties and uncertainties.’” The opinion concludes with Thomas arguing that Reynolds’ jury was indeed made to shoulder the enormity of sentencing and “nonetheless … returned not one but two unanimous death recommendations.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor rounded out the opinions in the Reynolds case with a dissent, specifying that Reynolds is one of seven Florida capital defendants in today’s order list whose sentences should be revisited. “The jurors in petitioners’ cases were repeatedly instructed that their role was merely advisory, yet the Florida Supreme Court has treated their recommendations as legally binding by way of its harmless-error analysis,” Sotomayor wrote. “This approach raises substantial Eighth Amendment concerns. As I continue to believe that ‘the stakes in capital cases are too high to ignore such constitutional challenges,’ I would grant review to decide whether the Florida Supreme Court’s harmless-error approach is valid in light of Caldwell. This court’s refusal to address petitioners’ challenges signals that it is unwilling to decide this issue. I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari, and I will continue to note my dissent in future cases raising the Caldwell question.” The Supreme Court decided the case Caldwell v. Mississippi in 1985, holding that it is “constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant’s death rests elsewhere.”

Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 2:24 pm BALTIMORE (AP) — Baltimore's police union has announced that members have accepted a new labor agreement with the city that will increase civilian oversight of the troubled police department. The Baltimore Sun reports rank-and-file members voted Tuesday to accept the proposed agreement. Mayor Catherine Pugh and City Solicitor Andrew Davis called the vote a victory for both sides. The three-year contract includes 3 percent annual raises for officers and a return to five-day work weeks with 8.5-hour shifts, instead of four 10-hour shifts. The contract also offers ""patrol incentive"" bonuses amid patrol understaffing. The contract requires two civilian volunteers to serve alongside three officers on oversight panels. Some department members had resisted increased civilian oversight. Aside from a temporary contract earlier this year, the department has been without a long-term contract since the last one expired in June 2016. ——— Information from: The Baltimore Sun, http://www.baltimoresun.com Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

The organization posted, ""Just hours into the journey, they were stopped by Mexican federales, detained for hours w/out food & water, some vomiting & shaking."" This group is a 501( c )( 3 ) nonprofit agency that promotes justice by providing free and low-cost legal services to underserved immigrant children, families, and refugees in Texas. A bill passed last week in Mexico's Senate granting same-sex couples equal social- security benefits as heterosexuals now moves to the Chamber of Deputies, where advocates expect it will be voted into law, according to an OpenlyNews.com item that cites Reuters. The vote in the country's recently sworn-in upper house was unanimous. President-Elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's Morena party won a majority in both the upper and lower houses of parliament in the July 1 election. With the government of Saint Lucia recently meeting with the Cannabis Movement, a group representing LGBT people on the island is hoping to meet with the government as well to discuss its issues, StLuciaNewsOnline.com reported. United and Strongthe only LGBT group on the island, and one that is celebrating 18 years of existencehopes to meet with the prime minister in an agreeable and non-hostile environment. Poland President Andrzej Duda has said that he he would ""seriously"" consider a law banning ""homosexual propaganda"" in schools and scouting organizations, according to PinkNews. ""I think that this kind of propaganda should not take place in schools, it has to be calmly and consistently opposed,"" he told Polish-language newspaper Nasz Dziennik. If such a law were put forward for consideration, it would likely be similar to the one currently in place in Russia, which bars ""gay propaganda."" The chief marketing officer of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret, has apologized for comments he made in an interview with Vogue about transgender models, The Huffington Post noted. Ed Razek said he didn't think transgender models should walk the runway because the show ""is a fantasy. It's a 42-minute entertainment special."" The company later published a statement from Razek in which he apologized for his ""remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion show"" that ""came across as insensitive."" Many social-media users, including trans model Isis King, expressed disdain about the apology. A gay London manaccused in September of duping four straight men into having oral and anal sex by posing as a woman on Tinder and other dating appswas sentenced to 15 years in prison, according to a NewNowNext.com item that cites Evening Standard. Duarte Xavier, 33, was found guilty of six charges of causing a person to engage in sex without consent. The court heard a statement from one victim who claimed he suffers from ""extreme stress, anxiety, panic attacks and depression"" after being used for Xavier's ""own sick fantasy."" Lesbian YouTube star Jessica Kellgren-Fozard will receive a honorary degree from the United Kingdom's University of Worcester, Gay Star News noted. Kellgren-Fozard has long advocated for disability and LGBTI rights through her YouTube channel and blog. Comedian Jo Brand, Holocaust survivor Mindu Hornick and former England women's soccer player Marieanne Spacey-Cale will also receive honorary degrees from the university. On Nov. 11, French President Emmanuel Macron, who has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy, used his speech to decry excessive ""nationalism"" at the root of the First World War and succeeding conflicts, USA Today reported. Trump and other global leaders gathered in Paris to mourn the dead of World War I and heed the harsh lessons designed to prevent future conflict. ""Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism,"" Macron told a gathering of world leaders that ranged from Russian President Vladimir Putin to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as Trump. Ten men arrested for allegedly conducting a same-sex marriage ceremony on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar are to face a forced anal examination, activists told The Guardian. The UN Committee against Torture has said such examinations ""have no medical justification"" and campaigners say they violate international law. On a related note, the European Union has recalled the head of its delegation to Tanzania because of what it calls a ""deterioration of the human rights and rule of law"" in the east African nation, CNN.com reported. The move to withdraw its ambassador, Roeland van de Geer, comes after severe international criticism over a crackdown on LGBT Tanzanians. Fiona Mozley has been awarded the Polari First Book Prize for her debut novel, Elmet, according to The Telegraph. Now in its eighth year, the prize is awarded annually to a writer whose first book explores the LGBT experience in poetry, prose, fiction or non-fiction. Mozley's win was announced at a ceremony at London's Southbank Centre as part of the London Literature Festival. Barilla gave attendees of a contest in Italy boxes of spaghetti with a drawing of lesbians on the box, LGBTQ Nation reported. At the World Pasta Championshipan event Barilla sponsorsin Milan last month, hundreds of limited-edition boxes of spaghetti no. 5 were dispensed. In 2013, Barilla chairman Guido Barilla said in a radio interview: ""I would never do an ad with a homosexual family. … If the gays don't like it, they can go an eat another brand."" He later apologized. Gay scenes have reportedly been censored from Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody in cinemas throughout Malaysia, PinkNews reported. Queen fans in Malaysia have reported that 24 minutes have been cut from the 133-minute long movie, including a crucial scene where Mercury tells Mary Austin that he is bisexual, according to The Daily Mail. Censors have also reportedly taken out a scene in which the band are dressed in drag for the video for 1984 hit ""I Want To Break Free."" A Japanese broadcaster ( TV Asahi ) canceled a live TV appearance of the popular Korean band BTS after a photo went viral of a band member wearing a T-shirt showing an atomic bombing juxtaposed with the celebration of Korea's liberation from Japan after World War II, Page Six noted. Japanese social media was filled with chatter over the photo of Jimin wearing the shirt with an image of a mushroom cloud with the English words ""patriotism"" and ""Korea.""

Representatives from Read Aloud West Virginia and Read Aloud Fayette County chat with Brookfield Renewable officials at the check presentation. MONTGOMERY — Read Aloud West Virginia earlier this month received a $15,000 donation from Brookfield Renewable to support the promotion of literacy for the children of West Virginia. “As a member of the West Virginia community, and particularly the Fayette County and Montgomery areas, we are proud to be able to make this donation,” Andrew Davis, Brookfield Renewable Director of Stakeholder Relations, North America, said in a press release. “Read Aloud West Virginia has done tremendous work in promoting the importance of reading among the youth of West Virginia by keeping books in children’s hands and by teaching them how reading is not only a valuable life skill, but how fun and enjoyable it is,” he said. “Brookfield Renewable has a great reputation of giving back to our community, and this is another example of that commitment,” said Mary Kay Bond, executive director of Read Aloud West Virginia. “This donation will go a long way in ensuring that our children will have the access to books that they deserve, and that our programs promoting literacy, be it through our volunteer readers program, our book distribution program or our public education program, have the resources that we need for them to be successful in developing the most valuable resource that we have-our kids.” The donation will provide support to Read Aloud West Virginia’s mission of promoting literacy through its four key program areas, including: Volunteer Readers — Community volunteers attend a one-time orientation and are placed in classrooms and other settings to read regularly. Their consistent involvement serves as a commercial for reading and sends a powerful message that reading is an enjoyable lifetime activity. Book Distribution — Access to books and other reading materials is essential to raising a generation of readers. Read Aloud puts books and magazines in the hands of students through a variety of programs. Classroom Enrichment — Read Aloud maintains an inventory of various educational enrichment materials which are available to teachers and schools upon request. These include Author Week information, Life Stories Units for middle and high school use, book sets and trunks and other materials designed to stimulate interest in reading. Public Education — Read Aloud makes an effort to incorporate public education into all of our programs. Schools cannot bear the sole responsibility for raising readers. Parents, relatives and neighbors are critically important role models in the lives of children. These individuals have the opportunity to influence a child’s perception of education and help him or her develop positive habits. Marion Tanner, a member of the Fayette County Board of Education who’s also involved in the Fayette chapter of Read Aloud West Virginia, daily sees the impact of the program on the lives of the area’s children. “During the past school year Read Aloud distributed more than 8,300 books and placed 1,113 volunteers in over 1,652 classrooms across West Virginia, including Fayette County,” she said. “(Brookfield Renewable Energy’s) willingness to become a community partner with Read Aloud West Virginia … will ensure that the Read Aloud West Virginia program will have the tools to continue their commitment to better preparing students for a promising future. “For the past 10 years, Read Aloud West Virginia has had an impact on the lives of Fayette County children in the following ways: providing training for numerous volunteer readers in all Fayette County elementary schools; donating books for two elementary school libraries; assisting in the implementation of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library; supplying books to hundreds of Fayette County preschoolers as part of the chapter’s Snuggle & Read program; and implementing a 3-year pilot program at Gauley Bridge Elementary encouraging all students to read over the summer to prevent the ‘summer slide.’ Every student chooses six books to take home for their own personal library. “Read Aloud’s programs put books in the hands and on the minds of Fayette County’s children,” Tanner said. “Read Aloud West Virginia-Fayette County Chapter is also proud to partner and collaborate with the Fayette County Board of Education.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular commented articles.

Bob,Diamond,1869,https://www.nasdaq.com/article/barclays-endorses-status-quo-with-new-chair-20181102-00238,"Join the Nasdaq Community today and get free, instant access to portfolios, stock ratings, real-time alerts, and more! By Christopher Thompson and Aimee Donnellan (The opinions expressed are their own.) LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Heard the one about the City grandee atop a British bank run by a Wall Street investment banker? Barclays investors certainly have. They will remember that when UK corporate financier Marcus Agius had a double act with hard-charging Chief Executive Bob Diamond it ended in vaudeville, with both eventually resigning over the Libor scandal. Appointing Rothschild & Co'sNigel Higgins to oversee Chief Executive Jes Staley should end less disastrously. In that light, the appointment looks like a defence of the status quo and, specifically, Staley's investment bank bolstering as European rivals Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse struggle. By contrast, outgoing chair John McFarlane, according to author Philip Augar, repeatedly clashed with former CEO Antony Jenkins over cuts to Barclays sizeable trading operations in particular. Higgins has three things to bear in mind. One is to avoid hubris: when McFarlane joined he predicted a doubling of the share price in three years, when it actually fell by a third. Another is the need to identify a replacement for Staley. Having led a bruising restructuring since joining in late 2015 and fallen foul of whistleblowing rules, it would make sense for the CEO to step down next year or 2020, ideally when Barclays has achieved its 10 percent return on tangible equity target, in line with its cost of capital. The final issue is Barclays shares' persistent discount to book, currently 30 percent. If returns falter, the age-old question about the utility of having a large investment bank will resurface - as will the appeal of activist investor Edward Bramson. If other shareholders suddenly become receptive to his pleas to cull the rainmakers and traders, Higgins will need to use his relationship skills to explain why Barclays' current structure is fit for purpose. On Twitter Twitter CONTEXT NEWS - Barclays said on Nov. 1 that Nigel Higgins, the deputy chairman of Rothschild & Co, would succeed John McFarlane as chairman on May 2, 2019 when he retires after serving his four-year term. - Higgins will join Barclays' board as a non-executive director on March 1, 2019 and take over as chairman in May after the annual shareholder meeting, the bank said in a statement. - ""In Nigel Higgins we have found an ideal candidate. He is a hugely respected banker, a strategic thinker, someone with extensive international experience, and he has a strong positive leadership style,"" said Crawford Gillies, who led the process to appoint a successor to McFarlane. - Barclays, one of Britain's biggest banks, has been subject to radical transformation in recent years. - Since taking over as CEO in December 2015, Jes Staley has pushed an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson. - Bramson's Sherborne Investors holds a 5.4 percent stake in the bank and was in talks with Barclays earlier this year about replacing McFarlane as part of an overhaul, according to a news report by Reuters. - Barclays shares rose 1.4 percent to 178 pence as of 0931 GMT on Nov. 2.

Steve,Cummings,1867,https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/edinburgh-v-scarlets-live-updates-15366309,"The Scarlets had got themselves into a winning position but saw the game slip away in the final quarter The Scarlets failed to get anything out of their trip to Murrayfield after falling away in the final quarter, eventually losing 31-21 to Edinburgh. They had doggedly stayed in the match and taken the lead with 30 minutes remaining but the hosts reasserted their authority to overhaul them and pull away for a bonus point triumph. Victory enabled the Scottish outfit to join third-placed Ulster on points in Conference B of the Guinness PRO14 and close the gap on the second-placed Scarlets to three points. Edinburgh had taken the lead when Fiji No.8 Bill Mata went over from a line-out for New Zealander Simon Hickey to successfully convert. Outside-half Dan Jones was wide with a penalty for the Scarlets and they lost Scotland-qualified New Zealander Blade Thomson to concussion. But they levelled matters with a superb try after Kiwi centre Kieron Fonotia bumped off Hickey and found youngster Morgan Williams with a long pass for the left-wing to break Edinburgh captain Henry Pyrgos’ attempted tackle before diving over. Jones converted but Edinburgh regained the lead with right-wing Tom Brown touching down twice in the space of eight minutes. The Scarlets responded from a line-out with Aussie centre Paul Asquith latching on to a deft grubber-kick from Jones to ground the ball for a try. Jones converted and the whistle for half-time went seconds later with the Scarlets amazingly just three points behind. Hickey was sin-binned for a professional foul early in the second half and the Scarlets took advantage with full-back Johnny McNicholl bagging his fifth try of the campaign. Jones converted and they were in front for the first time but it wasn’t for long as prop Pierre Schoeman drove over from close-range for Edinburgh’s fourth try and the bonus point. Juan Pablo Socino converted to give them the lead for a third time and the Scarlets had replacement prop Simon Gardiner sin-binned before Mata dived over the top of a breakdown to claim his second try. * THE GAMES: Here is who Wales are playing this autumn, when the games are and what the situation is with tickets * WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW: The security measures Wales fans can expect for this year's autumn internationals can be viewed here as an alcohol-free zone is introduced for the first time * NO ALCOHOL: All the details of the new alcohol-free zone at the game and how it will actually work can be found here. * THE ROOF: The Principality Stadium roof is closed for every Wales autumn international - and this is why * TV COVERAGE: You can see the kick-off times and TV channel details for every autumn international being played here. The Scarlets coach didn’t mince his words after the match as he lambasted his team’s display. “That first half our basic skills let us down. We couldn’t catch a cold and just made it hard for ourselves,” he blasted. “You get 15 on 14, you hit the front, you kick the ball away on the full and they score. “Overall, we’re not very happy. It was a very hard watch with the mistakes we made in the first half. We were our own worst enemy.” Thanks for following our LIVE blog. We will be back tomorrow with full coverage of Wales v Scotland. The Scarlets failed to get anything out of their trip to Murrayfield after falling away in the final quarter. They had hung in it and taken the lead with 30 minutes remaining but Edinburgh reasserted their authority to overhaul them and pull away for a bonus point triumph. Victory enabled them to join third-placed Ulster on points in the Conference B of the Guinness PRO14 and close the gap on the second-placed Scarlets to three points. The Scarlets had replacement prop Simon Gardiner sin-binned for illegally entering a maul from the side as Edinburgh drove for the try-line. And Edinburgh almost certainly ensured victory when Mata dived over the top of a breakdown to score his second try of the match. Hickey converted and they were 10 points to the good. Prop Pierre Schoeman drove over for Edinburgh’s fourth try and the bonus point after their 14 men had gone through 17 or 18 phases. Socino took the conversion with Hickey still in the cooler and smacked it between the uprights to give his side the lead for a third time. Hickey was sin-binned for a professional foul after tackling Sam Hidalgo-Clyne in the 10m zone following the scrum-half’s quick tap-penalty. Referee O’Keeffe should really have awarded a penalty try but decided on a penalty. Scarlets opted for a scrum and made use of their extra man with full-back Johnny McNicholl rounding Argentine Juan Pablo Socino for his fifth try of the campaign. Jones converted and they were in front for the first time. Thomson has been taken to hospital for treatment for concussion after being knocked out at a breakdown. The Scarlets have responded from a line-out with Aussie centre Paul Asquith latching on to a deft grubber-kick from Jones to ground the ball for a try. Jones converted and the whistle for half-time went seconds later with just three points in it. Edinburgh coach Richard Cockerill won’t be happy while their supporters are utterly bemused by the score-line with their team having had so much of the game. Edinburgh have got their third try after opting for a scrum when they were awarded a penalty in front of the sticks. They went through a couple of quick phases to suck in the defence and create the space near a touchline for a long pass from Pyrgos to put Brown over for his second five-pointer. Hickey again missed with the conversion. Edinburgh had made four visits to the Scarlets’ 22 and touched down three times. Edinburgh have regained the lead with numerous players getting their hands on the ball before a delighted Tom Brown went over for an unconverted try wide out. The Scarlets have levelled matters with a superb try following a ruck. Centre Kieron Fonotia bumped off Hickey and found youngster Morgan Williams with a long pass. The left-wing still had plenty to do but broke Edinburgh captain Pyrgos’ attempted tackle to slide over in the corner for Jones to splendidly convert. Outside-half Dan Jones was wide with a penalty, which was awarded following the restart. And they lost Scottish-qualified New Zealander Blade Thomson seconds later. There didn’t look to be much into it when he went to ground but other players fell on him and he stayed down. There was a lengthy delay before he was stretchered off, Ed Kennedy replacing him. Let’s hope it’s a precautionary measure and his injury isn’t too serious. Edinburgh tapped a penalty into the corner and Fiji No.8 Bill Mata was on the end of the line-out that followed to score. New Zealander Simon Hickey, a former outside-half of Super Rugby outfit Blues, successfully converted. Left-wing Duhan van der Merwe thought he had scored after chasing a kick but television replays showed he had knocked on. There’s a quiet atmosphere at Murrayfield but that’s what you would expect with it being Scotland’s national stadium and only a few thousand spectators inside. Sam Hidalgo-Clyne returns to Murrayfield for the first time since his summer departure to the Scarlets and he will come up against his old adversary Henry Pyrgos in the battle at scrum-half. Hidalgo-Clyne made 107 appearances and scored 470 points for Edinburgh during a seven-year spell in the Scottish capital. He will face the man brought in to replace him in Pyrgos. The pair are accomplished operators and the outcome of their duel could be crucial towards deciding the outcome. International ref Ben O’Keeffe becomes the third New Zealander to control a match in the various guises of the PRO14. The 29-year-old is in Europe for the autumn internationals. He started officiating in 2008 at the age of 19. A qualified ophthalmologist, he was the co-founder of a social enterprise which aims at creating medical technology to prevent blindness. O’Keeffe’s brother Michael represented New Zealand at the 2012 London Olympics in football. The Scarlets edged a 10-try thriller with Southern Kings at Port Elizabeth’s Madibaz Stadium in South Africa a week ago. In-form back-rower Will Boyde has been entrusted with the captaincy of last season’s PRO14 finalists for the first time. For centre Steff Hughes has been forced to sit out the clash with Edinburgh after suffering an ankle injury in training on Wednesday. Fellow centre Kieron Fonotia returns from suspension to replace him while back-row forward Blade Thomson, who missed last week’s clash in South Africa following the birth of his second child, is also back in action. Australian Steve Cummins and South African David Bulbring continue at lock with hooker Ryan Elias having been released from the Wales camp to partner props Phil Price and Werner Kruger in the front-row. Behind the scrum, New Zealander Johnny McNicholl moves to full-back with Morgan Williams coming in on the wing. Wayne Pivac’s side are five points behind leaders and reigning champions Leinster in their section. A bonus point victory at Edinburgh would see the Scarlets drew level with the crack Irish province, who last season became the first team to do a PRO14 and European Champions Cup double. But defeat would result in Edinburgh, who are eight points behind in fourth place, closing the gap in the standings. Leinster are in action on Sunday, when they face strugglers Southern Kings in South Africa.

Sara,Burns,1857,http://www.ozaukeepress.com/content/cg-belgium-girls-run-ninth-place,"After taking last year off, the Cedar Grove-Belgium girls’ cross country team returned to state and finished in the top 10 out of 16 teams on Saturday in Wisconsin Rapids. The Rockets took ninth with 243 points in the division 3 meet. They came in seeded eighth and finished 12 points behind Cashton for that spot. Lancaster won with 74, and Auburndale was second with 91. The Rockets’ rival Oostburg, which won the sectional while Cedar Grove-Belgium took second, ended up in fifth place with 151 points. Senior Karen Ibarra again paced the team by running the 5,000-meter course in 20 minute, 46.6 seconds, good for 43rd (18th of those with full teams). “Karen was out quick and around 25th at the half-mile mark, but the hills toward the last half of the race caught up with her a bit,” coach Brandon Langer said. “I know Karen had her sights on top 20, so she was a little disappointed after the race, but after talking to her and putting her whole season into perspective, she realized she had a very good senior year,” Langer said. The team’s strategy was to get out in the first mile, then attack the downhills and make a move in the final mile. Some of the hills, Langer said, slowed the runners since their positions didn’t change much. “A majority of the girls ran faster than their sectional times, though I was anticipating a more dramatic drop from some of them,” he said. Sophomore Cheyenne Simonet was 73rd (37th) in a personal-record 21:34.3. Freshman Lyndsay Sass was 95th (56th) in 22:16.1. Senior Grace Voskuil was 101st (62nd) in 22:27.4. Senior Katie Mueller was 110th (70th) in 22:40.8. Langer said he hoped Simonet, Voskuil and Sass would finish close together, but they lost contact at about the .75-mile mark. He was impressed with Simonet’s race. “She did a fantastic job attacking the downhills like we talked about, as she moved up to our No. 2 runner. This experience should give her confidence as she looks forward to next season,” he said. It was a solid season for the Rockets. “Considering that we had last year’s number one runner for only one meet, and also having last year’s No. 3 runner deal with an illness all season, I was impressed with the ability of the girls to step up,” Langer said. He said he looks forward to getting Payton Navis back healthy next season and returning three varsity runners. Large hits new low in time in taking 24th Ozaukee’s lone qualifier, Kelley Large ran a 20:18.5, good for 24th of 152 runners. The sophomore planned to work off of two runners who placed just ahead of her at the sectional race, coach Andrew Pfeuffer said. “She did a great job of putting herself in position to start the race and she did a phenomenal job of continuing not to settle in the race and kept catching other runners,” he said. Pfeuffer said Large grinded out a couple of “no-man’s land” areas where she was running by herself and made her way up to the next pack. “I was very proud of how she responded at the state meet and of her determination to push her limits. Kelley worked hard all offseason and during the season to earn her spot at the state meet and proved again that she can compete with almost anyone,” Pfeuffer said.

The chief of Fredericton police says the force’s staffing levels could be unstable for the next two years in the wake of a shooting that resulted in the death of two Fredericton police officers and two civilians. Chief Leanne Fitch told media on Thursday that a number of officers are still unable to return to their full duties and that 14 officers are expected to retire. As a result, Fitch says the force has committed to hiring 16 officers in the coming months, 10 more than what was previously approved for this year. READ MORE: Fredericton police to boost hiring, shift staff in wake of deadly shooting that killed 4 The decision was made with the City of Fredericton’s support. Fitch said that despite the staffing issues, public safety has remained her department’s number one focus. “I want the community to feel safe and protected,” she said. “I want to assure the community that they are in good hands.” Const. Sara Burns and Const. Robb Costello, as well as Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were shot and killed on Aug. 10. Matthew Raymond, 48, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. Fitch said on Tuesday that she would not be able to discuss the case as it is still before the courts. The police chief admitted that the reduction in staff has been challenging and resulted in the force’s public outreach programs being reduced while station tours, foot patrol and public presentations also been put on the back burner. She acknowledged that the force, the city and its residents are still attempting to heal in the wake of the events on Aug. 10. “The reality is that it can happen in any community, and we know this and I’m just incredibly proud of our officers who continue to put on their uniform and go out into the community.” “When the call came in, there was not a moment’s hesitation. People jumped right into action and got the job done.” © 2018 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Jane,Powers,1751,https://iusbpreface.net/2018/10/09/the-mind-of-a-jungle-demon/,"The Official Student Newspaper of Indiana University South Bend By: TAYLOR WALDRON Staff Writer/ Web Editor @taylor_sumiko On Friday Oct. 5, IU South Bend sophomore Kate Luce debuted her artwork at her first public art show titled, “The Mind of a Jungle Demon” in Michigan City, Ind. at The Quality Beet coffee house. Luce is currently double-majoring in both Journalism and Fine arts with a concentration in painting in drawing. She is also working on a minor in printmaking. The art show had a sizeable turn out. The room was packed with students, community members and general supporters of local artists. Luce’s work showcased the beauty and horror of nature intertwined with the complexity of human emotion and how dark the mind can seem. “Inside the mind of a jungle demon can be terrifying to most, but for those who find condolence with my emotions or feel a sense of understanding to the work, I thank you for that support,” said Luce in her artist’s statement. As someone who openly discloses her struggles with depression, Luce credits her artwork as having been an outlet for her to express and process her emotions in a healthy and constructive way. The show featured two gallery-style walls displaying 30 original pieces. Luce also had stickers and prints of her work for sale. Friends and supporters Megan Hayes and Ashley Ward each purchased a few of their favorite pieces. “Kate’s work is just so unique and I’m so happy to be here supporting her. It’s like watching your child succeed and I get to be the proud mom-friend,” said Hayes. “Kate’s art is awesome and spooky and I can’t wait to get my hands on some more,” said Ward. The show also featured live music from local artists Emily Jane Powers and the band, MREY. Each act was well-received by the attendees and seemed to fit well with the theme of the night. “The show went amazingly. I’m not even sure how to explain how surreal it was to see people who support me with my work just show up and validate that what I’m doing is what I’m meant to be doing,” said Luce. “I don’t think I’ve been this happy in a long time. I just want to celebrate creating and life and to give condolence to those who feel alone with what they may be going through. This show is only the start to everything I want to do with my work. I’m just very glad to be alive right now,” said Luce. Alongside Luce during the show were her family, friends and her professor and mentor Bill Tourtillotte. Tourtillotte teaches fine arts and printmaking at IU South Bend. “I would like to thank my amazing art professors…Ron Monsma and Bill Tourtillotte, who have pushed me to create work I never thought I would be able to. I would also like to thank everyone who helped me during the several weeks of getting everything ready for this opening, including my parents, who have supported my work all these years”, said Luce in her artist’s statement. Luce’s work will be on display at The Quality Beet in Michigan City, IN until November. To see Luce’s work, check out her instagram, @pineapplegoth.

Sara,Burns,1714,http://www.ozaukeepress.com/content/ozaukee-lady-runners-are-speeding,"The Ozaukee girls’ cross country team made it two in a row last Thursday. The Warriors won their second straight meet, this time scoring 40 points at the Panther Invite in Reedsville. Kelley Large led the way by taking second place in the 5,000-kilometer course in 21 minutes, 16 seconds. Jenna Schueller took fourth in 21:49, a personal record by 20 seconds. Amy Hoffmann had a season-best 22:07 for 10th. Ally Clark tied a PR with a 22:09 for 12th, and Ashlee Mueller took 17th in 22:47, a PR by 26 seconds. “Our girls pack running helped push the pace and had all seven of our varsity runners in the top 25 places,” coach Andrew Pfeuffer said. The meet follows a victory Sept. 20 at the Jim Bremser Invite in Mishicot, where the Warriors scored 49 points to win. Large took third in 21:04. Hoffmann was 10th in 22:08.

Andrew Cromwell reports A song written after the tragic deaths of four people during the Fredericton shooting last month is now taking on a life of its own. “We’d Rather Have You” was written by Steve Patterson of the Brunswick Street Baptist Church as a tribute to Const. Sara Burns. It was first performed at the regimental funeral for Const. Burns and Const. Robb Costello, who were shot and killed while responding to a call on Aug. 10. The incident also claimed the lives of Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud. READ MORE: Slain Fredericton police officer loved giving back Now, the tribute song will live on as part of a fundraising effort for the Sara Burns Police Memorial Fund. All funds raised through the purchase of the single will benefit organizations that help people in need. Burns’ husband, Steve, made the announcement at the city’s annual Harvest Jazz and Blues Festival. “This is about healing and helping people because Sara, that’s all she ever wanted to do in life was help people, and this is going to allow me to do that,” he said. Festival officials jumped at the chance to showcase the song, saying the event represents the best of the city. “It represents an opportunity for people to come together and enjoy the best of life, and certainly the community over the last little while has suffered and has also come together in a pretty amazing way,” said the festival’s music director, Brent Staeben. Burns’ husband had a reassuring message to share. “I want you to know that our family’s going to be OK, and the Robb Costello family, Bobbie Lee and Donnie, we’re going to be OK because everybody is strong,” he said. “We’re going to work together and we’re going to make some good come from this.” “We’d Rather Have You” will be available on iTunes for $0.99 on Sept. 21. © 2018 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Nathan Gorham, a New Brunswick based lawyer who practices out of Saint John and Toronto, made the comment outside the courthouse, shortly after Matthew Vincent Raymond made a brief court appearance Monday morning. Raymond said nothing as he faced a Fredericton judge on four counts of murder in the deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. Raymond, 48, wore orange jail clothing and leg shackles as sheriffs officers helped him cautiously exit a sheriff’s van. Matthew Vincent Raymond, charged with four counts of first degree murder, arrives at provincial court in Fredericton on Monday, Aug. 27, 2018. Andrew Vaughan / THE CANADIAN PRESS He looked down at the ground for much of the morning’s events, but observers noted he is slim, has short hair, is balding and has a greying beard. The court appearance was the first time the media has been able to provide visual images of Raymond, other than a fuzzy yearbook picture from his teenaged years. The police officers and civilians were gunned down Aug. 10 outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. It ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen, according to court documents. Raymond moved slowly and tentatively as he was led in and out of the court. Gorham said his client is in fairly poor physical condition but he is receiving medical treatment and is now out of hospital. On Monday, Regional Sheriff George Oram cautioned everyone in the courtroom against any outbursts. Pallbearers remove the Canadian flags from the caskets at the regimental funeral for constables Robb Costello, and Sara Burns, who were killed in the line of duty, in Fredericton on Saturday, Aug. 18, 2018. Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press Members of the victims’ families were among about 70 people assembled in the packed courtroom for his appearance. They left without speaking to reporters. Security at the courthouse was tight, and a large section of parking lot was cordoned off, with sheriffs’ vehicles used to block some of the view of the courthouse entrance where Raymond was brought in. The defence presented Judge Julian Dickson with a piece of evidence but the provincial court judge imposed a publication ban on anything to do with it. Gorham said they were unable to proceed with the case Monday because the lawyers are still awaiting disclosure — or release of the findings of the police investigation. “I expect that his plea will be not guilty and that we’ll be requesting a preliminary inquiry but we can’t make that decision until after I’ve received the disclosure,” Gorham said. Crown Prosecutor Darlene Blunston said she had been told not to expect the first portion of that disclosure until the first week of October. Dickson adjourned the case until Sept. 24. In this artist’s sketch, Matthew Vincent Raymond, charged with four counts of first degree murder, sits in provincial court in Fredericton on Monday, Aug. 27, 2018. James Vincent Walsh/CP Gorham said if he has not received disclosure by that point, he’ll again be asking to receive it, and the case will be set over for another date. The opportunity to enter pleas will come once the case is sent to the Court of Queen’s Bench. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. Thousands of police officers and first responders from across the continent travelled to Fredericton to attend a regimental funeral for Burns and Costello. Friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered varying memories of the accused murderer. Some have recalled how he retreated for long periods of time into video games, while others recall a pleasant supermarket co-worker. Recent accounts describe an increasingly isolated loner who was ejected from a bicycle shop and asked to leave a cafe for erratic behaviour. 9°C A few clouds Feels like 9°C We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

The digital banking start-up, which reported suspicious activity on its network to the Financial Conduct Authority and the National Crime Agency earlier in the year, has said that it uses software to detect “unusual behaviour”. However, some users have complained that innocent activity has been picked up by the software, resulting in their accounts being locked. Revolut, which is based on an app, was founded in 2013 by Nikolay Storonsky, a former investment banker. It was valued at $1.7 billion this year and has been growing rapidly. It has 2.5 million users. The complaints were first reported by The Sunday Times. Revolut… You are currently logged out Unlock quality journalism on the topics that you decide matter most.

John,O'Neil,1468,https://www.racing.com/news/2018-08-21/marmelo-still-melbourne-cup-bound,"18 November, 2018 18 November, 2018 17 November, 2018 17 November, 2018 19 November, 2018 19 November, 2018 19 November, 2018 Tue 20 Nov Wed 21 Nov Wed 21 Nov 6 November, 2018 3 August, 2018 3 August, 2018 3 August, 2018 Marmelo (Image: Racing Photos) Kate Watts@katewatts_ 21 August, 2018 Doubts had been cast whether Marmelo would still make the trip for the Melbourne Cup following his defeat as the odd-on favourite in last weekend's Group 2 Darley Prix Kergorlay. But on Tuesday, part-owner John O'Neil allayed fears the five-year-old was no longer Australia-bound, confirming plans are still in place for the English stayer to tackle the $7.3 million Melbourne Cup. O'Neill told RSN927's Racing Pulse that trainer Hughie Morrison had informed him he'd been happy with how the son of Duke Of Marmalade had performed in France, putting the result down to the track not being to his liking. ""He won that race last year, and having a lengthy chat with Hughie he's pretty confident he's going a lot better this year than he was last, which is really positive,"" said O'Neil. ""I know that Hughie was pretty happy with the run, he sent a note straight afterwards saying 'Look, the track was very hard, if it had been in the UK we probably wouldn't have run but we just took him over just to give him a bit of a nice pipe opener'. ""I would imagine that he probably won't have another run before the (Melbourne) Cup now. ""His focus is normally to really space those runs out so he'll come over, probably taper off a bit of work and then spark back up three or four weeks before the Cup."" O'Neil also dismissed concerns that connections were worried they'd hit a firm track at Flemington for Melbourne Cup Day, saying the horse had showed while he appreciates some give in the ground he can perform well on a Good track, evident in last year's Caulfield Cup. ""I think Flemington is traditionally firm but having said that the grass cover is pretty good,"" he said. ""They've just had no rain over in France at all, so for them the track was really hard, it was a lot harder than what it was the previous year. ""So I think we just deal with those situations how we face them, but I think the grass cover at Flemington is pretty good, he'll be okay."" Marmelo's connections are scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss a jockey selection for the Melbourne Cup, with O'Neil suggesting a number of options are on the table including his regular rider, the Belgium-born France-based Christophe Soumillon, and Hugh Bowman, who rode him in both the 2017 Caulfield and Melbourne Cups. ""Christophe has a great relationship with the horse, Ryan Moore has also won on the horse,"" O'Neil said. ""He's a wonderful rider Christophe but we've got a lot of wonderful riders here (in Australia) too. ""I'd personally love to get Joao Moreira on the horse if we could, I think he'd really suit him, but he's off in Japan now so it will be interesting to see.""

Joe,Boulos,1460,https://www.pressherald.com/2018/08/19/society-notebook-adults-with-autism-have-signs-of-hope/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers The lawn party raised money to expand care beyond childhood. Plans are announced for a new building to provide continued care for those with the development disorder. With an oversized tent and golf cart shuttles to the rescue, downpours didn’t stop the Signs of Hope lawn party Aug. 1 at the Falmouth Foreside home of Sheri and Joe Boulos, longtime supporters of Maine Behavioral Healthcare and Spring Harbor Hospital. “The goal this year is to open your hearts and minds to those who, for no fault of their own, have brains that work differently,” said Sheri Boulos, a member of the development committee. Signs of Hope fundraising was crucial in establishing the organization’s Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders four years ago, led by autism spectrum disorders expert Dr. Matt Siegel and serving individuals through age 21. The grand announcement at this year’s event was that long-term plans include a major expansion to continue care through adulthood in a new building that will be named after Dr. Girard Robinson. “This is a really important personal honor,” said Robinson, adding that it had been a major challenge in his career to expand access to behavioral healthcare. Over the past 40 years, Robinson has worked as chief medical officer at Spring Harbor Hospital, senior vice president for medical and clinical affairs at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Though retired from those roles, he is serving as interim director of substance use disorders at Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “Dr. Robinson was instrumental in bringing our developmental disorders program to Maine, and we have one of the strongest developmental disorders treatment centers in the country,” said Maine Behavioral Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Steve Merz. “But we want to meet the needs of the children who are now adults, so they don’t have to go away for the services they need.” “Tonight is the first step of raising funds for a major expansion to serve adults as well,” Siegel said. With 150 guests, the majority of whom were host committee members, Signs of Hope raised more than $95,000. “This is crucial to our success, helping us to expand services to a population that is underserved, both locally and nationally,” said Linda Durst, chief medical officer for Maine Behavioral Healthcare and chief of psychiatry at Maine Medical Center. Attendees included parents of young adults with autism who used to have to travel to Boston for care, then were able to access services locally when the center was established – until their children aged out. “We still need to do more for adults once they’ve aged out of high school and have graduated,” said Irene Kapothanasis, whose son Gregory is 25. “They’ve done a marvelous job with pre-K through high school. Now, we need to take the next step.” “Maine Behavioral Health has have done a tremendous job of meeting the needs of children and adolescents, but the specialized needs of this population do not vanish after the age of 21,” said Wendi O’Donovan, whose son Ryan is 22. “In fact, as these children or adolescents become adults, their ability to injure themselves or others grows exponentially.” “We need a whole continuum of care,” said Mary Jane Krebs, president of Spring Harbor Hospital and senior vice president for Maine Behavioral Healthcare. “We’re hoping in the next couple of years to have this larger center. It’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen. It’s really needed.” Amy Paradysz is a freelance writer and photographer based in Scarborough.

Bob,Diamond,1438,http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/markets/article-6074323/Bob-Diamond-faces-revolt-new-bank-Atlas-Mara-loses-way.html,"By William Turvill For The Mail On Sunday Published: 17:20 EST, 18 August 2018 | Updated: 08:48 EST, 19 August 2018 14 View comments Bob Diamond, the former Barclays chief once dubbed the ‘unacceptable face of banking’, has come under attack from investor groups ahead of his new bank’s annual meeting. Two influential shareholder adviser groups have raised red flags over corporate governance issues at London-listed Atlas Mara, a bank Diamond set up to focus on Africa. Glass Lewis has recommended that investors should vote against Diamond’s election as chairman because as a co-founder of the firm he is not considered independent. Under fire: Atlas Mara chief Bob Diamond Fellow adviser group ISS has raised similar concerns and recommends that investors abstain from the vote on August 29. The organisations are urging shareholders to vote against three non-executive directors including Michael Wilkerson, chief executive of Atlas Mara’s largest shareholder Fairfax Africa, arguing that he is not independent. The other two directors are former Bank of Ireland chief executive Richie Boucher and Hisham Ezz Al-Arab, chairman and managing director of the Commercial International Bank of Egypt. Both groups also oppose a motion that would allow Atlas Mara to sell 15 per cent of its shares without first offering them to existing investors. Diamond, who resigned from Barclays at the height of the Libor-rigging scandal in July 2012, founded Atlas Mara in 2013 and has been chairman since October 2016. Atlas Mara’s shares have fallen 80 per cent in five years. In 2010, the then Business Secretary Lord Mandelson criticised Diamond’s rewards at Barclays and described him as the ‘unacceptable face of banking’. Atlas Mara said it takes governance ‘very seriously’, adding that Diamond’s ‘continued leadership at the board is important to delivering on our business plan and performance objectives’.

Andrew,Davis,1437,https://racer.com/2018/08/18/team-tgm-tackles-vir-for-second-ctsc-win-in-three-races/,"By IMSA Wire Service August 18, 2018 5:53 PM By: IMSA Wire Service | August 18, 2018 5:53 PM Two races after a hard-earned maiden victory for longtime IMSA Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge competitors Team TGM, the team’s No. 46 Mercedes-AMG GT4 and co-drivers Owen Trinkler and Hugh Plumb returned to victory lane in a challenging Biscuitville Grand Prix at VIRginia International Raceway. A brief rainstorm early in the race that drenched half of the 3.27-mile VIR circuit wreaked havoc with the race strategy for many of the teams, but it ended up playing right into the hands of Team TGM. While many opted to switch to rain tires, Trinkler bravely opted to remain on the standard dry-weather slicks from Continental Tire. As the course dried, Trinkler worked his way forward and took the lead for the first time with just over one hour remaining in the race when Andrew Davis brought the race-leading No. 71 Rebel Rock Racing Chevrolet Camaro GT4.R onto pit lane. Trinkler surrendered the lead with slightly more than 46 minutes remaining when he pitted to turn the car over to Plumb, and for most of the next half hour, the battle for the lead came down to Robin Liddell – who had taken over in the No. 71 from Davis – and Jesse Lazare in the No. 69 Motorsports In Action McLaren GT4. But with 14 minutes remaining, both Lazare, who took the lead when Trinkler pitted, and Liddell came to pit road for one last splash of fuel. Plumb, on the other hand, had plenty of fuel to make it to the finish without another pit stop and he cruised to victory 6.046 seconds over Lazare. It was Plumb’s fourth Continental Tire Challenge victory at VIR and the eighth of his career in the series, while it was Trinkler’s second VIR win and 11th in the series. Trinkler won the Street Tuner (ST) class last year with then-co-driver Sarah Cattaneo. The victory also enabled them to extend their lead in the Grand Sport (GS) class standings to 18 points, 226-208, over No. 60 Roush Performance/KohR Motorsports Ford Mustang GT4 co-drivers Kyle Marcelli and Nate Stacy, who finished sixth in Saturday’s race. “VIR is a special place, we won here last year and to repeat is awesome,” Trinkler said. We never went to rain tires, we made a great strategy call. The front side of the track was just horrible from Turn 1 all the way to about Turn 7, but the back side was dry. They said just keep it on the track. “We were talking about coming down and taking rains, but I said give me another lap and let me see. I was just checking the track out and the line was coming back. I knew if we pitted it would ruin our day. I’m just say happy for [team owner] Ted [Giovanis] and everyone at Team TGM. We’re just doing our thing.” Lazare and co-driver Corey Fergus combined to lead a race-high 21 laps of the 59-lap race to finish second and take their first podium result of the season. It was their second consecutive top-five run after they finished fifth two weeks ago at Road America. Series veterans Davis and Liddell came home third in their first race in the No. 71 Camaro after returning to the Continental Tire Challenge this weekend with Rebel Rock Racing. Image by LePage/LAT Koch, O’Gorman Put eEuroparts.com Racing Into TCR Victory Lane for First Time in No. 12 Audi Tom O’Gorman won his second consecutive Motul Pole Award in TCR class qualifying on Friday, and on Saturday, he and co-driver Kenton Koch converted that pole to the first Continental Tire Challenge victories for themselves and the eEuroparts.com Racing team. It was anything but a flag-to-flag win, however, as O’Gorman made a trip into the tire barrier during the early race rainstorm. Undeterred, O’Gorman eventually got the No. 12 Audi RS3 LMS TCR back on course and he and Koch methodically worked their way back to the front as many of their competitors encountered their own issues. It took just seven laps for the No. 12 to get back to the head of the TCR field after the early incident, and Koch claimed the lead from Tom Long in the No. 77 Compass Racing Audi RS3 LMS TCR for the final time with 15 laps remaining. Koch and O’Gorman went on to win by a lap over the No. 74 Compass Racing Audi pairing of Kuno Wittmer and Rodrigo Sales. “It’s a joy to finally break through that glass ceiling and to get that first win,” O’Gorman said. “It’s a lot of tension building up to the first win and once you get it it’s a sigh of a relief and you can really focus on getting more. We’re hoping to finish off the rest of the season with this momentum. Huge props to my co-driver Kenton Koch to bring home the car. We had some struggles in my stint, but I think we had the least struggles in the field. It was a really, really challenging race so it’s even more rewarding to win this one.” The runner-up result for Wittmer and Sales bolstered their TCR points lead to four, 257-253, over co-drivers Long and Britt Casey Jr. with two races remaining this season. Long and Casey came home third in the No. 77. Image by Galstad/LAT Faulkner, Rabe Score First Continental Tire Challenge Win In ST After Penalty No. 21 Bodymotion Racing Porsche Cayman co-drivers Max Faulkner and Jason Rabe took their first Continental Tire Challenge race victory when the No. 52 MINI JCW Team entry co-driven by Colin Mullan and Mark Pombo that crossed the finish line first in class was penalized due to a technical infraction. Post-race technical inspection revealed that the No. 52 exceeded maximum boost pressure and was moved to last in class. Faulkner and co-driver Rabe earned their fifth podium result of the season in the ST class with the victory. ST class points leaders Nick Galante and Devin Jones finished second in the No. 81 BimmerWorld Racing BMW 328i. The No. 81 team was elevated to third post-race when the No. 37 MINI shared by Nate Norenberg and Derek Jones encountered a drive-time infraction and then moved to second following the penalty to the No. 52. Mat Pombo and Mike LaMarra wound up third in the No. 73 MINI JCW entry. Galante and Jones are now 13 points ahead of Mat Pombo and LaMarra, 257-244. Next up for the Continental Tire Challenge is the penultimate round of the 10-race season at WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca on Saturday, Sept. 8. The two-hour race will be streamed live starting at 6:05 p.m. EDT on IMSA.tv with audio commentary from IMSA Radio, which also can be heard on RadioLeMans.com.

High near 40F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph.. Cloudy skies. Low 27F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 2:32 pm Serving Terre Haute and Wabash Valley Tribune-Star file/Joseph C. Garza Terre Haute South No. 1 singles player Canaan Sellers closes into the net with an overhead during his win over North's Brayden Stultz last season. Tribune-Star file/Joseph C. Garza Terre Haute South No. 1 singles player Canaan Sellers closes into the net with an overhead during his win over North's Brayden Stultz last season. Tennis, still a single-class high school sport in Indiana, has settled into a familiar pattern in the Wabash Valley for both boys and girls. Terre Haute North and Terre Haute South will play a hotly contested regular-season match, then meet again with the sectional championship on the line. That sectional winner — so far — has been on a fast track to the semistate at Center Grove, one victory away from the eight-team state finals. That leaves West Vigo in a tough spot, although the Vikings have the Western Indiana Conference championship to fight for. Northview has both the WIC and its own sectional to play for — but with the Patriots or Braves waiting for them at the regional. • Northview — The Knights didn't reach the regional last season, despite a glittering record, but look to be in position to do that this year. And next year. And probably the year after that. Northview's top seven players are six sophomores and a junior who already have experienced success. When the Knights opened with a 5-0 win at White River Valley on Thursday, their lineup consisted of sophomore Owen Tipton at No. 1 singles, sophomore Brevin Cooper at No. 2, junior Tyler Hess at No. 3 and all-sophomore doubles pairings of Benjamin Goshen-Caleb Swearingen and J.D. Buell-Chase Nuckols. The Knights also have a new coach — sort of. Hannah Hughes takes over for her husband Shawn after being his assistant for the last four seasons. ""We have a lot of multi-sport guys, whose schedules are kind of divided in the summer,"" she said recently. So the Knights could be a little rusty early, and they might not finish the season playing in the spot they were on Thursday. ""Our biggest job right now is finding the best fit for our lineup,"" she said, ""because we're not going to lose anybody next year."" • Terre Haute North — Last year, it was the Patriots who survived to 3-2 wins over South and got to the state finals, where they lost to Culver Academy in a quarterfinal match. There are key veterans back from that team, although for awhile there is one less than coach Dallas Kelsey thought he had. Senior Alex Sacopulos, one of the four regulars back from last year, suffered a wrist injury during a practice match recently and his recovery time is uncertain. That means the Patriots have just three returnees right now, although with several candidates to fill the open spots. Junior Peter Christ, whose marathon win at No. 3 singles was the deciding point against South in last year's regular-season match, now looks to be the team's No. 1 player, with senior Drew Bishop — Sacopulos' doubles partner last year — probably moving to No. 2 singles. Senior Alex McGuire, who played No. 2 singles last year, figures in the lineup somewhere. Five sophomores — Ethan Knott, Cade Moore, James Rogge, Jae-Won Jung and Max Marietta — are fighting for playing time. ""And there's a good group of freshmen who will help us down the road,"" Kelsey said. ""We'll be looking at some different options to see who fits best,"" the coach said. • Terre Haute South — The no-brainer question of the 2018 boys tennis season, therefore, is the Terre Haute South team goal. ""Beat North"" takes on an extra level of meaning, and it's usually a pretty big goal anyway. The 2017 Braves weren't all at the state finals, but sophomore Canaan Sellers was. He got to the state singles semifinals last season as a freshman, and another no-brainer question for coach Jami Patterson would be who her No. 1 singles player is going to be. In South's first two victories, including one at Jasper, the rest of the lineup has been senior Aaron Gentry at No. 2 singles, sophomore Matthew Roberts at No. 3, junior Aiden Fellows and sophomore Caleb Morris at No. 1 doubles and junior Jake Thacker and sophomore Cam Faro at No. 2 doubles. Also pushing for playing time are junior Seth Gage and sophomore Stephen Kallubhavi, and senior exchange student Moritz Klopper might also be in the mix. ""I feel really good,"" Patterson said. ""Our singles players are playing extremely well and our doubles teams are competing and working together well."" • West Vigo — Andrew Davis replaces longtime coach Doug Tilford at the helm of the Vikings, after serving as West Vigo's middle school coach in recent seasons. And by Saturday's Viking Invitational, he was optimistic about having his full lineup available. West Vigo's early lineup included returnees Logan Lemon, a senior, and Dylan Lemon, a sophomore, at the top two singles spots, and they're likely to stay there. Junior Austin Robertson played the third singles spot, with doubles teams made up of senior Ben Duncan and freshman Ashton Matherly, then cousins Caleb Roush, a junior, and Garrett Roush, a sophomore. Senior Ryan Brown is a key returnee who hadn't been able to make tennis practice because he was a member of Wayne Newton Post 346 in the American Legion baseball's Great Lakes Regional. Other seniors are Nathan Bonnett and Spencer Butterman, while sophomore Josh King, freshman Blake Whitford and junior Chase Green are other possibilities. ""We're expecting to get first place in the WIC,"" Davis said. ""We're very talented, and that's our No. 1 goal."" Ancient sportswriter that hates the 21st Century.

Sara Burns had the opportunity to say goodbye to his wife on Saturday in front of thousands of police officers from across the country. Steven Burns honoured his wife with a tearful tribute, calling her his “hero and my angel.” “But now she is a hero and an angel for a community, a province and a nation,” Burns said on Saturday.

WATCH: Fredericton police chief chokes up remembering her fallen officers At the funeral, Burns spoke of Sara’s desire to become a police officer. He said she decided to pursue her criminology degree when she was 35 “while running the entire family and doing 20 hours a week minimum on the auxiliary for the Fredericton Police Force.” Upon graduating, Burns said Sara then applied to attend the Atlantic Police Academy. “When I think back now, I remember her biggest fear was having to leave her boys behind for about six months while she attended the academy in P.E.I.,” said Burns. “For 19 years she was the best wife, mother, business partner, chauffeur, nurse, and hockey mom a family could ever ask for.” Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic Leblanc and New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant, right, look on as members of the Fredericton Police Force carry the casket for Const.

To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.com FREDERICTON—An air of tragedy hung over the New Brunswick capital on Saturday as police and first responders gathered to pay tribute to two colleagues killed in the line of duty. Thousands attended the regimental funeral held at a local arena for constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns. Loved ones, colleagues and dignitaries spoke at the ceremony, and a common theme was woven into every speech: the kindness and compassion of the fallen officers. Fredericton police Chief Leanne Fitch’s voice shook as she described her time working with Costello and Burns, who were killed Aug. 10 in a shooting that also left two civilians dead. “When we sign up to serve and protect our city, we are committing our entire life’s work to this service,” Fitch said, adding that the two officers died as heroes. “Their deaths have created a ripple effect that stretches out as far as the ocean is deep.” Burns’s husband fought back tears as he delivered a powerful speech, in which he asked the surviving Fredericton officers not to feel any guilt about his wife’s death. “I want each and every one of you to know that she is at peace, and knows that you did everything you could to protect her,” he said. “Don’t burden yourself with the ‘why,’ because you won’t find the answer.” Burns asked that those in attendance pay their respects to the two civilian victims, Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud, as well. “Their families are grieving no less, and their lives are just as important,” he said. Burns’s tie and pocket square were yellow, his wife’s favourite colour, and matched the yellow roses placed on top of her casket. Greg Morris, a family friend of Costello, said the fallen officer took great pride in his work and had described being a police officer as his lifelong passion. Morris said Costello was a kind and compassionate friend who loved his mother, once spending days by her side while she was in the hospital. Costello also loved basketball, Morris said, adding that while his friend was never the most skilled player, he was the most selfless and was always willing to do anything for his team. But the most important thing in his life was his family, he said. Addressing Costello’s daughters, Morris said, “Kassie and Kaitlyn, your dad would be so proud of the remarkable women you’re becoming today. He loved you both very much.” Several dignitaries attended the funeral, including New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant, Lt.-Gov. Jocelyne Roy-Vienneau and Fredericton Mayor Mike O’Brien. Roy-Vienneau said she was fortunate to have met both Burns and Costello and was struck by their passion for their work. She said Saturday’s ceremony was both a time of great sadness and a time to honour all police officers and first responders. “The men and women in police uniforms constantly demonstrate the highest levels of courage, resourcefulness, initiative and willingness to go above and beyond, often putting themselves in harm’s way,” Roy-Vienneau said. “While we all wish for a different outcome, I promise we will not forget the sacrifices made in the line of duty.” At the beginning of the ceremony, officers laid the caps and belts of the fallen constables on top of their caskets, which were covered by Canadian flags, next to the roses placed there by family members. The flags were later carefully folded and given to Costello and Burns’s families. The service began with a heart-wrenching bilingual rendition of “O Canada” by award-winning singer Measha Brueggergosman, a Fredericton native. That was followed by a smudging ceremony with sweetgrass, performed by St. Mary’s First Nation Elder Imelda Perley, to honour the officers’ transition from “Earth walk to spirit walk.” Before the funeral began, 1,500 officers and first responders marched through the streets of Fredericton for a funeral procession, while hundreds of people lined the route. Rain poured from the sky during the parade, mirroring the gloom that has taken over the city of nearly 60,000 people. “The rain in our city today represents the tears of sadness and grief that flow from our hearts brought about by the terrible and senseless loss of these two heroes we dearly love,” Fredericton police chaplain Rev. Verner Drost said at the ceremony. The parade included a band, several police motorcycles, and Grimsby, a light grey, 10-year-old police horse co-owned by Burns and fellow Fredericton officer Const. Stefan Decourcey. The lives of the two civilian victims were also honoured this week by their families and friends. A public visitation was held Wednesday evening for Wright at a funeral home near Woodstock, N.B., although her obituary said there would be no funeral service by request and her internment would be held at a later date. Similarly, no funeral was held for Robichaud. His widow, Melissa Robichaud, told The Canadian Press he had requested to be cremated and she planned to scatter his ashes Thursday evening along a strip of road the avid motorcyclist often drove. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the shooting, and is set to appear in court Aug. 27. On Friday, a judge lifted a publication ban that had been imposed on court documents revealing details about how the deadly attack unfolded. Monday’s ban came hours after several media outlets had already reported on what the documents contained. The now public documents say the accused gunman was wounded as he allegedly exchanged gunfire with another officer from his apartment window.

Sara,Burns,1434,https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/decision-expected-on-publication-ban-for-fredericton-shooting-court-documents,"August 17, 201811:29 AM EDT FREDERICTON — A New Brunswick judge has lifted a publication ban on court documents in the Fredericton shooting that killed four people, revealing details about how the deadly attack unfolded. The province’s Court of Queen’s Bench had issued the ban on Monday — hours after media reported on their content — imposing an information blackout on the sequence of events that claimed the lives of Bobbie Lee Wright, Donnie Robichaud and police constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns. The documents unsealed Friday revealed the alleged gunman was wounded in the abdomen as he allegedly engaged another officer from his apartment window. The Crown information sheet says around 7:20 a.m. last Friday, a woman called 911 to report shots fired at 237 Brookside Drive. The document says the woman said someone was on the ground and she wasn’t sure if they were alive. Upon arrival, Costello and Burns went into the driveway while another officer who arrived moments after, Sgt. Jason Forward, stopped to ask questions of a passerby. “Sgt. Forward then heard a couple more gunshots so he proceeded into 237 Brookside Drive in back of building C,” the document states. “Once there, he noticed Constables Costello and Burns laying on the ground not moving. He also noticed another male on the ground and not moving, beside Const. Costello.” A male witness told Forward that shots were coming from the top floor of the apartment building. He and another officer then entered the building, set up containment and confirmed the alleged shooter was in Apartment 11-C. Forward later learned that another officer, described in the documents as Const. Arbeau, had engaged the shooter after he saw him point his long gun at him from the window. “Const. Arbeau believed he had hit the shooter in the torso,” the document says. “A little while later members of the (Fredericton Police Force Emergency Response Team) entered the apartment and took the lone occupant and shooter into custody. The suspect had been shot in the abdomen.” Police found “items believed to be firearm(s) and ammunition” inside the apartment. Police have said previously that Wright and Robichaud, who had just begun a romantic relationship, were shot first in the parking lot outside Robichaud’s apartment building, and the two officers were shot when they responded. Police say in the document that Wright’s body was found in the passenger side of a vehicle — which was registered to Wright — and all four victims were found in and around the vehicle. The vehicle’s windshield had been blown out. Police say Costello, Robichaud and Wright were pronounced dead at the scene while Burns was taken to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. He is set to appear in court on Aug. 27. Several media organizations had challenged the publication ban in court, and arguments were made earlier this week. Prosecutor Cameron Gunn had told the court that the Crown was prepared to lift the blanket publication ban, but an amended order seeking a more “narrow ban” had been filed instead. That ban would have unsealed the documents but continue to block the publication of names of individuals who have not spoken with media yet. But David Coles, a lawyer representing several media outlets, argued there was no basis for sealing the identities of individuals named in the court documents. He said the names would be in the public domain during the trial, and that reporters could learn the names from other sources. In handing down her decision Friday, Justice Judy Clendening said “the evidence falls short of establishing that a ban should be granted, even in the narrow situation of the protection of the privacy of the individuals.” “I do not find that the salutary effects of granting the publication ban strongly outweighs the deleterious impacts,” the judge said in an eight-page decision delivered orally. On Friday, Coles called the judge’s decision sound, saying that there must be compelling evidence to justify overturning the presumption of an open court and a transparent judicial process. “This terrible tragedy I suggest leaves a community hungry for as many details as they can be given to try to understand what happened,” said Coles, who represented a consortium of media outlets including CTV, CBC, Global, Brunswick News, Postmedia and The Globe and Mail. “So long as the details that are released won’t interfere or hinder the police investigation or the prosecution in any way, then providing that information in my opinion just better informs the citizens of Fredericton and indeed all Canadians in this national interest story.” We want to improve your reading experience 4°C Partly cloudy Feels like 1°C

Never a dull moment. This is the perfect opportunity to acknowledge the work that police forces do all across the province and country. While the above story can be safely filed under the “You know you’re from the Sault” category, not all stories are. The simple truth – is that police officers are in many tenuous situations every day. Whichever force. Whichever community. Whichever rank or serial number. If possible, take a few hours out of your day to watch the live stream of the funeral service for the two Fredericton Police Officers who were struck down in the line of duty. In Fredericton of all places. But that’s the sad point. It can happen anywhere. In a strong show of support for a municipal police force in mourning, thousands of police officers and first responders from across the country are expected to attend a regimental funeral Saturday for Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns. Volunteers have been working steady on to meet police officers and delegations at airports and hotels – wherever and however they are arriving to Fredericton. Martin Gaudet, Deputy Police Chief in Fredericton, said Wednesday, that “organizing the event is a monumental task as members of the force grieve the loss of constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns.” Among those gathering at the Aitken University Centre in Fredericton will be two officers from the Sault Ste. Marie Police Service. Constable Spina stated that “two members of the Sault Ste. Marie Police Service were already in transit” late this afternoon when I spoke with him.

Michael,Gordon,1433,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/17/aj-brimson-providing-welcomed-headaches-for-gold-coast-titans-coach-garth-brennan/,"TITANS After just two games at fullback for the Gold Coast, 19-year-old AJ Brimson is putting pressure on veteran No.1 Michael Gordon and Titans coach Garth Brennan is loving it. ""It's nice to have. We've probably lacked that over the last 12 months or so – depth,"" Brennan said after the Titans savaged the Sea Eagles 42-34 at Lottoland on Friday night. ""Michael Gordon has been one of our best players all year. He's Mr. Reliable, 'Flash'. ""One door opens and it's another opportunity. I've said publicly that I think AJ's future going forward is probably at fullback. The only thing concerning me about throwing him in so early was understanding defensive structures and getting the numbering [in defence] right. ""That probably hurt us a little in the first half ... our numbering was poor at certain times,"" Brennan said of the opening 20 minutes when the Titans found themselves down 22-6. They copped a spray in the sheds at halftime and came out and scored five second-half tries. Brimson scored two tries and made four tackle-breaks in a superb display. ""My plan is to give him a good pre-season, training up at fullback, working with 'Flash', getting him confident in the defensive side of things. You can see in attack there's no issue there,"" Brennan said. ""Fullback is such an art these days defensively. He'll get better with that. ""One thing about 'Flash' is that he can play wing; he can play centre; so he's got versatility there same as AJ."" Gordon is currently nursing a wrist injury, that needed surgery to repair. Brennan said with two rounds remaining, Gordon, who is on contract until the end of 2019, might not play again this year. ""Probably unlikely. I don't want to rush him ... and I'm not going to risk him,"" the coach said. ""Unless he's right, AJ is doing a good job – it's a bit of throwing him in now, having a look at him, and then getting him ready for next year. ""He's a special kid. I've stopped being surprised by what AJ dishes up. He's such a competitor and that's what you want in your football team – 17 competitors wanting to bust their butt and put their body on the line."" That was the Titan's fourth away win. They have also won four at home. But eight wins doesn't get a team into the NRL finals, never mind being so hot and cold with results like the Titans have been this year. ""That's why we're not playing semi-finals football, isn't it? That's the cold, hard facts of it,"" Brennan said. ""You're not going to play semi-finals football when you're as inconsistent as that ... don't worry about week to week – we're talking about minute to minute with us at the moment. ""It will come from getting to know each other better, trust each other, working harder. We're on a path and we've got to stick to it.""

Michael,Gordon,1433,https://realsport101.com/news/sports/rugby/rugby-league/manly-warringah-sea-eagles-vs-gold-coast-titans-five-things-we-learned/,"The Gold Coast have pulled off an incredible turnaround to defeat Manly at Lottoland, despite the best effort of the Trbojevic brothers. Here’s five things we learned from the bizarre encounter: Despite scoring the opening try through Anthony Don, the Titans were completely dominated by Manly in the first half of this match. By half-time, Manly had run over 500 meters more than the Gold Coast and lead 22-6 just seconds from halftime. A try just on halftime to Alexander Brimson kept the Titans within reach at 22-10 at the break. What happened next was one of Rugby League wonderfully bizarre moments, the entire momentum changed and the Titans scored with their first touch in the second half. They ran in a further five tries in the second half before a late try to Manly. The score finished at 42-34, despite the 16 point Manly lead, whatever Garth Brennan said to the Titans at halftime worked an absolute wonder. While it may be Daly Cherry-Evans that cashes in the big bucks, the Trbojevic brothers are the absolute heart of this Manly team. Despite the 30th minute try to Joel Thompson, the Trbojevic boys scored every other Manly try between them, with Tom earning himself a hat-trick and Jake a double. ﻿Tom Trbojevic absolutely tore the Titans to pieces in the opening exchanges, wreaking havoc on both sides of the ground, he finished with 207 run meters, four linebreaks, and a try assist for his brother. Jake on the other hand, topped the tackle count with 42 and was involved in everything all night. These boys are the future of Manly and without them Manly may have been embarrassed tonight. Remember the name Alexander “AJ” Brimson. Just 13 games into his NRL career he continues to wow spectators with his attitude and natural ability. After coming up with a host of try-saving tackles late in the first half, Brimson burned the Manly defense to score a late try that ultimately kept the Titans in the game at the break. ﻿His second half was just as good, he involved himself in attack and defense and score another fantastic solo try, in which he brought back the vintage kick and chase to score. This guy is a special kid, and the Titans have a headache in regards to their fullback position, Brimson has been too good to lose his spot, but incumbent Michael Gordon doesn’t deserve to lose his jersey either. Over to you Garth Brennan. The narrative of the entire week for Manly was how they would react to the intense and ongoing speculation around their head coach, Trent Barrett. Any worries about the controversy affecting the playing group was looking quashed in the first half, but following the break Manly fell to pieces. While the Titans deserve credit for their second half, Manly were, without doubt, lacklustre in the second 40 minutes. Perhaps a sign that they have lost faith in their exiting coach, as they didn’t follow Barrett’s instructions to close out what should have been a Manly win. With matches against top eight hopefuls the Tigers and Broncos to come in the final couple of rounds, Manly will have to improve their commitment if they are to win again in 2018. Ash Taylor has had an up and down season in 2018, however, showed what he was capable of against Manly. With the Titans on the ropes early he came up with a classy 40/20 which lead to the Titans first try. He came up with a couple of forced goal-line drop outs, a try-assist and a nice try backing up his five-eighth. Taylor stepped up with the boot as well, slotting seven from eight goals in the absence of Michael Gordon. It’s no secret that when Taylor plays good, so do the Titans, and if Taylor can continue this form to finish the year, this game might not be the Titans last win for the 2018 season ﻿What did you takeaway from the Titan’s big win at Lottoland?

As always, the daytime concert on Tuesday had over 400 people enjoying music from another era where melody was king. Paying tribute to old artistes with musical gems that included Climb ev’ry mountain from Sound of Music, Get me to the Church on Time from My Fair Lady and Sunrise Sunset from Fiddler on the Roof— kept the audience delightfully engaged. Rising star Kelly Harris made her debut and performed a couple of numbers with Rory Nolan, a young and talented theatre enthusiasts and actor from Shortland Street. Also making their presence felt were more experienced musical specialists Stuart Coats, who has a long-standing involvement with New Zealand Opera, and Hamish McGregor who performed a delightful rendition of If I were a rich man. Adding a fun element to the show were two ladies from the audience, Wenona Stephens and her friend Shirley Yelavich, dressed in vintage regalia. Much to everyone’s surprise, Wenona walked up on stage looking straight out of the golden era, just when the performers asked the audience to sing-a-long to Hello Dolly. It’s easy to see that both Susan and John, the couple who started Operatunity 17 years ago, still enjoy every bit of the showbiz including serving sandwiches after the show and talking to their audiences. The company now produces more than 200 concerts a year touring nationally to more than 25 venues around the country. Looking for a business or service?

USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin Steve Cummings(Photo: File/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo The city of Oshkosh is taking a stand to address a disturbing trend in property valuation. This trend is shifting the burden of property taxes from big-box retail stores to homes and small businesses. The term you may be familiar with is “dark store.” While some businesses have hired PR firms and lobbyists to spread misinformation, I wanted to explain to Oshkosh residents why this issue is important to you and what you can do to help us correct this unfair property tax shift. Cities throughout Wisconsin are responsible for assessing the property values of residential and commercial properties. City assessors are given specific rules to follow by the state of Wisconsin. Our assessor’s goal is to make sure that there is consistency in property values so that everyone is paying their fair share. RELATED: City approves nearly $130,000 combined payout to settle Lowe's 'dark store' lawsuit LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Get Oshkosh news in your feed COMMENTARY: 'Dark store' referendum question biased; Oshkosh taxpayers paying lobbyists COMMENTARY: 'Dark store' loophole shifts tax burden to homeowners In 2008, Walgreens sued the city of Madison, and claimed its properties were overvalued, even though Walgreens was being assessed for its actual sales price. Meanwhile, other big-box stores were arguing their stores should be valued as if the store is vacant, i.e. a “dark store.” Their argument ignores the income generated by these properties, as well as the arm’s-length transactions that occur when these properties sell for millions of dollars. Walgreens argued its property should be valued at approximately 40 percent of its actual sale price. Imagine if your neighbor argued your property should be valued at its sale price, but theirs should be valued at 40 percent of the sale price. Does that make sense? Instead of local assessors valuing properties using decades-long procedures, attorneys representing big box stores are negotiating their own values and manipulating the courts and the well-established rules to reduce their assessments to below-market values. Dark store reform will not increase the city’s collection of property taxes. The city of Oshkosh is under strict levy limits from the state of Wisconsin. What the city collects is fixed according to a formula established by the state. If the value of a big-box store goes down, the tax bill is shifted to you, the homeowner, and small local businesses, who don’t have the benefit of triple net leases and out-of-state attorneys to manipulate their assessed values. Specifically, property taxes for Walgreens, CVS, Menards, Lowe’s, Walmart, Target and Fleet Farm all go down, while your taxes go up to pay for their tax break. The city of Oshkosh and cities throughout Wisconsin have been working with the League of Wisconsin Municipalities to explain to legislators that dark store reform is necessary. Currently, 70 percent of the Wisconsin Legislature is in support of dark store reform, so this is a welcomed bipartisan issue. I would like to personally thank our local legislators, including Reps. Gordon Hintz and Michael Schraa and Sen. Dan Feyen, all of whom support dark store reform. Unfortunately, state legislative leadership refuses to put the dark store issue up for a vote. I encourage you to contact Assembly Speaker Robin Vos at 888-534-0063 and ask him to put dark store reform legislation up for a vote. When 70 percent of your elected representatives want to see reform, one person should not hold it up. Steve Cummings is the mayor of the city of Oshkosh.

John,O'Neil,1430,https://www.pressherald.com/2018/08/16/york-county-da-dismisses-charges-against-man-driving-boat-that-killed-his-brother/,"Sign in or Subscribe See Offers Jeffrey Beattie died in May 2016 when he fell off the bow of a boat being driven by Jonathan Beattie on Mousam Lake in Shapleigh. The York County District Attorney’s Office has dismissed all charges against a Sanford man in connection with a 2016 boating accident that killed his twin brother, citing a judge’s decision to grant a motion to suppress results of a blood alcohol test. Jonathan Beattie, 33, of Sanford had been indicted in November 2016 on charges of manslaughter, reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon and operating watercraft under the influence causing serious bodily injury or death. He also was indicted on a misdemeanor count of operating a watercraft under the influence. In a filing in York County Superior Court on Tuesday, York County Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan said that her office decided to dismiss all four charges because Superior Court Justice John O’Neil Jr. granted a June 11 motion by Beattie’s attorney to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test and statements Beattie made to police on the day of the accident. “The court granted the defendant’s motion to suppress after a full hearing,” McGettigan wrote in her dismissal filing. “Without the information regarding the defendant’s statements and other information, the state cannot meet the high burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jeffrey Beattie was killed on May 28, 2016, when he fell off the bow of the boat his brother was operating on Mousam Lake in Shapleigh. Investigators said the motorboat ran over Jeffrey Beattie, who was initially taken to Southern Maine Health Care in Sanford before being flown by helicopter to Maine Medical Center in Portland, where he died from his injuries. According to the motion filed by Timothy Zerillo, Jonathan Beattie’s attorney, a police officer and game warden never performed a field sobriety test on Jonathan Beattie, instead informing him that he had a “duty” to consent to having his blood drawn. Beattie verbally agreed and gave a blood sample at Southern Maine Health Care, but Zerillo said in court documents that the officers never sought or obtained a warrant. The lawyer also told the judge that the officer and warden did not allow Beattie to accompany his brother to the hospital in the ambulance, and then they questioned him for 5 to 10 minutes. O’Neil called the blood test “an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment” and noted that Beattie’s interrogation by police was made without a Miranda warning. Documents Zerillo filed in York County Superior Court in March describe what started out as an enjoyable, late spring day boating on Mousam Lake. The identical twins were joined on the motorboat by two friends and Jeffrey’s wife, Jennifer Beattie. “Jeffrey had one knee on the bowrider seat and his foot on the floor. As they turned, Jeffrey went over the side. The prop clipped him on the way by, and a fun day turned tragic,” Zerillo wrote. “The group immediately fished Jeffrey out of the water and began trying to stop the bleeding.” Zerillo said that while his client is relieved that the charges against him have been dropped, he may never fully recover from the death of his brother. Jeffrey Beattie left behind his wife and two young children. “We got the best possible result in the criminal case,” Zerillo said in a telephone interview Thursday evening. “But it is an absolute tragedy for him and his family.” Dennis Hoey can be contacted at 791-6365 or at: [email protected] Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

Andrew,Davis,1428,https://www.tampabay.com/blogs/baybuzz/2018/08/17/transportation-and-sprawl-hillsboroughs-biggest-woes-say-commission-candidates/,"Your privacy is important to us. We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. Read it here TAMPA -Planners predict some 600,000 people will move to Hillsborough County by 2045, further straining the county's overburdened road network. So it's no surprise that candidates running for the Hillsborough County Commission identified reducing congestion and preventing more urban sprawl as among Hillsborough's most pressing needs during a debate Friday. ""We have utterly failed to plan for and fund a transportation system that can accommodate all the growth our county commissioners keep approving recklessly,"" said Mariella Smith, a Democrat who is running for the countywide District 5 seat. There is less agreement about how to fix the problem. Smith said she would like to see the county explore whether it can convert CSX's rail network to passenger rail. That would have a lower per-mile cost than widening roads, she said. Fellow Democrat Angela Birdsong, who is running in District 2, said the county needs to raise impact fees. The fees are paid by developers to cover the cost of road improvements needed to cater to growing neighborhoods. Hillsborough's fees are lower than those paid in Pinellas and Pasco, Birdsong said. ""Why is it that we just can't get our Board of County Commissioners to get our impact fees?"" she said. The debate took place against the backdrop of a looming transportation initiative on the Nov. 6 ballot. If passed, it would raise the county's sales tax from seven cents on the dollar to eight cents, for a 30-year period beginning in 2019. It would raise an estimated $280 million per year. But the initiative was only mentioned by a few candidates including Republican District 2 candidate Chris Paradies, who opposes the tax hike. He would like to see more use of technology like adaptive street lights that adjust red light cycles to reduce congestion. And he fears that a focus on buses and rail is not appropriate when technologies like autonomous vehicles are set to transform the transportation landscape. ""We don't need to be building 20th Century solutions that will be museums by the time they're built,"" he said. There were also repeated calls for the county to prevent sprawl beyond the urban services area, a boundary intended to designate where the rural part of the county begins. Experts from the Urban Land Institute this year advised Hillsborough leaders that they should squash requests from developers to allow more homes per acre in areas where there are fewer utilities and less road capacity for at least five to eight years. Andrew Davis, a Democrat running for the mostly rural District 4 seat, said donations from developers unduly sway commission votes. Other candidates have ignored his challenge to give any campaign donations received from the development industry to charity. ""We let developers run this county from behind closed doors,"" he said. Republican Victor Crist, who is term limited in District 2 and switching to District 5, said commissioners had to make exceptions when approving developments during the recession to keep people in jobs and keep the local economy moving. Keeping development within existing urban and suburban areas should be the county's goal, he said. ""It's a lot less expensive to expand and modify existing infrastructure than to keep adding to it,"" he said. Democrat Elvis Piggott and independent candidate Joe Kotvas also took part in the debate, which was for candidates in Districts 2, 4 and 5 and was organized by the Tiger Bay Club of Tampa. Commissioners Ken Hagan, who is running for District 2, and Stacy White, the District 4 incumbent, did not attend. Contact Christopher O'Donnell at [email protected] or (813) 226-3446.

Sara,Burns,1427,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/public-visitation-today-for-fredericton-constables-killed-in-shooting-1.4055585,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement FREDERICTON -- Hundreds of mourners lined around a downtown Fredericton building Thursday for an emotional public visitation for two city police constables killed in the line of duty. Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns were gunned down at an apartment complex on Fredericton's north side Friday, in a shooting that also claimed the lives of civilians Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud. Inside a dimly-lit ballroom of the Fredericton Convention Centre, the families of Costello and Burns stood near large framed photographs of the fallen officers as a steady stream of visitors paid their respects to the grieving families. Two large projectors on either side of the room played slide shows with pictures of the officers at different stages of their lives, from what appeared to be a high school graduation and prom night to cradling a newborn baby and apple picking. Many people left the visitation in tears, struggling to cope with the violent shooting that has gripped this city for the last week. The Burns family issued a public statement Wednesday saying ""we have heard one common theme since the passing of Sara and Robb."" ""They were two of the most positive people anyone had ever met,"" said Burns' husband, Steven Burns. An obituary said the 43-year-old Burns fulfilled her lifelong dream of becoming a police officer three years ago, after more than 14 years as a stay-at-home mom of her three boys. ""Not a day would go by when she didn't say aloud, for everyone to hear, 'I love my job,""' the obituary published on the McAdam's Funeral Home and Crematorium website said. Steven Burns said his wife could ""brighten a room with her smile in an instant and make anyone feel at ease seconds later with just a few words."" ""Sara was put on this earth to help people and everything she has ever done in life was to help people,"" Burns said. ""We are so proud of the person and human being that she was, and we will miss her dearly."" An obituary for Costello said he loved being a police officer and though he spent time in specialized units he eagerly went back to patrol, ""his true love,"" the obituary published on the Bishop's Funeral Home website said. ""He was away at the police academy while his first daughter (Kassie) was an infant,"" the obituary said. ""He joined the Fredericton Police Force immediately after finishing the academy. His daughter Kaitlyn was born in Fredericton and Robb had a strong connection to the city he served."" Costello was ""so proud of both his girls and the women they were becoming,"" the obituary said. ""To his step-children he was known as 'Faux Pa' and he loved them like they were his own."" On Saturday, thousands of police officers and first responders from across the country are expected to attend a regimental funeral for the two officers. Although it's not open to the public due to space constraints, public gatherings to view the funeral will be held at the Grant-Harvey Centre and the Hope City Church. The public is also encouraged to line the streets of Fredericton for a parade procession made up of police officers and first responders that will precede the funeral. Meanwhile, an obituary published by Carleton Funeral Home in Jacksonville, N.B., said Wright graduated from Canterbury High School in 2003 and from New Brunswick Community College with a diploma in medical office administration in 2008. The 32-year-old woman had previously worked on a tree farm, in catering and in an office before embarking on a career as a home support worker. An obituary for Robichaud said he is survived by a wife and three children, and there will be no visitation or funeral, in keeping with his wishes. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. He is set to appear in court on Aug. 27. Police have said Wright and Robichaud, who had just begun a romantic relationship, were shot first in the parking lot outside Robichaud's apartment building, and the two officers were shot when they responded. Fredericton police spokeswoman Alycia Bartlett said an update on the case is not expected before Saturday's funeral. RCMP in New Brunswick are assisting the municipal police force in the homicide investigation, but Corp. Jullie Rogers-Marsh said all updates will come from Fredericton police.

Melissa Robichaud said her family was hurt the prime minister did not reach out to them Sunday while in the city, where he paid public tribute to Constables Robb Costello and Sara Burns at city hall. Robichaud said Trudeau told her he had wanted to give his condolences for the death of her husband, Donnie Robichaud, but couldn’t because he was meeting with families of the police officers.

They wear a vest, they carry a gun, that makes them more important than one of us? I called him a piece of s---,” she said in an interview Thursday. Robichaud said she swore at him because her two sons have been made to feel that their father was somehow less important. “Honestly I just lost my husband and my kids have just lost their father. My son put it on Facebook how hurt he was that he (Trudeau) was in town and he couldn’t even find a phone number to call and give his condolences or anything like that.” Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were also gunned down with Costello and Burns at an apartment complex on the city’s north side. When asked for a response Thursday, it was clear the Prime Minister’s Office was wary of commenting in detail about what was said. “The Prime Minister reached out to personally offer his condolences to the families of the victims,” spokesperson Chantal Gagnon said in an email. “We cannot imagine what they are going through. He offered our support to the families and will continue to do so.” The PMO confirmed that Trudeau had spoken to Melissa Robichaud and her two sons and that he would be speaking to Wright’s family in the next few days. While Robichaud admitted that she doesn’t like Trudeau to begin with, she doesn’t regret what she said. “Oh my God no,” she said. “If he was here I would say it again to his face.” An obituary published earlier this week said there would be no visitation or funeral for Donnie Robichaud in keeping with his wishes. Melissa Robichaud said she was getting ready later Thursday to scatter Donnie’s ashes. She said they had been married for 16 years before separating last December. “It’s what he asked for, we talked about it,” she said. “He didn’t want a funeral, he wanted nothing to do with church ... he didn’t want a memorial or anything like that. He wasn’t a religious man whatsoever and that was just him.” The family had previously confirmed that Robichaud had been a member of the Bacchus Motorcycle Club, but said he had left about a year before his death. “I’m taking his ashes along a strip that we all used to take on the bikes and letting them go,” Melissa said. Meanwhile, hundreds of mourners attended a public visitation Thursday for Costello and Burns, while a regimental funeral is planned for the two officers on Saturday. Thousands of police officers and first responders from across the country are expected to attend. A public visitation was held Wednesday evening for Wright at a funeral home near Woodstock, N.B.

Sara,Burns,1427,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/mourners-pay-respect-to-slain-fredericton-officers-at-public-visitation-1.4056694,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement Following a public visitation that saw hundreds of mourners pay their respects to the two police constables killed during a shooting in Fredericton last week, preparations are underway for the arrival of thousands of police officers, first responders, and dignitaries who will attend a regimental funeral for the officers. Constables Robb Costello, 45, and Sara Burns, 43, were gunned down after responding to a call at an apartment complex in a residential neighbourhood in the city’s north end. Two civilians, Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, and Donnie Robichaud, 42, were also killed in the shooting. On Thursday, visitors lined up around the block in front of the Fredericton Convention Centre for the opportunity to offer their condolences and shake hands with the grieving families of the two slain constables. “It was very touching, seeing all these people,” retired Saint John police officer Chuck Elgee told CTV Atlantic outside the centre. “People you don’t even know and they’re shaking my hand and shaking my fellow officers’ hands and thanking us. It’s hard to explain how that feels.” Retired Fredericton police officer Junior Woodland said it was important for the community to be able to show its support to the families at the visitation. “[It’s] very important to see these people and all the brothers here supporting families,” he said. On Saturday, a regimental funeral will be held at the Aitken University Centre on the University of New Brunswick campus. Due to the space constraints, the funeral won’t be open to the public. Instead, members of the community have been asked to line the streets of Fredericton for a parade procession consisting of police officers and first responders that will take place before the funeral. Public gatherings to watch a live broadcast of the funeral will also be held at the Grant-Harvey Centre and the Hope City Church on Saturday. Fredericton Mayor Mike O’Brien said the outpouring of grief and support within the community has been “overwhelming” and “heartwarming.” He said residents have volunteered to drive visitors to and from the airport, car dealerships have offered up vehicles, and dozens of people have contacted him offering up rooms in their homes for people to stay. “People are stopping each other on the streets and hugging each other, lending as much support as possible,” he told CTV News Channel on Friday. “There’s been a level of outpouring of emotion, anger, confusion, and now respect for the fallen that I’ve never seen before in this community.” The mayor said the regimental funeral will provide the community with the opportunity to come together to grieve for the fallen officers. “Tomorrow it will be with honour, dignity, and respect to our two fallen officers, they had a duty to serve and protect, and we have a duty to honour them, and it’s a way for the community to do so and while we’re doing that, we have to keep in mind the two civilians that died,” he said. “I know in the minds of the police force the other civilians that passed away are top of mind.” Following the funeral, O’Brien said the city will find a way to honour the victims of the tragedy in a lasting way when “the time is right.” Martin Gaudet, Fredericton's deputy police chief, has been involved in organizing the event and called it a “monumental task.” “We are going to celebrate their lives and we're going to do it with dignity and with respect. That's the task and we're not going to fail,” he said outside the Fredericton police department on Wednesday. The Fredericton International Airport is also preparing for the influx of visitors by adding more flights and increasing staff. “We’re already seeing an increase of passengers, so for the next three days we have added flights with Air Canada and WestJet who were very helpful in adding services to accommodate the demand,” Johanne Gallant, the airport’s CEO, said. The suspect in the shooting, Matthew Vincent Raymond, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. He is set to appear in court on Aug. 27. With files from CTV Atlantic and The Canadian Press Mourners line up to enter the Fredericton Convention Centre, where a public visitation for Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello is being held, in Fredericton on Thursday, Aug. 16, 2018.

Sara,Burns,1427,https://globalnews.ca/news/4393395/fredericton-shooting-publication-ban/,"Change Location Newscasts & Videos WATCH: We are learning more about that deadly shooting in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The details are contained in court documents that were under a publication ban, until today. Mike Armstrong Reports. A New Brunswick judge has lifted a publication ban on court documents containing details about the Fredericton shooting that killed four people, including that the alleged gunman who opened fire from his apartment with a long-gun was wounded in the abdomen as he traded bullets with an officer. The horrific shooting, which spanned just over two hours at a complex in the city’s north end, killed civilians Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud along with police officers Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns. The previously reported details about the tragedy and how police responded are laid out in a Prosecutor’s Information Sheet filed by police. The information can now be released following a decision Friday morning by Justice Judy Clendening to lift a ban that was imposed Monday. WATCH: Fredericton shooting suspect’s co-workers recall his temper, outbursts. Clendening said the investigating RCMP officer acknowledged the police document attached to the basic information filed was an “oversight,” and it was “unfortunate” that it became public. The ruling comes after a media consortium including Global News filed an application to lift the ban and injunction on information contained in the document as it does not present any threat to the prosecution and is of public interest. WATCH: Lawyer representing media says there was a ‘lack of evidence’ for publication ban David Coles, a lawyer for the CBC and representing the media consortium, said there was no evidence to necessitate a publication ban. “I think the court did what it had to do,” Coles said. “If you’re going to interfere with someone’s freedom of expression rights, which are constitutionally guaranteed, you need to have evidence of a compelling necessity for doing so. There just wasn’t such evidence in this case.” On Aug. 10 at around 7:20 a.m., Fredericton police responded to a complaint of shots fired at 237 Brookside Dr. WATCH: Accused Fredericton gunman described as ‘lonely’ Costello and Burns were the first to arrive at the scene, followed closely by Sgt. Jason Forward, according to the document. Costello and Burns went into the driveway at Brookside Drive, while Forward stopped to question a person on the street. “Sgt. Forward then heard a couple more gunshots so he proceeded to drive in back of building C,” the document says. “Once there he noticed Constables Costello and Burns lying on the ground not moving. He also noticed another male on the ground and not moving, beside Const. Costello.” The officer was told by a male witness that the shooting was coming from the top floor of the apartment block. Forward, along with another officer who arrived on scene, identified as Cst. Fox, then entered the building and set up containment on the top floor before confirming the shooter was in Apartment 11-C. “Cst. Forward advised responding [Fredericton police officers] that if the shooter presents himself to the window they should engage him,” the document reads. Police and RCMP officers survey the area of a shooting in Fredericton, N.B., on Aug. 10, 2018. One of the officers, described in the documents as Const. Arbeau, fired at the shooter after he had pointed his long gun at him while he was in the window. “Const. Arbeau believed he had hit the shooter in the torso,” the document says. Shortly after members of the Fredericton Police Force Emergency Response Team entered the apartment and took the suspect, who identified himself as Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, into custody around 9:35 a.m. He was taken to the intensive care unit at Dr. Everett Chalmers Regional Hospital for surgery for “gunshot wounds to the abdomen.” WATCH: Donnie Robichaud, father of three, identified as victim in Fredericton shooting He was remanded to the Saint John Regional Correctional Centre, according to documents. Police found “items believed to be firearm(s) and ammunition” inside the apartment. Police confirmed Monday the long gun believed to have been used in the attack is commonly available for purchase, and is not a prohibited or restricted weapon. “It’s a firearm that can be purchased here in Canada and the suspect does have a licence,” Deputy Chief Martin Gaudet told reporters at a news conference Monday. “It’s a shouldered weapon – a long gun.” All four victims were found near the vehicle, according to the police document. The vehicle’s windshield had been blown out in the hail of bullets. Police say Costello, Robichaud and Wright were pronounced dead at the scene while Burns was taken to hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A memorial outside police headquarters in Fredericton has grown as mourners have laid flowers, notes and teddy bears as the shaken community continued to grapple with the tragedy.

He had recently started a relationship with Wright, 32. Costello, 45, leaves behind a partner and four children and was 20-year veteran of the force who loved to serve his community. Burns, 43, leaves behind a husband and three sons. It wasn’t until the age of age of 35 that she decided to chase her lifelong dream of becoming a police officer. Meanwhile, details have begun to emerge about the alleged gunman who has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. He is set to appear in court on Aug. 27. A Fredericton business owner who knew Raymond described him as a person who gave “everyone” anxiety whenever he came into the room. Greg Bradford, the owner of Key Cycle, a bicycle repair shop close to where the shootings happened, told Global News that he believes Raymond had anger issues. “I had a hard time with him in my shop,” Bradford said, adding the he was even threatened once. “He threatened me, ‘If you tell anyone I’m shooting out in the woods, I’ll fight you.’” READ MORE: ‘It was hard to calm him down,’ says former colleague of alleged Fredericton shooter Others friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered a varying portrait of the shooter, described as a lonely person who loved first-person shooter video games, but who could also be a pleasant co-worker. Brendan Doyle, the former owner of the recently closed Read’s Newsstand and Cafe in Fredericton, told the Canadian Press he asked Raymond to stop frequenting his coffee shop after he allegedly expressed Islamophobic views and shared his dislike for Syrian refugees with patrons. “He’d been coming in almost daily for a coffee since 2010 and often stayed for an hour or two on the patio in the evenings,” Doyle said in a Facebook message Sunday evening to The Canadian Press. “While in the cafe, Matt also looked at magazines about bikes and about guns.” Jim Whelan, who worked with Raymond at an Atlantic Superstore in Fredericton about eight years ago, said he had generally found Raymond to be a pleasant co-worker who came into work smiling. “I’m shocked. I don’t know what happened. You wonder what is going on,” Whelan said. Chief Leanne Fitch has said that while people want answers to a senseless tragedy that has taken four lives, the police investigation is ongoing and is “focused on finding facts.” “I understand that there is a desire to find out what happened. We all want to know that,” Fitch said. “But you have to understand that some of that will only be released through the court process.” A regimental funeral “to celebrate the lives” of the fallen Fredericton officers will be held on Saturday at the Aitken University Centre at the University of New Brunswick.

Michael,Gordon,1426,https://greenwichfreepress.com/news/government/tesei-hortons-ramers-criticisms-are-politically-motivated-110983/,"Greenwich Free Press (https://greenwichfreepress.com/news/government/tesei-hortons-ramers-criticisms-are-politically-motivated-110983/) Last Thursday, Peter Tesei called into Sam Romeo’s radio show Greenwich Matters on WGCH 1490. Mr. Romeo, who is the chair of the town’s Housing Authority, and Mr. Tesei discussed Greenwich Time columnist Bob Horton’s recent pieces on issues in the Town’s Parking Services Department. Mr. Horton, whose columns are marked Opinion and are featured on the front page, has been a harsh critic of Tesei. On August 4, Horton wrote that Tesei should “immediately pressure the finance board to release the 2017 forensic audit of the Parking Services Department, and order an independent criminal investigation into possible corruption suggested by the department’s lax handling of cash receipts and pre-paid parking cards.” Horton said that $2 million was lost as a result of voided parking tickets over a six year period ending in June 2016 according to an audit conducted by RSM US LLP, an international tax, audit and consulting firm. Mr. Romeo said Bob Horton had nothing nice to say about the town of Greenwich. Mr. Tesei said the demand that the audit be released was politically motivated and would jeopardize the trial of Mr. Michael Gordon, who allegedly stole about $11,000 cash from Parking Services. “There was an individual arrested last year for theft of public funds in parking services,” Tesei said. “The person is pending trial for theft and during this period of time, the BET who conducted an internal audit, and then spent $150,000 on an outside audit, have been bickering over whether these reports should be released.” He said last October there was much debate in the audit committee that fell along party lines, and that Jeff Ramer urged the release of these documents. Tesei said the Town attorney went to the chief state’s attorney Richard Colangelo, who wrote back asking that the audit not be made public as it could put the prosecution at risk of Mr. Gordon. Tesei said that earlier in the day he learned that two members of the BET – Mr. Ramer and Jill Oberlander – had met with Mr. Colangelo along with the town attorney and chief of police to follow up on having the reports released, and again were advised that to do so would jeopardize the prosecution and open the possibility of nullifying the case. “And it was made clear to them that the reason it appeared to them wanting to do this was pure politics,” Tesei said. “That’s so much of what’s around us today and, unfortunately it is here in Greenwich.” As for voided parking tickets, Tesei said Parking Services, which takes in an annual revenue of around $5 million, had a longstanding policy of voiding tickets, but that did not constitute malfeasance as Mr. Horton suggested. Mr. Horton’s column focused on the history of voided tickets, calling them “unauthorized,” and suggested the $11,000 allegedly stolen by Mr. Gordon was “a drop in the proverbial bucket compared to the $2 million identified as ‘possibly misappropriated’ by the audit firm.” Tesei did not mention Rita Azrelyant, the then director of Parking Services whose position he after the November 2017 election. Ms. Azrelyant has since initiated a lawsuit alleging there was retaliation for her speaking out about unethical practices and mismanagement and that she was unfairly fired. Tesei said the Town’s retired risk manager, Ron Lalli, who is an internal auditor, has been working three days a week in Parking Services, looking at the voids and categorizing them. He said former Parking Services Director Allen Corry had a longstanding practice of giving reprieves to first time offenders who came to the window, and that it was “customer service” to forgive a first time ticket. Tesei said there were also tickets forgiven when people dropped their parking tags, or the tags fell off their rearview mirrors. “There were reasons why things were done as it relates to the voids,” he said. “They don’t relate to malfeasance. And there’s no way to even prove that.” Further, he said, in Greenwich, volunteers serve as parking ticket hearing officers. In fact, Mr. Romeo said he was a parking ticket hearing officer for five years, and that there were many instances when people missed the 15-day deadline to pay a ticket before it doubled, and they would be forgiven the doubling and pay just the initial fine. “I’m sick and tired of seeing this blogger on the front of the paper,” Romeo said, referring to Mr. Horton. “He seems to like people of a particular political persuasion, or who feed him things and are sort of like a dissident mentality,” Tesei said. “He uses his column selectively to provide partial information. There is no secret he is part of the Democratic party and was part of the campaign night this past November along with their standard bearer smiling ear to ear. There’s a ‘Let’s see who we can take down mentality.’” “I’m tired of being bullied by people. Mr. Ramer is a bully. I’ll say it to his face through the air. He’s trying to cast a pall on the town,” Tesei continued. “There’s a lot of good that’s happening and they don’t want the person in the front office to take credit for the good, they only want me to take credit for the bad.” Tesei said members of the BET should be more willing to work together, “rather than figure out ways to score political points to get political traction.” “This is also fueled in part because there are a lot of people angry about national issues,” Tesei said, segueing to the large number of candidates who ran for RTM last November. “So they got involved. They’re looking for anything to latch on to. Some of them never even voted before in local elections… But they exercised their right, God bless them, but they were emboldened by something not relevant to the town per se.” Romeo said he was disheartened by last November’s municipal elections. “We’ve never let outside national politics influence us. But it got real nasty, real dirty and it’s all because there’s a hatred of Donald Trump,” he said. “To bring it into the town of Greenwich and denigrate our Town is not right. That’s not the town I care to live in. …I think we as Town fathers have an obligation to get the right message out there and work as hard as we can to show the face of Greenwich – the face of Greenwich that Bob Horton doesn’t even know about because he doesn’t even live here.” Tesei said Mr. Horton uses information selectively. “He uses innuendo. It is driven by animus. He thinks he’s going to win a Pulitzer Prize.” Tesei said he has tried to be responsive to Mr. Horton’s requests for information, but, “It’s evident you can’t deal with people who carry such animus and hatred because they’re not interested in being fair and objective.” Mr. Romeo said the only reason the issue of the BET audits is coming up is to damage Tesei’s reputation. Tesei suggested that anger at him is actually misplaced anger at the president, and blamed the media. “I won’t be a punching bag for what’s really a bully mentality. Some people on the other side of the aisle will say it all started with Donald Trump. But it began before him,” Tesei said. “I think the media owns this. The media gives people attention. If the media gives people attention for doing something, they’re only going to do it more.” The First Selectman went on to say he sets a tone of civility in his office and that he was disappointed that members of the BET were “pulling punches.” “There are things the BET has done that, if presented in a certain way can have an appearance of conflict,” he said. “If that’s how we want to proceed, it’ll be a bad day and a bad time for the Town. I would hate to go down that road.” He said there is an individual on the BET who represents one of the Town’s largest property owners, and that creates an appearance of conflict. Acknowledging that the person received the approval of the Board of Ethics, he said however, “In this case this member represented the property owner on the appeal in court, and sat on the BET, which sets the budget for the law department.” “There is an appearance of conflict. If we want to go down that road, be my guest, we’ll be pointing it out and we’ll be driving people away from the essence of what makes Greenwich great, which is its volunteers,” he said. “It’s a sorry state of affairs when national political tactics are brought to bear in a community like Greenwich, because it will destroy the essence of Greenwich.” Romeo agreed. “Hopefully in this next election we can have a louder voice and we’ll be more successful and turn our state around because this state has been controlled by one party and we’re near bankruptcy. Enough is enough on that.” Tesei said people who criticize him for the unpublished Parking Services audits, his ‘Greenwich First’ slogan and the voided parking tickets are trying to create a diversion from the state’s poor economy. “Anyone reviewing this issue is chuckling, saying it’s like watching a schoolyard fight while there is a major war going on,” he said. Note: Jeff Ramer and DTC chair declined to comment for this article. the cost of living in Greenwich is far higher than the national average. There is a shortage of jobs that pay a living wage. Residents are challenged to pay a higher percentage of their income for housing and other basic needs. The result is an increase in the number of people in Greenwich struggling to make ends meet.

Michael,Gordon,1426,http://med.miami.edu/news/um-and-civic-leaders-honor-dr.-michael-s.-gordon,"11.19.2018 Miller School of Medicine Departments and Centers Miller School Departments, Centers and Institutes Close University of Miami and Miami-Dade leaders paid tribute to Michael S. Gordon, M.D., Ph.D., a legendary Miller School of Medicine researcher, clinician and educator, on Wednesday, August 15, at the co-designation of the Dr. Michael S. Gordon Plaza on NW 14th Street at Highland Road. The ceremony was presented by Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos A. Gimenez, Vice Chairwoman Audrey M. Edmonson and City of Miami Commissioner Wifredo (Willy) Gort. “Dr. Gordon exemplified what it means to be a faculty member at our Miller School of Medicine,” said UM President Julio Frenk. “He was a dedicated teacher who instilled in his students a love of technology and an understanding of the human side of medicine. His research saved countless lives, and he was dedicated to serving the entire community.” More than 100 Miller School professionals, first-responders, family members and friends honored the legacy of Gordon, who spent 41 years on the Miller School faculty from 1966 until his death in 2017. During his distinguished tenure, Gordon created Harvey, the world’s first cardiopulmonary patient simulator; UMedic, an innovative training program; and founded the Michael S. Gordon Center for Research in Medical Education. “Today’s dedication is a fitting tribute for a great man and a dear friend who transformed the way we provide emergency care here, and around the country and the world,” said Gimenez, who worked with Gordon in the 1990s to transform training for Miami-Dade’s first-responders. “Mike developed life-saving protocols for handling heart attacks and other medical emergencies. Today, we have the finest emergency medical systems in the world, due in no small part to his work.” Edward Abraham, M.D., Executive Vice President for Health Affairs and CEO of UHealth – the University of Miami Health System, called Gordon “an innovative giant” in medical education and patient care. “He was a pioneer and we are following in his footsteps, as we transform the delivery of medicine,” he added. Miller School Dean Henri R. Ford, M.D., M.H.A., called Gordon a role model for today’s students to emulate. He cited Gordon’s intelligence, curiosity, creativity, tenacity, leadership and humility. “When developing his simulator, he didn’t call it Michael Gordon,” said Ford. “Instead, he named it for his mentor [cardiologist Proctor Harvey, M.D]. That teaches all of us the importance of giving back.” After unveiling the new Michael Gordon Plaza nameplate with members of her family, Lynda Gordon thanked attendees for commemorating her husband’s legacy. “Michael had a saying, ‘If you want to go faster, go alone, but if you want to go further, go together,’” she said. “Michael encouraged his students to go further.” Over the years, the Gordons have provided ongoing financial support to the Gordon Center and endowed a chair for its director, S. Barry Issenberg, M.D., Senior Associate Dean for Research in Medical Education. They have also funded scholarships for medical students and made donations to the Richter Library, Frost School of Music, Jerry Herman Ring Theatre, Department of Athletics and other programs. “The Gordons have been generous supporters of UM, donating their time and treasure,” said Frenk. “Now, with the dedication of this plaza, we can honor Michael Gordon’s life and legacy in perpetuity.” News Archives More than 100 Miller School professionals, first-responders, family members and friends turned out for the ceremony.

Robert,Hoopes,1425,http://www.theintell.com/news/20180815/second-lower-south-defendant-in-corruption-case-to-change-plea,"Doylestown resident Robert P. Hoopes, the former Lower Southampton director of public safety, has filed to change his not guilty plea in the ongoing federal municipal corruption case. The second of three former Lower Southampton officials facing charges in an ongoing federal municipal corruption probe has filed paperwork to change his plea. Former Lower Southampton Public Safety Director Robert P. Hoopes, 71, of Doylestown, is scheduled to appear at a change of plea hearing Sept. 5 at the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, according to court records. Hoopes previously pleaded not guilty to a laundry list of charges including money laundering, witness tampering, bribery and extortion stemming from an undercover federal investigation starting in 2015, when he was working for the township as a conflict attorney. The court filing does not indicate what charges the plea change involves. This news organization was unsuccessful in reaching Hoopes’ attorney, William Winning, for comment Wednesday. Hoopes’ plea change would leave former Lower Southampton District Judge John Waltman, 60, of Lower Southampton, the only defendant scheduled for a jury trial set for mid-October in Philadelphia. Waltman faces charges including money laundering, bribery, extortion and conspiracy in two superseding indictments first released in December 2016. Hoopes and Waltman are accused of laundering $400,000 that they believed to be the proceeds of drug trafficking and health care fraud that were given to them by undercover federal agents while they were in office in 2015 and 2016, according to court documents. They are also charged with accepting bribes from four businesses in an alleged pay-to-play scheme, and with conspiring to fix a traffic ticket for an undercover agent before Waltman’s court. Hoopes faces an additional charge of witness tampering for allegedly trying to get a witness to lie before a federal grand jury about the $1,000 bribe the three defendants allegedly took in the ticket-fixing case, according to court documents. Hoopes worked as a Lower Southampton police officer from 1969 to 1988 before retiring on disability. He returned to law school to become an attorney practicing civil and criminal law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The supervisors hired him as conflict attorney for Lower Southampton in 2014 and he continued in the role through 2015 handling development projects involving County Builders, of Warminster, though an investigation by this news organization last year found then-township Solicitor Michael Savona continued to work on County Builders projects for the township after declaring he had a conflict of interest that resulted in Hoopes’ hiring. The board of supervisors unanimously hired Hoopes in February 2016 as the township's first public safety director; he was terminated 11 months later, following his indictment. If Hoopes pleads guilty, he will join fellow defendant former deputy state constable Bernard Rafferty, 63, of Lower Southampton, who admitted in March that he helped Waltman and Hoopes in laundering cash and with the ticket-fixing scheme. Sentencing hearings for Rafferty, as well as Savona, former credit union manager Kevin Biederman, of Philadelphia, former digital sign salesman Robert DeGoria, of New Jersey, who each also entered guilty pleas in the corruption cases, are scheduled later this year, after the October trial. Biederman admitted to charges he used his position at the Philadelphia Federal Credit Union to produce phony documents to facilitate the money laundering operation. DeGoria pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and IRS about his financial dealings with Waltman and Hoopes. Savona, whose Pennsylvania law license has been suspended, admitted lying to federal investigators about his knowledge of an alleged $10,000 bribe from DeGoria to Waltman and Hoopes.

It is particularly delicious when it is played and sung as gorgeously as it was here. Andrew Davis and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra were showered with plaudits at last year’s Edinburgh Festival for Wagner’s Die Walküre. The team reunited for a piece that’s soaked in Wagner, and Davis certainly drew out the shimmering Wagnerian textures for all they were worth. Yet he did so with a twinkle in his eye, with fleet tempos that emphasised the magic and the whimsy.

McDowell opens the season tonight against R-S Central at home (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titan defensive backs Andrew Green (12) and Brycen Seymore (right) celebrate after a big hit during last week's scrimmage. McDowell opens the season tonight against R-S Central at home (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday night. Since the McDowell Titans and R-S Central Hilltoppers started opening the season against one another in 2011, fans of both have spent more than their share of time on the edges of their seats. There’s no reason to believe tonight’s game will be any different. The Titans make their 2018 debut at home tonight against the Hilltoppers (7:30 kickoff) in a rivalry that has been decided by single digits in five of the last seven meetings. Only an 11-point Hilltopper win in 2014 and a forfeit victory by the Titans in 2016 (a 20-point Central win on the field) have bucked the trend of tight games. Last year, R-S Central escaped with a hard-fought 20-14 victory after intercepting the Titans in the end zone in the closing minutes of play. It was a finish that foreshadowed the second-half difficulties the Titans would endure the rest of the season. Not surprisingly, McDowell head coach Andy Morgan said his team would need to execute well all night. “We’ve had a good week of practice and we have a good game plan,” said the third-year head coach. “The kids understand what they’re supposed to do on both sides of the ball. All we have to do is go out and execute it.” That task should be easier for the Titans than it was last season, when they finished 2-9. McDowell has senior leaders scattered all over the field on both offense and defense, including quarterback Adam Randolph, receivers Dakota Effler and Andruw Randolph, running back J.C. Olivo, lineman Nathaniel McEntire and linebackers Andrew Davis and Cedric Biddle. They’ll be pitted against a Hilltoppers club that went 4-7 a year ago but features a young roster with only seven seniors and 17 sophomores and freshmen. Morgan said he’s been impressed with R-S Central regardless of the Hilltoppers’ youth. “They’ve got a big, physical fullback and a quarterback that runs it well,” said Morgan. “Their slots are pretty athletic and their splits are very athletic. They’re smaller up front than they have been, but they come off the ball pretty well.” But the coach said he’s more concerned with how his team performs than what happens on the other side of the ball. “It all comes down to how we execute, and how few missed assignments we have,” said Morgan. “The kids are going to play hard no matter what, but that’s not always enough. “But we’ll be ready. They’re ready to play someone else and get that salty taste out of their mouths a little bit.” Notes: Former Titan assistant coach Andrew Denton is now the defensive coordinator at R-S Central…McDowell is 20-19 all-time against the Hilltoppers…Morgan said the Titans have been fortunate to avoid preseason injuries. The only malady in recent weeks was – oddly enough – a dog bite sustained by sophomore kicker Seth Baird last week. Morgan said Baird would be fine for tonight’s game…The Titans are 24-22-1 all-time in season openers. McDowell voters cast 9,456 against the increase while only 4,580 gave their support.

Andrew,Davis,1423,https://www.thebozho.com/madison-movies-chain-reaction/,"By Tom Whitcomb Unless you’re from New York or L.A., when your town appears on the big screen, it’s kind of a big deal. In a recurring series, we aim to revisit the times Madison has gone Hollywood. Two things I love unequivocally are 1990s action movies (or “Big Dumb Movies,” as I like to call them) and flicks that star Keanu Reeves. Released in 1996, Chain Reaction checks both of these boxes. Directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) and co-starring Morgan Freeman and Rachel Weisz, Chain Reaction is a techno-thriller about the invention of a hydrogen-based power source and the U.S. government’s attempts to prevent it from popularizing because that would collapse the world economy (stupid clean energy!). As has been the case with the other two movies we’ve looked at so far, Chain Reaction’s Madison ties are centered largely around the Wisconsin State Capitol building, which again takes on the role of “U.S. Capitol.” So it’s not so much a Madison movie as it is a movie with a brief production stop in Madison (although nearby Lake Geneva and Williams Bay play themselves). Keanu Reeves is Eddie Kasalivich, a University of Chicago student and machinist who is framed for the murder of his boss and for the destruction of their laboratory. He goes on the run with colleague Dr. Lily Sinclair (Weisz), who’s also being framed, and the two must work to clear their names. If you hadn’t guessed, the laboratory is home to that mysterious power source from earlier. And of course there’s an evil corporation pursuing the tech; Brian “Succession” Cox plays the CEO. We get a couple shots of the rotunda and then one of the greatest cameos in Wisconsin film history: U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who was then a state representative! Yep, that’s a damn helicopter chasing the airboat. This world is governed by madness. The chase is an excellent metaphor for this movie — it constantly goes big and usually ends up failing miserably. Chain Reaction isn’t a great film, and Keanu Reeves was “rewarded” for his performance with a nomination for 1996 Razzie for Worst Actor. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t any excitement in the area for the movie. After all, it starred probably immortal action star Reeves and legendary actor (and future noted sexual harasser) Morgan Freeman. Plus director Andrew Davis had just made The Fugitive, one of the most popular films of the era. Accordingly, Madison Mayor Paul Soglin and his wife Sara treated the trio to dinner at The Blue Marlin. (It later became Hamilton’s on the Square and is now called Boar and Barrel.) The Wisconsin State Journal’s Pat Simms reported that wait staff said the two actors had “impeccable taste in wine.” And with filming taking place at the Capitol, Chain Reaction also marks the screen debuts of a few Wisconsin politicians. For example, Republican representative Mickey Lehman, who died last year at age 74, is the guy beside Baldwin. Several other current and ex-political staffers also appear. And former Wisconsin State Journal reporter Jeff Mayers (co-founder and current president of Wispolitics.com) even published an article for the paper’s March 3, 1996 edition chronicling his time as an extra in the movie. Mayers’ charming story starts with his arrival into the world of big-budget movie-making and sees the journalist attempting to navigate it. He finds humor in the rigid scheduling and constant micromanaging of the endeavor. As someone who pretty much hung out in the background, Mayers offered an interesting fly-on-the-wall perspective to the casting of extras. (To spot him, Mayers said to “look for the Jimmy Stewart look-alike in a blue overcoat walking briskly like an important Capitol person in a hurry.”) Chain Reaction is not required viewing by any stretch. It’s pretty much The Fugitive but more nonsensically contrived and nowhere near as gripping. In fact, Reeves turned down Speed 2: Cruise Control (and a $11 million paycheck) because he was so worn out by the end of Chain Reaction. And that’s kind of how I felt after watching Chain Reaction: exhausted and unsure when I want to foray back into the world of Big Dumb Movies. But that airboat chase, though… comments //Javascript Created by Computerhope http://www.computerhope.com //store the quotations in arrays var images = [], index = 0; images[0] = ""<a href = 'https://www.thebozho.com/win-free-bozho-tshirt/' target='blank'><img src='https://www.thebozho.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/free-t-shirt.jpg'></a>""; images[1] = ""<a href = 'https://www.thebozho.com/newsletters/'><img src='https://www.thebozho.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Newsletter.jpg'></a>""; index = Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length); document.write(images[index]); //done Copyright © 2018 The Bozho LLC.

After the incident that destroyed her life, she felt ashamed and blamed herself for what it has also done to her mother. She attempted suicide twice and said she now wears a fake smile as she is unable to forget. “I felt filthy and ashamed.” Now 26, the woman said he should suffer for what he did to her and has asked the judge who had to sentence him to send a message to men who prey on young girls. Justice Gillian Lucky did just that yesterday when she sentenced Peter Andrew Davis to 11 years’ and seven months hard labour for rape. Lucky said she too was concerned that young boys and girls were seen as preys, and sent a message to rapists that they will feel the full brunt of the law for their acts. Davis, 36, was convicted of rape by a jury on May 8. Even after his conviction he still maintained his innocence. In early May 2006, he offered the girl a ride to meet her cousin. Instead, he took her to a house in Central Trinidad, where he raped her. She begged him to stop, but he told her it would stop hurting. He did not stop and after raping her he sent her home, told her to take a bath and not tell anyone. Rumours of the incident and ridicule by others led her to speak to her mother a month later and the rape was reported to the police. In a victim impact statement, the victim said it affected her school work and she is always depressed around Mother’s Day since the rape took place two weeks before that day. She also harbours guilt for what it has done to her mother. “It made me feel it is my fault.” In sentencing Davis, the judge reminded that the maximum penalty for rape was life imprisonment. She also said the rape was premeditated, and began her sentencing starting point at 13 years’ hard labour. She shaved off only one year because of his clean criminal record and the positive probation officer’s report, but said she was not going to give any more discounts other than the five months he spent in jail awaiting trial and after his conviction. She was also critical of the way Davis treated his victim after he raped her. “He was more interested in protecting himself. “This court cannot turn a blind eye to the prevalence and seriousness of this type of offence,” Lucky said. The State was represented by prosecutor Gisele Heller-Ferguson. ORIGINAL STORY: Peter Andrew Davis was yesterday sentenced to 11 years’ and seven months hard labour for a 2006 rape.

Bob,Diamond,1372,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/anthony-hilton-banker-bashers-will-wince-at-tale-of-barclays-high-life-a3907896.html,"At the launch of The Bank that Lived a little: Barclays in the age of the very free market*, Philip Augar, the author, said while this book is about Barclays it is also about the City. Barclays may have got closer than all the others in seeking to be a global bank in the era after Big Bang in 1986, but in essence all the others wanted that too. It was just that they weren’t any good at it and lost fortunes trying to make it work. So you know who you are Barclays did at least live a little. And Augar’s book makes a gripping read, partly by marshalling the facts, but more by interviewing the people who worked there or thereabouts. Understandably many preferred to remain anonymous but without them he could not have told the story. It helped too that he had worked in the City. The launch also featured Bob Diamond, for a long time the CEO of Barclays Capital, and then the chief executive of the whole group, who left amid the Libor scandal. It was as well he was there — it would have been like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark otherwise — but it was also rather odd. Clearly Augar had interviewed him several times, clearly Diamond did not get it all his own way, but they were surprisingly friendly. Perhaps Diamond has mellowed. Perhaps Augar does not like confrontation. Nevertheless he made some good points. He talked about Diamond’s stare, and how no one wanted to be in the room when it happened. Diamond, for his part, thought no CEO likes bad news. He was building the bank and there was no room for passengers. That actually was the crux of it. Diamond says Barclays had great strengths in its brand and credit rating. On top of that he imposed risk management and financing, which became the bank’s competitive strengths at a time when the euro was making European capital markets viable and companies were beginning to embrace bond finance. He also is a hard-driving American, and Barclays was among the best of the bonus payers, albeit only once he had got rid of the majority of Barclays Capital, who he says did not know what they were doing. Augar also says Barclays today is financially sound. So where did it go wrong? Risk management meant more leverage — much more — and that alarmed regulators. But it was only part of it. The financial crisis got all regulators belatedly on their mettle, but Barclays took no money from government and therefore saw no reason to stop doing what it was doing. Indeed because other banks were disabled it was even more gung-ho. When the regulators made it plain that Barclays Capital had to slow down, the bank took no notice. When the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Adair Turner, handed a letter of concern to the chairman of Barclays, Marcus Agius, the latter again took no notice. It was only when the Bank of England intervened that Diamond realised he had to go. The regulators had all had enough. It has to be said that the non-executives were also poor when they could have made a difference. They were in principle big-hitters but in fact in thrall to Diamond. They did not seem to think Barclays had to toe the line and in spite of the crisis they seemed not to have made any connection with the real world either. But perhaps it was ever thus. Martin Taylor (the earlier ceo who gets a good press in the book) rapidly became disillusioned with his earlier generation of non-executives and decided to quit. Diamond says he was a lightning rod for all the banks so he had to resign; he was the last one standing from the class of 2007 financial crisis, but he took it badly to start with. Augar for his part, thinks the Libor scandal, which was not of Diamond’s making, should not have forced him out. But is that really so? John Varley, the chief executive during the financial crisis, is facing fraud charges along with three others over the raising of share capital from Qatar. This was when the bank was determined to avoid government finance and was looking to raise it from elsewhere. Augar naturally cannot discuss this because it is sub judice, but it is unfinished business. And of course there are other scandals with Libor and the foreign exchange market showing how wrong the culture was. And there are billions of pounds of compensation for PPI, the mis-selling of mortgage protection insurance. But the one which rankles to most observers is how business customers were sold interest rate risk hedging products which only protected them from rates going up. When they in fact went down, the customers were left with huge losses and many lost their businesses as a result. It was a Barclays Capital product, and it made the bank a lot of money, although it has since paid out significant sums in compensation. Barclays has betrayed these customers and nothing will get them back. Did Diamond know; did he care, was it collateral damage or was it devil take the hindmost? Augar’s book is good but only those in the City will like it. The rest of the country has a different take on bankers and the way in which relationships went down the tubes while the bank jacked up profits. Barclays may indeed have lived a little, but is a scandal that so many others had to pay the price.

(NASDAQ: COCP), (“Cocrystal” or the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company discovering and developing novel antiviral therapeutics that target the replication machinery of hepatitis viruses, influenza viruses and noroviruses, announced today its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and provided a corporate update. Recent Corporate Highlights: Dr. Gary Wilcox, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cocrystal, commented, “We are pleased with the progress we have made over the course of the first half of the year. Moving forward, our focus for the second half of this year is delivering on the milestones we have set for our clinical programs. We continue to make progress advancing our Phase 2a study of CC-31244 for the ultra-short treatment of HepC and expect to complete patient enrollment this quarter. Importantly, we look forward to announcing topline results from the CC-31244 Phase 2a study in the fourth quarter of this year and believe the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy data will be integral in guiding our next phase of development for our HepC program.” Clinical Programs Overview Pan-Genotypic Non-Nucleoside Inhibitor for the Ultra-short Treatment of Hepatitis C CC-31244, the Company’s lead product in development for HepC, is an investigational, oral, potent, broad-spectrum replication inhibitor called a non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI). It has a high barrier to drug resistance designed and developed using the Company's proprietary structure-based drug discovery technology. It is active against HepC genotypes 1-6 with low level cytotoxicity in multiple cell types. CC-31244 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2a clinical study for the ultra-short treatment of HepC-infected individuals. The Phase 2a open-label study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of CC-31244 with Epclusa®. Enrolled subjects will self-administer orally 400 mg of CC-31244 and a fixed dose of Epclusa for 14 days. After 14 days the subjects will continue the treatment for another 4 weeks on Epclusa alone. Subjects will be followed up until 24 weeks after the last dose of Epclusa to determine if they have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are SVR at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) and at 24 weeks post-treatment (SVR24), respectively. Expected Near-Term CC-31244 Clinical Program Milestones: Influenza A and Influenza A/B Inhibitors In addition to the Company’s HepC clinical program, Cocrystal is developing novel, broad spectrum influenza antivirals that are specifically designed to be effective against all important A strains of the influenza virus and to have a high barrier to resistance due to the way they target the virus. Cocrystal’s uniquely developed molecules target the influenza polymerase, an essential replication enzyme with several highly conserved regions common to all influenza strains, including pandemic strains. CC-42344, the Company’s lead molecule, binds to a highly conserved PB2 site of influenza polymerase complex (PB1: PB2: PA) and exhibits a novel mechanism of action. CC-42344 has shown excellent antiviral activity against influenza A strains, including avian pandemic strains and Tamiflu® resistant strains, and shows a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. CC-42344 is currently being evaluated in preclinical IND-enabling studies for the treatment of influenza. Further, the Company has identified molecules which have activity against both strain A and Strain B. Several of these have potencies approaching single digit nanomolar. Cocrystal is comparing them with its influenza A inhibitor, CC-42344 and will determine which program(s) to take forward based on data obtained in Q3 and Q4 2018. The Company is considering both oral and inhaled routes of delivery. Expected Near-Term CC-42344 Clinical Program Milestones: Summary of Financial Results for Q2 2018 For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $1,343,000 and $2,897,000 compared to a net loss of approximately $1,002,000 and $3,551,000 for the same periods in 2017. Total research and development expenses were approximately $1,119,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared with $1,255,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $136,000, or 11%, was due to the reduction in the timing of clinical trials costs. Total research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were $1,997,000, compared with $3,325,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease of $1,328,000 or 40%, was the result of timing of clinical trials activity. On May 3, 2018, Cocrystal announced the closing of an underwritten public offering. The gross proceeds to Cocrystal from this offering were approximately $8.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. On May 14, 2018, the underwriter exercised the option to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover overallotments for additional gross proceeds of $439,000. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, cash provided by financing activities totaled $8,869,000. Our 2018 financing activities included $7,684,000 net proceeds from the sale of common stock, $1,000,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $185,000 in proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 amounted to approximately $3,000,000 in proceeds from our sale of common stock. About Cocrystal Pharma, Inc.

Temps nearly steady in the mid to upper 30s. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy skies with late-night snow showers. Low 28F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of snow 40%. Updated: November 19, 2018 @ 2:42 pm OK, the Lions were more lucky than good Sunday. Anyone who follows the news realizes that we live in extraordinary times. We live in an era of toxic and divisive political rhetoric as well as acts of violence that include domestic and foreign- inspired terrorism. How did we arrive at this uncomfortable place? What can we do about it? John O'NeillJohn O’Neill John O'NeillJohn O’Neill No president was more ambitious than Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ). Not only did he vow to continue the agenda of John F. Kennedy (his fallen predecessor), he intended to expand it. Whereas Franklin D. Roosevelt had the New Deal, Harry Truman had the Fair Deal, and John F. Kennedy had the New Frontiers, LBJ proposed his own theme: The Great Society. And an integral part of the Great Society was LBJ’s declared War on Poverty. History scholar Joshua Zeitz examines LBJ’s sweeping agenda in his current book “Building the Great Society: Inside Lyndon Johnson’s White House.” What Seitz drives home is how working for LBJ was a 24 hour a day job. His inner circle included Joseph Califano, Horace Busby, Bill Moyers, Harry McPherson, and Jack Valenti. With the exception of Califano, these were all vintage LBJ men. Califano was a left over from the Kennedy administration, having served at the Department of Defense under Secretary Bob McNamara. LBJ scooped him up to become his chief domestic policy adviser. But even if Califano was the only Kennedy man in LBJ’s inner circle, LBJ made the most of Kennedy’s people. He kept the Kennedy cabinet intact after the assassination in 1963 and utilized to a great degree the Kennedy appointees. This was most true in the case of Sargent Shriver, Kennedy’s brother-in-law and the head of the Peace Corps when LBJ recruited him 1964 to head the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which encompassed LBJ’s two most cherished programs: Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), which was a domestic Peace Corps, and Head Start, designed to feed and help disadvantaged children. Zeitz’s book is valuable in showing how LBJ’s Great Society went well beyond the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Of course, these two acts were LBJ’s crowning achievements. But in 1965 there was still much work to be done which LBJ intended to complete. The other important value to Zeitz’s book is how it exposes the myth of the rift between the Kennedy people and the LBJ people in the latter’s administration. Except for Attorney General Bobby Kennedy, the slain president’s brother, LBJ had warm feelings for all of Kennedy’s people. Moreover, the level of disdain harbored between LBJ and Bobby Kennedy has always been exaggerated. For every tense discussion conducted by the two men was a friendly and warm conversation. Unfortunately, Zeitz himself falls into this trap, portraying the LBJ-Bobby Kennedy relationship as nothing but hostile. This misnomer detracts from the author’s overall revelation that good feelings prevailed between the LBJ people and the Kennedy people. Unfortunately, no examination of LBJ’s administration can avoid the tragedy of the Vietnam War. Insidious in nature, a minimal military commitment in late 1963 and early 1964, it erupted as a major conflict with a high cost in money and lives. Its infringement on the Great Society was inevitable. Regarding Vietnam, Zeitz makes a major error in declaring that LBJ was determined not to let the military conflict interfere with his Great Society. In hindsight, it is clear that LBJ was quite willing to allow Vietnam to infringe on his Great Society. LBJ was stubborn in his refusal to allow South Vietnam fall to communist North Vietnam. And he was well aware of the toll in both lives and money. Still, LBJ was sincere in viewing the Vietnam War as a continuation of the Kennedy agenda. LBJ’s predecessor was not much more flexible in his Vietnam policy and very much subscribed to the Domino Theory (the principle that if one country was allowed to fall to communism, other countries would follow). But this aspect of Vietnam (as just another Kennedy program LBJ intended to carry out) is neglected by Zeitz. Building the Great Society is still a well researched and informative book. But it’s not written for the casual reader. It’s not a book for the mere history buff. “Building the Great Society” is detailed and anything but light reading. On the other hand, it’s important reading insofar as it portrays the United States at its best. LBJ may not be considered by the academic elite as one of our great presidents, but his presidency was productive and he has been vindicated by history when compared to his political foes in the segregationist camp. Zeitz’s very much succeeds in making a favorable case for LBJ. John O’Neil is an Allen Park freelance writer. He has a degree in history from Wayne State University.

Andrew,Davis,1368,https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/article216357220.html,"By John Sowell jsowell@idahostatesman.com August 09, 2018 12:14 AM A trucking company will have to extend sound barriers to better muffle sounds heading toward a neighboring mobile home park from a proposed trucking terminal south of the Boise Airport. The Boise Design Review Committee voted 5-1 to approve the proposal from R+L Carriers. The decision came after nearly three hours of testimony Wednesday night. Neighbors from the Blue Valley mobile home park complained about noise, diesel fumes and potential danger to children living in the area, which is just west of Interstate 84. The company, which plans to build a terminal with about 100 bays, agreed before the meeting to install an 8-foot wall to keep truck sounds from bothering neighbors. But many of the people said that didn’t go far enough. Committee member Thomas Zabala, an architect, suggested raising the wall or berm to the height of the tallest stacks from the trucks that would use the terminal. The committee accepted that recommendation. For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. The committee restricted the terminal’s hours of operation from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The company will also have to install landscape buffers to shield views of the terminal from the neighborhood and nearby streets. After the vote, Chairman James Marsh told the audience, which totaled about 125 at the start of the hearing, that he hoped they felt their voices had been heard, even if they didn’t agree with the decision. Zabala said the committee appreciated the passion expressed by those who testified and those who submitted letters on the proposal. “I don’t think there were any members who were not affected by the neighbors’ letters,” he said. Bonnie Hardey, a resident, said adding the greater height requirement for the sound barrier was a good first step. But she was disappointed by the vote and said opponents would appeal to the city’s Planning and Zoning Commission. “We won’t stop,” said Hardey, a retired nurse. Hardey said she opposed allowing the company to install a fueling station at the proposed terminal at 7901 S. Eisenman Road. The underground tanks could leak, and there could be spills from the fueling operation, she said. Earl Mullins, a Boise acoustics engineer commissioned by R&L, testified that noise from the trucks driving into and out of the terminal would not add to overall sound levels. “They will be audible, but they won’t be any louder than the existing noise,” he said. He said he conducted several sound tests on the property and neighboring parcels, including the trailer park. Blue Valley was built in the early 1970s. Its 200 manufactured homes, housing about 550 people, surround a central lake, gazebo, fountain and common area. Several people who testified or wrote to the committee said they could not afford to find new housing somewhere else if the park closed. The park’s owners also opposed R+L’s plans. The area around Blue Valley was annexed by the city in 2008. At the time, it was zoned for industrial use by Ada County, according to city documents. The mobile home park was not annexed until 2013. It, too, had been zoned for industrial use by the county, and today it has a light-industrial designation. Andrew Davis, principal architect for BRS Architects of Boise, who represented R+L at the hearing, said there was no opposition to the zoning years ago. “Not a single person showed up to protest the zoning of this property then,” he said. Davis also disputed that the terminal would disrupt neighbors’ lives. He said residents are free to “stay or leave just like anyone in the city.” Stan Richards, director of R+L, based in Wilmington, Ohio, attended the hearing. He said most activity would take place after drivers arrived at about 8 a.m. until 10:30 a.m., and again in the late afternoon, at about 4:30. Rarely, trucks might come in as late as 7:30 p.m., he said. No trucks would be left idling overnight, Richards said. It’s company policy to unhitch the trucks from the trailers and park them in another part of the terminal. The trailers are left parked with their backs against the bay doors. Several Blue Valley residents testified that they wanted to be treated with respect, just like people from more affluent neighborhoods.

Rippon won season 26 of ""Dancing"" in a shortened athlete edition of the dance-competition show. ""Dancing"" pro alum Valentin Chmerkovskiy and professional choreographer Mandy Mooreknown for her work on La La Land and So You Think You Can Dancewill complete the judging panel. Dancing with the Stars: Juniors will air Sunday, Oct. 7, on ABC. Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at a forthcoming entertainment offeringbut stopped short of saying exactly what the technology giant, with nearly $250 billion in cash on its balance sheets, has planned, Deadline noted. Cook lauded Apple's recently announced partnership with Oprah Winfrey. The two reached a multi-year deal to produce original programming. Lady Gaga is clarifying her condolences after the sudden death of Rick ""Zombie Boy"" Genest at age 32, People.com noted. The Grammy winner, 32who collaborated with Genest on the 2011 music video for ""Born This Way""wrote on Twitter on Aug. 4, ""Out of respect for Rick's family, Rick & his legacy I apologize if I spoke too soon as there was no witnesses or evidence to support any conclusion for the cause of his death."" Genest was found dead in his home in Montreal. Both the Canadian authorities and Gaga have stated that the death was a suicide; however, Karim Leduc, Genest's manager, told People magazine that his family and friends think it was an accident. The successful gay comedy/mystery web series Where the Bears Are will debut its final season Monday, Sept. 10, at: wherethebearsare.tv, a press release noted.

Season seven features guest star Peter Paige ( Queer as Folk ), and the mystery centers around ""The Mr. Bear America Pageant"" in Palm Springs, California. SPOILER ALERT: Taylor Schilling ( who plays Piper ) is out as a series regular at the end of season six of Orange Is the New Black, LGBTQ Nation noted. Orange Is the New Black had been tying up Piper's loose ends for the last few seasons, instead focusing on the Daya/Taystee plot. Jaws dropped when Piper was released from prison and Schilling walked off the set, but not before marrying her on-screen love interest Alex Vause ( played by Scientologist Laura Prepon ); Alex isn't getting released anytime soon, which does open the door for a return visit by Piper. Orange Is the New Black co-stars Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver are involved in a real life, off-screen romance, a Washington Blade item noted. Martinez portrays Daddy on the Netflix series; before joining the show, she came in third on the debut season of The Voice. Tarver has played correction officer Artesian McCullough since season four. Rapper Travis Scott has responded to accusations of transphobia after apparently removing transgender model Amanda Lepore from the cover of his new album, PinkNews noted. The musician, who released Astroworld recently, said he was sorry for the ""misunderstanding"" in an Instagram post. In part, he wrote, ""Astroworld is about love and expression not hate! This is very important for me to speak up about: Growing up I've been taught to accept everyone, not to cast people away but bring them into your home!

Lance Bass thought he had bought the home featured in the opening and closing scenes of The Brady Bunchbut in an Instagram post titled ""'Here's the story of a shady Brady,"" the 'N Sync singer wrote that the deal fell through at the last minute, USA Today noted. Bass wrote he was ""heartbroken"" to learn a corporate buyer wants the house ""at any cost."" The two-bedroom, three-bathroom split-level home in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles was purchased in 1973 for $61,000; the 2018 listing price was almost $1.9 million.

It's a rare return to the music-video world for Gehrig after focusing on award-winning commercial work for clients such as Sport England, John Lewis and Honda. Two-time Academy Award-winner Jodie Foster has signed with CAA in all areas, TheWrap.com noted. n the past, Foster was represented for acting by ICM's Joe Funicello up until his retirement, and by UTA for directing since 2012. Foster has appeared in more than 40 films, including Inside Man, The Silence of the Lambs and The Accused; most recently, she starred in Hotel Artemis. Pose star Mj Rodriguez, along with her bestie, Mila Jam, are featured in the new documentary short One Stride: Chosen Family, a press release noted. The film, directed by Stephen Winter and presented by Barefoot, also features the late LGBTQ activist Richard Leitsch and his best friend, Paul Havern, as they all talk about the importance of chosen families. See www.barefootwine.com/chosenfamily. Tony and Grammy Award winner Billy Porter ( now on TV's Pose ) called out ""white, cisgender, rich boys"" in the LGBTQ community for closing their checkbooks once they got marriage equality in a new interview with Vulture, according to Instinct Magazine. Among other things, Porter described witnessing how some left the battle field ( taking their money with them ) when the focus of LGBTQ rights shifted from marriage to transgender protections. He added, ""We need take all that energy and focus, and shift it on to those who are less than us. That's how it works. Internal vigilance is the price of liberty. If we don't take care of the least among us, it doesn't matter how rich we are, it doesn't matter how fabulous we are."" Actress Chloe Grace Moretz is throwing shade at a rival film featuring LGBTQ characters, LGBTQ Nation noted. Moretz, 21, stars in the coming-of-age conversion-therapy drama The Miseducation of Cameron Post. While promoting the movie, Moretz revealed her stance on LGBTQ stories on-screen, specifically that ""queer films should be made be queer people""a reference to the rival conversion-therapy film Boy, Erased, due out in November. ""This movie was directed by a bisexual woman of diversity, it has a very diverse cast and we didn't cast all celebrities,"" Moretz said. ""You just look at the discrepancy and that's shocking.""

The films will be showcased at public screenings in New York on Aug. 14-15 before the finalists are chosen for a finale screening and awards ceremony in Los Angeles on Oct. 24. American Horror Story has been renewed for a 10th season, Deadline reported. ""Ryan [Murphy] asked for a 10th season of American Horror Story which we were happy to give to him,"" FX Networks CEO John Landgraf said. As Murphy recently moved to Netflix for a big overall deal there, he ""remains pretty committed"" to his FX slate, and he is ""really excited about Pose,"" which was just renewed by FX for a second season, Landgraf said. Singer Robyn has released her new single ""Missing U""her first new music as a solo artist since Body Talk in 2010, via Konichiwa/Interscope Records, a pres release noted. ""Missing U"" was recorded and written in Paris and Stockholm, and had Robyn teaming Joseph Mount ( Metronomy ) and longtime collaborator Klas Ã … hlund ( Robyn, Charli XCX, Madonna ) to write and produce the track. People can see a lyric video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o5BHH9U2Mg&feature=youtu.be. Charlotte Raewhose role as lovable house mother Mrs. Garrett on The Facts of Life charmed a TV generationhas died at 92, Deadline noted. Rae revealed last year that she had bone and pancreatic cancer, but a cause of death was not immediately revealed. Her big break into national notoriety came in 1978, when producer Norman Lear cast her in the TV show Diff'rent Strokes. Rae issued a memoir, titled The Facts of My Life, in 2015. Speaking of The Facts of Life, Sony Pictures Television has a comeback of the hit NBC sitcom in the early stages of development, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson's Appian Way and Jessica Biel's Iron Ocean Films in talks to produce, TheWrap noted. The Diff'rent Strokes spinoff aired on NBC from 1979 to 1988. There is currently no writer or network attached to the new project. Kim Kardashian was in hot water on social media after insinuating one of the most well known male models in the universe, Tyson Beckford, is gay, NewNowNext.com noted. On July 31, Beckford posted a negative comment on a photo of Kardashian on a post on someone else's Instagram account featuring an image of the media mogul. ""Sis, we all know why you don't care for it,"" Kardashian responded, adding an emoji Kermit the Frog ""sipping tea"" memeand some people began taking Kardashian to task for implying Beckford may be gayand for using that as an insult. Less than a year after taking over from Conrad Riggs as Amazon's hHead of Unscripted, Heather Schuster is exiting the company, Deadline reported. Amazon Studios is not commenting, but there are reports that Schuster's exit came after an internal investigation into alleged inappropriate comments during meetings and possible misuse of power. Riggs became embroiled in the sexual harassment allegations and claims against the Studio chief that resulted in he and several of his lieutenants being shown the door at the Seattle-based company.

Michael,Gordon,1366,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/08/09/james-tedesco-the-king-of-hard-working-backs/,"NRL NEWS Brought to you by Forwards across the game dominate the VB Hard Earned leaderboard with their workloads earning recognition, but at the Sydney Roosters it is James Tedesco who is the leader of the pack. Tedesco is one of only three outside backs that rank in the top three for their respective clubs according to VB Hard Earned data with Will Hopoate (1194 points) and Michael Gordon (1114 points) also included. The Roosters recruit had a slow start to the year by his own admission but has found his comfort zone to shape as one of the biggest threats heading into the Telstra Premiership finals. Tedesco will feature in Friday night's mouth-watering match-up between the Roosters and arch rivals South Sydney in another chapter of the book of feuds. The NSW fullback has been electric since returning from State of Origin duty and is now third behind teammate Blake Ferguson and Cowboys wrecking ball Jason Taumalolo in terms of running metres 3361 to his name. Add 11 line breaks, 112 tackle breaks and seven try assists to his name and it's fair to see where his points are coming from. On Friday night he'll no doubt be out to get the better of NSW teammate and Rabbitohs back-rower Angus Crichton, who will join the Tricolours next season on a lucrative deal. Crichton ranks as the side's best in 2018 and 11th overall on the VB Hard Earned leaderboard. Like Tedesco, Crichton had a quiet start to the season following a finger amputation in the off-season, but has returned to form following Origin to shape as a key man for the Rabbitohs on the right edge. The 22-year-old has six line breaks and four assists to his name, and has been defensively sound with a 90.8% tackle efficiency rate. The VB Hard-Earned Award index number assigned to a player each game is calculated by doubling the amount of runs a player makes, plus adding in the amount of tackles, support plays and decoys, along with offloads, tackles breaks and charge downs. Players lose a point for each missed tackle, four points for each error and penalty they concede and eight points for a sin binning. Manly forward Jake Trbojevic maintains his position on top with 1655 points. Knights workhorse Aidan Guerra (1556 points) moves into second spot to overtake Ryan James. A knee injury to Eels prop Daniel Alvaro will see him slide out of the top 10 over the coming weeks.

The utility sought an early release from his three-year contract with Super League club Warrington and will return to the Titans in 2019 on a two-year deal. The former Newcastle talent, 27, will add 135 NRL games worth of experience to Garth Brennan's young side and considerable versatility given his ability to play fullback, five-eighth, hooker or halfback. Roberts struck up a handy combination with good mate and halves partner Ashley Taylor in his previous two seasons for Gold Coast, but with Kane Elgey in the mix was never given full control of the reins. Ironically, out-of-favour Elgey's impending departure next season has allowed for Roberts' return. But his role will be no clearer even with Elgey's exit, given 19-year-old AJ Brimson has impressed in the No.6 this season. Brimson can also play fullback and with current No.1 Michael Gordon, wingers Phillip Sami and Anthony Don in good form and fellow Penrith utility Tyrone Peachey arriving next year, Brennan will be flush with options. ""Tyrone is a very good half but will also add that real utility value to our squad and the fact he can play six, seven, nine or one makes him such a valuable commodity to have,"" Brennan said. ""He's played a number of representative matches and has been a seasoned NRL player for well over five years so he knows what it takes to compete at the top."" Australian Associated Press

While economists expected the benchmark rate to be left unchanged on Thursday, the bank's guidance sees it staying at the current low for considerably longer than most forecasters were predicting. Shortly after the news the New Zealand dollar dropped around half a cent against the US dollar. Just before 9:30am the kiwi was buying US67.09c, close to the lowest level in more than two years. The OCR has a strong influence on the interest rates Kiwis pay on mortgages and earn on savings, especially floating and short term rates, although the influence has diminished the lower interest rates have fallen. READ MORE: Business leaders, economists fear NZ economy is slowing, leading survey shows ""We expect to keep the OCR at this level through 2019 and into 2020, longer than we projected in our May Statement,"" governor Adrian Orr said in the opening lines of the statement. ""The direction of our next OCR move could be up or down."" Orr said that the economy was expected to pick up pace before the end of the year, but there were risks that this may not happen. In the Reserve Bank's latest forecasts, the economy is expected to grow by about 2.8 per cent over the coming year, 0.5 percentage points lower than it expected at its last major update in May. The forecasts see lower growth in the next nine months before forecasting the economy will pick up in 2019. ""Risks remain to our central forecast. The recent moderation in growth could last longer,"" Orr said. ""Low business confidence can affect employment and investment decisions. Conversely, there is a chance that inflation could increase faster if cost pressures can pass through into higher prices and impact inflation expectations."" Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said he was surprised by degree of reaction from the central bank since May. ""While growth has slowed, we don't think that it will remain as soft over the rest of this year as the Reserve Bank expects,"" Gordon said. ""June quarter [economic growth], for instance, is actually shaping up quite strong."" ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley said his forecasts were for stronger inflation than the Reserve Bank's, as well as stronger growth forecasts and as a result was forecasting the OCR would begin to rise in late 2019. However Tuffley conceded that in terms of growth forecasts there was ""a greater degree of uncertainty than usual given the persistent weakness in business confidence to date this year"". On Monday, Treasury warned that the forecasts in May's Budget were at risk of being missed as a result of global issues, a cooling housing market and falling business confidence.

John,O'Neil,1364,http://www.sunjournal.com/oob-mans-request-for-less-prison-time-for-grandmothers-murder-denied/,"ALFRED — An Old Orchard Beach man serving a life sentence for murdering his grandmother in 2012 was denied his request for a reduced sentence. Derek Poulin, 29, appeared in York County Superior Court last month to ask Justice John O’Neil to reconsider the sentence handed down in 2015. Poulin’s attorney, Chris Nielsen, argued that the life sentence Poulin received was “cruel and unusual punishment,” and said the court failed to consider Poulin’s young age and his mental health, as well as his lack of any prior criminal history. Poulin was 23 when he murdered his 61-year-old grandmother, Patricia Noel, by beating her with a golf club and stabbing her about 70 times in her Old Orchard Beach home. Poulin then set fire to the house where he and his father also lived. Prosecutors described Poulin at his trial as an unemployed young man more interested in playing video games than a getting a job. He targeted his grandmother, they said, after she asked him to move out. Nielsen said at the time of the crime, Poulin’s brain was still developing. He said if Poulin was given a lesser sentence, he could leave prison and show that he had matured and become a better person. Justice O’Neil disagreed in a written decision last week. He said his original 2015 decision did not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and concluded that a life sentence was appropriate. “This was a brutal murder involving multiple weapons and was perpetrated upon someone who loved the defendant and had provided him with a place to live,” O’Neil wrote. The series of “cold and calculating” actions after the murder, including burning Noel’s body and the attempt to destroy the crime scene by setting the house on fire showed Poulin’s lack of remorse, the judge said. Poulin unsuccessfully tried to have the case appealed by the Maine Supreme Court, arguing that he had not had a fair trial in 2015. Derek Poulin is escorted into York County Superior Court in Alfred on Tuesday. Justice John O’Neil sentenced Poulin to life in prison for murdering his grandmother in Old Orchard Beach in 2012.

(Photo: Gazette File Photo)Buy Photo CHILLICOTHE — Former Zane Trace baseball star Andrew Davis’ competitive spirit took him far in his career, and he had it at an early age. “I remember he had a nightmare; he had been called out at second base in a little league game that day, and it was a real tight game and his dad was the umpire on the base and called him out,” said Davis’ mother Tammy Irwin. “That night, he woke me up sliding out of bed and arguing that he was safe.” The memory of being called out by his father is vague now for Davis, who has played in more baseball games than he can count. “I remember it more by everybody talking about it through the years,” Davis said. “I wouldn’t say I really remember exactly what happened, but I know I was safe.” Andrew Davis talks about his start in baseball Robert McGraw, Photographer Davis later became a star for Zane Trace baseball in the early 2000s, helping lead them to multiple state playoff appearances and even a state semi-final in 2001. He led his teams in various pitching and hitting statistical categories and was named to multiple All-Scioto Valley Conference teams. “Zane Trace, that’s definitely where I got started getting into baseball super serious,” Davis said. “The few years that I was in high school here our whole area was just like, ‘Baseball, baseball, baseball.’ … Ron Allen, my high school coach, he put in a lot of the extra time with me after practice and a lot of my teammates [and I], we would stay after here and just hit and take ground balls and fly balls and we would play baseball until someone kicked us out.” Allen, Davis’ high school coach, knew that Davis was a special player from the beginning. “[He had] great hands as far as fielding ground balls and stuff,” Allen said. “[He had a] great arm and as he started growing and maturing a little bit, by time [it] was his senior year you could tell that this guy was going to be a division one player.” A Division I college player is what Davis became, playing for Kent State University from 2004-07. During those four seasons with Kent State, Davis never hit under .300 and never hit under 40 RBIs with the team. “Kent State was definitely one of the best times of my life,” Davis said. “My coaching staff was excellent. They had so many years [of] experience in the big leagues and the minor leagues and college ball. They had so much knowledge, like you can’t even imagine the stuff you can learn in four years about something that you were already really good at … It was probably the best thing to happen to me baseball wise.” Baseball player Andrew Davis’s love of the game started at an early age and his natural ability would help Zane Trace do battle in the state tournaments. (Photo: Gazette File Photo) After graduating college, the San Francisco Giants drafted Davis in the 12th round of the 2007 MLB Draft. He played in the minors for them for two seasons alongside players like current Giants star Madison Bumgarner. “[My time] was short,” Davis said. “It’s real tough. It’s kind of a business and a lot of financial stuff goes into all the roles everybody plays in that. I did win two [minor league] championships while I was with the Giants and one of them was with Madison Bumgarner … It was a pretty good time, it just was a really, really tough time living, and just the grind.” Davis played well in the minors. In his one full season, and another shortened rookie season, Davis hit a combined .262 and knocked in 102 RBIs. He was ultimately released by the Giants during spring training in 2009. “They didn’t really give me a reason,” Davis said. “I think it just come down to that I didn’t get any money when I signed, and they had a lot of guys that signed for tons of money.” Lake Erie Crushers' Andrew Davis hits a game winning grand slam in game four of the 2009 championship series against the River City Rascal. (Photo: Photo courtesy Scott Evans Photography, Photo courtesy Scott Evans Photography) This opened a new opportunity for Davis as he joined the Lake Erie Crushers of the Frontier League — an independent professional baseball league. “I said ‘You know what? I’ll play. I don’t want to not play,’” Davis said. “So, I figured maybe I would give it another shot, and I ended up there for six years.” Those six years were memorable. From 2009-14 Davis appeared in four All-Star games, batted .292, hit 71 home runs and 387 RBIs. He also won a Frontier League Championship in his first season with the Crushers, where he hit a grand slam in game four of the championship series to help force a game five. Those stellar six seasons for Davis led to the ultimate accomplishment — being inducted into the Frontier League Hall of Fame. “My first question was, ‘Have I really been out of the league that long,’” Davis said. “It’s just an honor and I appreciate that I have earned that. It’s good to have that to share with everyone that’s supported me throughout the years.” For Davis’ mother, it felt like it was an appropriate way to honor Davis’ hard work throughout the years. “It kind of just ended,” Irwin said. “This was just a really nice honoring and something really nice for the time he put in in the league” Davis has now entered a new chapter of his life. He has been out of baseball since 2014 and is a beer salesman for Classic Brands in Chillicothe. He is unsure whether he will do something with baseball again in the future, but he has not completely closed that door yet. “I’m not going to say I wouldn’t ever go back into doing something with baseball, but for now I’ve been enjoying having some time to myself and starting a new career that I really like,” Davis said.

Thomas Hurd and Dylan Toften from Root, New York, went to the local courthouse expecting to walk away with a marriage license; town clerk Laurel Eriksen, however, rejected their bid to wed. Eriksen ""didn't process the two men's marriage license application because they failed to make an appointment with her, as everyone is required by her office to do,"" Town Attorney Robert Subik told the Daily Gazette. Still, he admitted that her religious beliefs also played a major role in her refusal. Six civil-rights organizationsincluding the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, Lambda Legal, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, National Center for Lesbian Rights and National LGBT Bar Associationfiled an amici brief urging the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to hear the appeal of Charles Rhines, a gay man on death row in South Dakota, according to a press release. According to the filing, new evidence ""suggests that at least some members of the jury accepted the notion that life in prison without parole would be fun for a gay personso much so that they felt it was necessary to impose the death penalty instead. In other words, significant evidence suggests that the jury may have sentenced Mr. Rhines to death based not on the facts of his case, but because he is gay."" The amicus brief is at https://tinyurl.com/y8eslggc. In Pennsylvania, lawyer Joshua Janis told one of his clients that a civil-union divorce was delayed because the judge had ""something against gay people and that straight people's divorces are put first""but it turned out the 37-year-old Chester County lawyer never even filed a divorce proceeding, Philly.com reported. In all, the Chester County District Attorney's Office said, more than 25 victims have come forward, alleging they paid Janis a total of more than $90,000 for work he did not do. Janis was charged with multiple felony counts of theft and related offenses. Rosie O'Donnell criticized the show Morning Joe for allowing Donald Trump a platform to attack her in 2007, calling out co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Willie Geist by name, TheWrap noted. During an appearance on MSNBC with anchor Ari Melber, the former daytime host accused MSNBC and the mainstream media of providing him a regular platform early on and not standing up to his falsehoods. Although O'Donnell has said she barely knows Trump, the feud between the two is legendary, stretching back more than a decade to their days as television hosts The Georgia Log Cabin Republicans voiced support for U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, with the group members saying they ""believe marriage equality is here to stay,"" Project Q Atlanta noted. The Human Rights Campaign said Kavanaugh ""would undermine LGBTQ equality,"" including blocking transgender troops from serving and allowing anti-LGBTQ discrimination. More than a dozen gay men were reportedly smeared and possibly outed after being arrested at an adult entertainment store in Florida, PinkNews reported. The 13 men were charged with public exposure and lascivious acts for engaging in sexual activity at the back of the Pleasure Emporium store in Hollywood, Florida, despite the acts being consensual and taking place in private rooms. Police say two undercover officers entered the adult store after receiving tip offs about sex acts in the store. San Diego State University graduate Robert DeKoven has donated $1 million to the school's LGBT programs, The San Diego Union Tribune reported. The money from DeKoven, a legal research and writing professor at California Western School of Law, will go to SDSU's Pride Center and its LGBT Studies Program. He graduated from the campus in 1980 and later helped write the city's Human Dignity Ordinance, which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation regarding employment, housing and lending. Air Force Academy football player Bradley Kim is joining the growing ranks of openly gay academy and college athletes, according to an Instinct Magazine item that cites Outsports. Kim is a safety for the Air Force football team who's recently come out as gay. After telling friends and family, Kim decided to come out publicly through an Instagram post. After he graduates, he'll move on to serve the military; once his service is done, he hopes to pursue a career in music. Alaska Airlines apologized after a flight attendant asked a gay man to give up his seat next to his partner so a straight couple could sit togetheran exchange that put the airline on the defensive as it rebutted claims of discrimination, The New York Times noted. David Cooley, the owner of a West Hollywood gay bar The Abbey, wrote on Facebook that he and his partner had boarded a flight to Los Angeles from New York when a flight attendant asked if Mr. Cooley's partner would move from his seat ""so a couple could sit together."" However, even though the company apologized, it also said what happened was a ""seating error"" and called itself a ""zero-tolerance company that does not support discrimination of any kind."" Former club-kid ringleader and founder Michael Alig has said times are hard for him since being released from prison, Instinct Magazine noted. Alig, 52who spent 17 years in jail for murdering fellow Club Kid Andre ""Angel"" Melendez in a confrontation over a delinquent drug debtrevealed that he's homeless after experiencing a major fallout with the owners of an art factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Alig spoke about his ordeal on an episode of Ernie Glam's web series Peeew!, where he's discussed the usage of hotels as his temporary home of sorts. A white police officer in Michigan who says he was taunted by fellow officers when he told them that he was part Black will receive a $65,000 settlement, CNN noted. Sgt. Cleon Browna 19-year veteran with the police department in Hastings, Michigansaid a series of taunts began in 2016 when he took a genetic test through Ancestry.com and learned that he is 18-percent African. His colleagues at the police department were whispering ""Black Lives Matter"" while pumping their fists as they walked past him and his police chief referred to him as ""Kunta""a reference to a character in Alex Haley's novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family and in the Roots TV miniseries. Reactions were mixed following last month's news that Town Housea 40-year-old St. Paul, Minnesota, LGBTQ+ bar and an all-around institutionwould reopen as a soccer bar, CityPages.com noted. Enter R Lounge, a new ""lounge-style"" gay bar that's headed for downtown St. Paul sometime this year. Bar Zia co-owner Travis Phillips is behind the new place, a small spot that will have room for between 60 and 80, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal reported.

Michael,Sylvester,1359,http://uptownmessenger.com/2018/08/man-sought-after-committing-identity-theft-on-arabella-street-resident-he-lived-with/,"Isaac Michael Sylvester (via NOPD) Isaac Michael Sylvester, 34, is wanted on charges of identity theft, fraud and resisting arrest, according to initial NOPD reports. Sylvester is accused of “making numerous fraudulent charges to a credit card of the victim, with whom he was reportedly residing between April through July 2018 at the victim’s residence in the 600 block of Arabella Street.” Detectives tried to arrest Sylvester at the home, but he escaped from them and remains at large, the report states. Sylvester is believed to have used multiple names — including known aliases of Isaac Michael Macavoy, Isaac Macafferty and Isaac McLaughlin — and false Social Security numbers in his identity-theft crimes, the release states. He is described as a 5-foot-8, 160-pound white man with black hair and brown eyes who spends his time in the French Quarter and Uptown, the report states. Anyone who can help locate Sylvester is urged to call Sgt. Frank Denton with the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Economic Crimes Unit at 504-827-6011, or CrimeStoppers at 822-1111 to leave an anonymous tip that could be eligible for a cash reward.
