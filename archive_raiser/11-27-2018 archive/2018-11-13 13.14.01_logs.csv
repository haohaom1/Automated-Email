Andrew,Davis,1919,https://news.uga.edu/elizabeth-king/,"Elizabeth King, an assistant professor with a joint appointment in the Odum School of Ecology and Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, helps students appreciate the connectedness and complexity of human-environment interactions. Where did you earn degrees and what are your current responsibilities at UGA? I earned my bachelor’s degree in biology from Reed College in Oregon and my master’s degree and Ph.D. in population biology from the University of California, Davis. I teach general courses on ecology and on natural resource conservation in the university’s Odum School of Ecology and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, as well as restoration ecology and graduate courses to students in both schools and from all over campus. I conduct research in two main areas of sustainability science. One area focuses on challenges faced by livestock-herding societies in rural Africa. In many regions, these people are struggling to secure sustainable livelihoods in the face of drastic environmental and social pressures. My work combines ecology and social science to gain a more holistic view of livelihood vulnerability. I’m particularly interested in which households in a community are able to successfully adapt to changing conditions, and what kinds of assets, knowledge and social arrangements give them that ability. The other sustainable science area is restoration ecology here in Georgia. I study how—and why—we repair damaged and degraded ecosystems. Some of this work is on the beautiful barrier islands of Georgia’s coast, and other projects are focused on urban forests right here in Athens. For instance, I’ve had great fun getting involved with UGA’s Chew Crew, which uses goats to remove overgrown and invasive vegetation. When did you come to UGA and what brought you here? I came in 2012, after over five years as a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at Princeton University. My teaching and research there was the beginning of my journey into highly interdisciplinary research focused on sustainability challenges in African drylands. I was working with scholars in fields ranging from political science to ecology to engineering and hydrology. I didn’t know what I would do next, but I was amazingly fortunate to find a position at UGA that welcomed my passion for integrative, sustainability-focused research and teaching. In addition to stellar colleagues in Odum and Warnell, I also was attracted by UGA’s notable strengths in environmental anthropology as well as the newly founded Integrative Conservation (ICON) Ph.D. program, where I knew great collaborations would arise. Last but not least, I’m from the Southeast and really wanted to be back with family, friends and Southern sunshine. What are your favorite courses and why? Each class I’ve taught has been a rush, a challenge and ultimately a rewarding experience. I teach two large classes, and I love getting into the “it’s showtime” spirit of captivating the attention of a large auditorium and also stimulating genuine curiosity, which then makes learning so much easier. Because of the complexity of ecosystems and multiple human values regarding environmental issues, ecology and natural resources courses are many students’ first exposure to science where there is no single “right answer.” I love facilitating students to see and ask big, hard questions about the world, and to realize that they each have a unique opportunity to answer them. The course in restoration ecology that I designed and teach is great fun, because it is at the nexus of all the things I love about teaching and science. It attracts both graduate and undergraduate students—from Ecology, Warnell and beyond. There is rich scientific theory to learn, yet we also need to learn about the human contexts in which ecological restoration is undertaken, which are studied in social and behavioral sciences. History and aesthetics are interwoven into people’s motivations for ecological restoration, so we bring in artistic and humanities perspectives as well. We talk about everything from plant population models to theories of cooperation in society, because you need to appreciate all those things in order to plan and conduct ecosystem restoration. Each student’s horizons are thus broadened by a course’s interdisciplinary approach. Elizabeth King in UGA’s Whitehall Forest. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) What are some highlights of your career at UGA? The first large project I embarked upon at UGA has certainly been a highlight. I had recently met Laura German, associate professor in anthropology, and we saw a great opportunity to work together, investigating the ecological and social changes that were unfolding in a community of livestock herders in Kenya. We recruited a stellar Ph.D. student who took the project to new heights, as well as a terrific postdoc who probed deeply into the reasons why people’s lives were changing and the strategies they used to cope and adapt. The experience solidified for me the value of integrating different ways of looking at problems, despite how challenging it can be. The Sustainability Science Symposia that the Center for Integrative Conservation Research hosts have been some of the most rewarding events I’ve experienced at UGA. Seeing how many scholars are focused on sustainability, from incredibly diverse perspectives, makes it very exciting and inspirational to work at UGA. How do you describe the scope and impact of your research or scholarship to people outside of your field? My work helps reveal the ecological cause-and-effect relationships that explain different forms of ecological degradation, with the goal of finding key leverage points to intervene and promote restoration. My work also studies critical social dimensions—”upstream” drivers, and “downstream” consequences—of land degradation and restoration. By looking at the ecological problem in its social, economic and political context, we see the broader landscape of barriers and opportunities for restoration in a much more holistic light. Many efforts to restore ecosystems and re-establish sustainable human-environment relations often fail because of social factors that were not accounted for. By coupling ecological and social science research, we can better avoid those pitfalls. What do you hope students gain from their classroom experience with you? Whichever class I teach, I hope that students gain the ability to see the complex cause-and-effect relations that underlie the patterns and trends we see around us. I also hope that students learn to appreciate that everything happening in the world today is governed on some level BOTH by scientific principles and by human values and actions. The connections may be indirect, but they’re there, and they’re important to grasp in order to think about sustainability. By teaching in a way that shows my own enthusiasm and wonderment for learning about complex relationships, I hope that students are excited and empowered as they develop their abilities to discern those connections. Describe your ideal student. One of my favorite quotes is by John Muir: “When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.” I’m endlessly fascinated by the connectedness and complexity of ecosystems and human-environment interactions. So I particularly appreciate students who also get excited by the complexity we discover as we examine the world around us, and who like to look at problems from different, new perspectives. When students are open to different perspectives, they can learn so much more about any place, creature or situation, which makes teaching and mentorship exciting and fun. Favorite place to be/thing to do on campus is… A stroll or lunch in the Founders Memorial Garden. It’s serene, harmonious and always gracefully reflects the season. The phrase “Southern charm” comes to mind whenever I visit. What a treat to have such an oasis nestled into campus, to visit for a minute or an hour. I like to meet with students outdoors—sitting, walking or having coffee—if we’re catching up on life or thinking broadly about new ideas. And the Founders Garden is an ideal spot to calm the mind and get creative. Beyond the UGA campus, I like to… Travel! Seeing new landscapes and new cultures is my greatest pleasure. It’s rewarding in terms of seeing new beautiful things, but it’s also deeply rewarding as a learning experience. Seeing and learning how different the world is in different places is for me a profound source of inspiration, wisdom and humility. Whether it’s right around the corner in Georgia or on another continent, there’s always something new and different to appreciate. Travel is my most treasured source of learning. Elizabeth King talks with graduate student Hannah Morris about her live oak saplings in a greenhouse at Whitehall Forest. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) Community/civic involvement includes…. Since 2013, I’ve been working with the UGA Chew Crew, a project that uses goats to clear out overgrown invasive vegetation on two campus sites. I’ve helped coordinate the citizen science efforts to monitor the effects of the goats on vegetation. Interestingly, the most rewarding part of this has not been the ecological changes that goats bring about, but the human changes that they bring about. Volunteers love working around the goats. The goats make restoration fun, they stir up new feelings of environmental care and stewardship in the volunteers and get kids, college students and community members excited about playing an active role in improving their environment. Favorite book/movie (and why)? In a way, I hope to never have a single favorite book or movie! There are many at the top of the list, and in keeping with my academic tendencies, they are wildly diverse. But the most recent addition to the favorite book pile, which I read this summer and still get swept away thinking about the beauty of many of its ideas, was “Braiding Sweetgrass” by Robin Wall Kimmerer. The author is a botanist and a Native American. Her essays reveal fascinating complementarities between indigenous and scientific ways of knowing and how they have shaped her as a scientist, a mother, a teacher, a learner, a citizen and an environmental steward. She is a remarkable storyteller, and in her stories the plants are themselves the teachers. As we learn about them, we also learn about ourselves. The book was full of ideas I had never heard articulated before; it was lyrical, personal, scientific and inspirational. And then, totally different, I also love Carl Hiaasen novels, which are like kaleidoscopes of hilarious, edgy, completely absurd, “only in Florida” escapades. The one UGA experience I will always remember will be… A few months after arriving, I was a marshal during the spring Commencement ceremony in Sanford Stadium. That afternoon, I learned a lot about my new home and community, and kind of fell in love with UGA. First, on the walk over to the stadium, I saw some parents and grandparents tailgating graduation! They were cheering on the seniors in their robes as they passed by. I thought that was just awesome. Then, when I walked alongside the joyous, cheering graduating seniors onto the field, I got pretty choked up when I saw the thousands and thousands of family members and friends in the stands, beaming with pride, excitement and love. I think of that moment frequently, because it’s an important reminder that—even though I meet hundreds of students—each person’s experience at UGA is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime journey. It’s humbling to think about the role that I get to play in many of those journeys.",0.0,4.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,1020357,0.6207214756626831,0,2018-11-13 13:13:47,True,Priority Mail

Jane,Powers,1916,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jane-powers-garden-cuttings-g53f268vd,"Gardening Jane Powers A decade or two ago, the rice paper plant, Tetrapanax papyrifer, bounced into our gardens. And what a stunner it is, especially the jumbo ‘Rex’ cultivar, with its felted, palmate leaves, 60cm or more across on a mature specimen. It is evergreen, tropical-looking and just the thing for adding structure in a town plot. It’s tender, but give it the shelter of a south- or west-facing wall and it will survive in most areas — although probably not the midlands or other cold spots. The Taiwanese native is one of the many shrubby plants ending in “panax” that have surged into Irish gardens in recent years. Others include Kalopanax, Pseudopanax (several species), Oreopanax and Sinopanax.

Revenue at the Miami-based company’s five IBDs grew 5% year over year in the third quarter, to $300 million, while pretax income surged 120% to $18.5 million, Financial Planning reports. That growth stems from record client assets of $175.5 billion, higher interest rates and rising product sales, according to the publication. Noteworthy: The IBD revenue accounted for more than 85% of the company’s total of $348.9 million. Advisor headcount also surged, in a sign the company’s recruiting efforts over the past couple of years are paying off. The total is now 4,300, up 17% year over year, increasing compensation expenses by $3.9 million. The company’s third-quarter results were its first since the SEC charged former Chairman Phillip Frost with involvement in a pump-and-dump scheme, Financial Planning noted. But its earnings filing with the SEC didn’t disclose any new information about Frost, who remains Ladenburg Thalmann’s largest shareholder. --Ross Snel The numbers are looking good at Ladenburg Thalmann’s independent broker-dealers.

Michael,Gordon,1912,https://www.theledger.com/news/20181109/judge-sets-aside-co-defendants-plea-in-2015-haines-city-murder,"BARTOW — Devonere McCune is once again facing two counts of first-degree murder. On Friday, Circuit Judge Jalal Harb set aside McCune’s April 2017 plea to armed robbery, in which prosecutors had dropped the murder charges in exchange for a 25-year prison term and McCune’s testimony against his three co-defendants. But the plea deal began to unravel in September when McCune refused to give a sworn statement to prosecutors for an upcoming trial. He said if he was called to the witness stand in that trial, he would impose his right to remain silent. During Friday’s hearing, McCune said he wanted a better deal, and would testify if the state offered him something less than a 25-year sentence. Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme said that wasn’t going to happen. McCune, 26, is one of four defendants in a January 2015 crime rampage that began with the armed robbery of a pawn shop in Auburndale and ended with the fatal stabbings of two women in Haines City. McCune, of Haines City, was the first to be arrested when the car in which he was riding crashed outside the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City during a law enforcement pursuit. McCune ran from the crashed 1996 GMC Jimmy and was caught by a Polk County Sheriff’s deputy and his K-9, according to Sheriff’s Office reports. Three other defendants, Michael Gordon, Jovan Lamb and Terrell Williams, were taken into custody at different locations in the subdivision. Once in custody, McCune provided detectives with details about the armed robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale and the high-speed chase to Haines City, reports state. He said Gordon, armed with a long rifle, and Williams, with a handgun, repeatedly fired at law enforcement officers during the pursuit. In his statement to deputies, McCune specifically named Williams, Gordon and Lamb as the three men with him up to the point where he was captured, reports state. Deputies have identified Gordon, 38, of Lakeland, as the lone assailant who stormed into the home of Patricia Moran, 72, and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, and viciously stabbed them to death before stealing their car from the home’s garage. He’s scheduled to stand trial in January, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in his case. Under Florida law, if a murder is committed in conjunction with certain felonies, including armed robbery, or as part of a conspiracy to commit the felony, each of those involved in the felony is responsible for the killing. In this case, each of the defendants has been indicted on the same criminal charges, including first-degree murder. McCune now faces the same 10 criminal charges as the others, including two counts of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer. If convicted of any of those charges, he faces life imprisonment without parole. A Polk County jury convicted Williams, 33, of Haines City, last month on two counts of first-degree murder and several charges stemming from the rampage, including armed robbery, attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. He was sentenced to a mandatory life prison term without parole. Like the others, 33-year-old Lamb was indicted on charges including first-degree murder, armed robbery and attempted first-degree murder of a law enforcement officer. His trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 11. He faces mandatory life imprisonment if he’s convicted. No trial date has been set for McCune. On Friday, Harb scheduled a status conference for Dec. 6.

Jane,Powers,1911,https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/seattle-s-madison-park-has-a-small-town-feel-and-strong-real-estate-market-113755,"Madison Park, a charmingly chic Seattle, Washington, neighborhood, is an oasis that can make residents feel as though they are vacationing all year round. Its cachet dates to the early 1900s, when it was a popular summer getaway for Seattle residents. The neighborhood, which still attracts a fair number of seasonal summer residents, is defined by its quiet, relaxed ambience as well as its park, beach, traditional architecture and village of vintage-style shops that has delineated its main street for generations. Madison Park also is notable for maintaining a suburban-urban vibe: The city skyline isn’t visible through the trees, but civilization is only a short ride away. More: ‘Fifty Shades’ Seattle Penthouse Lists for $11.5M Boundaries The east-central neighborhood in Seattle is bounded on the east by Lake Washington, on the south where Lake Washington Boulevard East and 39th Avenue East meet, on the west by Lake Washington Boulevard East and the on the north by Union Bay. Price Range According to Jane Powers, president of Ewing & Clark Residential, prices for single-family homes start at $850,000, which could buy a 1920s cottage on a 4,000-square-foot lot. Such houses usually have a small basement but no views. The average price, $2.1 million, is for a three-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot lot, again without a view. Buyers who want a hillside site to see the scenery, including Mount Rainier and the other Cascade Mountains and Lake Washington, have to pay at least $2.5 million, which generally includes a four-bedroom house on a 6,000-square-foot lot, according to Ms. Powers. ""There’s not much under $1 million,"" said Moira Holley, co-founder/senior global real estate adviser for Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty. She said the most expensive properties, which are priced at $10 million to $20 million, are on the lake or in the Reed Estate, the neighborhood’s only gated community on the waterfront. ""There are only nine houses on the block in the Reed Estate, and it’s a very long block. More: Remodeled Contemporary Perched Above Seattle These are legacy properties with larger lots of an acre or more,"" Ms. Holley said. ""They are all different and mostly traditional in style."" Ms. Powers noted that the highest recorded sale price—$20 million—was set on two different properties. ""The most recent $20-million sale was in February of 2017,"" she said. ""That house was torn down, so the property would be priced much more now after completion of construction of the new house. The property was on 180 feet of no-bank Lake Washington waterfront."" Prices for condos, which are in extremely limited supply, range from $650,000 to $2.5 million, Ms. Powers noted. Housing Stock Regardless of the price range, most of the houses date from the 1920s and 1930s. The majority are wood frame, Ms. Powers said, with about 20% being made of brick. Most of the homes are single-family; condos and apartments are rare. The 85-acre gated community of Broadmoor, which features a 115-acre golf course, contains 300 homes, and the enclave of the Reed Estate has nine luxury homes. ""There’s a lot of traditional architecture, ranging from Georgian brick to timbered Tudors, in the neighborhood,"" Ms. Holley said. Ms. Powers and Ms. Holley said that because there’s no developable land available in Madison Park, teardowns have become much more frequent. ""Many of the old houses are being reimagined,"" Ms. Holley said. ""Generally, owners keep the traditional front façade and make the rear exterior more contemporary, sometimes adding more glass to take advantage of the view. If the house is of a more modest size, it’s likely to be torn down in favor of a larger footprint that takes maximum advantage of the lot to make a more luxurious stand.""

""It’s right on Lake Washington and three and a half miles from downtown,"" Ms. Powers said. ""The village mom-and-pop shops are quaint. Starbucks is the only national chain."" The community is in a beautiful setting that includes the Washington Park Arboretum, whose 230 acres feature a variety of plants, some of which cannot be seen anywhere else in the Pacific Northwest, and Madison Park Beach, which is suited for swimming and features lifeguards and a bathhouse. Ms. Powers noted that Lake Washington Boulevard is a landscaped link to most of the parks and greenbelts within the city’s limits. ""It was designed by the Olmsted Brothers,"" she said, adding that their father, Frederick Law Olmsted, designed New York City’s Central Park and that the plan was to place a park or a playground within a half mile of every house in Seattle. Luxury Amenities The Attic Alehouse, which started out as a bowling alley and shooting gallery in 1904 and has been a Madison Park institution since the early 1950s, is known not only for its food and drink but also for its game-day parties. Madison Park Hardware, a family-owned neighborhood mainstay since the 1940s, retains an old-time feel. The eatery Bing’s prides itself on recipes featuring local ingredients and craft cocktails; and Bert’s Red Apple Market has been supplying the community with groceries since 1937. There also are newer hot spots: Nishino, established in 1995, is known as the city’s finest sushi restaurant; Belle Epicurean, whose Seattle-native chef was trained at Le Cordon Bleu, specializes in Parisian pastries; Scoop Du Jour Ice Creamery is a sandwich and sweets spot; and Martha E. Harris florist and gifts has been supplying bouquets for momentous events for more than three decades. ""The café Madison Kitchen, which is about five years old, is top-drawer,"" Ms. Holley said. ""It has significantly raised the bar."" Residents also are proud of Pioneer Hall, a museum that’s more than a century old. A repository of state history, it’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places. More: R.E.M. Guitarist Peter Buck Lists Seattle Condo for $1.45M The public schools, which include Garfield High and McGilvra Elementary, have high ratings that draw families. They are supplemented by a variety of top-rated private schools. The Bush School, which has 630 students, is the only independent kindergarten through 12th-grade school in the city, and the Epiphany School, a non-parochial institution, serves pre-kindergarten through fifth-grade students. The eight-acre Seattle Tennis Club, established in 1890, has 19 tennis courts, a fitness center, squash courts, pickleball courts, dining and banquet rooms, a pool, beachfront access, a boathouse and pro shop. Since its founding, it has hosted the annual Washington State Open, the state’s most prestigious tennis tournament. ""It’s on the waterfront on the most prime piece of real estate in the neighborhood,"" Ms. Holley said. ""Aside from the village shops, it’s the social center of the community, and it’s so popular that there’s a seven- to nine-year waiting list for membership."" Who Lives There ""There’s a real mix of people in the neighborhood,"" Ms. Powers said. ""They are of all ages and represent various professions. There are families, single people, employees of Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks and attorneys and doctors."" Ms. Holley added that the community also is home to ""most of the in-city, old-money families."" Notable Residents Although Madison Park is not a celebrity-centric community, Howard Schultz, chairman emeritus of Starbucks, lives there; every once in a while, he reportedly pops into the neighborhood’s sole Starbucks for a cup of coffee. Actor Tom Skerritt, known for his roles in ""Top Gun"" and the long-running TV series ""Picket Fences,"" also calls Madison Park home. More: Oprah Buys $8 Million Investment Property in Washington State Outlook ""The market is doing well now,"" Ms. Powers said. ""And because of Madison Park’s proximity to the city and its park-like setting, I expect homes will continue to appreciate in value."" Ms. Holley agreed, adding that Madison Park properties have ""historically experienced a 10%- to 20% premium compared with those of other comparable in-city neighborhoods."" She added that ""the area has escalated in value exponentially over the years."" Two decades ago, she said, a 1980s waterfront home north of the Seattle Tennis Club, on a ""super-prime"" 1.28-acre waterfront lot was tax assessed at $2.593 million; it sold in June 2018 for ""an unsolicited offer"" of $12.5 million. Another waterfront property, an updated 1950s custom home just south of the tennis club, which is on 1.28 acres, was tax assessed at $2.334 million 20 years ago; it’s listed for $12.850 million. ""Madison Park is one of the safest places to park your money in real estate,"" she said. ""Markets will go up and down and level off, but when you’re talking about blue-chip real estate, this is it."" And since so few legacy properties ever come on the market, she expected new sales in that category in particular to ""rise rapidly from $15 million to $25 million-plus.""

Malcolm,Chace,1910,https://www.ctpost.com/sports/article/Jeff-Jacobs-A-well-deserved-honor-for-Yale-s-13379586.php,"By Jeff Jacobs Yale hockey coach Tim Taylor watches his team during practice at the Ingalls Rink in New Haven in 1998.

Caption Close Yale hockey coach Tim Taylor watches his team during practice at the Ingalls Rink in New Haven in 1998. Yale hockey coach Tim Taylor watches his team during practice at the Ingalls Rink in New Haven in 1998. NEW HAVEN — His portrait will hang in the Schley Room at Yale’s Ingalls Rink between Murray Murdoch and Malcolm Chace. Tim Taylor’s widow, Diana Cooke, said she’s especially pleased with the work of artist Kelly Clark. Taylor has brought two fingers to his mouth; he is deep in thought. He is watching his beloved Bulldogs play, yet he could be listening to a student in an Ivy League lecture hall. He could be studying a piece of art or a complex mathematical equation. If there were a name for the portrait, it would have to be “The Thinker Coach.” “Professorial,” Cooke said. “I don’t think I ever met anybody who was so obsessed with trying to make the sport of hockey better,” said legendary Boston University coach Jack Parker. “Not just for Yale or for him; better for everybody.” “High IQ, high hockey IQ,” said Ben Smith, who coached for both Taylor and Parker before becoming head coach at Dartmouth and Northeastern and leading the U.S. women in the Olympics. “He followed the old adage that players don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care. A brilliant man. A rare man.” And so they gathered in the Fellows Lounge of Yale’s Benjamin Franklin College early Friday night for the private unveiling of Taylor’s portrait. The public unveiling would come a few hours later, between periods of Yale’s game against Harvard. It was a night made possible by the Yale Hockey Association, by guys like Paul Farren and Jim MacDonald. Farren said he hopes for something of more substance next season for Taylor. “It’s a little overwhelming for me,” Cooke said. “When Tim left Yale, there wasn’t any celebration. I’m both excited there is one and a little regretful that he isn’t here.” The oldest college hockey program in America traces its roots to 1893 and played its first intercollege game on Feb. 1, 1896. Yale began playing Harvard on Feb. 26, 1900. They have met more than 250 times. Chace is sometimes called the father of American hockey. Murdoch was a longtime Ranger who coached Yale from 1938 to 1965. Taylor’s portrait hangs with history. He was a Harvard man before he became a Yale man. He was captain of the Crimson’s 1963 team and graduated with a degree in English. Taylor was the scion of a newspaper family that owned the Boston Globe. His father, John, was president of the paper, but Tim never had any interest in getting into the business. That didn’t stop him from being a gentleman to reporters who covered his teams. He won a lot of games — 337 — more than any coach in Yale history. He became an important part of USA Hockey. Although he declined an invitation to be on Herb Brooks’ coaching staff for the 1980 Olympics that ended with the Miracle on Ice, he was an assistant coach/assistant general manager in 1984 and head coach in 1994 at Lillehammer. Neither ended with a miracle on ice. The ending at Yale in 2006 was unpleasant, especially hurtful. There had been some difficult seasons. After 28 years and at age 64, Taylor was open to retirement after one more season. The Yale administration wanted an immediate retirement. He resigned. “It was sad, it never should have ended that way for him,” Parker said. “They were thinking with their pocketbooks instead of their hearts.” When he retired as the longtime athletic director in June, Tom Beckett still carried some of those scars. He grew emotional talking about Taylor. “I have great respect for Coach Taylor,” Beckett said. “He did marvelous things for hockey in America. The university felt it was time for a change. We hired one of his former students. Keith Allain and Tim had a tremendous relationship. I wish I could have been able to continue mine with one of Yale’s legendary coaches. It didn’t happen. I’m saddened by it.” Taylor’s children were here. A number of great college coaches were here. Mike Richter, the Rangers goalie great, who got a Yale degree after he retired and helped Taylor with his goalkeepers, was here. So were a bevy of people who love Yale hockey. Asked if she could sense the healing, Cooke answered: “I think so. I’m trying to gauge that. I worked at Yale as well. When Tim got sick, I retired. I worked for over 30 years and had a very involved relationship with the athletic department with the undergraduate admission office. “When Tim went through the end phase of his career I tried to maintain an objectivity. I had a relationship with Tom and continued to as well. I’m regretful they didn’t have a chance to really mend fences. I know it wasn’t all Tom’s choice.” When Allain, who was a goalie for Taylor, led Yale to its great victory over Quinnipiac for its first national title in 2013, Allain and assistants Red Gendron and Dan Muse brought the NCCA championship trophy to Taylor at Connecticut Hospice in Branford. Taylor would die of cancer two weeks later. “I was very meaningful to him,” Cooke said. “Tim had watched part of that game. He slept on and off for the first two periods. The nurses and I got him awake and he watched them win. I remember asking him, ‘Who are you rooting for?’ He started laughing. He said. ‘Yale, of course.’ ” Yale, of course. “He was 100 percent devoted to hockey and Yale,” Cooke said. “A teacher.” Smith and Parker knew the teacher for a half-century. “The first time I got on the ice with him, we were playing in an old rink in Lynn, Mass., the summer of 1960,” Smith said. “I got to coach with Tim for five years here and then with Jack for 10. I feel like I’m one of the luckiest coaches of the last half century.” “I met Tim when we played in the Mayflower League in Brighton,” Parker said. “We played for the same (program), he was with the older guys. Every once in a while, I’d get called up from the younger guys. The first game I played with him he was coaching me. He grabbed me afterward and showed me how to do a better job on face-offs.” Parker and Taylor would become close friends. One a Boston Brahmin, the other hardscrabble. “Timmy and I couldn’t be any more opposite,” Parker said. When they were freshman coaches they would go on recruiting trips and discuss hockey systems for hours. Taylor beat No. 1 BU in an epic game in 1978, and even that couldn’t ruin their friendship. “He is the perfect example of a guy who loved coaching for all the right reasons,” Parker said. In 2013, three months before he died, Taylor served as a member of the Team USA staff for the World Junior Championships in Ufa, Russia. “He was a big cog in us winning,” Smith said. “He could barely walk. He could barely feed himself. But his passion for hockey bubbled over. He got on the plane with those kids. He dedicated himself to them.” jeff.jacobs@hearstmediact.com; @jeffjacobs123",0.0,3.0,0.17647058823529413,0.0,1022755,0.8031912132659844,0,2018-11-13 13:13:47,True,Priority Mail

Karen,Cummings,1904,http://www.osoyoostimes.com/textile-artists-piece-inspired-by-anonymous-handwritten-poem-about-death-of-son-in-war/,"Artist Karen Cummings shows her textile art piece on the theme of war and remembrance that’s on display at the Okanagan Art Gallery in Osoyoos. Cummings said it was inspired by a poem she found written by hand in the back of a library book, apparently by a mother who lost her son in Vietnam. It contained the line, “The more I cried, the less I spoke.” (Richard McGuire photo) A poem handwritten into the back of a library book inspired a local textile artist to create a work commemorating those who have died in war. Karen Cummings, who lives in Hedley, but is a member of the Okanagan Art Gallery in Osoyoos, created the large work that is now on display at the gallery. It incorporates a military uniform as well as other pieces of fabric to tell a story of war and remembrance. “I was thumbing through a public library book,” said Cummings. “I found handwritten on the back cover in ink a poem by a woman who describes her son going off to the Vietnam War and he doesn’t return. And the line in the poem said, ‘the more I cried, the less I spoke.’” It was a poetry book that she found at a library in Cambridge, Ontario, where she lived prior to moving to Hedley a year ago. The war poem obviously wasn’t part of the original book. Cummings said she began wondering about who the woman was who wrote the poem and what would inspire someone to write it in the back of a library book. Had the poem been shared elsewhere? She asked at the library, but they had no answers. “It just created a whole bunch of intrigue for me,” said Cummings. “As an artist, when you start to think about something, it expands in your world.” Cummings, who has been doing textile art for about 10 years, visited an army surplus store to look at the uniforms and ask questions about the fabrics used. The one she chose was not American and not from the Vietnam War period. Rather, it was dated 1956 and was a Canadian uniform. She intended it to be a more general comment, inspired by the anonymous poem, but universal. It was a fine garment with pockets and hidden buttons, all beautifully done. “It struck me and it was so incredible that so much care is given into creating a uniform that is meant to last a lifetime,” said Cummings. “And yet we give it to a soldier who is in a precarious situation that could last a very short period of time. It was just so interesting to think about that.” Cummings also incorporated an army shirt into her work and other material represents the crosses of graves. There’s a green, wooly material representing the grass. Cummings believes that fabric creates a visceral response since we’ve been connected to fabrics since birth. “You only have to see a piece of material and it brings back a memory,” she said. Cummings said she uses fabric to conjure up images and feelings. “I’m not a literal artist,” she said. “I don’t actually do scenery or landscapes.” Sometimes her work takes her in unexpected directions as it progresses. While this piece is large, her other pieces at the gallery are mostly smaller. “I’m new to British Columbia and new to this gallery,” Cummings said. “I’ve done lots of smaller pieces to introduce people to textile art. A lot of people don’t know what textile art is. It might be a really big jump for them to buy a bigger piece, so a smaller piece introduces people to the whole medium of textile work.” Unlike her smaller pieces that people have bought for their homes, this one is unlikely to be bought for someone’s living room, she admits. “This piece needs to go to some public venue, I would think,” she said. “Be it a library, a hospital or a school or something like that would probably be ideal. A museum or something.” The Okanagan Art Gallery is located at 8302 Main Street in Osoyoos.

Andrew,Davis,1903,http://kbnd.com/kbnd-news/local-news-feed/389297,"ON AIR NOW Rush Limbaugh 9:00am - 12:00pm Listen Live Posted: 2018-11-07 07:16:00 by Danise Lee BEND, OR -- Sally Russell (pictured) is Bend's first Mayor to be chosen by voters in nearly a century, and the first woman ever elected to the post. She has served on City Council since 2012, and is currently Mayor Pro Tem. Russell received just over 50% of the vote. The next runner up, fellow Councilor Bill Moseley, received about 41%. Shortly after the race was called, Mayor-Elect Russell told KBND News, ""I'm going to be Bend's first elected Mayor since 1928! That's a pretty cool thing! I'm ecstatic and I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm really, really looking forward to working with this community and bringing us forward into these next four years."" She added, ""I want to thank people who believed in me and what I could bring to this town and contribute as a leader going forward. I feel really grateful and very fortunate. And, I'm looking forward to just working with everyone."" Russell credits her win on a campaign focused on collaboration and inclusion, ""Building bridges, bringing people together, making sure that we engage everyone, whether or not they voted for me. It's really about recognizing that we all have different values and we've all got to find a middle ground and really make good decisions for all of us."" She says her biggest accomplishments as a Councilor are the creation of a citywide shuttle during peak tourism season, passage of over a dozen affordable housing initiatives and her work on a single-use plastic bag policy, which is expected to pass later this year. Joining Russell on Council will be Gena Goodman-Campbell, who easily beat Andrew Davis and Victor Johnson to win Position Five. She received 64% of the vote, ""I am just incredibly honored and humbled."" She tells KBND News, ""It's really exciting and I think part of it is my hard work from 2016 when I ran for State Representative paying off, and the hard work of everyone who has helped out on both of my campaigns."" Goodman campbell says the first thing she wants to do is listen and create ways for every resident to be more engaged with the city. Incumbent Barb Campbell won a second term on Council, with 49% of the vote. She defeated Sarah McCormick, who received 43%, and Ron Boozell, who spent Election Night in jail, although still received about 8% of the vote.

Sara,Burns,1902,https://www.citynews1130.com/2018/11/07/judge-to-appoint-new-lawyer-for-man-accused-in-fredericton-shooting-spree/,"by Kevin Bissett, The Canadian Press Posted Nov 7, 2018 12:00 pm PST Last Updated Nov 7, 2018 at 1:00 pm PST FREDERICTON – A Fredericton man accused of murdering two police officers and two civilians in an August shooting spree is getting his wish for a new lawyer. Matthew Raymond says he feels he has not been defended by his counsel, and tried numerous times to fire him. Provincial court Judge Julian Dickson said Wednesday that he agrees Raymond should have a new lawyer, and one will be appointed when the case returns to court next Wednesday. During a previous court appearance, Raymond told the court that his lawyer, Nathan Gorham, was withholding evidence that would allow him to be “exonerated” immediately because of temporary insanity. “Mr. Raymond’s obviously mistaken belief that Mr. Gorham could present evidence to exonerate him at this stage of proceeding suggests that possibly he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings. Mr. Raymond’s statements also suggest to me that he is not able to communicate meaningfully with counsel or to understand the role of counsel,” Dickson said. “He believes that Mr. Gorham could have exonerated him some two-and-a-half months after he was arrested and charged with killing four people including two civilians and two police officers. With all due respect, this does reflect a distorted understanding of counsel’s abilities and does call into question Mr. Raymond’s capacity to understand the role of counsel and communicate with counsel.” The Crown has already said it will request a 60-day psychiatric exam, but first the issue of defence lawyer must be settled. Raymond is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, and civilians Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. The four were gunned down Aug. 10 outside an apartment complex in the city. Outside court Wednesday, Gorham said he had little choice but to ask the judge to replace him. “Two weeks ago, Mr. Raymond discharged me and the reasons for discharging me make me believe that he was mentally unfit by reason of a mental illness, and so I felt that the only option that I could do ethically and in my duties to the court was to bring an application asking the judge to appoint counsel who could not be discharged,” he said. “Today the judge accepted there were reasonable grounds to make that appointment.” An official with legal aid said he would present the judge with the name of a lawyer for his consideration within the next few days. The case returns to court on Nov. 14, to appoint the new lawyer. We've sent an email with instructions to create a new password. Your existing password has not been changed.

Only on Foxtel. SIGN UP TODAY! Seibold talks coach swap A calf injury late in the year took what would’ve been a difficult decision out of his hands, with all agreeing it was best not to take any chances rushing him back despite the team being finals bound. “At the end of the day footy is only a small part of life and other things such as my family are more important,” Gillett said in August. “Making sure I take the extra time sits fine with me, and I will just continue with my recovery and look forward to being back on the field in 2019.” While the rise of Tevita Pangai Junior and David Fifita is exciting for the club, Gillett is one of the class players of the competition, having taken out the Dally M Second Rower of the Year the previous two seasons. So, the club’s declaration to foxsports.com.au that the 30-year-old will be raring to go ahead of the season opener on March 14, is sure to be a welcome one for the fans. The other big news on the injury front in clubland, is Josh Reynolds’ return for the Tigers. The Origin series-winning five-eighth was plagued by a right scapula injury throughout the season, only able to run out five times in his first year with Wests.
