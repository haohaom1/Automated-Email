Bob,Diamond,1896,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/martin-taylor-financial-policy-committee-interview-bank-of-england-financial-crisis-barclays-a8620746.html,"Log in using your social network account Log in directly with The Independent Try Independent Minds free for 14 days Hi {{fullName}} The Bank of England regulator talks about Bob Diamond, Sir John Vickers and reform of the financial system with Ben Chu in his first national media interview as a member of the Financial Policy Committee Martin Taylor presses his fingertips together, leans back in his chair and stares into the distance in contemplation. I’ve just suggested to him that if he’d fired Bob Diamond two decades ago the whole history of the global financial crisis might have been different. After a microsecond of thought, Taylor breaks into a smile. “I like to think the financial system didn’t hang on a binary choice of mine in 1998 – that would really be solipsism in the highest degree!” he chuckles. Fair enough. But the Apprentice-style fire-or-not-fire decision scenario was real enough. Taylor himself described it in an article for the Financial Times a few years ago. Taylor was the chief executive of the Quaker-founded British bank Barclays. And Bob Diamond’s investment banking division had blown up due to an unexpected sovereign default in Russia, forcing the group to register a large loss. What made it worse was that tight trading limits for Russian debt set by the bank’s board had been deliberately bypassed by Diamond’s traders. The ambitious American banker, humbled, was offering his resignation. Taylor turned it down believing that Diamond was too important to lose. Diamond, of course, went on to drive Barclays into the very heart of the global credit storm that unleashed disaster on the world and the UK economy in 2008. And he became one of the public villains of the crisis thanks to his spectacularly ill-judged suggestion before the Treasury Select Committee in 2011 that the “period of remorse” from bankers “needs to be over”. “Looking back on it I think I made the wrong call,” Taylor tells me, sitting in his rather spartan office on the upper floors of the Bank of England’s City of London headquarters. “But it was more about Barclays than the financial world as a whole.” Tieless, glasses nestling in his blazer pocket, wearing comfortable slacks, 66-year-old Taylor resembles a country solicitor more than a former City titan or the influential regulator he is now, as an external member of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The only hint of financial services about him is a faint pinstripe on that dark blue blazer. I’d wanted to interview Taylor for some time, and not only for his juicy insider knowledge on Barclays. He’s also been at the heart of some of the major post-financial crisis reforms and institutions. He served on the Independent Commission on Banking (better known as the Vickers Commission, after its chair, Sir John Vickers) which was set up by George Osborne to decide whether or not to split up investment and retail banking in the wake of the crash. And since 2013 he has been a member of the FPC, which is charged with sniffing out financial crises, like a Bloodhound, before they happen and orders the inflation of banks’ capital buffers when they seem to be getting too relaxed about risk. Taylor’s time with the commission is drawing to an end. He has informed the Treasury he will step down no later than June 2019. So it seems a reasonable time for him to reflect a little in public, not just on his time on the FPC but on the decade since the crisis. The first question is, how much has really changed in our financial system over the last 10 years? Taylor’s answer is unequivocal, trenchant even. “I don’t know whether to laugh or be irritated by it but one of the things I’ve found about a lot of the writing about the tenth anniversary of the crisis is that lots of them basically said ‘nothing’s changed’. But actually almost everything has changed,” he says. “The industry has changed profoundly. The relationship of regulatory supervisors to industry has changed profoundly. The incentives have changed. The rules on pay have changed. The rules about liquidity in banking have changed. I think there’s been an extraordinary policy response. And I think there’s been some cultural change. Those who wrote it’s all the same, I don’t know where they’re looking. They don’t see the world that I see.” I decide this is not a good time to divulge that I myself recently wrote an essay lamenting the timidity of the reform effort. We move on. Lots of banks have been fined huge sums by regulators over various scandals, from interest rate rigging to insurance mis-selling. Plenty of bosses have departed under a black cloud. But virtually none of the top bankers during the crisis whose institutions foundered and incubated gross misconduct – not even Fred Goodwin of the Royal Bank of Scotland – have been struck off from the Financial Conduct Authority’s “approved persons” list. Inclusion on it is needed to work in the industry. Doesn’t that, I suggest, represent a gross failure of nerve by regulators, a blow to genuine accountability? Taylor’s not having it. “I think on the whole that the people at the top of institutions that went wrong in the financial crisis, they lost their jobs, they lost a lot of money, they lost their reputations. I think the idea that they didn’t suffer is a strange one. Imagine what it’s like to be in their shoes – it’s not great actually,” he says. “I don’t think having the FCA write something on your tombstone is necessarily the be all and end all.” A new book on Barclays’ roller coaster history by the writer Philip Augar relates that when Taylor was in charge he wanted to split off the troublesome investment banking division. Indeed, he resigned after failing to win the support of the board for his radical restructuring plans. The Vickers Commission was asked to look into that very question, not just for Barclays but the entire UK banking sector. Yet Vickers stopped short of recommending a clean break and proposed a somewhat complicated “ringfence” of banks’ retail arms instead. Why didn’t Vickers go the whole hog? Wasn’t this a missed opportunity, especially from Taylor’s perspective? “I’ve done lots of work for government. If you’re on one of those committees, the ideal space to get to is somewhere where there’s an overhang on a Venn diagram and where what you think is a proper solution is something that government and parliament is going to accept,” explains Taylor. So did he think that a full split proposal might not be welcomed by the government and risked being rejected? “I was certainly conscious of it,” he says. “Finding a resolution to something does just mean recommending something. Recommending an ideal solution which government then does not enact is useless. Equally, finding an inadequate solution the government enacts is useless too.” But he’s adamant that ringfencing, finally due to come in next year, is an acceptable solution to the problem of banks funding their casino trading habits with ordinary depositors’ savings. “I remember when we reported it in September 2011 and said we wanted these things to be done by the beginning of 2019, a lot of people laughed and said, ‘This is for the long grass and it’s never going to happen’. And you know what? It’s three months away and it’s happened,” he says. Born 8 June 1952 in Burnley, Lancashire 1965-1969: Eton College 1970-1974: Balliol College Oxford, reading Oriental Studies (Chinese) 1974-1982: Reuters and Financial Times 1982-1993: Courtaulds (textiles company) 1994‐1998: Barclays chief executive 2000‐present: non‐executive director of RTL Group 2010‐11: member of Independent Commission on Banking 2013-present: external member of Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee 2015-present: director at CiBO Technologies Yet, on the subject of Vickers, there’s been an unusually public disagreement between the Bank of England and Sir John on the question of banks’ capital requirements. The FPC has mandated UK banks to have a capital buffer [shareholders’ equity to absorb potential losses] of at least 4 per cent of total assets. But Sir John, essentially, thinks that’s too low – and a floor beneath what the Vickers Committee itself proposed. What does Taylor think of the concerns of his old chair? “John has been vocal about the systemic risk buffer. I’m comfortable that where we’ve got to, we’ve got a system with about as much equity as Vickers proposed, and arrived at in a slightly different way, and with an awful lot more debt that is convertible into equity,” he says. “Would I prefer in an ideal world for some of that debt to be equity? Yes I would. But I think we’re in the right place.” I point out that even Mervyn King, who was the Bank’s Governor when Taylor joined the FPC in 2013, is now saying that banks should have substantially more capital than the regulatory minimum. “Mervyn’s a friend and I’ve known him a very long time. He was Governor of the Bank for 10 years and deputy governor for five and chief economist before that and he didn’t actually do it in those 20 years,” says Taylor, slightly mischievously. “If you’re a macroprudential regulator your default setting is to fall asleep worrying about the banking system and to think a little bit more capital would be nice. And the next time you think maybe a little more. We don’t want more capital to make supervisors sleep better – we want more capital to have the appropriate amount of resilience in the system.” Often central bankers and regulators are surprisingly gregarious in person but automatons when they write anything down. With Taylor it’s almost the other way around. As an interviewee he’s rather hesitant, diffident even. Our talk is punctuated by long pauses for thought. At a couple of points he asks, almost plaintively, “Don’t you think?” Rather disappointingly, he refuses to talk at any length about Barclays, where activist investor Edward Bramson is now pressing the bank to get out of investment banking, just as he urged all those years ago. Yet a supremely self-confident intelligence shines out of Taylor’s speeches for the FPC, which are crowded with erudite and witty historical references to imperial China and the French revolution. Their substance is usually the magisterial brushing aside of the latest anti-regulation fallacy propagated by the financial lobby. And there have been some Exocet newspaper articles. Along with the one that lifted the lid on the history of Bob Diamond at Barclays was a particularly memorable broadside in 2009 which castigated his former banking colleagues for paying massive bonuses to staff out of illusory paper profits during the bubble. His mordant conclusion: “The system was brought down not because risk management was deficient (though it was), nor because greed was rampant (though it was), but because bankers could not count.” Perhaps that unusual self-confidence with the pen reflects his origins in journalism, and his editing of the Lex investment column for the Financial Times in the early 1980s. Before I leave, I suggest to Taylor that it’s inconceivable that anyone today could progress from journalism to senior banker to regulator in the way that he did. “It was inconceivable then!” he laughs. “I had a very strange career. But I think people ought to change sector. One of the problems I found towards the end of my business career was I was dealing with people who knew everything about a rather narrow area. You want people like that – [but] you don’t want everyone to be like that. Because otherwise it’s quite hard to see where connections are made.” You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.

Bob,Diamond,1896,https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/chinese-oil-tycoon-buys-a-bunch-of-pricey-nyc-property-and-then-disappears/,"Ye Jianming is a 41-year-old Chinese oil tycoon who went on a spending spree, picking up some of the spendiest real estate in New York City. He spent $83 million and had plans to buy $80 million more but he disappeared in early 2018. Ye had ties to the intelligence unit of the People's Liberation Army according to sources close to him. The properties he bought or expressed interest in included a penthouse he purchased from a top Wall Street banker, and a townhouse that formerly belonged to a billionaire friend of Donald Trump. In May 2017, Ye spent $50.55 million to buy former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond's penthouse at 15 Central Park West. The 5,278 square foot apartment has four bedrooms, a library, and an eat in kitchen. In June 2017, he dropped nearly $33 million on a 4,028 square foot apartment on the 86th floor at 432 Park Avenue. The unit was then put up for rent for $80,000 a month. ANGELA WEISS/AFP/Getty Images Ye paid cash for both of these properties. Last December, Ye entered into a contract to buy an $80 million townhouse owned by the NHL's Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola at 12 East 69thStreet. Viola was briefly the nominee for Secretary of the Army. The 20,000 square foot townhouse has its own movie theater. The deal would have set the record for the most expensive townhouse ever sold in New York City at the time, but the deal fell apart in early 2018 at about the same time as Ye went missing. Ye is not the first high profile, wealthy, Chinese person to go missing. Actress Fan Bingbing has been missing since last summer. Casino tycoon Yang Zhuhui went missing in August. Zhou Chengjian, a Chinese billionaire with a net worth of $1.4 billion, went missing on January 6, 2016. Club Med owner Guo Guangchang went missing on December 10, 2015. Ye is reportedly under investigation in China. Ye is the chairman of Shanghai based CEFC China Energy, which has been expanding abroad aggressively in the past several years. It acquired $9 billion worth of shares in Russia's Rosneft energy giant, more than $1 billion in investments in energy companies in the Czech Republic, and more deals in Abu Dhabi, Romania, and Singapore. Ye's company has also purchased pricey real estate in Shanghai. With Ye's whereabouts unknown, his empire is under threat. CEFC has been selling off assets and canceling deals. In November 2017, a former Hong Kong official named Patrick Ho, who was one of Ye's top contacts in the Chinese government was indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on allegations of bribing African leaders through a charity that was funded by Ye's CEFC. Ye wasn't named in the indictment. Ho is challenging the charges against him. On news of his disappearance, shares in companies tied to CEFC China Energy plunged on the Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shenzhen stock exchanges and wiped out $630 million in market value in one hour. © 2018 Celebrity Net Worth / All Rights Reserved",0.0,5.0,0.4166666666666667,0.0,1015016,0.6338125555783158,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Bernard,Osher,1895,https://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/garchik/article/Admiring-Bergman-Swedish-film-master-and-13368811.php,"In this centenary of Ingmar Bergman, the great Swedish director’s admirers — both professional and personal — have been traveling the world, bringing him to life by telling tales etched in their memories. He wasn’t exactly an easygoing man, said Katinka Faragó, who has been described as his “right hand.” Faragó has been in the Bay Area since late last week, speaking and being interviewed at Bergman-centric events hosted by the California Film Institute, the Berkeley Art Museum/Pacific Film Archive and San Francisco State. She worked with the filmmaker for more than 30 years, beginning in a menial role while she was a teenager and serving eventually as script supervisor, production manager and producer. The first event on her busy Bay Area agenda was dinner on Friday, Nov. 2, at the home of Honorable Consul General of Sweden Barbro Osher and Bernard Osher. Place cards indicated we were dinner partners, and as we sat down and said hello, I asked how she had met Bergman. “Is this an interview?” she asked. From the tone, it sounded as though she wasn’t exactly ready for that, so I closed the cover of my notebook, which was in my lap. But after what seemed like a rebuff, she described going to meet him, and the advice she’d been given by other staffers who’d known him well. “If he stares at you, you stare back. If he spits at you, you spit back.” I opened my notebook and started scribbling, as the conversation lurched forward. In 1960, five years after she came to work with Bergman, she recalled, James Baldwin went to Sweden to interview Bergman for Esquire magazine. “He had a cold,” she said. “Bergman said, ‘I am not going to see him.’” (Almost 60 years later, she said, she still feels uneasy — worried about her boss’ disapproval — when she has to cough.) So Bergman “didn’t do the interview the day they had said. Absolutely not.” Instead, he asked Faragó to take Baldwin to a projection room in the studio and show him the 1913 silent movie “Ingeborg Holm,” and to translate into English its titles, which were, of course, in Swedish. The movie, a tragic tale about the misery of a poor family, was so moving, she said, that she started to cry. Overcome with emotion, she was unable to translate, she said. “I am sorry,” said Baldwin, “could you please tell me what’s going on?” The Baldwin profile that came out of their initial conversation was forwarded to me by Amanda Doxtater, a Scandinavian scholar at the University of Washington, who was at the dinner, too. Baldwin paints a vivid picture of Bergman. When the writer and subject meet, Bergman is solicitous about Baldwin’s flu, and then gets right to the point: “Well, are you for me or against me?” The writer also quoted an unnamed woman he describes as having worked with the filmmaker for several years. “He’s improved,” she says of Bergman, “but he was impossible. He could say the most terrible things, he could make you wish you were dead. Especially if you were a woman.” In conversation, Faragó described watching Bergman and the director Andrei Tarkovsky (for whom she worked later in her career), walking past each other at the Filmstaden, where they were both working. Bergman had expressed an eagerness to meet Tarkovsky, who had moved to Sweden from his native Russia. But walking by each other, neither so much as acknowledged each other’s presence. It was a lavish dinner on an enclosed patio high up in an apartment near downtown. All around us was the glimmer of lighted windows, and a bit farther away, silhouettes flickering around the Jim Campbell sculpture atop the Salesforce Tower. Near its end, Faragó clinked on a glass to call the guests to attention. “I am just trying to prove that I am not mute,” she said, “by saying thank you. I’ve been so well taken care of.” And then, it was that time when the guests stand up, collect themselves and prepare to go home and put on their pajamas. “You must be jet-lagged,” I said to the guest of honor, who’d arrived from Europe the day before. Definitely not, she said.

Posted: Wednesday, November 7, 2018 9:00 am | Updated: 9:05 am, Wed Nov 7, 2018. LBG returns to Bryan Park 0 comments The Laidback Golf Tour returned to the Rees Jones designed layout at Bryan Park Players Course today to compete in their final Major of the season. Last year their outing here was marred by cold misty rain and 40 degree temperatures. On Tuesday, Oct. 30, the weather was much better with sunshine and near 70 degree temperature. However, the scores were nearly the same. Last season the course gave up only one round in the 70’s and 16 birdies to the field of 23; while this time the yield was two rounds in the 70s with 13 birdies and one eagle. The course which has hosted the U.S. Amateur in the past is quite a challenge especially the high fluffy rough which devours stray shots. It’s beauty, condition, and hospitable staff make it the perfect venue for a Major event. Fran Hensley continued her solid play as she captured her fifth win of the season and second in a row with a birdie free round of 78. Mike Reynolds who lost to Hensley in their last outing in a play-off trailed by three strokes with two holes to go today. Reynolds beat Hensley by a stroke on each of the last two holes to pull within one at 79 for second place. It was Hensley’s second of the five wins coming without having to go to a play-off to determine the winner. A brand new member Tony Santoro claimed the A Flights third place prize with his round of 80. Tom Simmons who lost in a play-off here last season came out on top of the B Flight today with his 87 finish. It was Simmons second win of the season. Last season’s winner Jim White came up a stroke short today as he tied for second place with David Wilson at 88. White claimed the prize money by a match of back nine totals. Mike Pritchett, playing in only his second tournament of the season led the C Flight with his score of 88. It was Pritchett’s first win as he finished third in his previous outing. The Tours current points leader Randy McCann finished second with a 91. Glenn Hudson walked away from the field today in the D Flight as he picked up his second win of the season with a solid round of 89. Hudson had missed the last eight tournaments due to back and leg pain and shot 108 in his last outing. His solid play and wise decision making came back for him today as he avoided the usual high number holes. Curtis Smith finished second for the fifth time this season with his 98 finish. The Tour will next play at Danville Golf Club Monday Nov. 12 in their last event of the season in which they earn points toward season championship. The tournament will shotgun start at 10am. Entry fee for Tour members is $65 with registration request by Nov. 5 or no later than noon Saturday Nov. 10.

Michael,Gordon,1893,https://www.princegeorgecitizen.com/man-who-stole-money-from-b-c-parents-of-bantam-age-hockey-players-sentenced-1.23488093,"November 5, 2018 05:48 PM KELOWNA, B.C. — A man who stole money from a hockey association and the parents of bantam-age hockey players has been sentenced to one year in jail, but was set free the day of his sentencing because he'd already served the time. Loren Reagan and his former business partner Michael Gordon Elphicke created the Okanagan Elite Hockey Association in Penticton, B.C., in 2010 with the intent of sending hockey players and their parents on a tour of Europe. The court heard Monday that families paid $5,500 per traveller for the European tour, minus the amounts they raised by selling raffle tickets for meat draws, which were operated without the required gaming licence. Court heard the hockey association collected $130,000 in trip deposits and raffle proceeds between July 2011 and January 2012, but only $15,000 of that money went toward the European hockey tour. Reagan's three-week trial was scheduled to begin Monday morning in Kelowna, but instead the Crown and defence presented a joint submission and Reagan pleaded guilty to theft over $5,000. The Crown and defence proposed a jail sentence of time served, followed by two years' probation and a standalone restitution order of $80,000 to the 16 families that fell victim to his theft. Reagan has spent eight months and eight days in jail, totalling 12 months and 12 days with enhanced credit. He was arrested in Calgary in March after failing to show up for trial in 2017. British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Mark McEwan accepted the joint submission, but expressed frustration at the jail sentence. ""I am not happy with the length of this term,"" he said. ""This seems to be very slight for what he's done."" Reagan and Elphicke were accused of fraud over $5,000, theft over $5,000 and unauthorized management of a lottery scheme. Elphicke was sentenced earlier this year to two years' house arrest followed by three years' probation and was ordered to pay $117,000 in restitution to the 16 families. The charges of fraud and unauthorized management of a lottery scheme against Reagan were stayed by the Crown following sentencing. Reagan is not required to report to a probation officer, and he is not permitted to work or volunteer in any capacity that involves fundraising during his probation. He addressed the court Monday, expressing his remorse. ""I'd like to apologize for the circumstances,"" Reagan said. ""It was poor management on my part and I regret that dearly."" The intent to put on the European trip was genuine, defence counsel Kim Russell said in court. ""This was not a scheme that was devised from the outset to bilk the complainants of their money,"" he said. The reason the trip never happened was because Reagan and Elphicke were not good businessmen, said Russell. Reagan was also involved in a plan to build a dormitory for hockey academy students in Penticton. ""That's where a large part of the theft arises, is the use of funds from the (hockey association) towards the dorm project for permits and various expenses related to that,"" said Russell. ""And that was unbeknownst to the parents."" The dorm project consumed $40,000 of the money paid and raised by parents, while $20,000 was used by Elphicke for personal use, and $30,000 to $40,000 for Reagan's personal use. › or view results Your City Matters - City of Prince George November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 8, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 November 7, 2018 Find out what's happening in your community and submit your own local events.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Clearly, it was much more, but to the uninitiated, it was a head-scratching buy. And while big money is busy being exchanged at the actual Art Basel Miami Beach exhibition inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, that doesn't mean this whole Basel-dazzle is reserved solely for the 1%. In fact, Riviera South Beach reports, it is one of the best times for bargain hunters to find not only affordable artwork by someone who may, indeed, become the next Basquiat, but for free events and priceless people watching. The real underground, hipster action takes place where the energy is more electric than the expense account flush, at boutique hotels where burgeoning street artists, sculpturists, performance artists and those who fancy themselves as an amalgam of all of them convene to cocktail, network and show off their talents. Among those hotels is the Riviera South Beach, a contemporary, multi-building, chic stay with modern, colorful rooms - some with truly over the top, must-see decor, rooftop and courtyard pools, Insta-worthy art walls, and buzzy cocktail and Cuban cuisine canteen, Mas Cuba, an oft-Instagrammed artsy outpost of funky, re-purposed art and fab fare. Nearby is the Catalina Hotel, a high energy South Beach landmark with a distinctly retro-mod vibe - think Austin Powers meets South Beach, with two pools, two restaurants, three bars, and ultra-modern rooms. The adjacent Maxine's Bistro & Bar is open 24-hours serving farm fresh food, potent cocktails, and a perfect perch from which to people-watch. Some may consider the Tradewinds, an off the beaten path apartment hotel with full kitchen and stunning, sunny courtyard pool. An ideal address for Art Basel, Tradewinds is uber close to the Convention Center. There are several free must-sees during Art Basel. The first is a live performance piece by Mexican conceptual artist Abraham Cruzvillegas, whose debut performance piece, ""Autoreconstruccion: To insist, to Insist, to Insist,"" will take place twice a day in the Miami Beach Convention Center's brand-new ballroom and features dancer and choreographer Barbara Foulkes attached by a strap to the artist's scrap metal assemblage while musicians do their thing. Another must-see freebie is The Faena Festival running December 3 - 9 at the 3000 block of Collins Avenue, with a slew of public art, performance artists, exhibitions and all sorts of social-media-worthy opportunities to enlighten the masses. This year's theme is ""This is not America,"" which, according to Zoe Luke, curator of Faena Art, ""Addresses America as a concept more than a place, a contested and powerful idea that is greater than the waters and borders that frame it."" The fair has spread beyond Miami Beach thanks to the emergence of Wynwood as the arts district. Here, the streets (and walls) are plastered with art by renowned graffiti artists. An absolute to-do is the free Basel House at the old RC Cola Plant, 550 NW 24th St., where a collection of culture is housed all in one space, from music and vendors to new age art installations, late night DJs, mural tours, live painting, food trucks, and pretty much anything else, running December 7 - 9. Delving a little deeper, but not into people's pockets, is the free exhibition at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum featuring artist Hank Willis Thomas and his nonprofit For Freedoms project, and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collecting handwritten and typed messages from the incarcerated. Further exploration will undoubtedly turn up a slew of other opportunities to be immersed in the arts. Miami Beach circa Art Basel is a dazzling, dizzying, fascinating experience that can be enjoyed by people of all levels of appreciations of art, and most importantly, of all budgets. As the locals like to say, Basel Tov!

We have updated our privacy policy to better explain how we use data on this site. Read it here The latest TAMPA -Incumbent Republican Stacy White seems set to win re-election in Hillsborough Commission District 4. With early voting, mail ballots and 12 of 99 precincts reporting, White leads Andrew Davis by a seemingly insurmountable 13 percentage points. ""I ran on my record and I have asked the citizens of District 4 for another term,"" White said. "" I think the citizens have spoken and they are happy with my job performance."" White, who was elected to the commission in 2014 after a four-year stint as a Hillsborough School Board member, was viewed as a strong favorite to retain the mostly rural and suburban seat where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 11,000. White, 46, had a significant fundraising advantage, too, with more than $222,000 in contributions including the backing of developers, law firms and financial institutions. He touted himself as a fiscal conservative who would preserve quality of life for residents. He publicly opposed the transportation sales tax initiative. With Democrats focusing on two commission countywide seats, Davis, 36, was able to raise only about $10,700. A service adviser for an auto-repair shop, Davis hoped to make the election about sprawl. On the campaign trail, he repeatedly criticized White and the county for what he called irresponsible land development decisions to placate developers. ""Unfortunately, we'll have another four years of someone who is in the pocket of developers and who will stand up to the LGBT community,"" Davis said. ""I am not going to stop being a thorn in his side. "" Contact Christopher O'Donnell at [email protected] or (813) 226-3446. Follow @codonnell_Times.

Andrew,Davis,1889,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6659604-151/campbell-goodman-campbell-winning-in-bend-council-race,"Incumbent city Councilor Barb Campbell and environmental steward Gena Goodman-Campbell appear likely to win Bend City Council seats after initial election results Tuesday. Goodman-Campbell, the public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, led her main opponent, Central Oregon Community College student life director Andrew Davis, by a two-to-one margin. Musician Victor Johnson, the third candidate in that race, received only a few votes. Goodman-Campbell, 34, decided to run for the City Council because of conversations she had with voters during her unsuccessful campaign for the state House two years ago. She’s focused on lowering housing costs and improving transportation options. She said she thought her success stemmed in part from her canvassing in 2016, when she knocked on thousands of doors. Goodman-Campbell said her work will continue until new councilors take office. “I want to make sure I’m really up to speed on all the issues that will come before me and staying in touch with constituents,” she said. Campbell had a slighter but still significant lead over stay-at-home mother Sarah McCormick. Ron “Rondo” Boozell, a frequent candidate who spent election night and most of the campaign season in jail, collected a handful of votes in that race. Campbell, 54, campaigned on her experience and work on city initiatives including bike greenways and code changes targeted at reducing the cost of housing. McCormick and Davis far out-raised their competitors, and the bulk of their contributions came in large sums from groups representing the housing and real estate industries and the Bend Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the day Tuesday, McCormick had reported raising more than $80,000, and Davis had collected nearly $75,000. Meanwhile, Campbell raised nearly $14,000, and Goodman-Campbell collected about $19,500. Boozell and Johnson did no fundraising. McCormick, 32, made addressing homelessness in downtown a key issue of her campaign. She also criticized Campbell as being too focused on national politics to serve Bend residents. Boozell, 57, has run unsuccessfully several times for the Bend City Council. His campaign has been all but nonexistent because he’s been in jail since August for failing to pay child support, but during a jailhouse interview he said he wanted to be a voice for the homeless and other people who aren’t represented in Bend government. Davis, 34, is a lifelong northeast Bend resident. His priority is to quickly annex and provide services to the 2,380 acres in Bend’s urban growth boundary, the state-approved line around cities that determines where they can grow. He said Tuesday he was surprised and disappointed by the vote. “That’s a pretty big margin, so I wouldn’t expect it to change,” he said. “I ran a good hard race, and I’m proud of what I’ve done.” Johnson, 49, ran to draw the council’s focus to music and arts. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806412,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Andrew,Davis,1889,http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20181106/lanier-wins-district-court-judge-race,"ASHEBORO — In complete but unofficial results Tuesday, Sarah Neely Lanier followed in her father Bill Neely’s footsteps and was elected to fill the District 19B District Court judge seat. Lanier, a Republican, has been a managing partner at the general practice law firm Neely & Lanier, PLLC, since 2010. Her husband, Jeremy Lanier, is a captain with the Randolph County Sheriff’s Office. Her challengers were Brooke Schmidly, the only Democratic candidate in the race, and Republican Andrew Davis. Schmidly served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2001-2007. Since then, Schmidly has worked in private practice with Moser, Schmidly, and Roose Law Firm, focusing on litigation relating to child custody, personal injury, civil litigation and representing small businesses. Davis has been practicing law for 18 years. The results, which will become official following the Randolph County Board of Elections’ canvass on Friday, Nov. 16, had Lanier with 28,372 votes, or 61.23 percent; Schmidly, 10,565, or 22.8 percent; and Davis, 7,399, or 15.97 percent.

Andrew,Davis,1887,https://www.shropshirelive.com/sport/2018/11/05/shropshires-calvin-priest-heading-to-australia-with-england-counties-50/,"Shropshire Over 50s opening bowler Calvin Priest is heading Down Under to play in a World Cup. Calvin, who still plays regular Birmingham League cricket for Shifnal, has been selected as a member of the England Counties 50+ squad for the inaugural Over 50s Cricket World Cup. The tournament is taking place in Sydney from November 20 to December 5, with England Counties 50+ facing teams from Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Wales, Canada and Pakistan. Calvin has been one of the top performers for Shropshire in recent seasons in the Over 50s county competition which has seen the side qualify for the KO stages. This saw him invited to take part in England Counties 50+ trials earlier this year which, combined with his consistent performances for Shropshire in the Over 50s County Championship, has seen him selected in the 16-man squad. In the competition Down Under, each team all the others in a round-robin series, with the top four teams going forward to the semi-finals. England Counties 50+ are also due to play Australia in three ODIs during the tour. Shropshire 50s+ Organiser Martin Chambers said: “Everyone connected with Seniors cricket in Shropshire is thrilled to see Calvin selected as part of the England Counties 50+ squad. “He’s been a top performer for us in recent seasons leading our bowling attack. Good luck to Calvin and the rest of the squad, we’ll all be keeping a close eye on the games and hoping they can come home with the trophy!” Calvin comes from a family with a cricketing pedigree. His great uncle was Eric Hollies, a leg spinner who took over 2,300 First Class wickets for Warwickshire and has a stand named after him at Edgbaston, who also played 13 Tests for England. He was the man who denied Australian legend Don Bradman the chance of becoming the only batsman to average 100 in Test cricket when he bowled him for a duck in his last innings at The Oval in 1948. Bradman, who needed to score just four runs to achieve the landmark, ended with an average of 99.94.

Perkins (231) 439-9353 wtperkins@petoskeynews.com Reporter Voters in Charlevoix and Emmet counties will decide on many races and proposals in the upcoming election on Tuesday, Nov. 6. The polls will be open from 7 a.m.-8 p.m. on Tuesday. Below is a synopsis of all the races and proposals up for consideration on election day. Three Emmet County commissioner seats have contested races. In District 2, incumbent Republican Neil Ahrens is running against Democrat Lauri Hartmann. In District 5, Republican Jim Kargol is running against Democrat George Richard Lewis. In District 7, Republican Izzy Lyman is vying for the commissioner seat against incumbent Betsy White, who is running as a write-in candidate. Matt Bugera and Mary Ellen Hughes are running for mayor of Harbor Springs. Cece Johnston, Matt Naturkas and Pringle Pfeifer are running for the two Harbor Springs City Council seats up for election. In Petoskey, four candidates are running for City Council. Suzanne Shumway and Derek Shiels are running for the Ward 2 council seat. Lindsey Walker and incumbent Jeremy Wills are running for the Ward 4 seat. Steven Celez and Scott P. Newman are running for Mackinaw City village president. Zachary Coonrod, John Lemanski, Enzo Lieghio and George Ranville are running for three village council seats. Mark Ashley, Mary Ling, Jessica Nolff and Kathleen Reed are vying for three positions on the Petoskey school board. James Bell, Laura J. Jackson and Ed Trudeau are running for two seats on the Mackinaw City School District. Serenity Dankert is running for the Pellston school board against write-in candidates Stephanie Bromley and Angela Ross. Carp Lake Township voters will consider a proposal to grant Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-op an irrevocable electric franchise, which would make the co-op the electrical distributor in the community for the next 30 years. Springvale Township voters will consider a proposal to increase the road millage by one mill ($1 per $1,000 of taxable value) for four years, raising an estimated $92,000 in its first year for road repairs. Emmet County voters are looking at a potential five-year, .31 mill tax increase (31 cents for each $1,000 of taxable value) to pay for their share of Charlevoix, Cheboygan and Emmet counties’ 911 equipment upgrades. It would raise an estimated $896,565 in its first year. A number of public school levies are also on the ballot. An operating millage proposal for Public Schools of Petoskey would levy 21 mills on non-homestead property for a period of eight years, although the rate is not to exceed 18 mills. The remaining three mills would only be available to be levied to restore millage lost as the result of a Headlee amendment rollback. Public Schools of Petoskey is also asking for a sinking fund millage renewal, which would be an eight-year, 1.5 mill levy. Potential uses could include purchasing real estate, construction and repairs, school security improvements or acquiring technology. The operating millage proposal for Harbor Springs Public Schools would renew the amount of 14.7876 mills for a period of two years on non-homestead property. Only 13.9911 mills would be levied. The rest could only be levied to the extent necessary for the restoration of a Headlee Amendment rollback, in maintaining the maximum levy of 13.9911. The second Harbor Springs Public Schools proposal is to renew the recreation millage in the amount of 0.13 mills for a period of four years. That would cover expenses related to the district’s community swimming pool. Many places in Charlevoix County have county, and local elected positions to consider on Tuesday. Voters in the city of Charlevoix will select their preferred choice of mayor and council member candidate. Incumbent Luther Kurtz is seeking a second term as Charlevoix mayor. He faces Gabe Campbell, who previously served as the city’s mayor. Charlevoix Ward 1 voters will select between incumbent council member Janet Kalbfell and her challenger, Jodi Laurent. Voters living in the city’s Ward 2 will decide between incumbent Thomas Oleksy and Greg Stevens. Ward 3 voters will pick between incumbent Shane Cole and Rick Wertz. Four districts in Charlevoix County have contested county commissioner races on the November ballot. Voters in District 3, which covers Boyne Valley, Chandler, Hudson and Wilson townships, will pick between incumbent Ron Reinhardt and Walt Cherry. Reinhardt is running as a Republican and Cherry is competing as a Democrat. Republican Robert Draves and Democrat Ellen Addington are hoping to represent District 4, which includes South Arm Township and the city of East Jordan. Incumbent Joel Evans is not seeking re-election for the seat. Voters in District 5, which covers Eveline, Marion, Norwood, Peaine, and St. James townships, will pick between incumbent Nancy Ferguson and John Teesdale. Ferguson is running as a Republican and Teesdale is competing as a Democrat. In District 6 — which includes the city of Charlevoix and Charlevoix Township —incumbent commissioner Shirley Roloff, a Republican, will face Democratic challenger Richard Spring. Also this election, Hayes Township officials face a recall effort. The petition used in arranging the recall cited those officials’ votes in late 2017 to bid out the construction of a road, boat launch and fishing pier at Hayes Township Park Camp Sea-Gull. Hayes Township Trustee Paul Hoadley will face Robert Jess on the ballot. Hayes Township Clerk Marlene Golovich is facing a challenge from Warren Nugent. Julie Collard is running unopposed after former treasurer Robbin Kraft removed herself from the ballot. Collard was appointed to serve as treasurer by the Hayes Township Board in October after Kraft retired from the post. Other municipalities will have other races to consider. Incumbent William P. Carson and Theresa Marie Jarema are vying to be Boyne Falls village president. Jarema is running for the seat as a write-in candidate. Therefore, only Carson’s name will appear on the ballot. Five candidates are vying for two seats for a six-year-term on the Boyne City Public School District. Voters will decide among Zareena Safdar Koch, who is the lone incumbent running in the race, Nathan Minnaar, Karen Belch, Chris Marlin and Harry “Hap” B. Wright. In addition to picking local and county representatives, Charlevoix County voters will also have proposals to ponder. Charlevoix County voters are looking at a potential three-year, 0.5-mill tax to pay for their share of the Charlevoix, Cheboygan and Emmet County 911 equipment upgrades. It is projected to raise about $1.1 million in its first year. Charlevoix Township voters will decide on the township’s request for a $1.8 million bond issue to fund a new fire station, which would replace the current one on the north side. The bond would be paid off over 15 years. In its first year, the measure would have a millage rate of 0.9588 and would cost approximately $92 for the owner of a property with a taxable value of $100,000. Norwood Township voters will decide if they want to renew a one-mill levy to provide funds for fire protection and EMS services for the next four years. If approved, the millage would raise about $45,636 for the township in 2018. Many state positions are up for consideration on Tuesday. Voters will also decide the fate of three statewide ballot proposals. State Rep. Lee Chatfield, R-Levering and his Democratic challenger, Joanne Galloway, a farmer from Pickford, are vying to represent the 107th House District, which includes Emmet, Chippewa, Mackinac and parts of Cheboygan counties. State Rep. Triston Cole, R-Mancelona, who represents the 105th House District, faces a challenge from Democrat Melissa Frugé of Boyne City, who has a communications background. The 105th House District includes Antrim, Otsego, Charlevoix, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. State Sen. Wayne Schmidt, R-Traverse City, who represents the 37th Senate District — made up of Antrim, Charlevoix, Cheboygan, Chippewa, Emmet, Grand Traverse, Luce and Mackinac counties — will face Democrat Jim Page, a retired teacher from Sault Ste Marie. Michiganders will decide on Tuesday who will be the state’s next governor. Candidates for the position include Republican Bill Schuette, Democrat Gretchen Whitmer, Libertarian Bill Gelineau, Todd Schleiger of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, Jennifer Kurland of the Green party and Keith Butkovich of the Natural Law Party. Four people are running to be the state’s next secretary of state. The candidates include Republican Mary Treder Lang, Democrat Jocelyn Benson, Libertarian Gregory Scott Stempfle and U.S. Taxpayers Party candidate Robert Gale. Five candidates are running for attorney general, including Republican Tom Leonard, Democrat Dana Nessel, Libertarian Lisa Lane Gioia, Gerald T. Van Sickle of the U.S. Taxpayers Party and independent candidate Chris Graveline. Voters will have choices of several candidates for other statewide races, including the State Board of Education and the Michigan Supreme Court. Many people are running to serve on the boards of major state universities including the University of Michigan, Michigan State University and Wayne State University. For those positions, voters can pick no more than two candidates. In addition to candidates for elected offices, Michigan voters will consider three statewide initiatives. Proposal 1 would allow adults 21 and older to use marijuana for recreational purposes. Proposal 2 would amend the state constitution to create a commission of citizens with exclusive authority to decide on district boundaries. Proposal 3 would allow for folks to automatically be registered to vote when applying, using or renewing a driver’s license or state-issued identification card, unless that person declines. The initiative would also allow for no-reason absentee voting and straight ticket voting. Voters in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula will choose between U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Watersmeet, and Democrat Matt Morgan of Traverse City to fill Michigan’s 1st District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat seeking a fourth term in the Senate, will face Republican John James, a veteran and businessman. Other candidates running for the spot include George Huffman III of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, Marcia Squier of the Green Party and John Howard Wilhelm of the Natural Law party.

Paul Holmes and Michael Gordon explore whether, in an era defined by politicization and polarization, it's possible —or even advisable — for brands to just watch from the sidelines. Aarti Shah 05 Nov 2018 // 5:25AM GMT NEW YORK — Brands that are most effective navigating today’s polarized political environment are those with well-defined values that ultimately strengthen relationships, Paul Holmes maintained during a webinar conducted in partnership with Group Gordon last week. Holmes, founder and chair of The Holmes Group, and Michael Gordon, principal at Group Gordon, explored whether, in an era defined by politicization and polarization, it's possible —or even advisable — for brands to just watch from the sidelines. “There is no right or wrong as much as there is a determination to stand for what you stand for,” Holmes said. “What has changed is that neutrality is no longer an option.” Brands have long mixed politics with business, noting examples from the 90s when Levi Strauss ended its financial support of the Boy Scouts based on its stance on gay rights, to the aughts when United Benetton used prisoners on death row as models in its ad, to present day where companies like Patagonia, Nike and Chick-fil-A have benefitted from having firm convictions. “You now have to actually live the values that you espouse,” Holmes said. “That may make you uncomfortable but ultimately it has the potential to cement and solidify your relationship with employees, consumers and communities.” Two views on PR have emerged: those who measure PR success like a popularity contest — “the more people you can get to like you, the fewer people will dislike you” versus those who believe the best strategy for building relationships is by “knowing what you stand for and acting as if you really stand for it,” Holmes explained. The top 10 most trusted companies this year on the Harris Reputation Quotient survey include Chick-fil-A, known for promoting conservative social values, as well as progressive icon Patagonia. What they have in common is that they know what they stand for and remain true to their values. The firm’s research among senior communications executives also found that 62% of CCOs now believe the risk of not taking a stand outweighs the risk of taking a stance. “It helps to frame the message so it’s about values rather than personal or party politics,” Holmes said. He also pointed out that “the largest corporations in the world -— Amazon, Google, etc — are bigger than most nation states. They have more influence and economic pull than governments of many states. It would be more surprising if they don’t get involved.” Meanwhile, Gordon questioned how differences between a company’s business goals and stakeholder interests can be remedied. “If your values are totally misaligned with stakeholders — internal or external — it probably requires and adjustment one way or another,” Holmes said. “The role of PR people works two ways: either persuading external and internal stakeholders to your point-of-view or it’s persuading management to change their point-of-view.” Both Gordon and Holmes cautioned against overreacting to a loud, but insignificant, number of people. Holmes said while it might be easier for B2B companies to take a lower profile around issues, “I’m not sure it’s wise because sooner or later, the spotlight shows up everywhere.” “We’re living in a very transparent age,” he added. “You should conduct yourself in a way that everything you do, say or even think could end up in” the media.

Michael,Gordon,1884,https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2018/11/iran-sanctions-revisited.php,"In his great undoing of the “accomplishments” of the Obama administration, President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the humiliating and destructive Iran nuclear deal. The deal funded a terrorist regime that remains at war with the United States and that continues to avow its dedication to our destruction. There was no bridge too far for Obama in seeking to align the United States with the mullahs of Iran. Michael Doran explained the “secret strategy” driving this policy. Whatever the explanation, Obama’s appeasement of Iran represented part of the “fundamental transformation” of the United States that he proclaimed in the days before the 2008 election. I am grateful for the intercession of President Trump and his national security team. The Trump administration is also reimposing sanctions on the Iranian regime, effective today. The administration has termed the policy one of “maximum pressure” on the regime to reform its behavior. The sanctions to be imposed today target Iran’s oil, shipping, energy and banking sectors. These sanctions only go into effect today, but they have already begun to bite. Caline Malek reports here for Arab News from Dubai on the reimposition of sanctions. Former New York Times reporter Michael Gordon, now with the Wall Street Journal, reports on the related reorientation of American foreign policy in “Trump digs in for a long cold war with Iran” (accessible here via Outline). Gordon argues, New York Times style, with the effectiveness of the policy. He apparently couldn’t find anyone to speak in its favor. I should think that lessening the resources of the regime to fund evil beyond Iran’s borders is good in itself, but this is a point that escapes Gordon. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has won an internal administration argument about leaving Iranian banks with access to the SWIFT financial system. On Friday Secretary Mnuchin and Pompeo held a conference call with reporters explaining the scope of sanctions. Having lost the argument, National Security Advisor John Bolton professed to have a scheduling conflict. Controversy arose when the sanctions were announced in terms of Iran’s access to the SWIFT financial system and its potential to bypass the sanctions through it. According to Mnuchin, “SWIFT is no different than any other entity, and we have advised SWIFT the Treasury will aggressively use its authorities as necessary to continue intense economic pressure on the Iranian regime.” Malek’s Arab News article has more on this point. My daughter Eliana has reported for Politico on the dissatisfaction of Senators Cotton et al. with the resolution of the issues regarding SWIFT. Published on Thursday evening in advance of Friday’s conference call with Mnuchin and Pompeo, the story is here. Chris Wallace raised the issue with Secretary Pompeo in an interview on FOX News Sunday. He reiterated the point that Mnuchin made on Friday’s conference call: “The Iranian banks that engage in sanctionable behavior will be sanctioned by the Department of Treasury — period, full stop.” Asked why Senators Cotton et al. are not persuaded, Pompeo avoided a direct response: “I worked with Senator Cotton [in the House]…I’ve been at this a long time. No one’s going to argue that Secretary Pompeo isn’t tough on Iran and no one is going to argue that President Trump isn’t doing the same.” The Journal supports the policy as announced in a short editorial (accessible here on Outline): “The U.S. retains the flexibility to tighten sanctions further in coming months[.]” The editorial also provides this somewhat more persuasive response to Gordon’s Wall Street Journal article: “[Today’s] measures will deprive the rulers in Tehran of more cash for their foreign adventures.” “Arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.” Winston Churchill “Proclaim Liberty throughout All the land unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.” Inscription on the Liberty Bell",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

From left to right: Ben Orten, David McKenzie-James, Ed Barker-Wyatt (Captain), Dale Fawcett, Freddie Booth, Sean Evans DAVID Lloyd York have won their first Tyke Petroleum York Men's Tennis League division one title since 2013. Wigginton finished runners-up this term while Poppleton - who took the title for three consecutive years between 2015 and 2017 - ended the 2018 season in third. The division one champions also had the joint-best individual performances, with Sean Evans and Dale Fawcett each winning 39 of the 41 matches they played, losing only one all season. Rob Jones (Appleton Roebuck), Nick Turnbull (Poppleton), Andrew Davis (Harrogate Spa) and Dave Bradley (Appleton Roebuck) completed the season’s top six individual placings. Sherburn secured a hard-fought division two title and they will be joined in the top tier next season by Copmanthorpe, who edged Fulford into second place by a single point. The promoted pair will replace the relegated Rowntree Park and Starbeck in division one. Wigginton II and Boston Spa were convincing winners and runners-up, respectively, of division three. The title race in division four, meanwhile, was a thriller, with Racquets II (Harrogate) pipping Alne and Tollerton to the post by the smallest possible margin of half a point. Division five champions are Harrogate Spa, with Strensall close runners-up. The title honours in division six went to David Lloyd York III. Selby claimed second place, and promotion to division five, with Boston Spa II only one point behind in third. Division seven saw York IV took the title and Wigginton IV the runners-up spot. Champions of division eight were Harrogate Spa II, narrowly holding off a challenge from Wheldrake.

Denver police were called to that home around 8 p.m. Friday after receiving a call about a burglary in progress. The homeowner told police that the suspect refused to leave. When officers arrived, they checked the entire house and the yard outside. The injured party was found downstairs in the basement ""unresponsive,"" and was pronounced dead a short time later. Police say the homeowner, who was apparently armed with a 9 mm Smith & Wesson, is cooperating with investigators, ""and that no charges are pending at this time."" Does Colorado's ""Make My Day"" law apply in this case? The Make My Day law grants immunity to people who kill a home intruder, if they fear they are in danger. A law enforcement source told Denver7 that ""Make My Day may apply, but it will be up to the district attorney to decide."" That has neighbors talking. ""I think people should always be able to protect themselves in any situation where they may be in harm, especially in their own home,"" said neighbor Sarah Antonucci. ""It was quite the commotion last night,"" said neighbor Will McNamara, who lives across the alley. ""I don't know all the facts of what happened here, but if it could have been resolved without somebody getting shot, that would have been nice and certainly less violent."" McNamara told Denver7 that he remembers his house being ransacked once while he was attending college in Maryland. He said he was asleep downstairs and was awakened when he heard some people enter the house. ""I assumed they were my roommates, so I went back to sleep. The next morning, all of our stuff was gone,"" he said. McNamara said he's glad he didn't go upstairs. ""I don't know what they would have been willing to do,"" he said. ""I've thought a lot about the Make My Day law in that context, actually."" McNamara's roommate, Michael Sylvester, said he is familiar with the Castle Doctrine, a self-defense theory that gives a homeowner the right to protect his home with the use of deadly force. He said Colorado's version of the Castle Doctrine, Make My Day, is stronger than most other states. He said that’s a little concerning, especially since he’s read a number of stories about drunk college age kids getting shot after entering, or breaking-in to someone else’s home. “But if I were in a situation where someone was breaking in, I think I would feel a lot safer being armed,” he added. Family members asking questions Authorities have not yet released the name of the man who was shot, but family members tell Denver7 that he was 36 years old and that he lived on the south side of town. “He was apparently shot in the back of the neck,” the man's uncle said. ""We don't know why he was here."" When Denver7 tried to contact the owner of the house, a man who answered the phone hung up. The neighbors we talked with say they have never seen any unusual activity at that house. Denver7 has requested a list of the “calls for service” to the residence.

Michael,Gordon,1879,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/slight-rise-expected-unemployed-wage-growth,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said he expected a ""modest"" rise in employment for the quarter to September and the unemployment rate to rise slightly to 4.6%. ""There are signs of a softening in labour demand, as the economy has passed its peak rate of growth,"" he said in a statement. The Statistics New Zealand household labour force survey, tracking wages, employment and unemployment, is to be released on Wednesday, followed the day after by the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy statement. Mr Gordon said while both unemployment and wage growth was expected to exceed the Reserve Bank’s forecasts, there was no time for the central bank to process the results into Thursday’s policy statement. He expected the labour data to be a ""mixed bag"", given in the previous quarter the survey revealed ""surprisingly"" robust growth in employment, which was in line with a stronger gross domestic product result. ""However, the fall in the unemployment rate seems to be stalling, and it actually rose slightly to 4.5% in the June quarter."" Westpac was picking unemployment for the quarter at 4.6%, while the ASB and Reserve Bank’s picks were 4.5%. ASB senior economist Mark Smith said Wednesday’s labour data was expected to show a ""broadly stable"" unemployment rate and ""moderate"" quarterly increases for employment. ""Pay equity settlements for the health sector should contribute towards a 0.5% quarter on quarter increase in the private sector labour cost index, with its annual wage inflation easing to 1.9%,"" he said in a statement. With wage inflation still contained but some uncertainty over the country’s medium term growth outlook, Mr Smith expected a ""prolonged period"" of stability for the official cash rate. The Reserve Bank’s interest-driving official cash rate, at a record low of 1.75%, is broadly expected to be held there until early-to-mid 2020. Mr Smith expects employment to rise 0.4% for the quarter, and annual employment growth to slow to 1.9% — a two-year low. simon.hartley@odt.co.nz",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Paula,Lunder,1876,http://www.colby.edu/news/2018/11/02/lunder-institute-for-american-art-names-torkwase-dyson-as-fall-2018-visiting-artist/,"November 2, 2018 Torkwase Dyson, a painter whose explorations of visibility, environment, science, and migration have particular resonance at this moment in history, is the fall 2018 visiting artist at the Lunder Institute for American Art. She is also showing a new body of site-specific work in the exhibition Nautical Dusk, on view through Jan. 6, 2019, at the Colby College Museum of Art. During her Lunder Institute tenure, Dyson will lead a series of dialogues, performances, and lectures, including a public convening on Nov. 7 that will highlight her collaborations with Colby students and faculty.

Photo by Gabe Souza courtesy of the Colby Museum of Art. “We are so fortunate to welcome Torkwase Dyson to campus and to benefit from her thoroughly interdisciplinary, inquisitive approach to her work,” said Lee Glazer, director of the Lunder Institute. “She has developed a distinctive language of geometric abstraction through a wide-ranging investigation of space, architecture, history, and scientific discourse, and we are looking forward to the many interactions she will have with our community.” At the invitation of the Museum, the New Jersey-based artist consulted archival materials related to Samuel Osborne (c. 1833–1904) in Colby’s Miller Library. Osborne was born into slavery and migrated from Virginia to Maine in 1865. He worked for the College for more than 30 years, and in 2017 Colby President David A. Greene renamed the presidential residence “Osborne House.” “A notable aspect of Dyson’s practice is embedded in the many ways of considering mobility, space, and geographic conditions through the language of abstraction,” said Daisy Desrosiers, director of programs at the Lunder Institute. “The possibilities of encounters through the institute have provided, for the artist, a space to question how we position ourselves in regards to archival material and how we respond to it as part of an ongoing process of observation.” As a Lunder Institute visiting artist, Dyson is investigating materials in Miller Library’s Special Collections, engaging with Colby faculty and students, and developing new collaborative projects. “I extrapolate from those things to ask phenomenological questions around geography, proximity, transference, clarity, seeing, belonging,” said Dyson. This hybrid platform, which combines research with ongoing reflection and conversation, provides time for the artist to explore intersections with scholars from multiple disciplines. Dyson is on campus from Oct. 31 through Nov. 7, when she will record a series of dialogues with Colby faculty from several different departments, including astronomy and creative writing. A suite of programs in the Museum lobby from 1:30 to 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, organized by the Lunder Institute, will include poetry by Colby students and performances by invited guests, including Dyson’s collaborator, artist Zachary Fabri, and visually scored by Andres L. Hernandez. Dyson, Fabri, and Hernandez comprise the performance collective F/H/D. The afternoon will conclude with an open conversation with the artist, in which Dyson will reflect on Nautical Dusk and the subsequent encounters and discoveries it has generated. In Nautical Dusk, Dyson’s geometric forms are infused with metaphorical associations found in obituaries of Osborne. Written by unnamed white authors, these texts raise questions about authorship, transmission, and self-determination. Curated by Diana Tuite, Katz Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, Nautical Dusk features sculptures and paintings that explore these subjects. Dusk, a monumental ramp that visitors are welcome to engage with in a variety of ways, occupies half of the gallery. In 2017-18, its inaugural year, the Lunder Institute hosted artist Theaster Gates and poet Richard Blanco as its first visiting artists. About Torkwase Dyson Torkwase Dyson was born in Chicago, Ill., and spent her developmental years between North Carolina and Mississippi. Traversing these regions helped develop a fundamental dialectic of architecture/infrastructure, geography, and Black spatial liberation. During her years at Tougaloo College, where she majored in sociology and double minored in social work and fine art, she began to examine the poetics of Black history and environmental justice. Over the next 10 years, Dyson traveled to locally and globally strategize with communities of color on ways to attain resource equality. During this time she earned her bachelor’s in fine arts in painting from Virginia Commonwealth University and her master’s in fine arts in painting from Yale School of Art. In 2016 Dyson designed and built Studio South Zero (SSZ), a solar-powered mobile studio where the context of nomadicity became the framework for learning and making art about the environment. It was traveling with SSZ that inspired her experimental project the Wynter-Wells Drawing School for Environmental Liberation, where she explores contemporary theorizations of form, space, architecture, and the infrastructure of extraction economies. Though working through multiple mediums, Dyson describes herself as a painter who uses distilled geometric abstraction to create an idiosyncratic language that is both diagrammatic and expressive. The works are deconstructions of natural and built environments that consider how individuals negotiate and negate various types of systems and spatial order. Dyson’s work has been exhibited at the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Drawing Center, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Museum of Modern Art, the Corcoran College of Art and Design, Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts, the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education, and the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. Dyson has been awarded the Nancy Graves Grant for Visual Artists, Visiting Artist grant to the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, the Culture Push Fellowship for Utopian Practices, Eyebeam Art and Technology Center Fellowship, and the FSP/Jerome Fellowship. Dyson’s work has also been supported by Lower Manhattan Cultural Center, the Laundromat Projects, the Green Festival of New York, the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, the Mural Arts Program of Philadelphia, The Kitchen, and the Rebuild Foundation. In 2016 Dyson was elected to the board of the Architecture League of New York as vice president of visual arts and is currently visiting critic at Yale School of Art. She is represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery in Chicago and Davidson Contemporary in New York. About the Lunder Institute for American Art The Lunder Institute for American Art, established in 2017 through the generosity of Peter and Paula Lunder, supports innovative research, critical inquiry, and creative production aimed at expanding the boundaries of American art and its interpretive communities. Uniquely positioned within an academic museum on a liberal arts campus in Central Maine, the Lunder Institute offers opportunities for visiting artists and scholars to reflect, convene, and work with the Colby community across disciplinary boundaries to ask challenging questions, test new ideas, and produce work that is original, illuminating, and generative.",0.0,62.0,6.2,1.0,1028440,1.0,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Now they've welcomed a second and third generation and they're still selling bikes and accessories, and offering maintenance and repairs. The festivities will be all day Saturday, November 3, and they'll start early. ""We're going to have a bike ride--a gravel grinder--out in the countryside in East Ohio,"" said Rob Reed, owner. ""And we're going to have buckwheat pancakes--that's one of my favorites--with pure maple syrup, and we're going to have a wood-fired pizza truck come."" ""We're really looking forward to having all our old-time customers come as well as new customers come and spend time with us,"" said Bev Reed, mechanic and salesperson. ""It's been really nice to work on people's bikes that come from out of town and are riding for a cause,"" said Kathleen Reed, co-owner. The pre-ride pancake breakfast is at 7:30 a.m. The 20-mile ride starts out from the shop at 8:30 a.m. After the ride, there's wood-fired pizza, cake and more. And all day, they'll be serving fresh fruit smoothies made in a bicycle-powered blender! Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Mostly cloudy with some showers after midnight. Low 42F. Winds ENE at 5 to 10 mph. Chance of rain 50%. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 12:42 pm Nora Inez Crist, also known as Memaw, Sis, Shorty, Baby Doll, Barry's mom and NoraNora, went to be with her Lord and Savior while surrounded by family and friends on October 30, 2018, in Charleston. Nora was born May 17, 1941, on Shade Creek in Victor. Nora was preceded in death by her infant son Michael Aaron Crist, her mother Frieda McVey, her father Augustus McVey and her brothers JC McVey and Samuel McVey. Nora is survived by her son Barry Crist (Kim), her grandsons Jeremy Crist (Kristi), Joshua Crist, Jacob Crist and one great - grandson Jaxon Crist, all of Ansted, as well as her special companion of 21 years Ray Crist of Hico, whom she loved and adored. Nora is also survived by many siblings, Tom McVey (Bonnie) of Princeton, Sharon Fox of Proctorville, Ohio, James Conrad McVey (Rita) of Beckley, Richard McVey (Debbie) of Mt. Hope, Victoria Markivich (Andy) of Ansted, Melody Wallen (Steve) of Bradley, and her sister-in-law Lynn McVey, Ansted. She is also survived by a host of many nieces and nephews whom she loved very much. Nora was a dedicated Christian and member of St. Paul's United Methodist Church of Ansted, where she filled many roles over the years. She served faithfully in the United Methodist Women and also served as church treasurer and church secretary. She loved her church family and often she was surrounded by children during Sunday sermons. Her love for God was indescribable. Nora was retired from the Fayette County Board of Education after nearly 40 years where she worked as a secretary at Ansted High School, Midland Trail High School and the Central office of Fayette County schools. She also attended WV Tech where she received an Associate degree in business. Nora always lived life to the fullest and gave more than she received and was always thinking of others before herself. Her house was always open to those in need. She could often be found sitting on her front porch welcoming family, friends and neighbors; she would offer advice, wisdom and genuine conversation. She also enjoyed knitting, crocheting or doing needlepoint while sitting in her rocking chair. There are no words to describe her love for flowers and sweet treats. Nora's front yard was frequently a playground for the local neighborhood children whom she loved dearly. Nora also loved to travel and see new places and was often taking ""the trip of a lifetime"" with her family to create memories. Backroad adventures with Ray were her favorite. To those that knew and loved her, Nora was truly larger than life. Finally, Nora cherished her family more than anything. If there was a family event, you could be sure that she would be in the midst of the activities taking place. Her time was best spent with her family, whether it be on a trip to the beach, a family gathering for a holiday, or just dinner. Her love for ""her babies"" Jeremy, Joshua, Jacob and Jaxon was unmatched. Babysitting her great-grandson Jaxon was one of her many blessings. A special thanks goes out to the staff on 5 South at Charleston Area Medical Center, Memorial Division, especially to Nurse Nora for her compassion, kindness and caring spirit for Nora and her family during a trying and difficult time. Services will be held on Saturday, November 3, at St. Paul's United Methodist Church in Ansted, W.Va.

John,O'Neil,1872,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/bitcoin-and-blockchain/2018/11/02/e336c5cc-ded0-11e8-8bac-bfe01fcdc3a6_story.html,"Analysis Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events When Bitcoin broke into public consciousness in 2013, it couldn’t have been sexier: a digital currency being used to buy everything from drugs to cupcakes. Bitcoin’s wild price ride — soaring up in late 2017 only to fall steadily back down this year — was also pretty exciting, even if the swings made its use as an everyday currency seem less plausible. Another aspect of Bitcoin that’s a bit less scintillating has generated almost as much enthusiasm: public online ledgers. Blockchain — the technology used for verifying and recording transactions that’s at the heart of Bitcoin — is seen as having the potential to reshape the global financial system and possibly other industries. Yet five years after Bitcoin’s emergence, blockchain remains more of a tantalizing concept than a tool that’s actually used — kind of like Bitcoin. The Situation The total value of Bitcoin, which neared $300 billion in late 2017, stood at $112 billion in late October. Some in the industry thought the introduction of Bitcoin futures contracts by Cboe Global Markets, CME Group Inc. and Nasdaq in late 2017 would help build legitimacy, but trading on both exchanges was minimal. Bitcoin’s rollercoaster ride was replicated by a raft of new cryptocurrencies that have raised more than $21.5 billion through initial coin offerings. Their explosive growth drew warnings from regulators around the globe even before hackers stole almost $500 million worth of a digital token called NEM from a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange. The vast majority of ICOs lost substantial value in 2018. Blockchain also had a number of setbacks, as several high-profile initiatives were dropped or put on hold, including a plan by Australia’s stock exchange to start using the technology to process equity transactions. But Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced in September that starting in 2019, it will require suppliers of fresh, leafy greens to track their products using a digital ledger developed by International Business Machines Corp., which has spent heavily on developing blockchain tools for business. The Background Virtual currencies aren’t new — online fantasy games have long used them — but the development of a secure digital currency without a central issuer rightly turned heads. The person or people who created the Bitcoin system under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto solved a problem central to any currency — preventing counterfeiting — and did it without relying on a government’s authority. The software also solved one specific hurdle for digital money — how to stop users from spending the same unit of currency twice. The breakthrough idea was blockchain, a publicly visible, anonymous online ledger that records every single Bitcoin transaction. It’s maintained by a network of “miners” whose computers perform the calculations that validate each transaction, preventing double-spending. They earn a reward of newly issued Bitcoin. The pace of creation is limited, and no more than 21 million will ever be issued. For all its technical sophistication, Bitcoin’s early reputation was as a tool for selling drugs and laundering money online. The Argument Prominent economist Nouriel Roubini has joined investor Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., in questioning whether Bitcoin is simply hype. Buffett said the currency was “probably rat poison squared” and Dimon called it a “fraud,” though he later said he regretted making the comment and that blockchain was a real technology. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have both expressed openness to working with cryptocurrencies, and Fidelity Investments is offering to manage digital assets for clients. Regulators are paying attention, too. Different branches of the U.S. government have opened investigations into possible criminal manipulation of cryptocurrency trading and possible fraud in other parts of the market. A growing number of entrepreneurs in the field are lobbying for regulation to help Bitcoin shed its lawless image and become an established asset class. In the world of blockchain, a split has opened between those focused on creating specific tools for business and those pursuing the decentralized ideal of Bitcoin’s early days — freeing money from the control of governments and established financial institutions. Some critics say both kinds of blockchain amount to no more than a new kind of database.

Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Cr Ella Lawton was responding to comments by Andrew Davis during the public forum at a council meeting in Queenstown on Wednesday. Mr Davis told councillors the ORC's approval of the consent without community feedback was inconsistent with its recent promise to work with the community on the restoration of Lake Hayes and to step up water quality monitoring in the area. ""The ORC is on board ... and then we receive notice that a consent has been granted for a development directly on Mill Stream, the only tributary to Lake Hayes.'' In September, the ORC approved consents for the construction of six weirs, seven bridges and two culverts in and over Mill Creek, and for widening and reshaping the stream. It would be dammed to create amenity ponds above the weirs, and flood walls would be constructed to protect historic farm buildings from an extreme flood event. The work would be commissioned by Winton Partners subsidiary Waterfall Park Developments Ltd if it gains approval from the Queenstown Lakes District Council (QLDC) for a major hotel development on the site. In April, the company applied for resource consent to build a ``four-plus star'' 380-room hotel, restaurants, wellness centre and conference facilities on the 58hectare site, which is about 3km southwest of Arrowtown. Mr Davis said the work would cause the stream to be ""significantly disturbed'' when its water quality and that of Lake Hayes was already ""poor''. Cr Lawton said the non-notified consents were for ""in-stream work'' only, and if the QLDC granted resource consent for the overall hotel development, the regional council would work closely with it to protect the catchment's water quality. ""We will be putting in every possible [condition] we can to ensure there isn't an ongoing impact to Mill Creek and Lake Hayes. ""Essentially, we're in a situation where you guys are unhappy with what we've done. ""What we're promising is that the next steps are going to be better.'' The consents require Waterfall Park Developments to take ""all reasonable steps'' to minimise the release of sediment into the stream. An internal report by ORC senior consents officer Natasha Pritchard said sediment and erosion control measures would be necessary to avoid sediment-laden runoff impacting Mill Creek. Provided an earthworks management plan signed off by both councils was implemented following best practice, sediment discharge could be expected to be minimised, Ms Pritchard said.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1020357,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Olivo, the Titans' leading ground gainer, is listed as questionable for tonight's regular-season finale at Freedom (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell Titans running back J.C. Olivo looks for yardage during last week's 56-6 win over West Caldwell. Olivo, the Titans' leading ground gainer, is listed as questionable for tonight's regular-season finale at Freedom (7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. Looking for positives concerning the McDowell Titan football program? How about these: They’ve doubled their win total from a year ago, and they’re still fighting for a playoff spot here in Week 12. The Titans (2-4 Northwestern 3A/4A Conference, 4-6 overall) travel to Freedom tonight (7:30 kickoff) in the regular-season finale against the Patriots (5-1, 8-2). A win tonight would secure the only State 4A Playoff berth available to the conference. Regardless of what happens in Morganton, McDowell would still capture the postseason spot if the league’s other 4A program, South Caldwell (2-4, 3-7), loses at Alexander Central (3-2, 7-2) tonight. But the Titans won’t be thinking about that other game. “We’ve got to worry about what we do,” said McDowell head coach Andy Morgan, whose club is coming off a 56-6 win at West Caldwell last Thursday. “Freedom has an excellent team, but we have to take care of what we do and execute. We have a good game plan on both sides of the ball, and if we can execute, it should be a good ballgame.” The Titans have executed pretty well of late, especially on the offensive side. McDowell is averaging a healthy 25.4 points and a well-balanced 335 yards of offense, with 152 per game on the ground and 183 through the air. With the exception of a 229-yard outing in a loss to Alexander Central, the Titans have easily surpassed the 300-yard mark in four of their last five games. One of the biggest reasons for McDowell’s success has been the play of senior quarterback Adam Randolph, who set a new school record for single-season passing yards in last week’s win over West Caldwell. Randolph has thrown for 1,832 yards on 124-of-181 passing with 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He’s completing 68.5 percent of his passes, which Morgan said is the second-best mark in the state. “Adam has done a great job, and I hope he can pass for 2,000 yards,” said Morgan. “A lot has to be said about the offensive line and receivers. I think we’ve played fairly well the last half of the season. We’ve made some mistakes in the red zone, but the offensive line has improved a lot.” In addition to Randolph’s record-setting season, a couple of McDowell receivers have been quietly etching their names in the Titan history book as well. Senior Dakota Effler is now No. 2 in career receiving yards, while Andruw Randolph has moved into the No. 3 spot. Effler has 86 catches for 1,116 yards and eight touchdowns in his three-year varsity career. Randolph, a four-year varsity player, has 83 receptions for 1,105 yards and 13 TDs. Only Ethan McMahan (100 rec., 1,468 yards, 12TDs) is ahead of the duo. Randolph needs only one touchdown to tie the school’s all-time leader, Adrian Pearson. The Titans’ passing game may end up being especially important tonight. Senior tailback J.C. Olivo (176 rushes, 889 yards, 9TDs), the team’s leading rusher, is listed as questionable after re-aggravating a high ankle sprain last week. Olivo left the West Caldwell game in the first half and did not return. Sophomore Dequan Boyce filled in superbly for Olivo, rushing for 132 yards and three scores on 18 carries. “J.C. has been taped up and going about half-speed,” said Morgan. “I don’t know what his availability is, but if he can go, he will. He’s tough. It’s been bothering him all year, since back in the summer, but he’s done a good job of taping it up and taking care of it. “I was proud of Dequan. He has played mostly defense because we have two-platooned all year and J.C. hasn’t played defense. He has learned a lot (about playing tailback), but the thing I’m most proud of is he sticks it up in there and doesn’t try to bounce everything outside, and he’s getting those tough yards.” That’s good, since yards of any kind will be tough against a solid Patriots defense. “They’re very good offensively and defensively, but I think their defense is underrated,” said Morgan. “I think they’re one of the top two defenses in the conference. They’re physical up front and well-coached, their ends don’t get out of position, their linebackers are good, and they’re good in the secondary and everybody back there is athletic.” Freedom has been just as good offensively, averaging more than 44 points per contest. The Pats have scored at least 43 points in all but three outings: last week’s 35-16 loss to Watauga in the de facto conference championship game; a 31-21 loss to powerful Shelby in the season opener; and a 38-6 win over Alexander Central Oct. 5. The Patriots have scored 54 or more four times. The Titans will counter with players like senior defensive lineman Andrew Davis, who has led the team in tackles all season and has a team-high 74 stops. Linebackers Brycen Seymore (59 tackles, 2INT) and Johan Ayala (58, 4TFL), defensive back Drew Green (55) and defensive tackle Bryce Allison (55) all have more than 50 tackles to their credit. Allison has been a consistent playmaker up front, and leads the team with eight tackles for loss and six quarterback sacks to go with two fumble recoveries and a caused fumble. The playoffs are set to begin Friday, Nov. 16. The postseason was moved back a week due to weather concerns when Hurricane Florence hit the eastern part of the state. If McDowell qualifies for the playoffs, it would be an at-large selection in the 4A (small 4A) bracket. Freedom holds a 24-15 edge in the all-time series with the Titans. The Patriots have beaten McDowell three times in a row, included a 41-14 game in last year’s season finale. Northwestern 3A/4A Conference football 2018 Conf.

They talked about the possibility of McDowell having a standalone health department.

Michael,Gordon,1861,https://wwos.nine.com.au/nrl/nrl-cooper-cronk-future-pivotal-as-nrl-silly-season-begins/d910894e-4d65-41f5-9a8c-c7ec458aa7b3,"NSW and Tasmania have drawn their Sheffield Shield clash at the SCG, where Nathan Lyon snagged four late wickets to give his side a sniff of victory. New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor has come under fire for his throwing gesture when facing all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez in their ODI on Wednesday. South African captain Faf du Plessis says his side has to be ruthless and grab a chance to kick Australia's one-day side while it's down. NRL silly season is about to explode. At midnight on Wednesday, as it ticks over to November 1, clubs are officially free to target off-contract players from rival clubs. Central to the madness will be Cooper Cronk and the Sydney Roosters. Cronk, who incredibly played out the Roosters’ grand final win with a broken shoulder, is off-contract and would be 36 by the time the 2020 season starts. This may well be his last season and that would bring the best available playmakers roaring into calculations as Roosters recruits. They include Cameron Munster, Shaun Johnson, Mitchell Moses, Corey Norman and Luke Brooks. Munster and Brooks were the Dally M five-eighth and halfback of the year respectively last season. More than 150 players will be up for grabs across the NRL, from superstars to battlers. Here is the full list, and where some key names may end up. BRISBANE BRONCOS Off-contract: Patrick Carrigan, George Fai, Alex Glenn, Joe Ofahengaue, Tevita Pangai Jr, Andre Savelio. The Broncos will hope to stop powerhouse young forward Tevita Pangai Jr from following Wayne Bennett to South Sydney after he decided to extend with the club for just one season (yet to become official). Decorated veteran Alex Glenn has declared his intention of re-signing with the Broncos with the aim of becoming a 300-game, one-club player. Joe Ofahengaue will be a key focus for Brisbane, having established himself as a beast off the bench last season. Controversial prop Matt Lodge remains unsigned for next season. Tevita Pangai Jr. (AAP) CANBERRA RAIDERS Off-contract: Brad Abbey, Luke Bateman, Setefano Hala, Ata Hingano, Liam Knight, Jordan Rapana, Sam Williams. New Zealand Test winger Jordan Rapana will be Canberra’s priority signing, despite having a rocky 2018 campaign. Young Kiwi playmaker Ata Hingano finds himself on the back foot to secure a new deal after copping a six-month shoulder injury in pre-season, giving journeyman Sam Williams a chance to impress. CANTERBURY-BANKSTOWN BULLDOGS Off-contract: Fa'amanu Brown, Danny Fualalo, Michael Lichaa, Rhyse Martin, Ofahiki Ogden, John Olive, Francis Tualau. The Bulldogs’ salary cap remains in dire straits; club boss Andrew Hill has claimed they will not be in the position to chase any notable recruits until the 2021 season. Having already shed Aaron Woods and Moses Mbye mid-season this year, the Dogs now face losing David Klemmer to Newcastle and Kieran Foran has been linked with a return to Manly alongside Des Hasler. CRONULLA SHARKS Off-contract: Kurt Capewell, Sosaia Feki, Paul Gallen, Wade Graham, Aaron Gray, Valentine Holmes, Billy Magoulias, Toby Rudolf, Ava Seumanufagai, Scott Sorensen, Cruz Topai-Aveai, Braden Uele. Valentine Holmes may slip through Cronulla’s fingers for reasons largely beyond their control, with the Test star eyeing off a move home to Townsville with the Cowboys. The Sharks have offered to make him the highest-paid player in their history, with a reported five-year, $4 million deal. Wade Graham is coming off an injury-hit season but remains highly valued, while Paul Gallen is expected to retire after next season. Hooker James Segeyaro is unsigned for next season and is unlikely to remain at the club; almost joining Wests Tigers but now linked with the Bulldogs and Knights. Valentine Holmes. (AAP) GOLD COAST TITANS Off-contract: Jesse Arthars, Michael Gordon, Ryley Jacks, Brenko Lee, Jack Stockwell. The Titans have three spots left in their 30-man squad for next season and are in a holding pattern when it comes to a halves partner for highly-paid young star Ash Taylor. Ryley Jacks may earn himself a new deal if he impresses, or the Titans could chase a bigger name. MANLY-WARRINGAH SEA EAGLES Off-contract: Manase Fainu, Jack Gosiewski, Trent Hodkinson, Brad Parker, Lloyd Perrett, Toafofoa Sipley, Kelepi Tanginoa, Jorge Taufua, Joel Thompson, Dylan Walker, Frank Winterstein, Matthew Wright. Dylan Walker headlines Manly’s off-contract list, though there have been whispers linking him with a return to South Sydney. The Sea Eagles have an existing headache in strongman forward Marty Taupau, contracted until 2020 but rumoured to want a move to the Sydney Roosters; while he’s also been linked to the Bulldogs. Young centre Moses Suli remains without a contract for 2019 after a difficult season in which he went from Wests Tigers to the Bulldogs to Manly – all in a matter of weeks. MELBOURNE STORM Off-contract: Patrick Kaufusi, Cameron Munster, Joe Stimson, Christian Welch Munster, now one of the NRL’s best players despite a nightmare 2018 grand final, is the big prize for Melbourne and they are expected to retain his services despite interest from North Queensland. The Storm will be eager to keep GF forwards Christian Welch and Joe Stimson. A contract extension for captain Cameron Smith to play on into 2019 is dragging out but will surely be done. Cameron Munster. (AAP) NEW ZEALAND WARRIORS Off-contract: Blake Ayshford, James Gavet, Shaun Johnson, Solomone Kata, Karl Lawton, Issac Luke, Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad, Agnatius Paasi, Ligi Sao, Lewis Soosemea, Jazz Tevaga, Joseph Vuna. The Warriors finally retained feisty hooker Issac Luke on a one-year extension for 2019, meaning his future is immediately thrown back into doubt, off the back of strong interest from Newcastle this year. NZ Test halfback Shaun Johnson is the key signing, with Wests Tigers already announcing themselves as an interested rival club. The Eels, Broncos, Roosters and Raiders may well join that list. NEWCASTLE KNIGHTS Off-contract: Jamie Buhrer, Lachlan Fitzgibbon, Slade Griffin, Shaun Kenny-Dowall. Strong back-rower Lachlan Fitzgibbon is highly rated at the Knights and will be a priority re-signing. Former Kiwi Test star Shaun Kenny-Dowall has enjoyed his time in Newcastle and will hope to earn an extension. Big-hearted hooker Slade Griffin will get precious little chance to impress in 2019, coming off a fourth major knee surgery and given little chance of seeing NRL footy. NORTH QUEENSLAND COWBOYS Off-contract: Carlin Anderson, Kurt Baptiste, Ben Barba, Logan Bayliss-Brow, Scott Bolton, Javid Bowen, Gavin Cooper, Reuben Cotter, Tom Gilbert, Ben Hampton, Coen Hess, Corey Jensen, Ethan Lowe, Te Maire Martin, Gideon Mosby-Gela, Justin O'Neill, Matthew Scott, Murray Taulagi, Enari Tuala, Kurt Wiltshire. The Cowboys will free up a solid chunk of salary cap for 2020, with coach Paul Green expecting rep forwards Matt Scott and Gavin Cooper to retire. Big Origin forward Coen Hess will be a priority for extension, while Te Maire Martin will need to impress quickly alongside Michael Morgan to convince the Cowboys he deserves a longer-term commitment. Former Dally M Medallist Ben Barba is coming off a Man of Steel season in the Super League and will attract (wary) interest if his form again spikes. Ben Barba, playing for St Helens. (AAP) PARRAMATTA EELS Off-contract: Daniel Alvaro, Andrew Davey, Bevan French, Clinton Gutherson, Josh Hoffman, Greg Leleisiuao, Manu Ma'u, Reed Mahoney, Tim Mannah, Tepai Moeroa, Mitchell Moses, Corey Norman, Brad Takairangi. The Eels’ biggest name of all, Jarryd Hayne, is yet to get a contract for 2019, though a report claims the club is willing to offload Michael Jennings to keep him from interested rivals such as Wests Tigers. Co-captain Clint Gutherson and tough forward Manu Ma’u will be priority re-signings, while contract negotiations for modestly-performed big names such as Mitchell Moses, Corey Norman and Tepai Moeroa will be fascinating. PENRITH PANTHERS Off-contract: Jed Cartwright, Wayde Egan, James Fisher-Harris, Tim Grant, Jack Hetherington, Sione Katoa, Sam McKendry. The Panthers have already done their big business in the retention and recruitment market, re-signing NSW Origin halfback Nathan Cleary long-term and welcoming back his father, Ivan, as coach. Their sights will now turn to retaining New Zealand Test forward James Fisher Harris, while luckless prop Sam McKendry is coming back from a third ACL tear. SOUTH SYDNEY RABBITOHS Off-contract: Dean Britt, George Burgess, Thomas Burgess, Braidon Burns, Damien Cook, Joshua Cook, Jacob Gagan, Campbell Graham, Dean Hawkins, Mawene Hiroti, Matt McIlwrick, Cameron Murray, Mark Nicholls, Bayley Sironen, Lucky Ta'avale, Siosifa Talakai, Tevita Tatola, Tyrone Taukamo, Connor Tracey, Kyle Turner. Having earned NSW Origin and Test honours in 2018, Damien Cook is reportedly seeking $800,000 per season for a new deal and wants to stay with the Rabbitohs. Other top priorities are the Burgess twins and young-gun forward Cameron Murray, while Dean Britt is another who impressed last season. Kyle Turner is free to look elsewhere and may land in the Super League. Damien Cook (centre). (AAP) ST GEORGE ILLAWARRA DRAGONS Off-contract: Matthew Dufty, Jai Field, James Graham, Josh Kerr, Jeremy Latimore, Blake Lawrie, Joe Lovodua, Kurt Mann, Steven Marsters, Darren Nicholls, Reece Robson, Tristan Sailor, Tariq Sims. James Graham has been an invaluable recruit for the Dragons and must decide whether to play on, or return to the Super League. Tariq Sims will be a priority re-signing after finally earning his NSW Origin debut in 2018. Lively fullback Matt Dufty is in the gun, according to The Mole, and may even be offloaded for 2019 due to concerns about his workrate. SYDNEY ROOSTERS Off-contract: Mitchell Aubusson, Cooper Cronk, Joshua Curran, Dylan Napa, Zane Tetevano, Sitili Tupouniua. Cooper Cronk will likely be asked for a decision on his future early in the season, with the Roosters able to factor in his $1 million salary when chasing recruits if the champion halfback intends to retire, leaving a spot alongside Clive Churchill Medallist and new Test five-eighth Luke Keary. Mitchell Aubusson and Zane Tetevano are quality contributors who can be retained, while Dylan Napa could attract serious rival interest – potentially from Newcastle if it’s enormous bid for David Klemmer doesn’t come off. Napa has also been linked to the Bulldogs. WESTS TIGERS Off-contract: Josh Aloiai, Luke Brooks, Michael Chee-Kam, Robbie Farah, Mahe Fonua, Tyson Gamble, Luke Garner, Chris Lawrence, Jacob Liddle, Benji Marshall, Sam McIntyre, Thomas Mikaele, Robbie Rochow, Dylan Smith, Corey Thompson.

Steve,Cummings,1859,https://www.americanbanker.com/news/mufg-poaches-top-technology-exec-from-us-bancorp,"MUFG Americas has a new chief information and operations officer. MUFG said Wednesday that it has hired Christopher Higgins for the role. Higgins will report to Steve Cummings, president and CEO, and serve on the company’s executive committee. He starts on Dec. 10. Higgins most recently served as chief information officer at U.S. Bancorp, where he was in charge of enterprise architecture, application development and testing, among other responsibilities. He joined the $464.6 billion-asset Minneapolis company in 2012 from Bank of America, where he worked for 18 years in information management. In a press release, Cummings praised Higgins as “an ideal fit” for MUFG Americas, the U.S. division of the global banking giant Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group in Tokyo. “His technical expertise and proven track record in leading forward-looking technology and operations initiatives that are customer-focused will be an enormous asset to our team as we evolve our business model,” Cummings said. In his new role, Higgins will replace Chris Perretta, who plans to leave the company by the end of 2018, according to a spokesman. Perretta joined MUFG in April 2016. The announcement comes as MUFG looks to embark on a U.S. expansion, at a time when its parent company is facing a stagnant economy at home.

The teams played over 3 days 26/27/28 October and experienced all weather conditions. Beautiful warm sunshine on first day followed by a cloudy and wet afternoon on day 2 and ending on a sunny/cloudy but cold Sunday. The 3-2-1 involves playing 6 ends of Trips followed by 6 ends of Pairs followed by 6 ends of Singles matches. Each team played 5 matches with the top two in each Group going into the semi-finals. The final was played between Betty Anderson, Stewart Beattie (El Cid) and Velia Wood (Javea) against Sue & Graham Mills and Dave Sparrow from Bonalba (assisted by Norman Burgess on Day 1. Bonalba had won the Trips, The Pairs went to Betty and Stewart and the Singles between Velia and Graham ended in a draw but the guys from Bonalba had the overall shot difference to take top prize. El Cid Captain Stewart Beattie presented the generous prize money to the Winning teams from Bonalba and thanked them for the support they always give to our competitions. A big thankyou was also given to Direkt Optik for their generous sponsorship of this event. Stewart said a well done to everyone who played or attended and to our Umpire Tony Carroll. Special mention to a number of fairly new bowlers taking part in this competition for the first time and caused some early Halloween scares by taking a few scalps and gaining good experience. Thanks also goes to Steve Cummings for his work on the programme, Pat Arnett for her efforts raising 60 euros doing the football cards and to Sara and the Team from El Cid who kept us going for 3 days with super bowlers menu and drinks.

Bob,Diamond,1858,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-6335227/CITY-DIARY-Journalists-dont-welcome-embattled-Patisserie-Valerie.html,"By The dastardly Mr Deedes Published: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 | Updated: 18:23 EST, 30 October 2018 1 View comments Patisserie Valerie chairman Luke Johnson's has a noted aversion to the press Patisserie Valerie wasn't allowing journalists to attend today's emergency meeting until a U-turn late yesterday evening. This was the result of a 'misunderstanding', we are assured, rather than chairman Luke Johnson's noted aversion to the press. Journalists in the embattled entrepreneur's company are about as welcome as Sir Philip Green at a #MeToo gathering, which is odd. Until recently, Johnson penned a jaunty newspaper column which took frequent pot-shots at other businesses. Several of his close family, including father Paul and brother Daniel, are also prominent proponents of our trade. Theresa May is right not to back knee-jerk demands for Sir Philip Green to be stripped of his knighthood. David Cameron came to regret bowing to the mob over ex-Royal Bank of Scotland chief Fred Goodwin's defrocking. Green's ill-deserved gong, awarded by Tony Blair needless to say, serves as a future reminder of how impressionable prime ministers can become spellbound by flashy billionaires. It's best left in place pour encourager les autres. Bob Diamond is to be welcomed as keynote speaker at the Financial Times's US banking forum in New York next week. Since being ousted from Barclays six years ago, Bob, 67, refuses to hide his light under a bushel. His African investment vehicle Atlas Mara is showing steady growth, while last year's acquisition of brokers Panmure Gordon gives him a foothold once more in London. 'There are no second acts in American lives,' F Scott Fitzgerald opined. But then he never met beaming Bob Diamond. Former investment banker Ian Blackford, now the SNP's ample Westminster chief, humbly referred to himself as a 'simple crofter' in the Commons while attacking Philip Hammond's budget. The Conservatives' Greg Hands retorted: 'I had a career in the City and I don't recall him being a simple crofter at that time. 'Maybe that was his codename on his Bloomberg terminal as he was buying and selling financial assets.' Blackford squirmed like a constipated Dowager. The enduring success of British noodle chain Wagamama, which is being bought by The Restaurant Group for £559million, continues to baffle the Japanese. Out east, Wagamama translates as 'spoiled brat'. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

Michael,Gordon,1856,https://www.heraldtribune.com/entertainmentlife/20181030/music-review-music-traditions-grow-as-two-young-ensembles-merge,"ensemblenewSRQ opens new season of contemporary classical music with Boston-based HUB New Music A funny thing happened as I was returning home after the first concert of the ensemblenewSRQ season, featuring collaborations with musicians from the Boston-based HUB New Music. The concert had concluded with an excellent performance of the 2008 composition by the iconic American composer Steve Reich, a sweeping survey of themes expressing both traditional and modern techniques. When I entered my car, the radio played an orchestral concerto by Handel, a performance sounding very much like a continuation of the Reich. No, it wasn’t a case of artistic theft. Rather, it seems to have been a case of great minds thinking alike. The fact that this performance, the final item of the live concert, was so gripping and well expressed by the lengthy cheers from the audience may be proof that certain expressions are universal. The ensemble, in effect a double chamber-music orchestra, performed with terrific skill and coordination, qualities which were not always demonstrated in the first three items on the program, compositions that were not of the same quality. Beginning with Michael Gordon’s “acdc,” written in 1996, we heard a chamber ensemble composed of Francesca Arnone, flute; David Dziardziel, clarinet; Kate Dreyfuss, violin; Natalie Helm, cello; and Conor Harnick, piano. Anna Clyne wrote “1997” in 2008. On this occasion, the performance by HUB founder Michael Avitabile, bass flute; David Dziardziel, bass clarinet; Kate Dreyfuss, violin; and Jesse Christeson, cello, was at times edgy but always solid. More substantial, if not always convincing, was Nina C. Young’s “Rising Tide,” presented with confidence by Avitabile on flute; Laura Petty, clarinet and bass clarinet; Scott Crawford, percussion; Conor Hanick, piano; Samantha Bennett, violin; Steve Laraia, viola; Christeson on cello and George Nickson as conductor. The gem of the program, as noted, was the Reich “Double Sextet,” performed by entire ensemble, the piece that sent me and my car radio home in joy. Choose the plan that's right for you.

Phillip,Frost,1855,https://www.southflorida.com/theater-and-arts/art/sf-art-basel-2018-early-buzz-miami-wynwood-20181029-story.html,"We may be a month away from Art Basel Miami Beach, the contemporary-art mess of tented art fairs and celebrity-studded parties, but big events are already beckoning from every pocket of Greater Miami. So if you’re booking travel plans for December or — more impressive — you’re making a day-by-day schedule, you’re in luck: We have the early word on Art Basel week’s five buzziest gatherings. But first, the obvious: The granddaddy art fair Art Basel Miami Beach returns Dec. 6-9 to the Miami Beach Convention Center (1901 Convention Center Drive) with 268 galleries from 34 countries. Some 20-odd satellite art fairs will also be competing for your Basel bucks. Last year, a Kanye West bounce house visited Wynwood. A pop-up Museum of Ice Cream with environmentally unfriendly sprinkles lured South Florida’s candy fiends, including this reporter. But this year belongs to British street-art rascal Banksy and interactive art tech. Here are the Art Basel events vying to become your new favorite Instagram obsessions. Opens Nov. 15 at 736 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; $17-$24; Artechouse.com Billing itself as a “digital art immersion” exhibit, Artechouse (pronounced “art-tech-house”) is like a holodeck from “Star Trek.” Visitors can touch, draw on and move around art elements inside 10 interactive rooms covered in dancing digital projections. This 15,000-square-foot permanent art space will open to the public Nov. 15, two weeks ahead of Art Basel, with the exhibit “XYZT Abstract Landscapes” by French digital artists Adrien M and Claire B. Their installations include “Kinetic Sand,” in which users push grains of sand on a touchscreen; and “Field of Vectors,” digital “grass” that visitors can manipulate with their feet. Through Dec. 9 at Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; free; Frost.FIU.edu Here’s the most glaring statistic buried amid the many incarceration letters, poems, essays and notes wallpapering the Frost’s art gallery: 2.2 million people sit in U.S. prisons and jails, a 500 percent increase since the late 1970s, according to the nonprofit advocacy center the Sentencing Project. The letters come from artist Hank Willis Thomas (and his nonprofit For Freedoms project) and Baz Dreisinger, who spent years teaching in prisons and collected hundreds of inmates’ handwritten and typed messages on display. Opens Dec. 1 at Magic City Studios, 6301 NE Fourth Ave., Miami; $35.99-$49.99; BanksyExhibit.com Loyal followers of Banksy’s shenanigans will remember his stance on charging fans to see his art. (He flat out refuses, which is why his stenciled-graffiti works are all on public walls.) So it should come as no surprise that this touring show of 80 Banksy paintings, sculptures, screen prints and early-career photographs wasn’t exactly authorized by the British icon. The globetrotting exhibit instead comes from Steve Lazarides, the elusive street artist’s former agent, who tapped private collectors to loan out their Banksy originals. Miss it during Art Basel week? You’ll have time: The show will close Feb. 28. Dec. 5-9 at Art Miami, 1 Miami Herald Plaza, NE 14th St., Miami; $35-$275; 305-517-7977 or ArtMiami.com Forget leaping into pools full of multicolored plastic sprinkles at the Museum of Ice Cream: Artist Peter Anton has been building towering odes to chocolate and candy for years. During Art Basel 2012, Anton debuted “Sugar and Gomorrah,” a theme park-style attraction allowing visitors to ride a roller coaster through a maze of sugary sculptures, nude models and the faux ruins of a destroyed city. Anton’s newest palate-teasing monument to sweets is “Choco Tower,” a 10-foot-tall stack of five chocolate bonbons, with two chocolates half eaten. The 1,000-pound sculpture will appear in the Galerie von Braunbehrens’ booth at Art Miami. 8 p.m. Dec. 7-8 at Adrienne Arsht Center, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; $42.52-$213.72; 305-949-6722 or ArshtCenter.org A ballet starring prima ballerina Diana Vishneva that will premiere during Art Basel week, “Sleeping Beauty Dreams” is a dance-meets-art twist on the classic fairy tale.

Andrew,Davis,1852,https://news.uga.edu/synovus-scholarships/,"Scholarships will support first-year students from across the state. Synovus has established five need-based scholarships for incoming University of Georgia students intending to major in business. Part of the Georgia Commitment Scholarship Program, the scholarships will be awarded to students across Georgia beginning in fall 2019. The Synovus Georgia Commitment Scholarships are renewable for up to four years and will then be awarded in perpetuity. Synovus’ commitment to these students will extend beyond financial support, as the company will connect them with possible internships, networking opportunities, mentors in the banking industry and more. “Synovus is proud to partner with the University of Georgia to support the Georgia Commitment Scholarship Program,” said Alison Dowe, chief communications and corporate responsibility officer at Synovus. “We are thrilled that five incoming first-year students from across the state will benefit from Synovus’ scholarships beginning next fall. Our investment in the GCS Program also represents a lasting investment in the state of Georgia, and we look forward to seeing the impact of these scholarships for many years to come.” Through the GCS Program, the UGA Foundation will match, dollar-for-dollar, each of the five scholarships created by Synovus. Since the launch of this program in January 2017, more than $21 million has been raised to establish 322 new need-based scholarships. As the program continues, the university anticipates that between 400 and 600 new, need-based scholarships will be endowed. Increasing scholarship support for students is a key priority of the university’s Commit to Georgia Campaign. “One of the most effective ways to change lives is through education, and the Georgia Commitment Scholarship Program allows students across the state who are facing financial hardship to afford a quality education at UGA,” said Kelly Kerner, UGA vice president for development and alumni relations. “We are appreciative of Synovus’ ongoing commitment to our students and know that not only will these students’ lives be positively affected, but also those of their families.” In addition to their scholarship funding, Georgia Commitment Scholarship recipients will receive access to tutoring, academic coaching, networking opportunities, financial literacy workshops and student success workshops to better ensure their collegiate success. Synovus’ commitment to these students will also extend beyond just financial support, as the company looks to connect Georgia Commitment Scholars with internship opportunities, networking opportunities, mentors in the banking industry and more. “Synovus strives to focus on the communities we serve in three main areas: education, need-based opportunities, and health and wellness,” Dowe said. “We see our Georgia Commitment Scholarships as a way to address these areas in an innovative, effective way all across our state.”",0.0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806412,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Get Sport HD + Entertainment with no lock in contract and no iQ4 set up costs. Get Foxtel Sport. T&C’s Apply BRONCOS Pre-season training starts: November 24 Casualty ward: Anthony Milford (shoulder, Round 1), Andre Savelio (ACL, pre-season), Matt Gillett (neck, pre-season), Payne Haas (shoulder, Round 1), Jack Bird (sternum, pre-season), Jaydn Su’A (leg, pre-season), David Fifita (ankle, late pre-season), Andrew McCullough (finger, pre-season) What they need to work on: If they are sticking with the halves combination of Anthony Milford and Kodi Nikorima, a pre-season focus needs to be on defining both of their roles and developing that partnership. The Broncos really need to tighten up their defence too. There are too many lapses and they often find themselves losing their shape out wide. RAIDERS Pre-season training starts: November 1 Casualty ward: Jarrod Croker (knee cap, pre-season), Ata Hingano (shoulder, early rounds) What they need to work on: They lost 11 games by nine points or less, eight of which were by a converted try. Maybe Ricky Stuart should be looking into strategies to improve the mental toughness of his side, better preparing them for those arm wrestles. Their right edge defence has long been an issue too, with teams targeting Joey Leilua. So, that needs to be given special attention. BULLDOGS Pre-season training starts: November 1 Casualty ward: Josh Jackson (shoulder, late pre-season), Corey Harawira-Naera (groin, pre-season), Kerrod Holland (ankle, late pre-season), Kieran Foran (toe, pre-season), Raymond Faitala-Mariner (knee, pre-season), Marcelo Montoya (hamstring, pre-season), Adam Elliott (wrist, pre-season) What they need to work on: They lost key playmaker Moses Mbye (left the club) and Kieran Foran (injury) half way through 2018, so it was always going to be a struggle to find cohesion. But Lachlan Lewis was a revelation, and they have some quality young backs. If the spine can gel and work towards a solid game plan they’ll be competitive. SHARKS Pre-season training starts: November 26 Casualty ward: Wade Graham (ACL, early season), Jack Williams (pectoral, pre-season), Matt Moylan (shoulder, pre-season), Jason Bukuya (shoulder, pre-season), Josh Dugan (shoulder, pre-season) What they need to work on: Their left edge is the most dangerous attacking combination in the competition when Wade Graham is fit and firing. On the other side they need to replace the retired Luke Lewis (with either Scott Sorensen or Kurt Capewell), and if they can create a dynamic combination on that edge with Chad Townsend and Valentine Holmes they’ll be very hard to defend against. TITANS Pre-season training starts: November 5 Casualty ward: Dale Copley (hamstring, pre-season), Max King (shoulder, pre-season), Morgan Boyle (shoulder, pre-season), Michael Gordon (wrist, pre-season), Tyrone Roberts-Davis (neck, pre-season), AJ Brimson (shoulder, late pre-season) What they need to work on: Working on how best to inject rep star Tyrone Peachey into their side is a priority, as well as developing the young halves pairing of AJ Brimson and Ash Taylor. Peachey could help unlock the talent of his former teammate Bryce Cartwright, who at his best is a game-breaker. That should be a focus too. SEA EAGLES Pre-season training starts: November 5 Casualty ward: Apisai Koroisau (foot, pre-season), Curtis Sironen (ACL, pre-season), Lachlan Croker (ACL, early season) What they need to work on: Familiarising themselves with Des Hasler’s style of play after three seasons with Trent Barrett at the helm. And they’ll need to work on options on both sides of the ruck and not just through chief playmaker Daly Cherry-Evans. STORM Pre-season training starts: November 15 Casualty ward: Nelson Asofa-Solomona (ankle, pre-season) What they need to work on: Giving Brodie Croft their full backing and a proper opportunity to work on his combination with Cameron Munster. Because the three-man rotation implemented by Craig Bellamy in 2018 made the Storm look unusually clunky at times throughout the year. The spine will also have to get used to life without champion fullback Billy Slater. KNIGHTS Pre-season training starts: November 5 Casualty ward: Kalyn Ponga (ankle, pre-season), Nathan Ross (groin/hernia, late pre-season), Slade Griffin (ACL, mid-season), Tautau Moga (ACL, pre-season), Jacob Saifiti (shoulder, pre-season), Nathan Ross (groin, mid pre-season) What they need to work on: Nathan Brown’s side were the second worst defensive team in the competition behind the Sea Eagles in 2018, so they’ll need to tighten up in that area. Connor Watson’s transformation into a first grade five-eighth did not go as smoothly as the Knights would have hoped so they’ll need to put some work into his combination with Mitchell Pearce if they plan on sticking with him in the No.6 jersey. If not, and they opt to throw Kalyn Ponga into the halves, they will need to find a capable fullback. COWBOYS Pre-season training starts: November 5 Casualty ward: Michael Morgan (biceps, pre-season) What they need to work on: Developing new combinations. There’s plenty of change around the Cowboys’ key positions heading into 2019 with Ben Barba, Michael Morgan, Jake Clifford and Jake Granville set to form the new-look ‘spine’. There might be teething problems early, but there’s plenty of strike. EELS Pre-season training starts: November 1 Casualty ward: Josh Hoffman (shoulder, pre-season), Kaysa Pritchard (shoulder, Round 1), Nathan Brown (knee, pre-season), Blake Ferguson (broken leg, pre-season), Manu Ma’u (cheekbone, pre-season) What they need to work on: Everything. The Eels struggled big time in both attack and defence in 2018. They’ve made a couple of smart signings in Junior Paulo and Blake Ferguson, but if they don’t get a good start on 2019, pressure will mount on off-contract coach Brad Arthur. PANTHERS Pre-season training starts: November 12 Casualty ward: Nathan Cleary (ankle, pre-season), James Maloney (neck, pre-season), Dean Whare (broken arm, pre-season), Sam McKendry (ACL, early season), Dylan Edwards (shoulder, pre-season), Jarome Luai (ankle, pre-season) What they need to work on: Re-adjusting to coaching philosophy. Ivan Cleary is back and brings a different approach to what Anthony Griffin and even Cameron Ciraldo do, so the players will need to gel and get behind their coach to get the best possible start to the new season. RABBITOHS Pre-season training starts: November 12 Casualty ward: Adam Doueihi (ACL, mid-season) What they need to work on: Locking in their back row. The Rabbitohs’ are effectively without their starting edge forwards from 2018, with John Sutton still without a contract and Angus Crichton off to the Roosters. While Sutton is likely to re-sign, a spot is still open for someone to snatch. DRAGONS Pre-season training starts: November 5 Casualty ward: Gareth Widdop (shoulder, Round 1), Jack de Belin (ankle, pre-season), Paul Vaughan (foot, mid pre-season), Tariq Sims (knee, late pre-season), Euan Aitken (hamstring, pre-season), Jacob Host (shoulder, Round 1) What they need to work on: Addressing late-season fades. The Dragons always emerge from the pre-season one of the fittest teams, but they’ve developed a habit of falling away as finals approach. Player management is definitely one Paul McGregor and his high performance staff need to get a jump on. ROOSTERS Pre-season training starts: Mid-November Casualty ward: Cooper Cronk (scapula, late pre-season), Bernard Lewis (ACL, early season), Zane Tetevano (biceps, late pre-season), Angus Crichton (shoulder, pre-season) What they need to work on: Developing their right side combination. The defending premiers have picked up a pretty handy player in NSW Origin backrower Angus Crichton. They’ve also lost right winger Blake Ferguson, so that side of the park will need some attention this pre-season. WARRIORS Pre-season training starts: November 1 Casualty ward: Roger Tuivasa-Sheck (knee, pre-season), Issac Luke (shoulder, mid-season), Nathaniel Roache (back, pre-season) What they need to work on: Continuing to build on 2018. This year the Warriors took promising strides to becoming a more consistent team and made finals for the first time since 2011. Their squad is virtually the same bar the retirement of Simon Mannering and the acquisition of Leeson Ah Mau, so they should be aiming for a top four finish. WESTS TIGERS Pre-season training starts: November 15 Casualty ward: Josh Reynolds (shoulder, indefinite), Corey Thompson (ankle, pre-season), Robbie Rochow (hand, pre-season), Josh Aloiai (hand, pre-season) What they need to work on: Attack. The Tigers scored just 377 points in 2018, which was the second fewest in the competition this season, only three above wooden-spooners Parramatta.

Andrew,Davis,1849,https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2018/10/29/292304/up-a-creek-a-battle-over-consent,"Become a supportervia PressPatron Lake Hayes is a small lake in the Wakatipu Basin in Central Otago, in New Zealand's South Island. It is located close to the towns of Arrowtown and Queenstown. Photo: Bernard Spragg David Williams is Newsroom's South Island correspondent and investigative writer. environment Otago’s regional council stands accused of rubberstamping non-notified water consents for a new hotel planned near Queenstown without adequately considering the effects on a nearby scenic lake. David Williams reports. After years of being lobbied to increase its efforts in Queenstown, last year the Otago Regional Council got the message. It stood accused of dragging its feet on multiple issues, including public transport, wilding pine control and water monitoring, while squirrelling money away for a new Dunedin headquarters. There was fighting talk about creating a unitary authority. The pressure told and the floodgates of ratepayer money opened. The council agreed to re-open a council office in Queenstown and subsidise public transport in the Wakatipu Basin. Cash was splashed on water, too, with $100,000 for research on lake snow and a promise to work with communities on lake restoration work, including Lake Hayes, near Arrowtown, one of the country’s most photographed lakes. This year, the council announced a decade-long plan to spend millions more on water monitoring, including installing a buoy at Lake Hayes. That delighted the Friends of Lake Hayes Society, a group that has been pushing for a buoy for years. But problems persist. Over the previous year, algal blooms caused the lake to be closed to swimmers and elevated E.coli levels were discovered. In June last year, dead trout were found in Mill Creek, Lake Hayes’ main tributary. In August, the Otago Regional Council’s technical committee discussed three possible ways – flushing, capping and destratification, according to the Otago Daily Times – to improve Lake Hayes. Now, there’s concern the momentum towards an environmental clean-up will be lost, or reversed, because of a large hotel planned on the banks of Mill Creek. Quiet consideration As regional councillors were publicly discussing ways to clean up the lake, the council’s staff were quietly considering consents for a proposed 380-room hotel, next to Arrowtown’s Millbrook Resort, in an area known as Waterfall Park. Developer Winton Group – through subsidiary Waterfall Park Developments Ltd – dubs Waterfall Park a forgotten treasure, home to a 30-metre waterfall that’s out of public view. The company wants to build a four-plus-star hotel on the site in four blocks. The complex will also feature two restaurants, a bar, conference centre, wedding chapel and wellness centre. Heritage buildings at the adjacent Ayrburn Farm, settled by Scotsman William Paterson in 1862, will be restored and repurposed. (Waterfall Park Development Ltd has asked the council to re-zone a parcel of land next to the planned hotel so it can build up to 200 houses. Other Winton Group projects in Queenstown include Bridesdale Farm, a subdivision fast-tracked by the local council, and the high-end Lake’s Edge subdivision, adjoining the Hilton Queenstown Resort & Spa complex.) Last month, the regional council approved various work to be done on Mill Creek. The consents weren’t publicly notified because the council assessed the effects of the work as minor. Council chief executive Sarah Gardner is quick to point out that the Department of Conservation (DOC) – which has statutory responsibilities for native aquatic species – gave written, unconditional approval to the consents. (This reliance on DOC as an environmental backstop mirrors another controversial consent approval, for the extension of a Queenstown skifield, that is now subject to a judicial review.) Fish and Game and iwi demanded conditions, including undertaking the work outside of fish spawning. The work approved at Waterfall Park includes widening, deepening and re-shaping the creek, creating ponds through a series of boulder weirs. Flood-protection walls will be built, as well as building seven bridges and two culverts. Winton Group, a company associated with Chris and Michaela Meehan, plans sediment and erosion controls and will temporarily divert the creek during widening work. Revegetation and ecological work is also planned. (Winton Group couldn’t be reached for comment.) The regional council’s own analysis shows Mill Creek and Lake Hayes already exceed some limits or targets for water quality, such as phosphate, turbidity and total nitrogen. For other contaminants, such as nitrate and E.coli, there’s little or no headroom for the water bodies to take more. If Lake Hayes’ poor state is to be reversed, contaminants from within its catchment, which starts on the slopes of Coronet Peak, need to be reduced. The main culprit for adding nitrates and phosphorus to the lake is Mill Creek. Increasing development, population growth and land-use intensification won’t help – especially as stormwater from Waterfall Park’s hotel complex will flow into the creek and, eventually, Lake Hayes. “We believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” – Andrew Davis Friends of Lake Hayes Society committee member Andrew Davis, who works for a global investment management firm, accuses the regional council of being cavalier by granting non-notified consents in a sensitive environment. Speaking personally and not on behalf of the committee, he says: “Lake Hayes is one the region’s most precious resources, we need our regulators to start affording the lake the protection it rightly deserves.” Davis points to problems earlier this year with stormwater runoff at Wanaka subdivisions Northlake (another Winton Group development) and Hikuwai as a sign that new developments are struggling to prevent sediment run-off. The district’s chief engineer, Ulrich Glasner, told the Otago Daily Times in May the performance of some stormwater infrastructure, particularly in new developments, did not meet the council’s expectations. Davis tells Newsroom: “With the current Waterfall Park development we believe there is a high likelihood that sediment will enter Mill Creek and ultimately be deposited in Lake Hayes.” Council boss Gardner says the effects of the Waterfall Park proposal were assessed as minimal. “It is correct that if sediment enters Mill Creek, the receiving water body will be Lake Hayes.” Public notification of consents isn’t mandatory, she says, and the effects on the Friends of Lake Hayes “from the specific activities considered” were assessed to be less than minor. As the effects of the applications were considered “minimal”, Gardner says further assessment of the impact on Lake Hayes wasn’t required. She adds: “We have not assessed the effects of all activities that may be undertaken in the development.” Increased pollution in Lake Hayes could lead to more frequent closures for recreational activities and increase the cost of restoration efforts, which already seem likely to run into the millions of dollars. Inevitably, the clean-up costs will largely fall on the local community. Friends of Lake Hayes has made a submission to Queenstown’s district council, which is considering Winton Group’s resource consent for the hotel development. Regional councils deal with environmental-based consents, such as those affecting air and water, while district councils manage land-based subdivisions and developments. Waterfall Park Developments originally lodged consents jointly to both councils, asking them to be publicly notified and heard together. The regional council (ORC) “staff recommending report”, written on August 30, notes, however: “On advice from the original job manager, the two consent processes were unbundled as it was considered that the ORC consents could be processed on a non-notified basis.” To the district council, the society challenges the developer’s claims that the in-stream work, stretching for hundreds of metres of Mill Creek, will have a less than minor effect on the immediate environment and downstream. (The actual channel works extend for about 135m.) During construction, the submission says, there’ll be increased sediment and nutrient discharges into Lake Hayes. “We are of the view that in spite of all the assurances provided by the applicant there is a significant risk that designs and structures may not perform to design when tested by the very powerful and unpredictable natural forces that are applied during high-intensity rainfall events.” (An ecological peer review, by 4Sight Consulting, says with appropriate controls, and if best practice is followed, sediment discharges from construction work “can be expected to be minimised”.) Vulnerable fish Some of those most affected by the Mill Creek works are native galaxiid fish, koaro, that live in Lake Hayes but spawn in Mill Creek. Slowing the water flow and creating pleasing-looking pools will help trout – something Fish and Game endorses. But the koaro, classified as “at-risk, declining”, prefers fast-flowing riffles. The developer’s ecological expert said the potential effects on native fish are considered to be minor. DOC’s Wakatipu operations manager Geoff Owen tells Newsroom the department’s approval was given on the basis that the works would improve the outlook for koaro in the long term. That would be done through native riparian plantings, culverts allowing for fish passage, weed control and a condition to avoid works in the stream during the koaro spawning period. “DOC believes the application as it stands would result in habitat that would be better for native fish,” Owen says. However, an ecological peer review of the hotel proposal provided to regional and district councils seems to contradict that view. The 4Sight Consulting report, completed in August, says while the works are unlikely to have a significant effect on koaro, the loss of preferred habitats “have not been adequately considered by the application”. “The installation of three of the six proposed aesthetic weirs will ... result in the loss of areas of preferred instream habitat for the ‘at risk’ koaro and may impact potential spawning habitats. The weirs will result in additional habitat for brown trout, a predator of koaro.” To offset the habitat loss, the 4Sight report says a riparian planting plan should consider enhancing the remaining habitats preferred by the fish. (Regional council boss Gardner says the “localised impacts” of habitat loss will be mitigated and monitored by consent conditions. Some koaro habitat will be enhanced and protected through activities like riparian planting.) Newsroom asked the department to comment on this apparent contradiction but no reply was received by publication deadline. In August, Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage introduced an amendment bill to Parliament aimed at better protecting indigenous freshwater fish, most of which are found nowhere else in the world. Acknowledged problems with protecting threatened, endangered and vulnerable fish species include water management by regional councils and council enforcement over habitat destruction.

In between, the TSO offers much-loved music by Beethoven, John Adams, and Ravel-in a program entitled Boléro-and presents the poignant Britten War Requiem, coinciding with the centennial of Armistice Day. On November 3 (at 2:00pm and 4:00pm), guest conductor Sameer Patel returns to the TSO for The Mozart Experience. A recipient of three consecutive Solti Foundation U.S. Career Assistance Awards, Patel is currently the Associate Conductor of the San Diego Symphony. With the participation of the Magic Circle Mime Company, this concert is a fun-filled and educational journey through the life of W. A. Mozart. The program also spotlights young violinist Duncan McDougall, a winner of the 2017/18 Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra (TSYO) Concerto Competition. On November 8 & 10, the TSO commemorates the centennial of Armistice Day with Britten War Requiem-a tribute to all those who have given their lives in defence of freedom. For the world première of his War Requiem, Britten's plan was to bring soloists from Great Britain, Germany, and Russia together on stage as a sign of the reconciliation between once-hostile countries. It is in the same spirit that the TSO has invited Russian soprano Tatiana Pavlovskaya, British tenor Toby Spence, and Canadian-German baritone Russell Braun, joined by the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and the Toronto Children's Chorus under the direction of Bramwell Tovey, to perform this moving work. The November 10 evening includes a free pre-concert performance by The TSO Chamber Soloists at 6:45pm. On November 21, 23 & 24, Finnish conductor John Storgårds is back on the TSO podium for Boléro. The TSO reprises City Noir, John Adams's jazz-tinged evocation of 1940s Hollywood cinema. Kirill Gerstein, praised by The New York Times as ""one of the most respected pianists of his generation,"" takes centre stage for Beethoven's lyrical Piano Concerto No. 4, before the Orchestra delivers Ravel's great orchestral showpiece, Boléro. On November 25 (3:00pm), the Toronto Symphony Youth Orchestra (TSYO) bring their passionate music-making to the George Weston Recital Hall (Toronto Centre for the Arts). For the first public performance of the season, the young musicians and their new conductor, Simon Rivard, deliver the delightful overture to Candide and Symphonic Dances from West Side Story by Bernstein, as well as Brahms's tongue-in-cheek Academic Festival Overture. The program also includes Debussy's beautiful Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. On November 28, 29, 30 & December 2, the TSO sets the scene for the holiday season with Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker & More. Korean-Canadian Earl Lee-the TSO's former RBC Resident Conductor-conducts this year's tribute to the beloved Russian composer, which features some of Tchaikovsky's theatrical and symphonic music, including selections from the ballet The Nutcracker, complemented by the passionate and tempestuous Fourth Symphony. The TSO Season Presenting Sponsor is BMO Financial Group. The Mozart Experience is sponsored by Great-West Life, London Life and Canada Life.

""The Crown's position will be that the accused has put his mental capacity for criminal intent into issue, as well as the fact that the accused has raised the issue of fitness, based primarily on his utterances in court,"" she said. In court Monday, the 48-year-old Raymond motioned to Dickson that he wished to speak again. Wearing an orange jump suit and oversized grey sweatshirt, Raymond stood and addressed the court, saying he had tried to fire his lawyer, Nathan Gorham, four times and ""now it's going to be five times."" ""What happened in the past is something else, but right now I know what's been going on,"" he said. Another defence lawyer, Spencer MacInnis, asked the court for a bit of time to prepare for the Crown's application. Dickson will hear the application next Monday for a psychological assessment that Blunston said will take 60 days. The lawyers and family members of the victims refused comment as they left the courthouse. Raymond is alleged to have fired from his apartment window with a long gun, killing two civilians as they loaded a car for a trip, and two police officers who responded to the scene. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. Last Monday, Raymond had interrupted his lawyer to address the judge. ""Your honour, may I interrupt? I have something really important to say, I have a statement to make,"" Raymond said during that appearance. ""I should not have been in prison at all. I am not guilty due to at least temporary insanity. The evidence is all right there ... it shows exactly what has happened. I am not guilty."" Former friends and acquaintances of Raymond have offered varying memories of the accused murderer, ranging from a boy who retreated into video games, a pleasant supermarket co-worker and an increasingly isolated loner in recent years.

This year it was held Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018 (www.thememorial.ca). It is an all-inclusive day to honour and express appreciation for the dedication of police and peace officers across Canada. As of 2018, there are 865 fallen officers engraved on the honour roll tablets near Parliament Hill, which includes the RCMP. This year there were six Canadian police officers who died in the line of duty that were honoured. Among them were Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, Victoria police Const. Ian Jordan, Abbotsford police Const. John Davidson, Nova Scotia RCMP Const. Francis Deschenes and Surete du Quebec Const. Jacques Ostigny. This is the Canadian Memorial Day to reflect on the important role police and peace officers play in Canadian society and to honour those that have made the ultimate sacrifice in carrying out their duties. Police from across Canada, as well as their families and the public, gather to reflect and show support. Let us support and show respect to our local and national police on this officially proclaimed day.

Richard,McVey,1847,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/can-a-democrat-win-in-west-virginias-trump-country,"West Virginia was once a Democratic stronghold, but its political landscape has shifted solidly Republican in recent elections: in 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton there by 42%. But now, a Democratic congressional candidate who himself voted for Trump is resonating with the state’s residents. Yamiche Alcindor reports on Richard Ojeda and a surprisingly close contest. Judy Woodruff: Now a look at a surprisingly competitive congressional race unfolding in West Virginia, where a Democrat is making noise in a district President Trump dominated. Yamiche Alcindor has this report. Yamiche Alcindor: A Democrat in Trump country, and some considering a leap of faith. At Bridge Day in Fayetteville, West Virginia, tens of thousands of people came out to watch base jumpers, and talk about a surprisingly competitive race. Democratic State Senator Richard Ojeda and state delegate Carol Miller, a Republican, are fighting to win a seat in Congress once thought to be solidly red. In 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in this district by 42 percent. Richard Ojeda: We're going nothing but the filthy rich and the dirt poor. Yamiche Alcindor: But Ojeda, a 24-year Army veteran, has managed to make this race a nail-biter. Man: I'm a UMWA man. We need you. Yamiche Alcindor: Miller, a businesswoman who owns several car dealerships and a bison farm, declined to be Interviewed. But in ads like this, she stressed her connection with the president. President Donald Trump: A woman that works very hard for you, Carol Miller. Yamiche Alcindor: At Bridge Day, that endorsement seemed to carry significant weight. Richard McVey: It would be Carol Miller, and that's a vote for Mr. Donald Trump. That's my entire reason for voting for her. Yamiche Alcindor: Others were unhappy with the direction of the Democratic Party. Rick Kirk: They left me. They left me, my morals. I think they're getting very weak on the Second Amendment. I'm pro-life 100 percent. Yamiche Alcindor: That, in part, has led to the shifting political landscape in West Virginia. West Virginia was once a Democratic stronghold. But Republicans have made major inroads here. Now Democrats are wondering if Ojeda can be a model for taking back control in this state and others across the country. Richard Ojeda: We have got to get back to what the Democratic Party really was about. We create opportunities for those who live in poverty. Yamiche Alcindor: At rallies and in Facebook videos, Ojeda rails against corporate money and lobbyists. Richard Ojeda: They're bootlickers, ladies and gentlemen. Yamiche Alcindor: He's won the backing of the state's largest coal and teachers unions. He also supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and legalizing recreational marijuana. Yet, Ojeda voted for President Trump. Richard Ojeda: Am I happy with him now? I'm not. But the thing about it is, I'm willing to stand in a corner and let people throw stones at me for supporting Donald Trump. But I will tell you what. Where I come from, the coal mines are operational. Yamiche Alcindor: Is there anything about him personally that's changed that made you not want to support him? Richard Ojeda: When you're the president of the United States, you're the president over every single citizen in the country, OK? Not just the Republicans. Put your cell phone away. Be the president. Yamiche Alcindor: Like the president, he's pro-coal. How do you square your interest in environmental issues and the environment with your support with — for coal? Richard Ojeda: I want to make sure that our water and air are taken care of. I want to stop those things that cause those issues. But I still think there is a way to be able to mine our coal. And if you want to come down here and you want to pull the plug on coal, bring me something down here, so that my coal miners can transition. And I don't mean minimum wage jobs. Yamiche Alcindor: And he spared little criticism for many of his fellow Democrats, who he says have forgotten about West Virginia. Richard Ojeda: Let's go ahead and start about why Democrats lost power. You want to know why? Because they sucked. They sucked. They got to the point where they were in office for so long. And you know what? People finally got tired of it, and they got kicked to the curb. Mike Plante: He talks like them, he dresses like them, and expresses the anger that they feel. Yamiche Alcindor: Mike Plante is a longtime Democratic strategist based in Charleston. Mike Plante: For a Democrat to reach across and get enough Republicans to be successful, or vice versa, you have to be seen as somebody who's not part of the political establishment that people have lost confidence in. Yamiche Alcindor: Brandon Blankenship understands that appeal. He grew up in a staunchly conservative family and has been a Republican all his life. But after running into Ojeda at a restaurant and talking to him for an hour, Blankenship decided to vote for him. Brandon Blankenship: Even if I don't agree with everything that he says, it means more to me that you do. I need you to believe in what you're saying, not just say it because you think it's what people want to hear. He believes what he's saying. Yamiche Alcindor: Blankenship, no relation to Don Blankenship, the coal mine owner turned political candidate, works as an EMT, but says he and his wife don't have health insurance. He's hoping Ojeda's support for a public insurance option will lower health care prices. Brandon Blankenship: I get to see these patients' hospital bills and their ambulance bills. For eight hours in a hospital, it would wreck my family for the next nine months. Yamiche Alcindor: Other Republicans have painted Ojeda as a socialist and say his policies will cost taxpayers too much. And the president himself has criticized his demeanor. President Donald Trump: You can't have that person in Congress. That person is stone-cold crazy. Yamiche Alcindor: Despite their differences, some think Ojeda echoes President Trump's brand of politics. Carol Pittman supports Ojeda and President Trump. Carol Pittman: They are not going to sit around and just talk really mild and calm and say, oh, everything is going to be OK, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. No. Give me some excitement. Show me you're going to do it. Yamiche Alcindor: Republican David Roby disagrees. David Roby: There's no comparison between the two. Do I like everything Trump does? No. But, you know, that's just who he is. You take the good with the bad. What he's done positive for the country outweighs anything negative he's said or done. Yamiche Alcindor: The father of five works for the Department of Veterans Affairs. In his spare time, he and his wife raise chickens and grow vegetables. Inside their family's greenhouse, Roby explained his support for Carol Miller. David Roby: Carol Miller is the epitome of a job creator. Her and her husband own several car dealerships. She has a bison farm. She employs people through there. She knows how to create jobs. Yamiche Alcindor: Like Ojeda, Roby is a veteran. But they disagree on politics. David Roby: He's making basically the usual politician promises. I'm going to this, I'm going to do that, I'm going to do this. How? Severance tax? I mean, how are you going to pay for all these grand ideas? Yamiche Alcindor: Polls show only single digits separating Ojeda and Miller. Democratic strategist Mike Plante says this race should send a message ahead of 2020. Mike Plante: I think Democrats forgot how to tell a compelling narrative along with the data. You look at Trump's message, you know, make America great again, very simple, very compelling. I say fight like hell and let your constituents know that's what you're doing. Richard Ojeda: That's what I believe in. That's why I will die a Democrat. Yamiche Alcindor: In less than two weeks, West Virginians will have an answer as to whether that strategy succeeds. For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I'm Yamiche Alcindor in Fayetteville, West Virginia.

Michael,Gordon,1846,https://www.silive.com/news/2018/10/in-class-gaynor-mccown-students-give-back-to-community.html,"Gallery: Gaynor McCown students participate in service projects By Annalise Knudson | aknudson@siadvance.com aknudson@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Students at Gaynor McCown Expeditionary Learning School in New Springville gave back to their community for the school’s 10th annual Day of Service. “We honor the memory of Gaynor McCown, our school’s namesake, each year by heading out across Staten Island, Brooklyn and Manhattan to give back to our community,” said Traci Frey, principal of the school. All 430 students at the school participated in service projects, which were designed by staff. Students were able to choose from 16 different opportunities, including: cleaning local parks; reading to preschoolers; mentoring students at elementary schools; painting the Staten Island Pride Center; making care packages for families with babies in the newborn intensive care unit at Richmond University Medical Center; hosting a Halloween party for students at the Richard Hungerford School, and more. The day highlights the character traits upon which the school is founded -- citizenship, integrity, perseverance, respect and responsibility. View the gallery above to see students during their service projects. As part of our education column, In Class, we are highlighting some of the activities Staten Island students are engaged in -- both inside and outside the classroom. Here’s a look at some additional recent education-related happenings. FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS Councilman Joseph Borelli (R-South Shore) announced he allocated $550,000 in funding for Staten Island elementary and middle schools in fiscal year 2019. The funds will go toward new initiatives and upgrades for schools in Borelli’s district. “We have the highest performing public schools in New York City right here on the South Shore of Staten Island and it’s my privilege to augment the hard work of principals, parents and PTAs by providing them with the resources they need to maintain their edge and continue producing outstanding students,” Borelli said. The enhancements will include major technology upgrades, including smart boards and laptops at 12 local schools: PS 4, Arden Heights; PS 6, Richmond Valley; PS 8, Great Kills; PS 37, Great Kills; PS 42, Eltingville; PS 53, Great Kills; PS 55, Eltingville; PS 58, New Springville; PS 62, Rossville; Barnes Intermediate School (I.S. 24), Great Kills; Totten Intermediate School (I.S. 34), Tottenville; and Rocco Laurie Intermediate School (I.S. 72), New Springville. “We at PS 53 are very grateful and thankful to Councilman Joe Borelli for allocating $50,000 to support our technology program,” said Beth Albano, principal of PS 53. “In an effort to provide our students with the tools necessary to be innovative in an ever-changing society, this funding will help facilitate our students’ growth.” Pam Malloy, PTA president of PS 55, said: “Words cannot express how lucky and happy everyone at PS 55 is for the technology funding we’re receiving this year.” SCHOLARSHIP AWARD Staten Island Academy senior Samantha Trimboli was named the 2018 winner of the Michael Gordon Foundation Inc. Scholarship Award. The award is presented to a high school student who is academically gifted, an exemplary leader and demonstrates strong citizenship in the community. “Samantha is a scholar, a leader, an athlete and is certainly not afraid to try something new and unfamiliar or take on a challenge,” said Eileen Corigliano, assistant head of school. “She is intellectually curious and always looking to better herself and help others. Since she began Staten Island Academy as a freshman, Trimboli has acquired several academic awards, and was inducted into both the Spanish and National Honor societies. She was also elected by her peers as the vice president of the Student Advisory Council. “Samantha embodies all of the characteristics that we value here at Staten Island Academy,” said Albert Cauz, head of school. The Michael Gordon Foundation Inc., was established by Michael Gordon – a famous handbag designer – to help young people in the areas of education, health and welfare. Schools can apply to the foundation for grants, with the funds awarded to students as scholarships. Do you have a story idea for the In Class education column?

Kathleen,Reed,1844,https://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/New-food-hub-in-the-works-498721121.html,"ROANOKE, Va. (WDBJ) - The Local Environmental Agriculture Project, a nonprofit known as LEAP, is working to increase access and affordability to local food. LEAP is trying to create a hub for local produce. Sam Lev at LEAP has big plans in store for the barn at Heritage Point Farm. ""It's going to mean a stronger local food economy, so we're keeping jobs, we're building new farms, we're spending more of our dollars locally and then we're helping people eat more good, locally produced foods,"" Sam Lev, Director of Programs and Operations at LEAP, said. LEAP is a nonprofit focused on connecting local farms and businesses to people who need food. Currently, its barn is a miniature food hub that allows LEAP to store and provide the fruits, vegetables, and eggs they sell at farmers markets. But the organization is looking to transform it-- ""Turning this barn as it is right now into a place that is going to buy and sell large volumes of locally grown foods so we can help increase access, help grow new farms, and help existing farms expand,"" Lev said. The expanded food hub should make the lives easier for farmers. Kathleen Reed, Agriculture Extension Agent at Virginia Cooperative Extension, said, ""As an aggrigator, a food hub can allow small farms to have somewhere that they can drop off produce without having to deliver. You're allowing farmers to spend their time farming."" LEAP is gathering partners and building a business plan for the future of their food hub.

John,O'Neil,1842,http://www.watertowndailytimes.com/obit/sister-janice-elizabeth-oneil-sister-elizabeth-michael-20181027,"Sister Janice Elizabeth O’Neil (Sister Elizabeth Michael), 89, died Wednesday, October 24, 2018, in St. Peter’s Hospital, Albany. She had been a Sister of St. Joseph of Carondelet for the past 66 years. Sister Janice was born on August 6, 1929, in Saranac Lake, NY, daughter of the late John and Isabel Primeau O’Neil. After graduating from St. Bernard’s Elementary School and Saranac Lake High School, she attended The College of Saint Rose and received a bachelor’s degree in French in 1951. On March 19, 1952, Sister Janice entered the novitiate of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Troy, NY, and professed final vows on August 15, 1959. She subsequently received a master’s degree in French from The College of Saint Rose and served for 50 years as teacher and librarian in schools in the Albany and Syracuse Dioceses, including over three decades at St. Frances de Sales School in Herkimer. Sister Janice retired to St. Joseph’s Provincial House in 2004. Sister Janice was a faith-filled woman whose warm and welcoming spirit was a gift to all with whom she came in contact. A genuine “people person,” she was blessed with a beautiful smile, a keen sense of humor and a genuine interest in each individual who crossed her path. Sister Janice’s life was very much about relationships: with her loving God, with her dear family, with her Sisters in community and with her many dear friends and colleagues. She enjoyed the playfulness and simplicity of the school children as well as quiet, encouraging conversations with the elderly, and in both situations, her compassionate nature and her great strength of mind and heart enabled her to brighten the lives of many. In her later years, Sister Janice’s peace-filled acceptance of her prolonged illness and inability to walk defined her and bespoke the beauty of a life well-steeped in the love of God and well-lived in service to others. Sister Janice is survived by her beloved sister, Myrna O’Neil, of Ogdensburg; her sister-in-law, Former Assembly Woman Chloe Ann O’Neil, of Parishville; her niece, Beth Ann Rice (Steve Lavigne); her nephew, Doctor John O’Neil (Meg), and their families; many dear cousins and friends; and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. In addition to her parents, Sister Janice was predeceased by her brother, Former Assembly Man John G. A. O’Neil; and by a dear family friend, Samuel Cavallario. Sister Janice’s Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Tuesday, October 30, at 10:30 a.m. in the chapel of St. Joseph’s Provincial House, Latham, NY. Calling hours will be held at the Provincial House on Monday, October 29, from 4:00-7:00 p.m. with a prayer service at 7:00 p.m. Contributions in Sister Janice’s memory may be made to the Development Office of the Sisters of St. Joseph, 385 Watervliet Shaker Road, Latham, NY 12110.

Andrew,Davis,1841,https://www.frontstretch.com/2018/10/27/christopher-haase-wins-california-8-hours-pole-for-audi-sport-team-land/,"Phil Allaway October 27, 2018 IGTC, Phil Allaway, Sports Cars Leave a comment Audi Sport Team Land’s Christopher Haase claimed the overall pole for Sunday’s California 8 Hours Saturday afternoon (Oct. 27) in his Audi R8 LMS GT3. Haase, driving a similar car to the one above, but with a paint scheme resembling the stripes on the American flag, turned in a lap at 96.304 mph in the closing minutes of the session. Haase’s time was seven-hundredths of a second faster than Strakka Racing’s Raffaele Marciello in the fastest of the Mercedes. Dries Vanthoor, driving the No. 19 Audi for Audi Sport Team WRT, was third quickest. SunEnergy1 Racing’s Luca Stolz was fourth overall and claimed the Pro-Am pole position in his Mercedes. Black Swan Racing’s Patrick Long was fifth in the best of the Porsches. Other American-based GT3 entrants include the second SunEnergy1 Racing Mercedes. The Pro class No. 175 (qualified by Tristan Vautier) qualified sixth. K-PAX Racing’s No. 9 Bentley. Àlvaro Parente qualified the first generation Bentley Continental GT3 ninth overall, out-qualifying both of the factory Bentley Team M-Sport entries with the second generation Continental GT3. Romain Dumas qualified the Wright Motorsports No. 911 Porsche 911 GT3 R in 10th. As previously noted, Stolz in fourth overall was the best of the Pro-Am teams. His time was only eight-hundredths of a second faster than Strakka Racing’s Felipe Fraga in the No. 42 Mercedes. Precision Products Motorsports’ Shinya Michimi was third in class and 15th overall. Qualifying was a bit unusual by American standards. There were three rounds of qualifying Saturday morning. Each driver had to participate in at least one of the rounds (teams with two drivers could have one driver do two rounds). The fastest laps for each driver were averaged together to determine not only who advanced to the Pole Shootout, but the rest of the grid as well. In GT4, Team Panoz Racing’s No. 51 Panoz Avezzano piloted by Pirelli World Challenge regulars Dr. Preston Calvert, Ian James and Matthew Keegan claimed the class pole with an average lap speed of 87.653 mph, good enough for 18th overall. That average was nearly a half a second faster than the Mercedes of Murillo Racing’s Matthew Fassnacht and Christian Szymczak.

Numerous scientific studies conclude that keys to healthy aging include keeping one’s mind active, social engagement and feeling useful. Osher made those three attributes a requirement for financial support to create Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes across the entire United States. OLLI at Granite State College has been a part of healthy aging for thousands of New Hampshire seniors since its inception in 2004 thanks, in large part to Bernard Osher. Osher, born and raised in Biddeford, Maine, founded the Bernard Osher Foundation in 1977 to support four particular interests – post-secondary scholarships, integrative medicine programs, arts and educational organizations and lifelong learning institutes for “seasoned adults.” Offering grants to colleges and universities to support creation of Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the Osher Foundation’s guidelines outline 17 topic areas for the courses offered. This guarantees mental stimulation and assures there will be something of interest for all adult learners. Guidelines also call for significant volunteer support from the membership. While this does keep costs reasonable, the primary motivation for this requirement is to engage the senior population which may suffer from post-retirement “what am I going to do with my life now?” syndrome. Volunteers are responsible for the curriculum, for planning and executing all events, for teaching classes and for supporting the administration of the program overall. The importance of their work is easy to define: no volunteers means no OLLI. Social engagement is evident at any OLLI class or function as strangers come together to pursue a common interest and find the joy of interacting with like-minded peers. What does that mean – are all OLLI members of the same faith ... or political persuasion ... or economic background? Oh my, no! The shared experiences of OLLI members come from: ■being raised in the ’40s and ’50s with Lassie, the Beaver, the Andersons and Howdy Doody; ■living through the ’60s, perhaps as a full-fledged hippie, a member of the armed services or a civil rights activist; ■raising families and building careers through the ’70s and ’80s, and ultimately; ■retiring or planning for it in the new millennium. And the wide variety of personal experiences while navigating those common periods contribute to the richness of the dialog as OLLI members share where they’ve come from and how they live this next chapter of their lives. In OLLI, social engagement is not synonymous with party-going. It is all about that sharing – sometimes it’s the quiet collegial activity of planning a program or editing a catalog, sometimes it’s a small group getting together for coffee and talking about the most interesting souvenir they collected while traveling. Sometimes it’s meeting face to face over a Scrabble board instead of the more impersonal Words with Friends computer game. And for the party animals, well, yes, there are also parties! OLLI will be represented at the upcoming Active Aging program sponsored by the Concord Monitor and Monadnock Transcript-Ledger on Tuesday at the Bektash Shrine Center.

(AP) — A Florida man has been sentenced to life in prison for the fatal stabbings of two women during a crime spree. The Ledger reports that 33-year-old Terrell Williams was sentenced after jurors found him guilty Thursday of two counts of first-degree murder. Authorities say Williams, Devonere McCune, Michael Gordon and Jovan Lamb robbed an Auburndale pawn shop in January 2015. McCune was arrested following a shootout with police in nearby Haines City. Following a 911 call, deputies responded to a nearby home and found the bodies of 72-year-old Patricia Moran, and her daughter, 51-year-old Deborah Royal. Authorities say Williams, Gordon and Lamb were arrested after trying to flee in the victims' car. Investigators believe Gordon killed the women. Gordon and Lamb are set to stand trial next year. McCune had previously been sentenced to 25 years as part of a plea deal, but prosecutors set aside the deal when he refused testify. ___ Information from: The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.), http://www.theledger.com",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

BARTOW — A Haines City man was found guilty by a jury Thursday of two counts of first-degree murder in the brutal stabbing deaths of a mother and daughter in a subdivision. Terrell Williams, 33, of Haines City was sentenced to life in prison by Circuit Judge Jalal Harb. He's the first of four co-defendants to be found guilty in the deaths of 72-year-old Patricia Moran and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51. The two women were killed during a crime rampage that began in Auburndale when three armed, masked men robbed a pawn shop and ended when Polk County sheriff’s deputies, aided by a K-9, found Williams hiding in a shed not far from the murder scene. Autopsies would show that Royal had been stabbed 54 times, with one cut so deep it severed her esophagus. Moran had 50 stab wounds. Her throat, too, had been cut. After running from a crashed car, investigators have said 38-year-old Michael Gordon forced his way into the Chanler Ridge subdivision home of Moran and Royal and fatally stabbed them before stealing their car and crashing it through the garage door. He was arrested a short distance away. Gordon’s trial is scheduled for January. Jovan Lamb, charged with being an accomplice, will be in court in February. Devonere McCune had pleaded guilty to armed robbery in April 2017 in exchange for the state dropping the murder charges and for his testimony against the other defendants. Prosecutors filed a motion last month to set aside the plea agreement after McCune told prosecutors he would take the Fifth Amendment, affording him the right to remain silent, if he was called to testify. Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme told jurors in closing arguments that Williams was equally as involved in the crime rampage as Gordon, of Lakeland, and Lamb, 33, and McCune, 26, both of Haines City. Williams told jurors during testimony that he wasn't involved with the other three until after they had robbed the Auburndale pawn shop, and that he had nothing to do with the killings.

Michael,Gordon,1839,https://www.wbtv.com/2018/10/25/basketball-coach-pleads-guilty-groping-college-student-charlotte-flight/,"(Michael Gordon/Charlotte Observer) - A former University of Cincinnati basketball coach pleaded guilty Thursday to misdemeanor assault stemming from the groping of a South Carolina college student on a 2017 flight into Charlotte last year. Larry Davis was a passenger on American Airlines Flight 4203 from Milwaukee on Sept. 12, 2017, when the incident involving the 23-year-old female passenger allegedly occurred. The Observer does not name alleged victims of sexual assault. A Charlotte-Mecklenburg police report says the woman, who lived at the time near Charleston, told officers that she was “inappropriately touched by the passenger seated next to her.” Davis, who at the time was co-associate head basketball coach at Cincinnati, told U.S. Magistrate David Cayer that he was guilty of one count of federal misdemeanor assault. He will be sentenced at a later date. Davis announced his retirement last month. “The decision and timing of when to retire is never easy, but the time is right for me now. It’s time to move on to a new phase in my life,” Davis said, according to gobearcats.com. The Cincinnati Enquirer reported this week that the coach’s sudden departure came about an hour before his firing was to go into effect. Three days after the 2017 incident, the school suspended Davis with pay for two weeks while it investigated the allegations, according to a statement from UC Athletic Director Mike Bohn cited by the Enquirer. “We recently learned that the allegations may have additional support. … As Mr. Davis is no longer employed by the University, we have no further comment,” according to the statement reported by the Enquirer. From 1997 to 2006, Davis was the head basketball coach at Furman University in Greenville, S.C. He also spent four years as an assistant coach at Wake Forest, where multiple reports credit him for the recruitment of NBA great Tim Duncan. 1 Julian Price Pl.Charlotte, NC 28208(704) 374-3500",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Michael,Gordon,1839,https://www.heraldtribune.com/entertainmentlife/20181025/ensemblenewsrq-launches-season-with-boston-musicians,"enSRQ joins with HUB New Music for an Oct. 29 concert Collaboration is at the heart of each ensemblenewSRQ season, and the new one begins Monday with local musicians teaming up with the Boston-based HUB New Music group. EnSRQ musicians will play some numbers and the HUB ensemble will play others, but all the musicians will join together at the end for Steve Reich’s “Double Sextet,” which won a Pulitzer Prize. “What’s neat about it is in the sextet, the local crew plays against and off of the out-of-town crew,” said ensemblenewSRQ co-founder and percussionist George Nickson. “Each group plays a different role in creating the entire experience. It’s a completely fun jam and feels more like pop music than classical.” HUB New Music features a group of educators and musicians, including founder Michael Avitabile, flute; David Dziardziel, clarinet; Zenas Hsu, violin; and Jesse Christeson, cello. The first concert of the group’s third season starts with Michael Gordon’s “ac/dc,” followed by Anna Klein’s “1987” and then Nina C. Young’s “Rising Tide” before finishing with “Double Sextet.” The concert highlights two different styles of composition happening in modern music, Nickson said. The first and final pieces are minimalist, using small sets of themes or ideas. The two in the middle are interested in small details, and feature “attention to texture and hyper-expressivity.” “The two female composers in the middle, their music is really detailed and emotionally expressive,” he said. “It juxtaposes really well with the minimalist, more groove music that Reich and Gordon have written.” Gordon’s piece is an interpretation of electronic currents, Nickson said, with chord progressions similar to pop and rock songs but in an irregular 11/8 time. “It feels like your heart has skipped a beat,” he said. “The meter is all jumbled up. His work is definitely a play on expectations and changing them up a bit. Klein’s piece that follows is almost the opposite — it’s deeply personal and intimate, and intended to be played with the lights completely off.” Klein’s “1987” is based on a music box her father gave to her mother. The music has an electronic accompaniment of a music box to be played along with the musicians, which makes it “haunting and almost macabre.” Meanwhile, Young’s “Rising Tide” uses electronics as a way to experiment with the sound of acoustics, “blending the sounds together and making something completely new. It’s the kind of piece the audience will look at a person playing and not be sure where the sounds are coming from,” Nickson said. And Reich’s sextet features techniques he invented called “phasing,” in which one musician starts a phrase and another picks it up but speeds it up slightly. Sometimes, two groups play off each other; other times, Reich has an ensemble play against a recording of itself. Another piece in the ensemblenewSRQ season will feature this technique. “Throughout the season, we try to highlight the breadth and diversity of what’s out there being written,” said ensemble co-founder and violinist Samantha Bennett. “We want to present the gamut of styles and instrumentation of works. The first concert looks at two trends of composition, but it’s really only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what’s to come for the duration of the season.” Highlights of the season’s six concerts includes “Holographic,” in January, featuring composer/pianist Daniel Wohl and visual artist Daniel Schwarz for an hourlong piece. Composer Matthew Aucoin, who recently won a MacArthur Fellowship, will be performing and presenting two works in March, and the season concludes with a commissioned percussion concerto debut. Nickson said he was “thrilled” with how quickly the ensemble has grown and how many ideas have turned into actual concert programs. This season they are even repeating some concerts at Studio 620 in St. Petersburg. “Everyone who thinks they would not be interested in classical music should check this out, especially those who are looking for exciting adventurous music that is something they maybe haven’t heard before,” he said. “This is not your standard classical fare.” Choose the plan that's right for you.

A paid-sick-leave ordinance in Austin, Texas, should be blocked because it violates the state's minimum wage law, the state attorney general's office and lawyers who represent business groups argue. The challenged ordinance would require employers in Austin to provide paid-sick-leave benefits to employees who work for that employer 80 or more hours in Austin in a calendar year. Workers would accrue one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked in the city, and employers could cap annual accruals at either 48 or 64 hours, depending on employer size. The law was to take effect Oct. 1, but a state appeals court temporarily halted it. The Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) joined the state attorney general's office, the Texas Association of Business and several other business groups in the lawsuit against the city of Austin. The groups are seeking to leave in place a temporary injunction that will prevent the law from taking effect while the courts consider the merits of the challenge. ""SHRM is optimistic that the court will ultimately reject Austin's one-size-fits-all sick-leave mandate, but because other state and local governments are likely to push more of these mandates, SHRM will continue to push for a national solution as outlined in the Workflex in the 21st Century Act,"" said Lisa Horn, SHRM's vice president of congressional affairs. The Society worked with Rep. Mimi Walters, R-Calif., to develop the Workflex in the 21st Century Act (H.R. 4219), which would simplify paid-leave options and offer employees generous paid leave and increased flexible work arrangements. State Law Pre-Emption The Texas Minimum Wage Act bars cities from setting or regulating private-sector employees' wages. The state attorney general's office and the business groups that oppose Austin's mandate contend that paid-leave benefits are wages. ""The legislature told cities that local ordinances are pre-empted to the extent that they establish or govern wages,"" said Andrew Davis, a state assistant solicitor general, during oral argument on Oct. 17. ""Nevertheless, the city enacted and plans to enforce an ordinance that effectively raises wages by requiring employers to pay employees more for the same amount of work."" [SHRM members-only state coverage: Texas Employment Law] Paul Matula, an attorney with the city of Austin, argued that the Texas Minimum Wage Act's pre-emption clause applies only to wages and that paid-sick-leave benefits are not wages. Legislators know how to express their intent to pre-empt local laws, he said, and they must use ""unmistakable clarity"" when doing so. Davis disagreed. He noted that the Austin law would require employers to pay employees at their ""ordinary rate"" when they take accrued sick leave. By directing employers to pay workers a certain rate, the city has attempted to regulate wages, he argued. Lawsuit Timing Matula argued that the lawsuit challenging the ordinance was brought too soon, before it could be shown that the new law would cause any harm. He said that most employers would not face any enforcement penalties until June 2019, and that small employers would have until 2020 before the enforcement mechanism kicks in. ""But is there any doubt that [the ordinance] was going to be implemented and that it would be enforced and that there would be consequences if businesses did not comply?"" asked Justice David Puryear of the Texas Third District Court of Appeals. He noted that employers presented evidence that they may need to alter their business models, make arrangements with third-party administrators and take other steps to prepare for implementation. More City-Level Laws The San Antonio City Council passed a similar ordinance several months after Austin lawmakers approved theirs. However, advocates for paid sick leave in Dallas fell short of the signatures needed to put the issue on November's ballot. Some Republican lawmakers in Texas have said that local paid-sick-leave laws hurt small businesses, and they may introduce bills to block such ordinances, according to the Texas Tribune. More than 20 states have passed laws that prohibit local governments from imposing their own paid-leave mandates. Nonetheless, state and local paid-sick-leave laws continue to proliferate. In some states, such as California, Maryland and Washington, employers must comply with state and local sick-leave laws that have different accrual rates, caps and administrative rules. While worker advocates say that paid-sick-leave ordinances guarantee that employees will be able to care for themselves and their families, business groups argue that inconsistent paid-sick-leave rules at the state and local levels make compliance difficult for employers.

Home delivery subscribers can read it free! John O'Neil O’NEIL WILKES-BARRE — A city man wanted for blasting music at “extremely unreasonable” levels barricaded himself in his home Wednesday night and slashed the hand of a police officer who tried to get in, according to police. John Joseph O’Neil, 54, of 62 Regent St., was captured after causing a deep cut to the finger of Officer Steve Wengen during the standoff. According to the complaint, officers were dispatched to O’Neil’s home around 10:45 p.m. to a report of loud music. When police contacted O’Neil, he grew irate and refused to step outside, police said. O’Neil screamed he wasn’t going back to jail and threatened to stab police if they didn’t leave his property, the complaint said. Officers at the scene discovered O’Neil was wanted on an arrest warrant on a charge of disorderly conduct issued earlier this month. In that case, officers were dispatched to his home three times within an hour and a half the night of Oct. 5 to reports of noise complaints. Police said O’Neil was blasting music and refused to open the door, and at one point got on a microphone to declare he was God and a sovereign citizen. O’Neil also warned he had “two more speakers and 10,000 more watts” he would use when officers left, police said. On Wednesday night, O’Neil again refused to open the door and began barricading himself inside, police said. After determining O’Neil was a danger to others, police used a battering ram to take down the door, police said. However, because the door had been barricaded the battering ram only punched a hole through it, according to the complaint. In an attempt to get inside, Wengen stuck his right hand in the hole and O’Neil slashed it with a knife, causing a deep cut that required emergency medical care, police said. Officers eventually got inside and confronted O’Neil, who was armed with a knife in the living room, according to the complaint. O’Neil was captured after a brief struggle. Police charged O’Neil with a felony count of assaulting a law enforcement officer as well as misdemeanor counts of simple assault, making terroristic threats, reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. Magisterial District Judge Ferris Peter Webby Sr. arraigned O’Neil on Thursday morning and set his bail at a combined $30,000 for both cases. O’Neil was being held at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility with a preliminary hearing set for Nov. 6. Contact the writer: jhalpin@citizensvoice.com 570-821-2058 75 N.

Jane,Powers,1834,https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-chicago-music-local-sounds-1026-story.html,"“I don’t believe that people peak,” said Emily Jane Powers. And anyone who looked at Powers’ long writing, performing, and recording history of 13 albums recorded in 16 years would never use the term “peak” to describe her creative work ethic. “Those 16 years have been very significant regarding my own evolution musically, and how I make music and why I make music and share it with people,” she said. For Powers, music is a therapeutic outlet. She uses it to process what she’s feeling and seeing and to make better sense of things. So it is easy to understand why she’s so prolific. But since 2009, Powers has unleashed a new process for making her music. “Everything I would do pre-2009 if I couldn’t do it myself, it wasn’t worth it,” Powers admitted. “I was really stubborn about that.” Since then, she’s only released three albums, and Powers cites many reasons for the lower output: a move to Chicago, the stresses of a day job, the effects of getting older. Most critical for Powers is her approach to making music in the midst of those other life changes. “The time I work on music is not much more precious, but much more deliberate,” she said. “So if I’m going to work on music, I have to use that time really wisely.” Part of using her time more wisely includes attention to sound. Powers’ newer music focuses more on her guitar playing. Every note is crafted with intent and purpose to keep from reusing anything — chord progressions or multilayered reverb, for example. “I have less time to devote to (making music), so the time has to be more meaningful,” Powers added. “It wasn’t that (making music) was thoughtless before. It was fun. It was exciting, and it is still fun and exciting. But now, it just has to be tightened up.” Powers also feels an abundance of confidence in her guitar playing, something she maybe could never admit to in the past. But things have changed as she’s gotten older and more secure in her music. “If I want something, I’m realizing I can get it in the sound,” she said. “I just thought other people could get things to sound a certain way because they knew things I didn’t. And now I’m starting to know things that other people know.” Another thing “other people know” is the power of collaboration. As a musician who wrote, played and recorded everything herself for the majority of her albums, collaboration came late in her musical career. But Powers said she has learned to value and find strength in the collaboration process, in large part because it helps her truly, finally make the sort of music (at least aesthetically) she’s always wanted. Listeners can hear these significant changes on Powers’ latest album, “Restless,” released in March. She described this album as her most vulnerable yet, due in large part to her affinity for the editing process. “If I’m going to edit, I should just say what I want to say. I should just try to be more direct,” Powers claimed. Getting older means the things one feels heighten significantly and in seriousness. There is a more clear, more profound understanding of the machinations of the world. Talking about it, especially as an artist, is a natural method of processing those monumental changes. “It continues to be scary to share your work, but I think that when you’re vulnerable, there’s payoff in it.” Britt Julious is a freelance writer. onthetown@chicagotribune.com Twitter @chitribent When: 8:30 p.m. Saturday Where: Empty Bottle, 1035 N.

Andrew,Davis,1832,https://news.uga.edu/new-approaches-diversity-inclusion/,"Grants broaden access for students through innovative programs “UGA has been my dream school for so long,” Justin Edge said. “This is the school for me. It’s a great institution.” That dream became a reality for Edge and three other first-year law students named to the initial group of Benham Scholars thanks, in part, to New Approaches to Promote Diversity and Inclusion grants, which supports the program by funding the students’ participation in the school’s early start program in addition to offering academic support and professional development opportunities. The Benham Scholars program, named for Robert Benham, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of Georgia and the second African American graduate of UGA’s School of Law, is just one of the 21 grant proposals funded through the program, which was announced by UGA President Jere W. Morehead in August 2017. A total of $300,000 was awarded in January 2018 as part of the program. The $10,000 to $25,000 grants are used for the development or adoption of new projects that support the recruitment, retention and success of underrepresented, underserved and first-generation students at UGA. High School seniors laugh at a therapy robot with assistant professor Jenay Beer in the Assistive Robotics and Technology Lab on the Health Sciences Campus. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker) “The New Approaches grants are making an incredible impact on broadening the access, success and engagement of students from a range of backgrounds through innovative programs and initiatives,” said Michelle Cook, vice provost for diversity and inclusion and strategic university initiatives. “The effect is being felt across the state as young people are being exposed to the opportunities for exploration and growth through higher education.” Jenna Jackson, the law school’s associate director of admissions and diversity programs, and Greg Roseboro, the law school’s executive director of admissions and diversity programs, are using the grant to support various opportunities for the Benham Scholars throughout their time in law school. “We’ve created something that not only will help students now, but, looking forward, also will help us to open the profession to more people,” Jackson said. “We intend to have our fingers on their pulse to see how they’re adjusting emotionally and academically. With the students in mind, we can do some really great things.” The program includes academic support and professional development opportunities such as mentorships, meetings with law school alumni and transportation to and from Atlanta for those opportunities. The intention is that these students graduate, pass the bar exam and then serve the state as an attorney. Edge plans to eventually make an impact in his hometown. “I can see myself going back to Americus. I’d like to learn, get my training and go back home as a polished attorney to assist the community,” he said. “With the tools I’ll learn here, I’ll be able to go home and serve whomever needs help.” Other New Approaches grants focus on recruiting prospective undergraduate students. During the week of July 9, the College of Public Health brought 22 rising high school seniors from across Georgia to campus for a pre-collegiate summer institute. The program, funded in part through a New Approaches grant, serves as an introduction to what life is like for UGA’s public health students. In fact, current public health students served as counselors and mentors to participants and led them through a variety of sessions that included public health classes, seminars and workshops on financial aid and admissions essay writing. The goal, according to Brittani Harmon, coordinator of the institute and clinical assistant professor of health policy and management, is to give participants an experience “as close to freshman year as possible.” That experience included staying in dorms, eating at Bolton Dining Commons and learning about campus culture. “This is a good primer for them to be able to practice their skills in a controlled environment,” she added. “They’re the next generation of go-getters.” John Kang, one of those go-getters from Lawrenceville, learned much more than facts and figures at the institute. “After this week, I can say with confidence that my eyes have been opened to new perspectives and new career pathways. After seeing the range of majors and routes the student counselors have been through, I now understand the true nature of college and its purpose: to promote growth.” Journalism students volunteering for the UGA-Grady High School Sports Broadcast Program try out the equipment for the first time.

Since the beginning of the school year, Grady Sports Media students have traveled to Cedar Shoals a few times a month for after-school training sessions focusing on all parts of sports broadcast journalism, from producing and camera work to play-by-play announcing, building in-game graphics and tracking game statistics. Friday nights are spent in the stadium press box where the high school students, under the leadership of the college students, practice what they have learned by producing a live broadcast of Cedar Shoals football games. Both sets of students learn from each other. Cedar Shoals students gain practice through this on-the-job training experience. Grady College students gain valuable mentorship skills and have an opportunity to share their collegiate experiences. “We are grateful that this idea we’ve had in our minds for a while is coming to fruition because of this grant,” said Vicki Michaelis, who helped write the grant and serves as the John Huland Carmical Chair in Sports Journalism and Society and director of Grady Sports Media.",0.0,3.0,0.21428571428571427,0.0,1020357,0.7657225643508048,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Andrew,Davis,1832,http://okcfox.com/news/local/body-camera-cold-items-in-fridge-led-to-arrest-in-oklahoma-city,"by Austin Prickett & Will Maetzold Body camera footage shows officers encountering an alleged refrigerator thief Oct. 22 in Oklahoma City. (Oklahoma City Police Department) Oklahoma City police have released body camera footage showing officers as they reportedly caught a man ""cold-handed"" stealing a refrigerator. Police reports show that just before 3 p.m. Oct. 22 officers were called to the 1600 block of NW 35 Street in reference to a burglary. Officers made contact with the man near NW 32 and Blackwelder as he was pushing a refrigerator on a dolly down the road. Danny Mainus said he's part of the neighborhood watch group on NW 35th St. near Classen Blvd. So he thought it would be best to call police when he saw the man with the refrigerator on his street. ""I wasn't officially on patrol, but when you're out and about and you care for your neighbors, you do that,"" Mainus said. The man told police that he found the fridge on the side of the road left out for ""big trash pickup"". An officer opened the fridge and found it to be full of items and that the items were still cold. A witness told police they saw the man wheeling a black stove down the road, before coming back to a home in the neighborhood and wheeling a fridge out. The owner of the home was contacted and confirmed that the man did not have permission to be inside the house. Police then arrested the man, later identified as 49-year-old Lee Andrew Davis. ""It's unclear exactly what the situation was at this house but he did go inside to steal the appliances,"" Oklahoma City Police Msgt. Gary Knight said. ""He did not find them outside. But to make it more interesting, the refrigerator was still full of food."" Davis also had three warrants for his arrest. Mainus said it was a strange sight to see. ""I followed him down Blackwelder about a half a block behind him and he just kept going,"" Mainus said. ""Finally the police showed up."" Mainus said he hopes some of the crime related to vacant homes will be stopped. ""We have the homeless finding vacant houses and moving into them and tearing them up,"" Mainus said. ""In fact, there's one on 31st.""

Bob,Diamond,1831,https://therealdeal.com/2018/10/25/a-chinese-oil-entrepreneur-was-scooping-up-manhattan-properties-then-he-disappeared/,"Companies with connections to Chinese oil entrepreneur Ye Jianming spent about $83 million on New York City properties and planned to buy $80 million more before Ye’s mysterious disappearance earlier this year. The deals included purchasing a penthouse from a former Wall Street banker and buying a townhouse from a billionaire close to President Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal. Companies tied to Ye also bought the penthouse of former Barclays Chief Executive Bob Diamond in 2017 for $50.55 million, along with an apartment at 432 Park Avenue for about $33 million. In December, a company tied to Ye went under contract to buy billionaire Vincent Viola’s $80 million townhouse at 12 East 69th Street, which would have set a record at the time for New York’s most expensive residential townhouse ever. However, Ye went missing early in 2018, and the deal fell apart around the same time. Viola’s house was put back on the market for $88 million. Ye chairs a conglomerate based in Shanghai called CEFC China Energy, which aggressively expanded abroad in recent years. However, the company is now selling assets and unwinding deals as Ye’s whereabouts are still unknown.

Bob,Diamond,1831,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/comment/article-6312831/ALEX-BRUMMER-Vodafone-losing-way-Colaos-departure.html,"By Alex Brummer for the Daily Mail Published: 17:00 EST, 24 October 2018 | Updated: 17:01 EST, 24 October 2018 1 View comments When Vittorio Colao stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was treated like an all-conquering hero. But investors keeping an eye on the vanishing Vodafone share price and shrinking stock market value might be asking different questions of his successor Nick Read. In recent days, the shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1 billion, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100. n recent days, Vodafone's shares have hovered at 145p, down from a year-high of 239p, putting a value on the telecoms group of £39.1bn, and it has now slumped to just 15th in the FTSE 100 It is hard to remember that Vodafone was Britain's flagship tech group and a pioneer in the fast-growing telecoms and data markets in the Japan and the United States. Both stakes have been discarded. The shareholding in Verizon Wireless was sold for a phenomenal £100 billion. In effect, the empire built by the excellent Sir Chris Gent was dismembered, leaving behind a group which is a shadow of its former self. A strategy of expanding into emerging markets, such as India, has proved disappointing because of intense competition. It is hard to think that digging deeper into low-growth Europe, by acquiring Liberty Global's networks, can ever pay off. Getting a good deal from America's 'cable cowboy' John Malone was never going to happen. Colao and his predecessor Arun Sarin were under constant pressure from shareholders to de-clutter and release value from the Verizon Wireless stakes. But assets were relinquished in advanced Western economies just at the moment that the smartphone and data revolution took off. Alex Brummer says when Vittorio Colao (pictured) stepped down as chief executive of Vodafone earlier this year, he was 'treated like an all-conquering hero' In 2006, Vodafone sold its Japanese offshoot to tech investor Softbank for £8.9 billion. A decade on and Softbank is on the verge of sponsoring Japan's biggest ever initial public offering in a deal for the former Vodafone unit expected to raise up to £20billion. Being a minority holder in Verizon Wireless was never a comfortable place to be. Sarin did well to avoid a quick sale and create the value which Colao cashed in. But it was a latecomer to data. The value which might have been created by hanging on or maintaining a smaller stake in Verizon was sacrificed for immediate cash. Shareholders (including this writer) received a cash bonus. But there are serious questions to be asked as to how a high-growth entity allowed itself to become a sub-performing utility. Staley resistance The Vodafone experience suggests that Jes Staley is right to resist the attentions of corporate vampire Edward Bramson's assault on Barclays' investment banking. It is easy to show that the returns on its credit cards is far superior to that from M&A. But it is a meaningless comparison. Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era. Brummer says: 'Barclays, as the only fully functioning investment bank in Europe, has an enormous opportunity if it can keep out of trouble and avoid the excesses of the John Varley and Bob Diamond era' Lingering costs of the past are still there, the latest being a £1.4 billion fine from the US Department of Justice for the mis-selling of mortgage securities. It seems only yesterday that a very senior Barclays executive was explaining to me that its portfolio of sub-prime mortgages were a higher grade than those of other banks. Barclays deserves credit for defending the performance of the investment bank rather than giving in to bullies. A much better performance in equity trading drove the investment bank performance in the third quarter when Barclays was the third-biggest player in global debt markets and involved in major M&A such as the high-profile Michael Kors acquisition of Versace. As the UK heads towards Brexit the importance of Britain maintaining a strong presence in American-dominated investment banking is enormously important. Bramson is better at taking on the weak. Hidden treasure Should there be any doubt about the importance of Barclays and financial services to the UK economy, it is worth looking at new data today from the industry's advocacy group CityUK. It shows the UK to be the world's leading exporter of financial services in 2017 with a surplus of £68 billionn – that's equal to the next three contenders combined. Small wonder that French president Emmanuel Macron wants a share of the after-Brexit business. Best of luck with that. Share what you think The comments below have not been moderated.

Jeff,Packman,1829,https://www.colby.edu/news/2018/10/24/colby-expands-access-to-cutting-edge-science-through-establishment-of-linde-packman-lab-for-biosciences-innovation/,"October 24, 2018 Programs supported by gift will create pipeline for the next generation of scientific leaders Colby College has received a major contribution to support programs that will prepare the next generation of innovators in the sciences through funded experiences at renowned partner institutions on the leading edge of discovery. The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad.",0.0,15.0,0.9375,3.0,1022024,0.9999999968398564,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

(NASDAQ:MKTX) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 24, 2018 10:00 AM ET Executives Dave Cresci - IR Rick McVey - Chairman and CEO Tony DeLise - CFO Analysts Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Raymond James Rich Repetto - Sandler O'Neill Kyle Voigt - KBW Chris Shutler - William Blair Chris Allen - Compass Point Jeremy Campbell - Barclays Capital Markets Dan Fannon - Jefferies Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. Dave Cresci Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2018 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide an update on trends in our businesses, and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our Web site. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick. Rick McVey Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products, and continued robust Open Trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3 2017. Our estimated U.S. high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth, and reached a record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million, was up 6% compared to Q3 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million, and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12%, including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson yards. We expect to move in to our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open Trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes both saw rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatilities fell, and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads, and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions has been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong, and position the company well for future growth. Slide five provides an update on Open Trading. Open Trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter, and was up 58% to a year record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion, also up 58%. Open Trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 Open Trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open Trading liquidity providers or price-makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through Open Trading, and over 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transactions costs through Open Trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a U.S. high-grade transaction through Open Trading protocols. Importantly, Open Trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our product and geographic diversification. Our U.S. high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior, leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year, and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam, and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are underway to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22%, with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on the system, representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Tony DeLise Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. U.S. high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year. A slight increase in estimated market share accounts for the uplift in trading volume as U.S. high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated U.S. high-grade market share is up one percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes, our other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets, and U.S. high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains was the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volume, 27% growth in high-yield volume, and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated U.S. high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated U.S. high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. The 11% increase in trading volume resulted in 5% uplift in commissions. New data contracts accounted for the $800,000 increase in information services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and we customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter, and 21.6% year-to-date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards, and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range, and now expect the effective tax rate for full-year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years of maturity and higher yields caused a reduction in our U.S. high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, U.S. high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially, and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in each trade size bucket. Our Other Credit category's fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. So percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter, and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10, provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and tradeshow spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses was 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology, and infrastructure. Our full-year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30th were $446 million, compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $15 million, and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-month free cash flow is a record $178 million. Based on these results, our Board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Rick McVey Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth in estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum; including high-yield, emerging markets, and Open Trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months provided a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Hey, good morning, guys. Rick McVey Good morning, Patrick. Tony DeLise Morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market forum was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps from the efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Rick McVey Sure. I think this is a continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead Axess in the system and identity offsetting interest in that trade, they could do so with any trade size and have the opportunity to work up trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols in newly issued bonds that would introduce faster means of execution for highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trade sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking to add around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period-end employee count, and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter-to-quarter, so should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual give what the volume environment looked like during the quarter? Tony DeLise Yes, so Patrick, two things in there on the headcount, and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefit. On the headcount, we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have start days [ph] in the fourth quarter, so we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit we don't know what will happen with attrition, but we are sitting on 15 additional add. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was just a slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits. It was around a $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower. The cash bonus accrual is formulaic; it is tied to operating performance. And quarter-to-quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you should see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes Q2 to Q3, you saw pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy All right, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Rich Repetto Yes, good morning, Rick. Good morning, Tony. Rick McVey Good morning, Rich. Rich Repetto And congrats on the uptick in the Open Trading percentage, I guess the first question is on Open Trading. And it seems like quarter-to-quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in there, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield. The others went up by like a percent or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter, from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove that big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in Open Trading? Rick McVey Yes, a couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of Open Trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that Open Trading is providing the highest value in less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield, that we've just seen better take-up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way and reduce transactions costs and in a less liquid market, like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Rich Repetto Thanks, Rick. A follow-up on Open Trading is, I would assume the ETFs -- well, just some comments on auto ex [ph] as well, just the trend there. If Open Trading pick up I assume the auto ex and the drivers -- one of the drives is ETFs, that you would see auto ex also increasing? Rick McVey Yes, I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right at auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you all know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on, to low-touch, and now even moving into no-touch, where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they're able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfection willing to auto-execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade. It's really about do the price responses come back to meet the clients' preset expectations. And if they do they're willing to auto-execute those trades. Rich Repetto Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q, and I think these are from your comments that July and August were a different story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think, even more volatility in October. And you may have covered this, but if you did I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October. But can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility, like September, October. Rick McVey Well, October, if you look at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield, very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months. And September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall. But we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October, and the product mix will drive the fee capture. Rich Repetto Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Rick McVey Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto ex, but maybe more so on the Composite+ product, really just want to updated thoughts on the future of Composite+ and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facility some of these auto ex functionalities being built into the buy side, but are there also other revenue generating opportunities for Composite+ as well? Rick McVey Sure, happy to take that one. No, we're really pleased to see both dealer, investor, clients embracing Composite Price Plus, which is a real-time mid-market now in about 20,000 global securities. So, incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products; it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that, and the client take-up around Composite Price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto-execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients the more they can use auto execution, so it does tie in to the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking streaming price protocols, and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices or RFQ as we are looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Rick McVey Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices, and so the technology here. It's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And to date, institutional investors have stuck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up, I do think it's possible that streaming prices especially to more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency. And when the market is ready to go in that direction then we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler Hey, guys. Good morning. Rick McVey Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler I want to go back to a question earlier on high yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high yield open trading has really accelerated in the last couple of quarters. I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters; previously, it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETF, I just want to understand is are the ETF market makers what has driven the vast majority that acceleration or there are other factors? Rick McVey There are other factors as a key ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high yield trading overall and open trading adoptions specifically from one only investment managers. And a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high yield trading environment which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in funds flow. So I think it's a combination of adoption by not only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler Okay, yes, make sense, Rick. And then on the some of the discussions around new functionality trend that you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process, when should we expect to actually see you roll out that functionality and talk about kind of the discussions the consulting you are doing with the buy side trading desks as you work on those developments? Tony DeLise Yes, there is no set timetable like anything that we do. We are out talking to both dealer and investor clients to see if we could add value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we are at mid-stream on those conversations. And depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around a faster, more active protocol for new issue trading, we will be ready to roll it out. So there is no set timetable, but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open. Chris Allen Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we have been seeing lately in September, October, I'm wondering if there is any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets in Eurobonds? Obviously, Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in periods and you know, it's has been a little bit flatter. And looking at September to the summer period, so any commentary there would be helpful? Rick McVey So Chris, you are looking for some comments on October or for the third quarter? Chris Shutler Yes, just in terms of I mean you kind of noted that things picked up in the back-half of September continuing into October, something like more of those comments are more focused on high grade and high yield. So just wondering how the other buckets are trending as well? Rick McVey You saw from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets in Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think that one thing that points to -- this is more particularly for the emerging market than Eurobonds right now, market volumes are still struggling. So even we gave some commentary that October market volumes for U.S. investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one it's while healthier than the third quarter, you are not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Tony DeLise On the last one, Chris, euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from tracks and others sources, euros look to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for U.S. high grade and U.S. yield. Chris Allen Got it, and just from an overall perspective you are seeing changes in client behavior at all? Or it's just the environment has got a little bit better and trading activities are kind of picking up? Just trying to think about this could be treated like we saw on the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming and participating maybe a little bit quieter in these periods? Rick McVey I would separate the two but the clearly the broad based gains that we are seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products this is shaping up to be one of our strongest years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual for fact it's being driven more by EM, high yield and euros this year than it is in high grade, but even high grade up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively, the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we have ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trading behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment. And we obviously can't control that. It ebbs and flows with various factors. And it hit the trough for the year in July and August and then September and October we are seeing it rebound. It looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So, I would separate those two factors. Tony DeLise Hey, you know, jumping again on this particular point, but look these are longer term trends across all the products where we have more client engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading at the bigger piece across all of our core products. Open trading is the bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products. That's up hundred clients just in the past year. So it's just the network and the engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen Makes sense. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell Hey, thanks. So we have kind of stable pricing in high grade. And Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So appreciate the update here on October volumes, but are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten? And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightened duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter or next year? Tony DeLise Yes. So, Jeremy, it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We have been -- and the thing that we look at more is around years of maturity and where absolute yields are. But we are not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just be investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four product is very consistent with the third quarter. And as Rick, pointed before that you may see a mix of multiple products. So one product rolling faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture, but the individual product level notes no change. Jeremy Campbell Got it, thanks, and then just setting back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted about 150 bips of year-over-year expansion on -- in high-grade market share. I guess kind of going forward, you know, what types of shares gains should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the outside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Tony DeLise You know, it's a little bit of both, I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility that would be helpful to our share gains and as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where when new issues are extremely active there is a slice of trace that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of. So the new issue market has that impact, but we're playing a long game. We take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be five or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit and these are very large markets. We have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell Got it. And then one quick one; and I apologize if I missed this, but Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year is going to be 21 to 22, any sense of what we should expect into '19? Tony DeLise Yes, sure Jeremy, so we hadn't completed the budget process yet for 2019, so we're not prepared at least today to give you definitive range, but that said I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you look to 2018, and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate would be right around 24%. That's really the jumping off point for 2019. But the difficult part is -- it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this that sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefits there would be around $2 million. So jumping off point -- and again, budget's not complete, jumping off point 24%, rolling some excess tax benefits. So, to be something less than 24%, but when we get to this January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Fannon Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that -- I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses. You talked about some headcount that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we looked at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months. Tony DeLise Sure, Daniel, I study on the expenses, I mean, this is -- we are still investing for the future. We are -- you know, we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There's some regulatory related spend as well -- and just on the tax rate, you know, we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January, but you know, again thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9% and then if you look longer term the past five years, the compound annual growth rate has also been about 9% and we're going to continue -- we had plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion in our infrastructure. I suggest taking history into account and at least -- from modeling out sort of early models on 2019, will give more color in January, but that 9% that's where we've been and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Dan Fannon Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million and I appreciate the commentary on October and you know, the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here in -- for the last several quarters, but I guess, as we think about a higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Tony DeLise Dan, if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate node activity matters, but if you take those all aside and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yes, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture and I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every one percentage point, change in yield across the yield curve -- you know, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So again if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture, but there are -- there's so many things that influence fee capture around, years of maturity, trade size, dealer mix. There's just a lot that goes into the mix on U.S. high-grade. Dan Fannon Got it, thank you. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill.

NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.

""Product diversification is evident in the results with a record 9.2% estimated high-yield market share, 22% year-on-year increase in emerging market trading volume and a 28% increase in Eurobond volumes. We are encouraged by the improvement in market conditions for credit trading that we started to see in September."" Third Quarter Results Total revenues for the third quarter of 2018 increased 6.1% to $101.4 million, compared to $95.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. Operating income was $46.4 million, compared to $46.6 million for the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of 0.5%. Operating margin was 45.8%, compared to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $38.6 million, or $1.02 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $34.1 million, or $0.90 per share, for the third quarter of 2017. Commission revenue for the third quarter of 2018 increased 4.9% to $90.5 million, compared to $86.3 million for the third quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees were $66.0 million on total trading volume of $385.5 billion for the third quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $65.9 million on total trading volume of $346.8 billion for the third quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 17.5% for the third quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 17.2% for the third quarter of 2017. All other revenue increased 17.4% to $10.9 million, compared to $9.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, principally due to higher information services revenue of $0.8 million and post-trade services revenue of $0.8 million. Total expenses for the third quarter of 2018 increased 12.4% to $55.0 million, compared to $48.9 million for the third quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $1.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $1.6 million, marketing and advertising expenses of $0.9 million, technology and communication costs of $0.8 million and employee compensation and benefit costs of $0.8 million, mainly due to an increase in headcount. Occupancy costs in the third quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.9 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.04. Other income increased to $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018 from $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 due to a $0.7 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 19.3%, compared to 27.7% for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $0.4 million reduction to the provisional tax charge recorded in 2017 in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The third quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $3.8 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Dividend The Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on November 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 7, 2018. Share Repurchases A total of 31,500 shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.1 million. Balance Sheet Data As of September 30, 2018, total assets were $646.1 million and included $446.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of September 30, 2018 was $578.6 million. Guidance for 2018 The Company is updating its full year 2018 overall effective tax rate guidance to a range of 21.0% to 22.0%, down from the previous guidance of 23.0% to 25.0%. The reduction is primarily due to excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that were exercised during 2018. The Company expects that full year 2018 expenses will be near the low-end of the $220.0 million to $232.0 million guidance range. The expense guidance includes duplicate occupancy costs of approximately $7.0 million for the Company’s new corporate offices in New York during the build-out phase. The Company also expects that full year 2018 capital expenditures will be near the high-end of the $43.0 million to $50.0 million guidance range. The capital expenditure guidance includes approximately $26.0 million of buildout costs for the new corporate offices.

Michael,Gordon,1826,https://www.theledger.com/news/20181024/jury-to-deliberate-in-brutal-haines-city-stabbing-trial,"BARTOW — Twelve jurors will begin deliberating today in the murder case of Terrell Williams, who is accused in the 2015 armed robbery of a pawn shop and the slayings of two Haines City women who became victims of the attempted getaway. As they deliberate, they’ll consider Williams’ brief testimony Wednesday, when he told them he didn’t join up with the three assailants until after they had robbed the Auburndale pawn shop, and that he had nothing to do with the killings. During the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that the assailants robbed the pawn shop and led law enforcement on a high-speed chase to Haines City, often firing on the pursuing officers, before crashing their car outside the Chanler Ridge subdivision in Haines City. All four in the car fled after the crash, authorities said, and deputies would apprehend Williams hiding in a shed behind a home in the subdivision. After running from the crashed car, 38-year-old Michael Gordon forced his way into the home of 72-year-old Patricia Moran and her daughter, Deborah Royal, 51, and fatally stabbed them dozens of times before stealing their car, crashing it through the garage door. He was apprehended a short distance away. Assistant State Attorney Kristie Ducharme told jurors Wednesday in her closing argument that Williams, 33, of Haines City, was equally as involved in the crime rampage as Gordon, of Lakeland, and the other two alleged assailants, Jovan Lamb, 33, and Devonere McCune, 26, both of Haines City. She said the men conspired to rob the store and worked in partnership to fire on the law enforcement officers while trying to get away. During the two-week trial, she presented 43 witnesses who detailed the series of crimes that occurred late that afternoon in January 2015. Tampa lawyer Daniel Hernandez presented only one witness – Williams. In his testimony, Williams said he never touched the revolver he’s accused of using during the robbery at the Cash America Pawn Shop in Auburndale. When asked where he got the jewelry authorities found hidden in his sock when he was arrested, he said he’d found it in the car after he’d joined the others. Authorities later linked the jewelry with the pawn shop robbery. When asked why he was running from police, Williams told jurors he panicked, as anyone would in the same situation. But Ducharme told jurors that Williams’ testimony Wednesday stood in stark contrast to statements he’d made to law enforcement shortly after his arrest. She also noted that forensic testing uncovered his DNA in a rubber glove thought to have been used in the robbery. But Hernandez discounted that evidence, saying in his closing arguments that DNA cannot be dated, and Williams admitted to frequently handling rubber gloves at an apartment where the gloves were kept. Hernandez emphasized that Williams is accused of wearing a hoodie that was later found in the Haines City neighborhood where the four men were arrested, but Williams’ DNA wasn’t on it. “He has denied these crimes,” he told jurors, “and his explanation is consistent with innocence.” Williams is the first of the four co-defendants to stand trial. Gordon’s trial is scheduled for January and Lamb will face a jury a month later. McCune had pleaded guilty to armed robbery in April 2017 in exchange for the state dropping the murder charges and for his testimony against the other defendants. Prosecutors filed a motion last month to set aside the plea agreement after McCune told prosecutors he would take the Fifth Amendment, affording him the right to remain silent, if he was called to testify. A hearing on that motion is set for Nov. 9. Suzie Schottelkotte can be reached at suzie.schottelkotte@theledger.com or 863-533-9070. Follow her on Twitter @southpolkscene.

Michael,Gordon,1826,https://themoscowtimes.com/articles/us-group-bangs-on-a-can-in-zaryadye-63303,"Courtesy of Zaryadye Concert Hall Moscow’s Zaryadye concert hall opened in September with a mind to bringing new audiences to the realm of classical music. There is perhaps no better act on their fall line-up to do this than the Bang on a Can All-Stars, who are set to play at the hall tonight. The All-Stars are the touring sextet of the New York-based Bang on a Can, a contemporary music organization which is unique in the world of classical music. They regularly commission new works, run their own summer institute, and even have their own record label. Bang on a Can was founded by composers David Lang, Michael Gordon, and Julia Wolfe. In 1987, they decided to hold a 12-hour long concert of contemporary music, where, thankfully, the audience was encouraged to come and go as it pleased. To define the group in terms of the traditional framework of the classical music world is quite difficult. Organizationally, they lie somewhere between an itinerant ensemble and an major institution, and, as the double bassist Robert Black described, are “part classical contemporary ensemble and part rock band.” While they have collaborated with leading figures in the classical world like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, they also have branched out to other genres, working with the jazz saxophonist Ornette Coleman and the Sonic Youth guitarist Thurston Moore. The ensemble’s clarinetist, Ken Thomson, told The Moscow Times in an interview upon arrival in the Russian capital that “we’re looking for people who are experimenting in their genre, in the avant-garde of whatever they’re doing. We’re not working with [American Idol winner] Kelly Clarkson.” Related to their willingness to cross boundaries, the ensemble emphasizes making their programs accessible to audiences. They avoid the more academic and esoteric elements of contemporary classical music, and as a result, Black finds, “when people come to a Bang on a Can concert, they’re not put off or outraged.” Thomson explained that when performing “we try to be a little bit less formal than the traditional classical concert in that we talk to the audience. We’re not all getting up there in tuxedos, playing some strange music and then leaving again. We’re trying to have some conversation.” At Zaryadye, the All-Stars will be performing a collaborative piece by the Bang on a Can founders Lang, Gordon, and Wolfe called “Road Trip.” It premiered in 2017 and is now being performed outside the United States for the first time. Black called the piece “energetic,” and Thomson elaborated that it is “the stadium rock show that they never got to have because they’re classical composers.” Both were thrilled to be playing it under the fine tuned acoustics at the new hall. Tickets are still available for this unique musical event. Concert on Thursday (October 25) at 7 p.m. Zaryadye Concert Hall. 6 Ulitsa Varvarka, Bldg. 4.

Michael,Gordon,1826,https://www.albernivalleynews.com/home/election-2018-high-school-students-get-involved-in-port-alberni-election/,"Hailie Baxter, Elyssa Rakusan and Emily Cutforth helped to organize the student vote at Alberni District Secondary School. ELENA RARDON PHOTO ADSS students held their own student vote While Port Alberni residents were voting for their municipal leaders last week, students at Alberni District Secondary School were also holding their own “mock” election. Students Emily Cutforth, Elyssa Rakusan and Hailie Baxter—all members of Anne Ostwald’s Social Justice class at ADSS—helped to organize the student vote. By visiting different classrooms across the school, they explained the rules of the student vote and introduced the different candidates for mayor, city council and School District 70. “We wanted to encourage more students to participate,” said Cutforth. “And we wanted them to talk to their parents about voting,” added Rakusan, noting that the voter turnout “hasn’t been very good” in Port Alberni for the past few years. The student vote included a polling station with ballots. “We tried to simulate as much as we could an actual voting station,” said Cutforth. “[Students] had the option to vote or not, just like they do in a real election.” The student vote came very close to the results of the “real” municipal election. Sharie Minions earned the mayoral victory, and students selected four out of the six winning councillors (Cindy Solda, Helen Poon, Debbie Haggard and Ron Corbeil). Students also correctly selected five out of the six winning school district trustees (Connie Watts, Larry Ransom, John Bennie, Pam Craig and Rosemarie Buchanan). Cutforth, Rakusan and Baxter said they had expected these close results after the all-candidates meeting that was organized by another class. Once students got a chance to see their prospective municipal leaders, the votes started coming in the same way, said Rakusan. READ: Alberni District Secondary School students ask the tough questions “After the all-candidates meeting, we expected it to be closer to the actual vote,” added Baxter. The three students added that they “weren’t really surprised” by the final results of the actual election. “I think we all expected Sharie [Minions] to win,” said Baxter. “Everyone seemed to like her.” “She had a good platform,” added Cutforth. “Everyone knew her from council, so she had the experience. But at the same time, she was new and different.” Final results for the ADSS student vote: Mayor Sharie Marie Minions = 125 Mike Eugene Ruttan = 77 Denis Edward Sauve = 68 John Maxwell Douglas = 62 Kevin Allan Wright = 29 Gary Edwin Robertson = 23 Rejected votes = 3 Councillor Cindy Nadine Solda = 143 Helen Poon = 140 Michael Gordon Moore = 127 Debbie Jo Haggard = 113 Helen Rose Robertson = 93 Ron Maurice Corbeil = 84 Char Anne Patterson = 74 Matthew Daniel Pearson = 70 Kris Michael Patterson = 69 Rick Daniel Ethier = 67 Hira Lal Chopra = 64 Todd Grant Patola = 59 Dan Wayne Washington = 59 Seva Kaur Dhaliwal = 57 Ron Allan Paulson = 55 Christopher Joseph Alemany = 54 Aaron Christopher Brevick = 54 Blain Pouliot = 50 Jerome Ernest Henrik Luchka = 44 Karl Eugene Hamagishi = 37 Rejected votes = 3 School District 70 (Alberni) Connie Linda Watts = 128 Larry Charles Ransom = 122 John William Bennie = 120 Pam Ann Craig = 120 Rebecca Clare Standley = 109 Rosemarie Maxine Buchanan = 100 Cherilyn Elizabeth Bray = 99 James RK Brook = 94 Jane Jones = 94 Christine Maria Washington = 81 Karrine Elizabeth Magnussen = 78 Rejected votes = 3 elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.com River-Port Danceworks brings together professional and student dancers Alberni author Jacqueline Carmichael was inspired by the words of her grandfather Food service is one of four finalists for the Pot Luck Ceramics $10,000 grant Service dog helps retired veteran break his ‘fight or flight’ reaction to PTSD It is a favourite place for people to go for a long walk Cadets are sponsored by the Royal Canadian Legion Branch #293 Premier John Horgan will debate in favour of reform, while Opposition Liberal Leader Andrew Wilkinson will make the case for keeping the current system Little uptake on incentive programs for fencing frustrates local conservation officer In an interview for a documentary marking his 70th birthday, the heir to the throne said he will have to act differently once king The fire broke out late Wednesday night at the Northmart store Cliff Graydon says he is only guilty of having a sense of humour that stems from another era One key issue is whether residents can supply neighbours during drought Strong labour force, GDP expected to keep market strong The shelter, put on by Abbotsford’s 5 and 2 Ministries, became the first 50-plus shelter last year New listing features several Vernon players River-Port Danceworks brings together professional and student dancers ‘Festival of lights’ celebrates triumph of light over dark, good over evil Telus Corp. reported a third-quarter profit of $447 million, up from $406 million a year ago, and raised its dividend.

MarketAxess Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:MKTX)Q3 2018 Earnings Conference CallOct. 24, 2018, 10:00 a.m. ET Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today October 24, 2018. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir. David Cresci -- Investor Relations Manager Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2018 conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter and will provide update on trends in our businesses; and then Tony DeLise, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Rick. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2018 results. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results driven by increased market share across all of our core products and continued robust open trading activity. Overall, trading volume of $386 billion was up 11% compared to Q3, 2017. Our estimated US high-grade market share of 17.5% was up from 17.2% last year. Estimated high-yield market share shows strong growth and reached the record 9.2%, up from 6.9% in the same period last year. Third quarter revenue of $101 million was up 6% compared to Q3, 2017. Operating income for the quarter was $46 million and diluted EPS was up 13% to $1.02. Expenses of $55 million were up 12% including $1.9 million in duplicate rent expense for our new offices in Hudson Yards. We expect to move into our new headquarters by the end of the year. Open trading adoption continues to accelerate. Additionally, emerging market and Eurobond volumes, both saw a rapid growth during the quarter. Slide four provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions for credit trading were soft in the third quarter. Credit spreads were tighter, volatility fell and core product market volumes declined on average 14% from the second quarter. Overall, trading conditions improved in September and into October. The combination of higher treasury yields, widening credit spreads and elevated new issue activity has led to a much better trading environment for our business. While market trading conditions have been mixed over recent months, share gains across products have been strong and position the company well for future growth . Slide five provides an update on open trading. Open trading volume growth accelerated during the quarter and was up 58% to a near record level of $88 billion. Average daily volume was $1.4 billion also up 58%. Open trading represented 23% of our volume in Q3, up from 16% last year. Over 282,000 open trading transactions were completed in the third quarter, up from 155,000 in Q3, 2017. Open trading liquidity providers or price makers on the platform drove approximately 1.5 million price responses, representing a 107% increase in activity in the third quarter. During the quarter, over 750 firms provided prices through open trading and over a 1,000 firms completed at least one open trade. Liquidity takers saved an estimated $36 million in transaction costs for open trading on the system, up 68% from the third quarter last year. Participants benefited from average transaction cost savings of approximately 1.9 basis points of yield when they completed a US high-grade transaction through open trading protocols. Importantly, open trading volume is growing rapidly across all four core products as dealer and investor clients embrace this new source of liquidity. We believe the breadth and depth of our global credit liquidity solution differentiates MarketAxess from the competition. Slide six provides an update on our products and geographic diversification. Our US high-yield product experienced another quarter of rapid growth. Record estimated high-yield market share of 9.2% led to a year-over-year volume increase of 27%. Our European business continued its strong performance for the year. MiFID II has had a positive impact on client trading behavior leading to a 21% increase in volume with European clients. Eurobond volumes from European clients were up 33% year-over-year and EM volumes were up 32%. We are continuing our preparations for Brexit in the event there is a hard exit. We are adding senior staff to our new office in Amsterdam and our applications with the Dutch regulator are progressing as expected. Client documentation changes are under way to avoid trading disruptions in any exit scenario. Global emerging market volume was up 22% with strong growth in both external debt markets as well as the 26 local EM markets that currently trade on the platform. We now have over 650 international client firms active on this system representing an 18% increase in the number of institutions year-over-year. Our growing footprint in international credit trading significantly expands the long-term growth opportunity for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Tony to discuss the financial results in greater detail. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Rick . Please turn to slide seven for a summary of our trading volume across product categories. US high-grade volumes were $206 billion for the quarter, up 3% year-over-year, a slight increase in estimated market share accounted for the uplift in trading volume as US high-grade TRACE volumes were flat year-over-year. Year-to-date estimated US high-grade market share is up 1 percentage point. In spite of weak market volumes or other credit category trading volumes were up 25% year-over-year. We estimate that market volumes across European corporate bonds, emerging markets in US high-yield bonds were down more than 10% in the aggregate. Healthy market share gains were the main driver behind the 28% growth in Eurobond volumes, 27% growth in high yield volume and 22% growth in emerging markets volume. With six important trading days remaining in October, estimated US high-grade and high-yield market volumes are more than 20% ahead of third quarter levels. Estimated US high-grade market share is running similar to the third quarter level, and estimated high-yield market share is running well ahead of the third quarter level. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Overall revenue was up 6% year-over-year. A 11% increase in trading volume resulted in a 5% uplift in commissions. New data contract accounted for the $800,000 increase in Information Services revenue. The $800,000 increase in post-trade services revenue was principally due to a combination of new MiFID II services and new customers. Expenses were up 12% year-over-year and operating income was flat year-over-year. Excluding duplicate rent expense recognized during the build-out phase of the company's new corporate offices in New York City, operating income was up 4%. The effective tax rate was 19.3% in the third quarter and 21.6% year to date. During the quarter, we recognized $1.7 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards and a $400,000 reduction to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisional charge recorded in 2017. We are updating our guidance range and now expect the effective tax rate for full year 2018 will be between 21% and 22%. Our diluted EPS was $1.02 on a fairly stable diluted share count of 37.8 million shares. On slide nine, we have laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes and fees per million. Total variable transaction fees were flat year-over-year as the 11% increase in trading volume was offset by lower overall fee capture caused by several factors. First, our new high-yield fee plan implemented in the third quarter of 2017 and several high-grade dealer migrations shifted revenue from variable transaction fees to distribution fees. Distribution fees were up $4.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. Second, lower years to maturity and higher yields caused the reduction in our US high-grade fee capture. And third, revisions to the Eurobond fee plan enacted earlier this year resulted in lower Eurobond fee capture. That said, US high-grade fee per million hasn't varied the past three quarters. Years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform was unchanged sequentially and there was no significant change in the percentage of volume in these trade size bucket. Our other credit category fee capture was little changed on a sequential basis. The percentage of volume in the other credit category derived from Eurobonds, emerging markets and high-yield was consistent with the second quarter and there was little change in fee capture at the individual product levels. Slide 10 provides you with the expense detail. Sequentially, expenses were flat as higher depreciation and amortization expense on infrastructure and software investments was offset by lower advertising and trade show spend. The year-over-year increase in expenses were 12%. Excluding the duplicate rent charge, the expense increase was 9%. Despite the soft market conditions, we continue to invest in people, technology and infrastructure. Our full year 2018 expenses are projected to be near the bottom end of the guidance range of $220 million to $232 million inclusive of approximately $7 million in duplicate rent expense. On slide 11, we provide balance sheet information. Cash and investments as of September 30 were $446 million compared to $407 million at year-end 2017. During the third quarter, we had a quarterly cash dividend of $16 million and repurchased 32,000 shares at a cost of $6 million. We also spent $4 million on construction associated with the build-out of the New York City office space. Trailing 12-months free cash flow was a record $178 million. Based on these results, our board has approved a $0.42 regular quarterly dividend. Now let me turn the call back to Rick for some closing comments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Tony. We are pleased with the overall growth and estimated market share across all products during the quarter. Long-term growth priorities continue to gain momentum, including high yield, emerging markets and open trading. The increase in overall credit market volumes over the last several months, provides a much better foundation for growth for our business. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Hey, good morning guys. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Patrick. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Good morning, Patrick. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst So I think one of the key takeaways coming from your recent open market form was I think some conversations around the challenge of having complex and large trades conducted electronically. Can you talk about some of the steps, some the -- efforts that MarketAxess is taking to try to more aggressively go after that space? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I think this is the continuation of changes that we've been making in the system to reduce concerns around information leakage. So as we've talked about in the past, Patrick, we've done quite a bit of work on allowing system participants to lead access in the system and identify offsetting interest in that trade. They can do so with any trade size and have the opportunity work on trade sizes from there. We are talking to market participants about different protocols, in newly issued bonds that we would introduce faster means of execution for a highly liquid bonds in the first period of trading. And then I think the other part to watch is the growing liquidity pool that exists in $3 million and under trade sizes and whether we will start to see a trend toward more of the large trades being broken down into smaller trades sizes. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst Great, thank you for that. And then maybe an expense question for Tony. I know last quarter you talked about you were tracking at around 30 employees in the third quarter. What was the actual period end employee count and how does that -- you had basically flat compensation and benefits expense quarter to quarter. So, should we think about that as maybe lower bonus accrual given what the volume might look like during the quarter? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Patrick, two things in there on the headcount and then what happened quarter-to-quarter on the comp and benefits. And the headcount we ended up at 444 people, which was up right around 15 people from the end of -- at the end of the second quarter. We're sitting here today with another 15 positions where we have to start take in the fourth quarter. So we do expect headcount to rise here through the end of the year, albeit, we don't know what's going to -- what will happen with the attrition but we are sitting on 15 additional adds. On the comp and benefits piece, it looks like it was as the slight increase quarter-to-quarter, but you do have an increase in salaries and benefits, it was around $600,000 increase there. But the bonus accrual was lower, the cash bonus accrual is the formula getting tied to operating performance and quarter to quarter that bonus accrual was down around $700,000. And you can see that's reflective of the market conditions we're referring to. So if you look at market volumes, Q2 to Q3, you saw a pretty healthy decline there. So not necessarily apparent when you look at the -- look at that line on comp and benefits, but there were some offsetting factors in there. Patrick O'Shaughnessy -- Raymond James -- Analyst All right. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Yeah, good morning, Rick, good morning, Tony. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Rich. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And congrats on the uptick in the open trading percentage. I guess the first question is on open trading and it seems like quarter to quarter, I'm not looking year-over-year in here, but the quarter-to-quarter the biggest percentage increase was in high-yield, the others very -- went up by like a 1% or so, but high-yield went up more from the prior quarter from 44% to 52%. Can you tell us like what the market dynamics that drove big of an increase in the high-yield bucket in open trading? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, couple of things that I'd comment on there. What we've observed in terms of open trading percentage by product is the less liquid markets tend to have the highest percentage of OT. And I think that that shows that open trading is providing the highest value and less liquid credit product areas. So that's been the case with high-yield that we've just seen better take up there as our technology is connecting market participants in a very important way to reduce transaction costs in a less liquid market like high-yield. The other thing I'd point out is, we've talked with you and others, Rich, about the activity that's growing around ETF market makers in electronic trading and they're especially relevant in the high-yield. So as those businesses continue to grow and embrace electronic trading, you do see the impact of that in terms of not only overall volumes, but also the activity in OT. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst And just a fallow up here, thanks, Rick. A follow up open trading is, I would assume the ETFs just some comments on auto-ex as well, just the trend there. If open tradings pickup, I assume the auto-ex and the drivers, one of the drivers of ETFs that you would see auto-ex also increasing? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I would actually separate those two things. You're absolutely right about auto execution growing, but I think it's a slightly different driver there. As you well know, the buy side is laser-focused on improving trading efficiency and reducing costs. And one of the outcomes of that is that we're really seeing a new level of automation from investors in how they use the MarketAxess system. And it's gone from high-touch early on to low-touch and now even moving into no-touch. Where the data tools that clients have are so strong that they are able to set parameters pre-trade by which they're perfectly willing to auto execute a transaction on the system. And I think I would look for this trend to grow because it does really help the buy-side with an important objective around trading efficiency. It is equally relevant whether it's a disclosed trade with dealers or an open trade, it's really about do the price responses comeback to meet the clients' preset expectations and as they do, they're willing to auto execute those trades. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Got it. And the last question, Rick, is on the general environment. If you look at 3Q and I think these are from your comments that the July and August were a different tale story compared to September. And then you've seen, I think even more volatility in October, and you may have covered this, but if you did, I missed it. I know you covered the market share in October, but can you talk about like the fee capture trends when you have higher volatility like September, October? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, well, October if you looked at the TRACE volumes for high-grade and high-yield look very much like September. So as we approach the end of October, the September and October market volume run rate is about 22% higher than what we observed in July and August. So we did have a very soft period during the summer months and September and October market volumes have been significantly better. The fee capture is going to depend primarily on product mix. And Tony made some comments about the success that we continue to have in the high-yield market overall, but we'll have our market volumes out at the end of October and the product mix will really drive the fee capture. Richard Repetto -- Sandler O'Neill -- Analyst Understood. Thank you. Thanks for the answers. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Good morning, Kyle. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Good morning. Just a follow-up on auto-ex, but maybe more so on the composite plus product. Really just want to get updated thoughts on the future of composite plus and how this fits into the MarketAxess trading kind of ecosystem. I think maybe it could be used to help facilitate some of these auto-ex functionalities been built into the buy-side. But are there also other revenue generating opportunities for composite plus as well? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. Happy to take that one. We're really pleased to see both dealer and investor clients embracing composite price plus, which is a real-time mid market now on about 20,000 global credit securities. So incredibly valuable pre-trade price indicator, price discovery tool. And I think right now, much like our other data products, it's primarily been used as an additional tool in the trading process. There are many places I think we could go with that over time. I think it's already starting to become relevant in our TCA analytics for clients. And I think that you could even start to see it impact valuations and indices in some way as well. So a lot of effort into that. And the client take up around composite price has been really encouraging. You're absolutely right, it's one of the data tools that does give clients comfort when they are utilizing auto execution technology. So the more data that we can provide to our clients, the more they can use auto execution. So, it does tie into the growing use of auto execution that we're seeing on the system as well. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Okay. And then just going back to the open market forum, there were some participants that were talking about streaming price protocols and how they expect growing adoption of those protocols over time in the market. Can you help us understand what you're developing in terms of streaming price protocols and your views of the adoption versus -- of streaming prices versus RFQ as you're looking out maybe over the next three or five years? Thanks. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sure. I mean we have the technology capabilities to operate streaming price markets already which we do in CDS indices. So the technology series, it's a question really of what do the streaming price quotes look like relative to what institutional investors are able to achieve through an RFQ. And today institutional investors have struck with RFQ because it does create a highly competitive environment for them to achieve best execution. But as dealers get more and more sophisticated with their use of algos and those markets continue to tighten up. I do think it's possible that streaming prices, especially at the more liquid end of the market could offer a combination of strong liquidity and greater trading efficiency when the market is ready to go in that direction and we certainly are ready to go from a technology perspective. Kyle Voigt -- KBW -- Analyst Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Hey guys, good morning. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hi, Chris. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst I wanted to go back to a question earlier on high-yield and just make sure I understand the dynamics here. So the high-yield open trading is really accelerated in last couple of quarters, I think it's gone up 14 percentage points in last two quarters, previously it gone up 14 points over two years. I heard your comments on ETFs, so I just want to understand is -- are the ETF market makers, what has driven the vast majority of that acceleration or are there other factors? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer There are other factors, I think ETF market makers are an important new form of liquidity for investor clients on the platform. And it's obviously creating a better liquidity environment for our buy-side clients. But it's equally relevant to see the growth in high-yield trading overall and open trading adoption specifically from long-only investment managers. And, a year ago, we were dealing with a very benign high-yield trading environment, which really kind of took the ETF market makers out of their relative value trading. The environment for high-yield trading has been a lot better recently with more volatility and more movement in fund flows. So I think it's a combination of adoption by long-only investment managers, greater involvement from the ETF market makers and then an improvement in the market trading conditions for high yield. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay, it makes sense, Rick. And then on the -- assume the discussion around new functionality agenda, you are kind of working on around addressing the new issue process. When should we expect to actually see you rollout that functionality? And just talk about kind of the discussions, the consulting you're doing with the buy-side trading desks as you work on those developments. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yeah, there is no set timetable like anything that we do, we're out talking to both dealer, investor clients to see if we could add more value in newly issued bond trading. And I think we're in midstream on those conversations and depending what we hear back in terms of new protocols around faster, more active protocol for newly issued training, we'll be ready to roll it out. So there's no set timetable but the discussions are taking place. Chris Shutler -- William Blair -- Analyst Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open . Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Morning guys. Appreciate the commentary on the improved environment we've been seeing lately on September-October. Just (ph) any commentary on how things are trending in emerging markets and Eurobonds, obviously Eurobonds has been a source of strength for you guys in recent periods and EM has been a little bit flatter looking at September to the summer period. So any commentary there would be helpful. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer So, Chris, you're looking for some comments on October or what's the third quarter? Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Yeah, just in terms of when you kind of noted the things picked up in the back half of September, continuing to October, but it sounds like more of those comments are more focused on high-grade and invest in -- high yield. Just wondering how the other buckets are trading as well. Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer You saw it from the third quarter numbers that we had very good quarter in both emerging markets and Eurobonds where despite the fact that market volumes were down, we had a big pickup in trading volumes. All of that came from market share gain. I think the one thing that I would point to and this is more particular from emerging markets and Eurobonds right now. Market volumes are still struggling. So even -- we gave some commentary that October market volumes for US investment grade and high yield are running 20% or more above the third quarter, that's not the case for emerging markets right now. So that one while it's healthier than the third quarter, you're not seeing that type of volume pick up. So that will be one thing that is different running into October. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Actually, on the last one, Chris, Euros look based on the estimates that we can derive from traction other sources Euros looked to be more similar to the increases that we talked about for US high-grade and US high-yield. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Got it. I guess just from an overall perspective, you're seeing changes in client behavior or it's just the environments got a little bit better and trade activities kind of picking up. I'm just trying to think about this could be a period like we saw in the first quarter this year and then things starting to slow down or maybe new entrants are kind of coming in, new participants have maybe have been little bit quieter on these periods? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer I'd separate the two, but clearly the broad based gains that we're seeing in market share reflect a change in client trading behavior. And if you look across the four core products, this is shaping up to be one of our strongest year ever -- years ever for market share gains overall. And what might be a little bit unusual of the fact that it's being driven more by EM, high-yield and Euros this year than it is in high-grade, but even high-grade is up about 1% in share year-over-year. And collectively the four products show one of the best year-over-year share gains that we've ever had. So that reflects the ongoing electronification of the credit markets and the change in trade behavior that's taking place by both dealers and investors. The second part is market environment that we obviously can't control that, it ebbs and flows with various factors. And if it hits the trough for the year in July and August, and September, and October, we would see a rebound, it looks like it's back toward more like Q2 levels. So I would separate those two factors. Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer I hate to keep on jump again on this particular point. But -- look, these are longer-term trends across all the products where we have more clients engaged and trading across each product. There is open trading, the bigger piece across all of our core products, open trading to bigger percentage of volume. We have more clients, and trading multiple products. We just ended up the third quarter where we now have more than 850 clients that are trading three or more products, that's up the 100 clients just in the past year. So just see the network and engagement with clients across all products is just expanding. Chris Allen -- Compass Point -- Analyst Thanks guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Thanks. So we've kind of stable pricing in high-grade, and Tony, I think you mentioned duration of bonds was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter. So, appreciate the update here on October volumes. But are you guys seeing duration of traded volumes in October either extend or tighten. And if we just get a kind of continuation of tightening duration, what's the outlook for pricing into the next quarter and next year? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. So, Jeremy, you know it's obviously early in the quarter here. We aren't seeing any significant change in duration right now. We've been -- and the thing that we look at more as around years to maturity and what absolute yields are, we're not seeing a big change in the years to maturity. The fee capture -- and this wouldn't just the investment grade but the fee capture in October at the individual product level for the core four products is very consistent with the third quarter. And Rick pointed out before that you may see a mix among the products or one product growing faster than the other and that would influence overall fee capture but the individual product level, no change. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it, thanks. Let me just stepping back a little more big picture, I think you guys have historically kind of targeted at about 150 bps of year-over-year expansion in high-grade market share. I guess on a go-forward, what types of share gains, would we -- should we expect from kind of blocking and tackling and executing on things under control like open trading and things like that versus some of the upside potential should the macro market dynamic improve a bit? Richard McVey -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer It's a little bit above, which I think our share gains are more evident when volatility picks up. So if we are embarking on a new period of higher volatility, that would be helpful to our share gains. And as you know our share gains also ebb and flow with new issue activity where new issues are extremely active. There is a slice of TRACE that is in those newly issued bonds that we currently have a lower share of, so the new issued market has that impact. But you know we're playing the long game, we take a very long-term view on this and the metrics that I care about when I think about where I hope the company will be in 5 or 10 years from now, really look very healthy to me. And Tony just outlined some of them, but if you really do the work on the share momentum broadly and not just high-grade, you will see that there is a clear trend going on, on the system with client behavior embracing more electronic trading across credit. And these are very large markets, we have an incredibly strong market position and we're really pleased with what we see in terms of the share story. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Got it. And then just one quick one, and apologies if I missed this. But Tony, I think you kind of -- you referenced the tax rate for this year going to be 21% to 22%. Any sense of what we should expect into '19? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Sure, Jeremy. We haven't completed the budget process yet for 2019. So we're not prepared at least today to give you a definitive range. But that said, I'll give you a little bit of color. So if you looked at 2018 and you excluded windfall tax benefits from stock based compensation, the year-to-date effective tax rate will be right around 24%. So that's really been jumping-off point for 2019. But the difficult part is it's difficult sitting here today to predict those excess tax benefits because we don't know the share price for stock options, we don't know the timing of whether stock options will be exercised. I can tell you this, sitting here today, based on today's share price that in January when we have a round of restricted stock vesting, the tax benefit, there would be around $2 million. So jumping-off point, and again, but it's not complete jumping-off point 24% roll into an excess tax benefit. So it would be something less than 24%. But when we get to the January call, we'll give you more color and try and narrow down a range for you. Jeremy Campbell -- Barclays -- Analyst Perfect. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Thanks. I guess, Tony, just building upon that, I know the budget is not done, but maybe if you can give us the framework to think about 2019 expenses, you talked about some head count that's coming on in the fourth quarter. Is there -- if you think about the environment getting better or we look at the summer, I guess, it doesn't -- just wondering if you're looking at spending any differently on some of the new initiatives or outlook as we think about the next 12 months? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, sure, Daniel. I'll tell you on the expense, I mean, this is, we are still investing for the future. We are -- we're still investing in geographic expansion, launching new protocols. There is some regulatory related spend as well. And as I just said on the tax rate that we haven't completed the process yet. And we will give you more color in January. But again, thinking about 2018, if you take the duplicate rent out and even we've had some impact from foreign exchange change, but if you pull those two out, the expense increase for this year is about 9%. And then if you look longer-term, the past five years, the compound annual growth rates also been about 9%. And we're going to continue. We have plans to continue to invest in the platform, new protocols, geographic expansion, in our infrastructure. I'd suggest taking history into account at least for modeling out sort of early models on 2019, we'll give you more color in January. But that 9%, that's where we've been, and that's probably a pretty good starting point. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. And then just a follow-up on the transaction fee per million, and I appreciate the commentary on October. And the resiliency in high-grade has been consistent here for the last several quarters. But I guess, as we think about higher rate environment, is there something different that's happening that we shouldn't think about shorter duration of having a negative impact on that just because of mix or is that still the right way to think of it? Antonio DeLise -- Chief Financial Officer Dan, if we were just -- if we were just isolating that one factor and realizing that years to maturity matters, trade size matters, dealer mix matters, floating rate note activity matters. But, if you take those all side and leave them constant, all we're talking about is a rising yield environment. Yeah, you're likely to see some decline in fee capture. I've given some sort of color or some range in the past where for every 1 percentage point change in yield across the yield curve, it could be something like $10 per million or $15 per million. So you again, if you're keeping everything else constant, you would see a decline in fee capture. But there are -- that is costing us so many things and influence fee capture around years to maturity, trade size, dealer mix, there's just a lot that goes into the mix on US high-grade. Daniel Fannon -- Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Thank you. Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from a Rich Repetto with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.

John,O'Neil,1824,https://www.timesleader.com/news/722603/w-b-police-officer-slashed-with-knife,"WILKES-BARRE — A city officer’s finger was slashed by a knife-wielding man who barricaded himself inside a Regent Street house late Wednesday, court records show. Police responded to a noise complaint at 62 Regent St. just before 11 p.m. and learned an occupant, John O’Neil, 54, had an arrest warrant issued Oct. 5 for disorderly conduct. O’Neil became irate and refused to exit the house, records say. Police allege O’Neil screamed and yelled he wasn’t going to be arrested and wasn’t going back to jail. O’Neil also allegedly threatened to stab officers if they did not get off his property. Police requested several times for O’Neil to exit the house. O’Neil reportedly told officers he was armed with knives. A battering ram was used in an attempt to force open a rear door, police said. The force of the impact caused a hole in the door that did not open due to objects O’Neil allegedly placed against it. When an officer reached through the hole, O’Neil slashed at the officer’s hand and caused a deep laceration to his finger. Officers eventually entered the house and arrested O’Neil after a struggle. The officer was treated at a local hospital. This week’s incident follows police visits to O’Neil’s residence Oct. 5 and Oct. 6 when he was cited with disorderly conduct for loud music. During one encounter, police said O’Neil used a microphone connected to speakers to scream at officers, claiming he was God and a sovereign citizen. O’Neil was arraigned Thursday by District Judge Ferris Webby in Luzerne County Central Court on charges of assault of a law enforcement officer, simple assault, terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct. He was jailed at the county lockup for lack of $30,000 bail. Court records show O’Neil was sentenced by a Luzerne County judge in June 2005 to two years on probation on charges he assaulted an Edwardsville police officer.

Karen,Cummings,1823,https://thecounty.me/2018/10/24/news/snow-from-today-is-not-expected-to-stick-around/,"Username or Email Address Password Remember Me CARIBOU, Maine — Snnow wreaked havoc on drivers across northern and coastal Maine Wednesday, with more than seven inches of snow recorded in some parts of Aroostook County by the afternoon. Janet Crowley, a Houlton resident, said she was “shocked” by how slippery the roads were when she went to work just after 8 a.m. “I pulled out of my driveway and nearly spun in a circle on a patch of ice,” she said. “I drove 20 miles per hour all the way to work and I still had a hard time.” Police reported numerous accidents and cars off the road in Hodgdon, Houlton, Littleton, Presque Isle, Caribou and in the St. John Valley. Nearly 50 vehicles slipped off the road across much of coastal Maine and in Greater Bangor during some of the first snow of the season, according to Maine State Police. Some of the most common troubles spots included Routes 17 and 32 in Lincoln and Knox counties, Route 9 in Hancock and Washington counties and along Interstate 95 between Etna and the Old Town area, state police spokesman Stephen McCausland wrote in an email. Most cars slipped off the road because drivers were going too fast for the conditions, he said. As of 9:30 a.m., no severe injuries were reported. In most cases, vehicles sustained minor damage. A moderate to heavy snow band was located over U.S. Route 1 and the northern end of Interstate 95 just after noon, according to the weather service. Mark Bloomer, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Caribou, said Wednesday afternoon that 7 inches of snow had been recorded in Sherman by 2 p.m., followed by 6.5 inches in nearby Patten. Rangeley had received 5.3 inches, while Bridgewater and Cary in Aroostook and Topsfield in Washington County picked up 3 inches. The 2” inches of snow recorded in Caribou Wednesday broke the previous record for this date in 1981 of 1.3 inches, according to the NWS. Snow was expected to continue through Wednesday, with little additional accumulations. Snow began falling at about 7 a.m. in the Houlton area, and roughly two inches had fallen by 11:30 a.m. The weather service indicated the community might get up to 5 inches by the time the storm ends early Thursday morning. Karen Cummings of Houlton said Wednesday that she canceled a planned trip to Presque Isle due to the snowfall. “I don’t have my snow tires on yet, and I don’t trust people during the first storm of the year,” she said. “Even people who have lived in the state all of their lives seem to forget how to drive.” Thursday and Friday are expected to be dry, but temperatures will be lower than normal for late October. NWS Meteorologist Todd Foisy said on Monday that the earliest Aroostook County has ever seen snow was on Sept. 29, 1991. Snow in October is not abnormal, he said, with some falling “between 20 and 30 times” since record keeping began in 1929. Foisy said that the average date for snow to fall in The County is on Oct. 26. The most snow ever recorded in October fell in the Caribou area in 1963, when 9.4 inches was recorded. The second highest total, 7.6 inches, fell in 1959 in the Caribou area. Writers Eesha Pendharkar and Judy Harrison of the Bangor Daily News contributed to this report.

It is after a major signaling problem between Woking and Surbiton this morning left South Western warning passengers not to travel. Both South Western Railway and Network Rail have apologised for the problems which caused havoc for commuters, compounded by a second day of strike action which had already seen a third of services canceled. James Crook from Network Rail said: ""There's a chance that services will be disrupted later on through the day. ""The strike action has made things more challenging for South Western Railway today, of course it's frustrating for passengers - passengers do deserve better. ""Performance hasn't been where we want it to be recently, particularly on the stretch into Waterloo - it's a really heavily used stretch of track. ""We're doing everything we can to improve this and we totally understand that things haven't been good enough recently and things need to improve."" ⚠️ *UPDATE 24/10* Network Rail fixed the signalling fault by 11 am and we are now able to run services through the affected area. However, disruption is expected through the rest of the day whilst we try to recover and make sure we have the right crew and train stock in place.

James,Crook,1822,https://www.pendletoday.co.uk/sport/more-sport/international-flavour-for-trawden-ac-1-9413183,"There was an international flavour for Trawden AC runners at the weekend, with a group heading off to Amsterdam. Jo Lovick raced the full marathon in a time well inside four and a half hours, while nine of her club-mates were in action in the half marathon. Michael Wrigley was fastest of them, followed by John McDonald, David Howard, Ashley Eastwood, Ian Hothersall, David Pickles, David Greenwood, Verity Brown and Gillian Greenwood. A bit closer to home, and club chairman Paul Brown completed another sub-three hour marathon when competing in the Abingdon event on Sunday. Some of the biggest clubs and best fell runners in the country got together just outside Ambleside on Saturday for the annual British Fell Relay Championships. The event, over some of the Lake District’s most gruelling terrain, is run over four legs, with the first and last run individually, and the middle two in pairs. Trawden had two teams in action, with Tom Cosway, Craig Storozuk, David Fort, Mick Dobson, Adrian Blackledge and James Crook taking the men’s team to 102nd place, while Jamie Osborne, Susie Pedder, Lucy Brown, Peter Stobbs, Jamie McIlvenny and Emily O’Connor took the mixed team to 170th place. Over 250 teams started the event, with many not completing the toughest race in the event’s recent history. Saturday saw one of then final club championship races of the season, with seven members taking part in the Standish Hall Trail Race in Wigan. Sean Fitzpatrick secured a top 50 finish, Dawn Tibbs won her age category, and there were also strong finishes for Emma Walker, Colin Smith, Sarah Roberts, Karen Windle and Elaine Corcoran. And on Sunday, the club’s winter series started with the Rodney Round in Colne. Of the 50 entrants, David McCabe was first over the line followed by Martin Greenwood. Tom Cosway and Mick Dobson were next home, despite the fell running exertions of the previous day. And Fionnuala Swan was first lady home. ©2018 Johnston Publishing Ltd.All rights reserved.",0.0,2.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,1016901,0.8905882487407198,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
James,Crook,1822,https://www.pendletoday.co.uk/sport/more-sport/juniors-steal-the-headlines-on-busy-weekend-for-trawden-1-9413272,"It was another busy weekend for Trawden AC members with marathons, half marathons, epic fell races and the start of two cross country leagues. The Red Rose Cross Country League got underway at Leigh Sports Village on Saturday, with the juniors stealing the headlines. In the Under 11 Boys, Stan Stephenson, Harry Smith and Daniel Brown took Trawden to first place and Matthew Fleming, William Walker and Ben Stratton repeated that feat in the Under 13 race. Charlotte Robertshaw, Tamzin Osborne and Leah Harvey secured fifth place in the Under 11 Girls; Joss Waiting, Eve Hartley and Isabel Holt were seventh in the Under 13 Girls; Harrry Beechey, Joe Sims and Will Rowlands took eighth in the Under 15 Boys and Abigail Stratton, Ellie Singleton and Amelia Dugdale finished fifth in the Under 15 Girls. In the ladies’ race, Christina Singleton, Helen Buchan and Nicola Nuttall finished sixth, the same trio securing fifth in the veterans’ race. And Paul Redman, David Lord, Jamie Osborne, Adrian Blackledge, James Crook and Kevin Fenton-Clough took the men’s team to ninth place with Redman, Lord, Osborne and Blackledge seventh in the veterans’ race. Saturday also saw the start of the Mid Lancs Cross Country League in Ulverston. The ladies’ A team of Dawn Tibbs, Julie Townson and Emma Walker finished 19th, with the B team of Victoria Rogan, Karen WIndle and Verity Brown in 30th place. In the men’s event, Martin Greenwood, Mick Dobson, Stephen Hartley, John McDonald and Ian Hothersall steered the men to 20th place. Fionnuala Swann completed the epic Langdale Horseshoe Fell Race and finished 15th lady. On Sunday, in the Yorkshire Marathon, David Fort was first Trawden runner home in three hours 13 minutes, and there were strong performances from Sean Fitzpatrick, Dennis Smith and Darran Stobbs. Tracey Deed completed her first marathon, a year after finishing the Couch to 5k running programme. Fifteen Trawden runners were in action in the ever-popular Manchester Half Marathon, with Jordan Strachan leading them home in 1:22. Next home was Kirk Butler in 1:33, and the others were Stuart Brown, Lee Ford, Pip Larter, Gary Sutcliffe, Edward Lee, Andy Cooper, Andy Lamb, Ben Murray, Sarah Spence, Ian Barton, Diane Ford, Lucy McPherson and Andrew Duffy - many recording PBs or finishing their first half marathons.

The initiatives funded by Karen Linde Packman and Jeff Packman—the creation of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation and permanent funding for the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences and the Champlin Scholars program—create a pipeline for the most ambitious and talented students from all backgrounds to pursue College-funded research, internship, and global opportunities in preparation for careers in fields such as biotechnology, biomedicine, biochemistry, ocean sciences, genomics, and bioinformatics. Jocelyn Thomas, a former CAPS student and Champlin Scholar at Colby, is now a research assistant at The Jackson Laboratory. “This is a golden age for the biosciences,” said President David A. Greene. “The discoveries made now will have an enormous impact on human health and prosperity and the health and vitality of our planet. It is essential that we draw on the talents of this generation of students to lead the way in scientific research and the innovation that emerges from that work. The Packmans’ vision and generosity will strengthen the pipeline of scientific leaders by making Colby a place where students can benefit from the best of the liberal arts tradition while also having access to the instrumentation, infrastructure, and large-scale scientific collaboration available through the world’s leading research laboratories.” Both alumni from the Class of 1988, the Packmans currently hold key leadership roles at the College. Jeff Packman is vice chair of the Colby College Board of Trustees, and Karen Linde Packman is chair of the Colby College Museum of Art’s Board of Governors. CAPS Students on Allen Island with Professor of Biology Catherine Bevier. By supporting the Colby Achievement Program in the Sciences (CAPS) in perpetuity, the Packmans’ gift ensures that students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to pursue careers in the sciences. Originally established as a pilot program through a grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institution, CAPS helps students from under-resourced and traditionally underrepresented groups persist in the sciences. CAPS students spend six weeks with faculty in the classroom and Colby’s laboratories the summer before their first year, preparing them for the rigor of the natural sciences and providing them with a support system for when they experience challenges. Since the program’s inception, Colby has seen a marked increase in African-American, Latino/Latina, and Native American majors in the sciences, and their average grade point averages have climbed during the same period. Through the Champlin Scholars program, students will receive College funding to support their summer or January term research and internship experiences, which opens those opportunities for students who may not otherwise be able to pursue them. The Champlin Scholars program is named in honor of longtime biology professor Art Champlin, who collaborated with The Jackson Laboratory for decades and was Mr. Packman’s mentor during his student years at Colby. Funding available through the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will allow Colby to expand on its connections to leading research institutions, which already include The Jackson Laboratory, Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and others. The College will also continue to broaden its network of companies that are innovating in the biosciences and offer students funding to pursue internships to prepare them to make an impact in their fields. Students from a broad range of disciplines will have access to funded experiences that allow them to tie their academic work to innovative approaches to opportunities around the country and the world. The Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation will bring students and faculty from the arts and humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences together around complex issues, adding richness to each student’s perspective and approach. “We are honored to be able to support such critical and innovative programs at Colby,” said the Packmans. “We are acutely aware of the disparate access to educational opportunities that exist in the biosciences. We are proud that Colby is setting itself apart from its peers in its dedication to ensuring academic support, options, and funding for all students who wish to pursue careers in the field.” The inaugural director of the Linde Packman Lab for Biosciences Innovation, the J. Warren Merrill Associate Professor of Biology Andrea Tilden, believes that the opportunities created through this new funding will place Colby students at the vanguard of bioscience discovery. “We’re very excited to be able to create a network of opportunities and collaborations for our students with our own bioscience faculty at Colby and with world-class research institutions—some of which happen to be here in Maine,” said Tilden. “A student who launches a genomics project with a scientist at the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory, for example, may use Jackson Laboratory genomic sequencing resources, and then Colby’s cyberinfrastructure platform for computational analysis of large genomic datasets. With this extraordinarily generous funding, all of this can be orchestrated to provide unique, innovative, and rich experiences for our students in the most groundbreaking fields in the biosciences.” Tilden was a founding faculty member of the CAPS program, which has proven successful at helping students from underrepresented backgrounds stay engaged in the scientific disciplines at Colby and now serves as a model for colleges and universities working to address issues of persistence in the sciences. She also has been instrumental in developing opportunities for Colby students in genomics at Jackson Laboratory, including a January-term course funded through the Champlin Scholars program. She is currently helping to develop Colby’s new program in computational biology, which includes a multi-institution cyberinfrastructure collaboration with Jackson Laboratory and the University of Maine. The initiatives funded by the Packmans’ gift support efforts by Colby to connect students’ academic pursuits to meaningful opportunities that are available to all—regardless of their financial means. In December 2017 Colby announced the creation of the Buck Lab for the Environment and Climate Change, which supports internships, research, and global experiences; and earlier that year the College launched DavisConnects, which, among other things, will guarantee students at least one global experience beyond study abroad.",0.0,8.0,1.6,3.0,1022025,0.9999999995654916,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

An updated entry list for the Nov. 16-18 race currently features 43 cars, including several high-profile American teams and the highly anticipated North American debut of James Glickenhaus’ SCG 003C. The American team will compete on home soil for the first time with its pair of SCG 003s, which are already Stateside, with one car set to be entered by LightSpeed Racing alongside the works Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus operation.

Andrew,Davis,1813,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/WORLD-Activist-attacked-LGBT-flight-Richard-Grenell-sterilization/64484.html,"The world's first known flight fully staffed by LGBT+ people is due for takeoff from London Heathrow Airport in June 2019, PinkNews reported. The LGBT+ pilots and cabin crew will head the one-time ""Pride Flight"" to New York, which is the first U.S. city to host the World Pride event next year, on June 28the day marking 50 years since the beginning of the Stonewall riots. Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Holidays has teamed with tourism bureau NYC & Company, and have enlisted Broadway actor and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Tituss Burgess to be the master of ceremonies during the flight. President Donald Trump is considering naming Richard Grenell as Nikki Haley's replacement at the United Nationsdespite concerns from some in his camp, according to NewNowNext.com . Grenell is the U.S. ambassador to Germany, already making him the highest ranking gay official in the administration. He was confirmed despite the objections of Democrats over his history of sexist and insulting tweets, which many saw as disqualifying. Other top contenders for the position include Kelly Knight Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada; and Jamie McCourt, the U.S. ambassador to France and Monaco. Human Rights Watch reported that a policy in the Czech Republic forcing transgender people to undergo sterilization surgeries to legally change their gender violates the right to health, according to the European Committee of Social Rights. Non-governmental groups ILGA-Europe and Transgender Europe argued that the Czech Republic's requirements for legal gender recognition violated the European Social Charter, a Council of Europe treaty focused on social and economic rights. The Netherlands has handed out its first gender-neutral passport, PinkNews reported. Leonne Zeegers received the document, which marks her as gender X instead of male or female, after a two-year court battle which she won in May. The 57-year-old former nurse and sex worker is intersex, had gender confirmation surgery to become a woman in 2001, and now identifies as gender-neutral, using she/her pronouns. Other countries including Australia, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Pakistan, India, Ireland and Nepal have introduced a third gender on passports or are in the process of doing so, as well as a few U.S. states. Transgender people in Uruguay are celebrating after the country's Congress passed a comprehensive trans-related law Oct. 18, Gay Star News reported. Most notably, trans people can now self-identify their gender and update their legal name, without approval from a judge. The new law also creates scholarships for trans people to access education, as well as sets up affirmative action. New Zealand is planning on removing restrictions to the number of gender-confirmation surgeries that can be performed every year, according to PinkNews, which cited the Kiwi publication Newsroom. The country currently limits the number of publicly-funded gender confirmation surgeries to three male-to-female and one female-to-male operations every two years.

Michael,Sylvester,1776,http://www.theforecaster.net/sylvester-doyle-square-off-again-in-portlands-house-district-39/,"Share Tweet Share Share 0 comments PORTLAND — State Rep. Michael Sylvester, D-Portland, is seeking a second term in House District 39, and is opposed by Republican Peter Doyle, whom he defeated in 2016. Doyle declined to be interviewed about his candidacy. Sylvester’s campaign is funded through the Maine Clean Elections Act. Doyle is traditionally financed. House District 39 covers the city’s Casco Bay islands, Munjoy Hill, eastern waterfront and Congress Street corridor to State Street. State legislative terms are for two years. Election Day is Nov. 6. Sylvester said his first term was a learning experience, one that will help set a tone for moving forward. “There is blame to be spread on both sides for partisan atmosphere,” he said. “When you sit in the chair, you learn so much goes on behind closed doors.” Sylvester and more than a dozen other legislators hope to move forward as the Bull Moose Caucus in the next session, working first on areas where there are some bipartisan agreements and compromise. He is also supporting Maine Attorney General Janet Mills for governor, after first supporting Betsy Sweet. While he and Mills do not agree on everything, Sylvester said passing legislation without worrying about it being veto-proof will move the state forward. In moving forward, he said he will also try again with a local option tax, which failed in both branches of the Legislature last year. This time, he would like counties, not municipalities, to establish local option meal and lodging taxes if passed at referendum. While supporting the aim to bolster home health care for senior citizens and people with disabilities, Sylvester said he is not certain it will be enacted in the manner Question 1 seeks. How to fund the programs and finding people to staff them remain challenges, he said, although he will vote for the referendum. He compared the question to Question 2 in 2016, which placed a surcharge on incomes of $200,000 or more to fund education. The surcharge was never enacted, but legislators did increase education funding. Sylvester said he could envision the same result for funding home health care. Sylvester also supports the four bond questions to fund clean water, roads and bridges, and secondary education. Sylvester supports an expansion of MaineCare beyond the expansion approved by voters last year, so it would include all Mainers. While he would like to see if a system can be administered with other states, he would support the state going it alone through a tiered system that would not require full implementation from the start.

John,O'Neil,1775,https://www.teamusa.org/News/2018/October/15/Bridget-ONeil-Wins-Youth-Olympic-Diving-Bronze-94-Years-After-Her-Great-Uncles-Olympic-Gold,"Bridget O'Neil swims toward the surface at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 on Oct. 12. 2018 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Bridget O’Neil’s bronze medal on the women’s 3-meter springboard at the Youth Olympic Games not only added her name to the history books, but also helped to inspire future generations of divers. O’Neil has direct ties to both the past and future of the Olympic Movement. Her great-uncle John O’Neil won Olympic gold medals for Team USA in rugby in 1920 and 1924. And when Bridget’s not busy with her own training, she’s helping to coach future divers at her club in Texas. In the morning’s prelims O’Neil finished fifth to advance in the competition. In the final O’Neil scored 439.60 points to secure her podium position by more than 10 points. O’Neil’s best dive was her third-round reverse two and a half, which earned her a 61.60. But going eighth of 12 in the diving order meant that O’Neil would have to wait for several more athletes to finish competing to see if her spot on the podium would hold. Want to learn to curl like the pros? Looking for breaking news, videos, Olympic and Paralympic team bios all at your fingertips? Download the Team USA app today. “After you’re finished, it’s exciting,” O’Neil said. “There’s no pressure on me, so it was just fun to watch the scores go up and see what others can do.” With the bronze medal around her neck, O’Neil was excited to carry on the family name her uncle had established in the Olympic movement nearly a century ago. “It is really cool to have two medalists in the family,” O’Neil said. “I guess it is a tradition I can help to carry on. I have thought about if I could compete in Paris like he did. I’m going to have to keep working hard and trying my best to achieve that.” John O’Neil’s second Games were held in Paris. Should Bridget O’Neil make the 2024 U.S. Olympic Team, her Games would also occur there – 100 years later. While the sports of rugby and diving don’t have a lot in common, it’s obvious that the younger O’Neil has many of the same qualities as her great-uncle. “My family told me that he was really driven, worked hard in his sport, and that’s how he achieved his goal,” O’Neil said With firm ties to the past, O’Neil also has her eyes to the future. She teaches kids at GC Divers, who are 6-12 years old, the basics of diving, or as she puts it “going headfirst into the pool.” “It is one of my favorite things I get to do this year,” O’Neil said. “I do it every week and I just love watching them have fun and teaching them something I love to do also. “It’s funny to think I was once a diver in lessons and now I’m here. So, it could be any of them in my shoes one day.” ©2018 United States Olympic Committee. All Rights Reserved. ©2018 United States Olympic Committee.

Andrew,Davis,1773,https://news.uga.edu/launch-pad-entrepreneurs/,"The fourth floor of Creswell Hall looks pretty much like your typical residence hall, but the students living here are far from typical. They are all entrepreneurs: risk-takers who want to turn their ideas into businesses. Many of them already have. Jared Zengo of Oconee County started a business making art installations out of Rubik’s Cubes, and has sold his art to Oriental Trading Company, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. Hannah Abdulhaqq, a fashion merchandising minor from Douglasville, started a clothing resale business and has a website to sell clothes. Alex Deltchev, a chemistry major from Oconee County, started a landscaping business in high school. Now, after following an interest in the video editing software Adobe Premiere Pro, he has a business that creates music videos and Snapchat filters. These three first-year students are a part of the Launch Pad, a new living learning community created to spark innovation. Students applied to live in the Launch Pad this spring after being accepted at UGA, but before starting classes. They had to write a brief essay describing their entrepreneurial goals, and share stories about their own startups, if applicable. The group—14 men and 12 women—represents a wide cross section of campus. Many of them are engineering and STEM majors. Zengo signed up for the program because he was interested in both business and computer science. He’s majoring in computer science, but using the Launch Pad entrepreneurship program to learn about business. “I grew up building computers for nonprofits, like Free I.T. Athens. I love entrepreneurship,” Zengo said. “I get that feeling when I think of an idea. Someone’s never done this before. I can make this a real thing. And that gives me a rush to keep on going.” Donald Chambers, lecturer and associate director of the entrepreneurship program far right, talks with students during class. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) Students in the program take a First-Year Odyssey Seminar, where they learn all about being an entrepreneur, from the initial idea to growing a business. They have keycard access to their own co-working space off the lobby on Creswell Hall, where one of the Odyssey classes meets. The co-working space and maker space is stocked with tables and stools, sofas and ottomans, snacks, a refrigerator and a 3D printer. Launch Pad participants also have other perks including membership in the Four Athens Tech Incubator, membership in the Society of Entrepreneurs and opportunities to meet one-on-one with successful entrepreneurs. “Entrepreneurs come and talk about how they started and how they kept on going,” said Zengo. “And they each teach a different life lesson. Some of them blew it out of the water instantly, while others didn’t really. They failed, and then they kept on trying to improve. And they ended up succeeding.” And rejection is a subject stressed in the seminar taught by Don Chambers or Cali Brutz, lecturers and associate directors of the UGA Entrepreneurship Program. “When you’re looking to be an entrepreneur, and start up an idea, it’s hard,” said Chambers to the class. “Don’t be discouraged if we push on you. Don’t take it as ‘that’s a stupid idea’; that’s not the case at all. It’s hard. If it were easy, none of us would be in college. We’d all be zillionaires coming up with ideas. So keep trying. If the first idea, the second idea, doesn’t work, that’s fine.” For a class for freshmen who are only a few weeks into the semester, the class is fast paced. “Why are ideas no good?” Chambers asked the class. “Because they’re just ideas,” said Haylee Peters, an international business management major from Monroe. “Because they’re based on your world, your experience,” Chambers explained. “How many other people have the same problem? Maybe two. Is there 200? Is there 2,000? If you can find 10 people, you can find 20; if you find 100, you can find 200. If you can’t find 10, you can’t find 20. And you don’t have a business. Try to prove yourself wrong. Most of your ideas won’t pan out. If you can’t prove yourself wrong, then maybe you really are on to something.” After a discussion on customer discovery, the class breaks into groups to come up with open- ended questions to ask potential customers. They’re all working on different group projects—building apps, websites, doing marketing for a neck pillow—to work through what it takes to start your own business. (From left:) Undergraduates Natalie Baddour, Lauren Gower, Haylee Peters, and Zarino Frausto listen to their professor during class. (Photo by Andrew Davis Tucker/UGA) “So far the coolest thing I’ve learned I think is just how much goes into building a business,” said Peters. “Because I’ve been working for Chick-fil-A, I’ve been learning about businesses that are already established. It’s been nice to learn about how ideas turn into businesses and how much it takes—how many different types of people are needed to even start thinking about a potential business.” Peters also likes the camaraderie of the Launch Pad community. “I immediately had 25 friends. We hang out all the time,” she said. “I get to hear their ideas and give my input. They’re all pretty honest about my ideas and what they think I could improve on, and it’s been nice to just be able to interact with these people that have different interest in different majors.” Abdulhaqq said the program is a small, tight-knit community. “I don’t have that many freshman classes, because I came in with 50 credit hours and am in a lot of junior level classes,” she said. “Having the other freshmen I can relate to is really helpful.” But mostly the program has reinforced her entrepreneurial spirit. “This had made me realize that I can do bigger things than just reselling clothing,” she said. “I could have a corporation and run it right now and start it.” In fact, Ethan Boos and Charley Sun from the program are currently working their first business possibility through the eight-week-long UGA Idea Accelerator. The Launch Pad program is one of many initiatives UGA is taking to elevate entrepreneurship at UGA. Housed in the Terry College of Business, the UGA Entrepreneurship Program includes an undergraduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship—which is open to all UGA undergraduate students interested in working for a startup or nonprofit, or pursuing investment banking and angel funding; and a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship, open to all UGA graduate students who want to develop an idea into a successful venture, build an effective team and secure funding. “The Entrepreneurship Program at UGA has been designed to be very hands-on,” said Bob Pinckney, director of entrepreneurship at UGA. “Entrepreneurship can be described as a contact sport—you have to be in it to truly learn how to be successful at starting and running your own business. We work hard to provide opportunities for students to learn and experience entrepreneurship through doing. From the Harvard case studies and speakers in the classroom to the Accelerators, Pitch contests, and Georgia Kickstart Fund, UGA is building one of the top entrepreneurship programs in the country.” UGA entrepreneurship opportunities in addition to the Launch Pad include UGA’s Next Top Entrepreneur competition, Collegiate Consensus Great Brands Competition, UGA Idea Accelerator Program, UGA Kickstart Fund, UGA Summer Launch Program, participation in the new Student Startup Incubator and membership in the Society of Entrepreneurs. The program will grow from this inaugural class of 26 with room for around 50 students in the next cohort. Applications for the Launch Pad will open in spring for incoming freshmen.",0.0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806412,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Andrew,Davis,1773,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6600830-151/bend-council-candidates-talk-homelessness-wards-in-final,"Bend City Council candidates debated topics including the city’s approach to homelessness and whether councilors should be elected from geographic areas during a final forum before ballots are sent out Wednesday. Bend voters will see three-way races for two council seats, and five of the six candidates participated in a League of Women Voters forum Monday. Andrew Davis, Gena Goodman-Campbell and Victor Johnson are running for Position 5, and Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick are running for Position 6. Ron “Rondo” Boozell is also running for Position 6, but he was not able to attend the debate because he is in jail through December for failing to pay child support. Homelessness McCormick — a stay-at-home mother who manages digital media for the Pine Tavern, which her family owns — and her husband lived in an apartment above Pine Tavern when they first moved to Bend. She said they were accosted by homeless people while living there. Because of that experience, she’s made homelessness a key issue of her campaign and said she wants to create a Bend-based working group focused on homelessness. A regional group, the Homeless Leadership Coalition, already works on solutions to homelessness in Deschutes, Crook and Jefferson counties. But McCormick said she wants to see a group focused specifically on Bend. “I want to have representation from the business owners and people affected and not just foundations,” she said. Campbell, a city councilor who owns the Wabi Sabi gift shop downtown, is on the Homeless Leadership Coalition, and she and Councilor Bruce Abernethy have spent months working on a housing-first model. She pointed out that homelessness is a complex issue that can result from medical bankruptcy. “Until we have a place for these people, until we have resources for these people, I’m interested in finding housing for them,” Campbell said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, agreed that the city needs to work on providing housing to help homeless residents, and everyone else. She said she’s also interested in developing a regulated camping area that will allow people who choose to live outside to do so safely. Johnson, a musician, said he likes the idea of developing a tiny home village at Juniper Ridge. Davis, the student life director at Central Oregon Community College, said homelessness was a good opportunity for the city to engage in public-private partnerships with organizations including Bethlehem Inn and Shepherd’s House. “Individuals in our community, no matter where they live or whether they are unable to find a home to live in, they’re still part of our community,” he said. Wards The Bend City Council unanimously rejected a committee recommendation to elect councilors from geographic wards last year. Council candidates made it clear that vote probably wouldn’t go differently if they’re elected. Davis, Goodman-Campbell and Johnson all dismissed the idea of electing councilors by wards, saying citywide elections ensure that councilors represent the entire city. “I think it’s really important for our councilors to be responsible to all of Bend,” Goodman-Campbell said. Goodman-Campbell said she does want to make sure city committees, whose members are appointed by the mayor with input from councilors, include people from all areas of town. Campbell introduced a city resolution doing that. Campbell said she wants to see councilors elected citywide, but she’s open to requiring them to live in a specific part of town. McCormick was the most open to reopening a discussion about wards because people in different neighborhoods have different needs, she said. “It might be premature for Bend to go by regions, but I’m open to hearing more about it,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,2.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1020357,0.8671528590517087,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Generally cloudy. High near 45F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph.. Partly cloudy skies. Low 31F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 12:33 pm BINGHAMTON -- It was a battle of top bird on Saturday as the Spencer Van-Etten/Candor Eagles squared off against the Eagles of Whitney Point. Both offenses were explosive, but Whitney Point held on to win 28-22. The game was originally scheduled as a Whitney Point home game, but due to field conditions and weather, the game was moved to a neutral site at Chenango Valley High School. The change in venue didn't seem to affect either team early on. SVEC was on the verge of going three and out on its opening possession before quarterback Matthew Byrne hit Cameron Fitzgerald for a 30-yard strike on third and long to put SVEC into Whitney Point territory. Two plays later, Christian Haynes ripped a 24-yard run on third down for the opening score of the game. On their opening possession, Point quarterback Andrew Davis used his legs to drive his team down the field in response. No passes were needed for Whitney Point on its opening drive, and eventually Davis ran it in from 14 yards out. With no kicker on the roster, Whitney Point went for two after each of its scores. An unsuccessful pass play kept it at 7-6 in favor of SVEC. On the ensuing kickoff, Haynes rumbled down the sideline for a 75-yard kickoff return touchdown. Whitney Point was not shaken by this. The run game stayed true and Davis was rewarded with his second 14-yard rushing touchdown of the game. The two-pointer was good this time, and the game was knotted up at 14. Whitney Point wouldn't let Haynes get the ball on the next kickoff. A perfectly executed onside kick put them at midfield. Spencer Van-Etten/Candor held on defense, but the offense sputtered after. SVEC lost yards on all three downs and had a punt blocked to give Whitney Point great field position. Tanner Kallfelz punched it in from eight yards out to give Whitney Point its first lead of the game at 22-14. After Byrne threw an interception late in the second quarter, Whitney Point was poised to go into halftime with a one score advantage. However, Cameron Fitzgerald intercepted Davis and ran it down to the 1-yard line with just over a minute left. Haynes ran it in for his third score of the half and tacked on the two-point conversion. The score was 22-22 at halftime. Both defenses tightened up in the second half. SVEC recovered a fumble on the opening possession, but that only led to a punt. With just over a minute left in the third, Whitney Point was driving once again. On a fourth down play deep in SVEC territory, Davis evaded two defenders before connecting with Joshua Timmins for the first down. Davis finished off the drive with a one-yard touchdown rush, his third of the game. Late in the fourth, it was SVEC's turn. Byrne connected with Noah Mack twice to get the Eagles to the 30-yard line of Whitney Point. With the Eagles knocking on the door, Christian Haynes fumbled to kill the drive. This wasn't the last chance for Spencer-Van-Etten/Candor, however. A defensive hold gave the SVEC offense another chance to either tie or win the game. On fourth-and-7, James Sutherlin caught a 40-yard hail mary that took the Eagles to the opponent's 40-yard line, but it was his drop on the ensuing fourth down that squashed the Eagles' hopes. SVEC drops to 2-5 on the season with a matchup on the road against Chenango Valley coming up next week. Whitney Point meanwhile moves to 5-2 on the season. They visit Susquehanna Valley next week. ; Your comment has been submitted. Reported There was a problem reporting this. Log In Keep it Clean.

A cluster of historic row houses known as Whitehillâ€™s Row on B&O Avenue are moving closer to a revival with an approval from the cityâ€™s Planning Commission this past week. Frederick County natives Michael Gordon and David Bauer plan to restore and revitalize the six three-story houses at 155-165 B&O Ave. into four-bedroom, three-bathroom units. The structures have fallen into disrepair after years of neglect. Known as Whitehillâ€™s Row, Frederick businessman James Whitehill built the homes in 1858 as part of the Lower Depot neighborhood, a group of residential properties along Water Street and B&O Avenue south of the train depot. The expansion of the B&O and Frederick & Pennsylvania Line railroads spurred the development, which also included collections of other houses to support a barrage of industrial construction. Through the years, as officials rezoned the area, they somehow overlooked the homes as residences, despite nearly always serving in that capacity. Instead, the houses were zoned industrial along with most of the surrounding properties. City officials recognized this mistake when it was brought to their attention with the new ownersâ€™ purchase and filed a request to change the zoning to residential. On Monday, the Planning Commission voted to make the zoning change. The owners needed to change the zoning for the project, which is in the planning stages, to move forward. If all goes as planned, the owners hope to finish the first two units by the beginning of 2019, with the remaining set for availability next spring. Gordon has said the houses are set for sale with listings in the upper $400,000 range. Each unit is more than 2,000 square feet and has a total of four levels, which includes three floors and a basement. Next weekend, the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum is hosting its annual Oktoberfest, and as part of the festivities organizers are planning to fire blank rounds from a musket. Patti Mullins, the cityâ€™s public relations coordinator, made sure to pass that information along in a news release issued on Wednesday to ensure the public would be aware. The event is set for this coming Saturday and Sunday at the museum at 1110 Rosemont Ave. The musket fire is permitted to occur only between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Saturday and noon and 5 p.m. Sunday, according to the release. Oktoberfest is held annually at the museum and according to the museum website, will feature juried arts, crafts, cultural activities, German food and drink, oompah band, colonial history demonstrators activities for children. The museum is housed in a traditional German farmhouse, and the Oktoberfest event is an annual staple to celebrate the heritage.

Michael,Gordon,1768,https://www.odt.co.nz/business/fuel-price-and-rates-rises-expected-push-inflation-higher,"Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Petrol prices which hit record highs beyond $2.50 a litre last week. Another seasonal boost to the consumer price index, which measures inflation, is expected to come from a 4% increase in council rates around the country. The Reserve Bank’s target is annual inflation at the mid-point of 1%-3% and the CPI has been within that range since mid-2016. peaking twice in that period to touch 2%. The price index will be released tomorrow. While the Reserve Bank predicted inflation for the September quarter would be 0.4% — and annually 1.4% — Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon believes it will be higher, at 0.7% for the quarter and 1.7% for the year. ""Higher fuel prices account for much of the expected quarterly rise, and are likely to push annual inflation higher again in the near term,"" he said. Inflation was shaping up to rise above the midpoint 2% of the Reserve Bank’s target range, for at least a short period, he said. The cross rate between the New Zealand and US dollars hit more than two and a-half year lows last week, hovering just above US64c for most of the week as the greenback went from strength to strength because of the strong US economy. ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley was also picking a higher than forecast outcome, also settling on 0.7% for the quarter and 1.7% annually. He, too, predicted fuel and housing-related costs would be the main drivers. ""We’ll be watching for signs of businesses passing on these higher [fuel] costs to consumers."" He reiterated the ASB expected the Reserve Bank to leave the OCR on hold until early 2020. Mr Gordon expected the lower exchange rate during the past year would have impacted on the prices of imported goods. Mr Gordon said the rising fuel prices were a mixed bag for monetary policy, adding to inflation up front but also weighing on activity over the medium term. The interest-driving official cash rate (OCR) remains at a record low 1.75%, with expectations it will not be moved up or down until well into 2020. ""Higher inflation caused by petrol prices certainly wouldn’t prevent the Reserve Bank from cutting the OCR if there were signs the economy was faltering,"" he said. The single biggest contribution to Mr Gordon’s inflation forecast was a 6% rise in petrol and diesel prices, stemming from a trifecta of rising world oil prices, a falling exchange rate and the introduction of Auckland’s regional fuel tax. simon.hartley@odt.co.nz",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Michael,Gordon,1768,https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/news/23200/gbp-nzd-pound-sterling-to-new-zealand-dollar-exchange-rate-news-and-five-day-forecast.html,"Ahead of the weekend the Pound Sterling to New Zealand Dollar (GBP/NZD) exchange rate struggled to hold onto a stronger footing as doubts over Brexit mounted once again. As officials indicated that key hurdles still stand in the way of a deal investors were prompted to re-evaluate their recent bout of optimism, leaving the Pound biased to the downside. Tensions are likely to remain elevated ahead of Thursday’s EU summit, with markets still hoping to see signs of concrete progress towards a deal. With the time to secure a Brexit agreement fast running out GBP exchange rates look set for another volatile week of trading. A general easing in market risk aversion offered a boost to the New Zealand Dollar, on the other hand, as reports pointed towards the US and China discussing trade at the next G20 meeting. Although domestic data continued to paint a lacklustre picture of the New Zealand outlook this was not enough to keep NZD exchange rates under pressure for the time being. Confidence in the New Zealand Dollar could strengthen further on Monday evening if the third quarter New Zealand consumer price index improves as forecast. Investors expect to see an uptick in both quarterly and annual inflation, something which is likely to give the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) greater cause for confidence. If inflation accelerates to 1.8% on the year this would push the CPI closer to the RBNZ’s target range, reducing the likelihood of interest rates being cut this year. As Michael Gordon, Senior Economist at Westpac, noted: ‘We also expect the lower exchange rate over the last year to have an impact on prices of imported goods. ‘Inflation is shaping up to rise above the midpoint of the Reserve Bank’s target range, for at least a short period.’ As worries over the prospect of a RBNZ rate cut have weighed heavily on demand for the New Zealand Dollar in recent weeks a stronger showing could push the GBP/NZD exchange rate sharply lower. Even so, the mood of NZD exchange rates could still sour in the wake of the latest Global Dairy Trade auction if prices show another contraction. As dairy prices have seen a sustained decline since May any fresh dip may encourage investors to sell out of the commodity-correlated New Zealand Dollar. The Pound may also find support on the back of the latest UK inflation data, with forecasts pointing towards a modest uptick on the year. As long as inflation continues to run in excess of the Bank of England’s (BoE) 2% target policymakers are likely to come under increasing pressure to consider hiking interest rates further. If the case for more BoE action builds this could boost the Pound against its rivals, even in the face of continued uncertainty over Brexit. However, as markets anticipate an easing in average weekly earnings in the three months to August this may put the brakes on any potential GBP exchange rate rally. Evidence that wage growth remains muted would dent confidence in the outlook of the UK economy, given the significant role that consumer spending has had in driving growth in recent years. If consumers come under greater pressure this may damage the prospect of stronger economic growth in the second half of 2018. A contraction in September’s UK retail sales figure would encourage further GBP weakness, leaving the Pound on a weaker footing ahead of the EU summit. A Brexit breakthrough, though, could help to shore up the GBP/NZD exchange rate.

Noell) Tulare Western’s Jordan Burrell was in full stride. With nothing but open turf ahead, a 75-yard touchdown was destined. Yet, in the midst of all the sideline screaming, he only heard one voice. “I could hear my defensive coordinator [Sean Knox],” Burrell said. “He was yelling, ‘That’s why we do what we do in practice.’” Tulare Western hosts Mission Oak a during a East Yosemite League High School Football game at Bob Mathias Stadium on Oct 12th, 2018. (Photo: John L. Noell) Burrell snagged three turnovers as Tulare Western dominated cross-town rival Mission Oak 49-0 on Friday night. His big play was a 75-yard touchdown run after scooping up a blocked field goal in the third quarter. Burrell also had an interception and a fumble recovery. The Mustangs (8-0, 3-0) have used a stingy defense to stay successful this season. The defense has now forced 30 turnovers (16 interceptions and 14 fumble recoveries). Maybe that’s why defensive coordinator Knox’s hollering found Burrell’s ears on the touchdown run.

Coming in averaging more than 200 rushing yards per game, Johnson had two touches Friday: one run for 1 yard and one 46-yard reception. But the Mustang offense still caught fire, thanks to the rushing prowess of Andrew Davis (65 yards and three touchdowns) and Mikey Ficher (59 yards). Henry Williams and Rolondo Holmes also had rushing touchdowns. Looking for something to do this weekend? Get your weekly entertainment stories in your inbox every Friday morning.

And the Hawks may have found a spark — a 6-foot, 260-pound spark. “It was the most fun I’ve ever had,” Christian Herrera said. Normally a defensive lineman, Herrera was thrust into the offensive backfield for his first carries of the season. Tulare Western hosts Mission Oak a during a East Yosemite League High School Football game at Bob Mathias Stadium on Oct 12th, 2018. (Photo: John L. Noell) Actually … he’s pretty sure they were the first carries of his entire football career. The result? A team-leading 44 rushing yards on 11 touches. “I just like to help the team,” said Herrera, a senior. It was one Hawks highlight in an otherwise rough night. The Mustangs took command early, with three touchdowns in the first quarter. The frame was capped by a 13-yard fumble return on defense by Anthony Cervantes — one of four turnovers caused by the Mustangs defense. Tulare Western scored another three touchdowns in the second quarter. The 42-0 halftime lead added extra delight to the homecoming festivities at halftime.

Michael,Gordon,1765,https://www.theunion.com/news/local-news/nevada-county-sheriff-deputies-find-several-hundred-pounds-of-suspected-marijuana/,"October 11, 2018 A routine probation check turned into a foot chase that netted Nevada County deputies three arrests and the discovery of hundreds of pounds of suspected marijuana, authorities said. Deputies performed the probation check on Patricia Dawn Cooper, 27, at her 10000 block Rough and Ready Highway home around 12:20 p.m. Wednesday. They arrived and found Leslie Edward Schofield, 38, and another man standing outside near a detached workshop, Sheriff Keith Royal said. Deputies confirmed Cooper was in her home. She then stepped outside, walking toward the officers, he added. ""They asked — had anyone recently seen Michael Gordon?"" Royal said of the officers. Gordon, 37, had arrest warrants on charges of spousal battery and hit and run, records state. Deputies continued talking when, moments later, the 37-year-old Gordon ran from the rear of the workshop. Deputies caught him after a brief chase and found a small bag containing suspected methamphetamine on him, the sheriff said. Deputies then searched the shed and Schofield's vehicle, he added. ""They look in the shed and they notice there's a great deal of marijuana hanging,"" Royal said. According to Royal, the shed held over 400 pounds of suspected marijuana leaves and about 250 pounds of processed cannabis. Deputies also found cardboard, post office shipping boxes. A search of Schofield's vehicle revealed $5,700 in cash, suspected meth, heroin and a pipe, the sheriff said. Schofield is charged with three felonies: being an accessory to a felony, possession of a controlled substance for sale and planting marijuana. He also faces a handful of misdemeanors: possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana for sale, possession of a narcotic controlled substance and possession of controlled substance paraphernalia, jail records state. Schofield has since made his $19,000 bond, reports state. Gordon was arrested on his outstanding warrants. He also faces two new misdemeanors: resisting a public officer and possession of a controlled substance. He's free on $11,500 in bond, reports state. Cooper faces two felonies: being an accessory to a felony and a probation violation. She remained jailed Thursday, records show.

You can't tell from the temperature outside, but October is finally here, and we could all use a beer (or ten) to cool down courtesy of Grovetoberfest. The Coconut Grove beer fest is back this year with plenty of sudsy options from local breweries. If you're into liquor, the Craft Spirits Fest will also be in the neighborhood with your drink of choice this weekend. And if you're looking to immerse yourself in the diverse and vibrant culture of the Magic City, hit up HistoryMiami's CultureFest 305 this Saturday, or head west to the Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum for a survey of 21st-century Caribbean art and culture. Here's a look at some of the best events happening in Miami over the next few days. Friday You remember Eddie Izzard's face from the hit TV show The Riches and flicks such as Ocean's Twelve, Mystery Men, and Across the Universe. Now it's time to see the English comedian on the big stage. He's bringing his Believe Me tour, named after his memoir that hit shelves last year, to the Magic City. His live show hilariously reflects on his unique adventures, covering everything from his time rising through the ranks in London to performing at Madison Square Garden. 8 p.m. Friday, October 12, at Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; arshtcenter.org. Tickets cost $35 to $196. Miami's original zombie prom is back, and it's billed as ""deader than ever."" That means you need to head to Zombie Prom Resurrección in your most magical zombie garb and be ready to own it. In addition to hosting a number of beastly South Floridians, the event will deliver live tunes from Otto von Schirach & the Bermuda Triangle Family, Galactic Effect, Lamebot, MadSavvy, and Lipstick Alley. 9 p.m. Friday, October 12, at 1306 Miami, 1306 N. Miami Ave., Miami; facebook.com. Tickets cost $10 to $20. Throughout the year, the Craft Spirits Fest stages a number of events, including happy hours, seminars, and dinners. They all culminate with a grand tasting of more than 100 spirits and cocktails to sample. The latest grand tasting will happen Friday at the Cruz Building. Last year's edition included participants such as Wondermint Liqueur to Prescribed Spirits, so prepare to whet that palate. 6:30 p.m. Friday, October 12, at the Cruz Building, 3157 Commodore Plaza, Coconut Grove; craftspiritsfest.com. Tickets cost $50 to $75. Saturday A false Miami narrative has become frustratingly pervasive with the advent of the boutique art explosion in neighborhoods such as Wynwood in recent years. Cultural carpetbaggers claim Miami ""lacked culture"" before the galleries came along, but true Miamians know that this city has always been the melting-est of melting pots, with music and flavors from the Caribbean, Latin America, and many other places blending to create our own, unique culture. It's the duty of institutions such as HistoryMiami to reassert this narrative. To that end, CultureFest 305, the museum's free day festival of music, dance, food, and art, will include performances by the Delou Africa Dance Ensemble, reggae band Jahfe, a martial arts presentation by Master Xiaoming Lu, and much more. 2 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at HistoryMiami Museum, 101 W. Flagler St., Miami; historymiami.org. Admission is free with RSVP. Caribbean art is a gold mine of underappreciated greatness. That's why it's crucial to see places such as the Little Haiti Cultural Complex and events like the Third Horizon Film Festival shining the rightful spotlight on our neighbors to the south and tropical transplants to the States. This week, it's the Frost Art Museum's turn. The museum is opening ""Relational Undercurrents: Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago,"" a major survey of 21st-century Caribbean art with a focus on the inclusivity and connectivity of Caribbean cultures. 4 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Patricia & Phillip Frost Art Museum, FIU, 10975 SW 17th St., Miami; frost.fiu.edu. Admission is free. More than 500 craft beers are waiting to be tasted. What are you waiting for? Grovetoberfest is back. In addition to boasting ungodly amounts of delicious brews from local faves such as J. Wakefield and LauderAle to national/international suds like Imperial and Harpoon, the fest will offer live tunes, delicious bites, and a retro 8-bit game area. Prepare to geek out and drink on at this one. 2 to 7 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Peacock Park, 2820 McFarlane Rd., Coconut Grove; grovetoberfest.com. Tickets cost $44 to $89. The star of The Jim Jefferies Show is set to hit Hollywood. If you're easily offended, this show might not be the best one for you. But if you like to laugh at anything and everything, the Australian comic never disappoints. A good primer for a Jefferies show would be his hit Comedy Central show or his latest comedy special, This Is Me Now, which was released in January. 8 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Hard Rock Live, 1 Seminole Way, Hollywood; ticketmaster.com. Tickets cost $35 to $75. The Bass is previewing two big exhibitions this week, and you're invited. Italian artist Paola Pivi, who won the 1999 Golden Lion Award at the Venice Biennale and is based in Alaska, is presenting ""Art With a View."" The exhibition offers the artist's signature anthropomorphic, feather-covered polar bears, a massive inflatable ladder, and other Instagrammable works straight out of a dream. Texas-born, L.A.-based artist Aaron Curry is opening ""Tune Yer Head."" His work reveals the artists who influenced him, from Picasso to cartoonists, as well as BMX and skate culture. Celebrate these two very different but equally thoughtful shows with a crowd. 5 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at the Bass, 2100 Collins Ave., Miami; thebass.org. Admission costs $10. Each year, Miami's art elite clamor to attend the fundraiser Smash and Grab. Held in support of the long-running and respected art space Locust Projects, it offers a raffle of donated artwork by local and international talents. It's a pretty awesome way to see work by Miami creatives on the rise. It's also one big party, featuring sounds curated by the Rhythm Foundation, this year with DJs Par, Benton, and Ricardo; food by Shake Shack, Harry's Pizzeria, and 222 Taco; and booze by Bacardi. It's the quintessential Miami benefit that turns art lovers into collectors. 6:30 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Locust Projects, 3852 N. Miami Ave., Miami; locustprojects.org. Admission costs $50. You have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in! Ween, the enigmatic alt-rock band that shape-shifted its way through genres in the '90s and early '00s, has a cult following for good reason. It's not only because members Gene and Dean Ween were ""sprouted from the demon-god Boognish,"" but also because they produced a song or album for every taste. The two childhood pals formed their act in 1984 and recorded nine studio albums with expanded membership. Though Gene Ween left the group to deal with his substance-use disorder, the duo recently reunited in 2015 and is on tour. You can catch one hell of an evil live Ween show at the Fillmore this week. 8 p.m. Saturday, October 13, at Fillmore Miami Beach, 1700 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; fillmoremb.com. Tickets cost $49. Sunday It's always been crucial for locals to support the Miami Symphony Orchestra — a world-class group of musicians that helps elevate this city to an international hub of musical prestige. Check out the grand opening of the orchestra's 2018-19 season with conductor Eduardo Marturet, pianist Mary Anne Huntsman, and other stellar musicians. The program will include a world premiere of Tindle's Orbits, as well as Gershwin's Piano Concerto in F Major and Holst's The Planets, Op. 56. 6 p.m. Sunday, October 14, at Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, 1300 Biscayne Blvd., Miami; arshtcenter.org. Tickets start at $35. The world has about 12 years to cut carbon emissions, correlated monster hurricanes are tearing our state apart, and the country is run by a pack of Bond villains. We could all use a little healing these days. Tierra Santa's ongoing wellness events are taking self-care to a whole new level, teaching participants calming techniques utilizing essential oils, meditation, and yoga. Tierra Santa Spa Director Agustina Caminos will guide this Sunday's Pranic Healing Conference, where she'll introduce no-touch techniques of energy healing for those interested in learning another way to calm the mind and body during fraught times. 3 p.m. Sunday, October 14, at Tierra Santa Studio, 3201 Collins Ave., Miami Beach; faena.com.

Andrew,Davis,1763,http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20181012/clearer-picture-of-judicial-redistricting,"A story that ran Friday on the judicial candidates contained incorrect information. District Court Judge Lee Gavin, who is running unopposed for his District 19B seat, explained the process more clearly: The judicial redistricting this year split Randolph, Montgomery and Moore counties, not just Randolph and Montgomery. In the process, Randolph did not lose a District Court judgeship but gained one — the N.C. District Judge, District 19B seat for which Brooke Schmidly, Sarah Neely Lanier and Andrew Davis are running. Current District Court Judge James Hill did not lose his seat when the redistricting occurred. Hill left that seat to run for a new Superior Court judgeship that was created. He is unopposed. After he’s elected, a new judge will be appointed to replace Hill and fill out his term that expires in 2020. “The way the appointment works depends on the result of the constitutional amendment on the Nov. 6 ballot,” Gavin added. “Currently, the governor would make the appointment. But if the amendment passes, the Legislature would send the governor at least two names and he would pick one of those two that the Legislature wants.” Choose the plan that's right for you.

Andrew,Davis,1763,https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/2019-audi-r8-lms-gt3-evo-makes-us-debut-on-display-at-road-atlanta-petit-le-mans/,"The 2019 Audi R8 LMS GT3 EVO makes its U.S. debut this week, Oct. 12-13, on display at Road Atlanta following its global debut at the Paris Motor Show on Oct. 2. The latest model from Audi Sport incorporates learnings from Audi drivers and race teams, and will be available for U.S. customers in December. “We’ve put even greater focus on our customers, gathered information from our Audi Sport teams and used our learnings from the successful competition model to create this evolved version of the R8 LMS GT3,” said Michael-Julius Renz, managing director of Audi Sport GmbH. In designing the R8 LMS GT3, Audi Sport focused on optimizing aerodynamics and brake cooling to provide greater consistency under dynamic driving conditions, and increased strength of transmission elements. The vehicle also features substantial modifications to the overall concept and longer service intervals for the clutch and transmission. All of these factors contribute to higher performance efficiencies while lowering overall operating cost. In addition to featuring the U.S. debut of the R8 LMS GT3 EVO, this weekend’s race will serve as the finale of the IMSA WeatherTech Championship with Audi teams competing for victory. Magnus Racing with drivers John Potter, Andy Lally and Andrew Davis, and the team Montaplast by Land Motorsport with drivers Daniel Morad, Christopher Mies and Sheldon van der Linde, will race in their R8 LMS GT3 models. The 2019 R8 LMS GT3 EVO will be available for sale in the U.S. in December for $514,900.

In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission slapped Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost with a lawsuit accusing him of stock fraud. According to the SEC, Frost and his co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of stocks and then exited with millions, leaving other investors with virtually worthless shares. After the charges were announced in the national media, stock prices for Frost's company, Opko Health, plummeted. Now Frost is being sued by six Opko shareholders who lost money because of the alleged pump-and-dump scheme. The lawsuits, which have been filed in Florida, New Jersey, and New York, are brought by plaintiffs Charles Steinberg, Jason Kerznowski, Michael Brennan, Paul Camhi, Andy Yu, and a sports agency called Adsport that's run by CEO Gary Knudson. Frost, the namesake of Miami's Frost Museum of Science and Frost Art Museum, has not yet responded to the complaints in court. A spokesman for the octogenarian did not return a call from New Times Wednesday, but in an earlier statement, Frost denied the SEC's allegations. ""Nothing is more important to me than my integrity... I intend to fight the charges that have been brought against me and will fight to clear my name,"" wrote Frost, who has not been criminally charged with any wrongdoing. In the six new lawsuits against Frost, shareholders accuse him of intentionally making false or misleading statements about the finances and operations of Opko. Attorneys for the shareholders argue that as CEO of Opko, Frost knew or should have known about the alleged activity spelled out in the SEC's claim. You have successfully signed up for your selected newsletter(s) - please keep an eye on your mailbox, we're movin' in! Most of the suits contain similar language and allegations, but one of the cases filed last week in Miami federal court, by New York resident Andy Yu, goes into greater detail about the way Frost financially benefited from Opko. According to Yu's complaint, Frost rented his own office space to Opko for $81,000 per month beginning in January 2014 and then hiked it up to $86,000 per month in 2018. If the claim is true, Frost made about $4.45 million acting as landlord for his own company. The lawsuit also says Frost billed Opko a total of $659,000 for use of his private plane in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. ""As the company’s highest officer and as chairman of the board, he conducted little, if any, oversight of the company’s engagement in the scheme to make false and misleading statements, consciously disregarded his duties to monitor such controls over reporting and engagement in the scheme, and consciously disregarded his duties to protect corporate assets,"" the complaint alleges. Yu's attorney, Walter Mathews, did not return a call from New Times Wednesday. As of now, no court hearings have been scheduled.

Andrew,Davis,1761,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6575942-151/bend-council-seat-draws-candidates-with-diverse-backgrounds,"Bend City Council candidates Name: Andrew Davis Age: 34 Profession: Student life director at Central Oregon Community College Education: Bachelor’s degree in business administration from Oregon State University-Cascades and master’s in business administration from Eastern Oregon University Name: Gena Goodman-Campbell Age: 34 Profession: Public lands coordinator at the Oregon Natural Desert Association Education: Bachelor’s degree in political science from Colorado College Name: Victor Johnson Age: 49 Profession: Musician and support provider for adults with developmental disabilities Education: Associate degree in audio engineering from Full Sail University and bachelor’s degree in English literature from Guilford College Bend’s next city Councilor will be a community college administrator, an environmental steward or a musician. Andrew Davis, Gena Goodman-Campbell and Victor Johnson are running to fill a seat held by Councilor Nathan Boddie, who’s running for the state House. Bend City Council candidates Name: Andrew Davis Age: 34 Profession: Student life director at Central Oregon Community College Education: Bachelor’s degree in business administration from Oregon State University-Cascades and master’s in business administration from Eastern Oregon University Name: Gena Goodman-Campbell Age: 34 Profession: Public lands coordinator at the Oregon Natural Desert Association Education: Bachelor’s degree in political science from Colorado College Name: Victor Johnson Age: 49 Profession: Musician and support provider for adults with developmental disabilities Education: Associate degree in audio engineering from Full Sail University and bachelor’s degree in English literature from Guilford College Andrew Davis Davis, 34, has lived in northeast Bend his entire life. He studied business administration at Oregon State University-Cascades and Eastern Oregon University, served on the board of the Orchard District Neighborhood Association and works as Central Oregon Community College’s student life director. Davis said he frequently hears from COCC students who have trouble finding housing they can afford while attending school and struggle to find jobs in the area after they graduate. “They’re underemployed or they’re taking that intellectual talent and going somewhere they can afford to live,” he said. “I would like to see us be able to retain those folks.” He said his priority is to annex and provide services for the 2,380 acres in Bend’s urban growth boundary — the state-approved line around cities that determines where they can grow — as quickly as possible to provide more land for homes and high-wage industry. The city moved a step closer earlier this month to annexing about 400 acres in the northwest portion of town by signing an agreement with four developers, and it’s seeking applications through Friday for a committee that will help develop a plan for about 500 acres southeast of town. “What’s most concerning to me is the gap between median household income and median household price,” Davis said. “I think there are a lot of people here who are trying to do all the right things, and it’s getting expensive to live here. To me, that’s because we can’t build homes fast enough to keep up.” The city should encourage a broader mix of homes, including duplexes, townhomes, small single-family homes and apartments, he said. Davis said he wouldn’t support efforts proposed by several mayoral candidates to limit spending on tourism promotion because tourism is a significant part of Bend’s economy. Tourists who decide to move to the city also contribute to Bend’s economy, he said. “Tourism is an important part of our economy, and there’s a lot of people whose jobs depend on it here,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to see us do something that harms people’s current jobs or businesses.” Gena Goodman-Campbell Goodman-Campbell, 34, said she’s long wanted to serve the community. A close but unsuccessful campaign against state Rep. Knute Buehler in 2016 convinced her the City Council was the right place to serve because many of the concerns she heard from voters were local issues: housing costs, transportation and quality of life. “I knocked on 4,000 doors over the course of eight months in 2016, and that experience really changed my perspective on Bend and the challenges people were facing,” she said. Goodman-Campbell moved to Bend 12 years ago to lead a campaign to protect the Badlands Wilderness, an effort that succeeded in getting Congress to designate 30,000 acres east of Bend as a protected wilderness area in 2009. Since, she’s worked as the Oregon Natural Desert Association’s public lands coordinator. She said she wants the city to continue its affordable housing policies while looking at ways to build homes as soon as possible in urban growth boundary expansion areas and areas targeted for more dense development in the city. The city should offer incentives and subsidies to developers to make sure they can build the types of housing Bend needs, she said. “One of the challenges right now is that the cost of construction and the cost of development is causing local builders to mainly build homes that are not affordable to the vast majority of people who work here,” she said. “We actually have a couple thousand homes on the market at any given time that are available, but those homes that are available are affordable to people making over $150,000 for a family of four.” Bend’s transportation planning should focus on ways to move people more efficiently across town, she said. One way to meet a state requirement to reduce the number of miles vehicles travel is to build complete communities where people have access to jobs, stores and restaurants through a short walk, drive or bike ride. Bend should work with Visit Bend, the company that contracts with the city to provide tourism promotion, to mitigate tourism’s negative effects on traffic and overuse of trails, she said. The city should consider shifting funds from tourism marketing to paying for tourism facilities, such as urban trails, Goodman-Campbell said. Victor Johnson Johnson, 49, is a musician who moved to Bend four years ago to take a job as a music director at a pre-school. After being laid off two years ago, he dedicated himself to helping people through his music and his work as a support provider to adults with developmental disabilities. He said he wants to bring a focus on music and arts to the City Council. “I really believe it’s the heartbeat of Bend,” he said. “People can have widely varying political views and beliefs but they can come together through music.” The City Council provides a platform to address societal issues like bullying and violence, Johnson said. He’s written songs about a white nationalist’s 2017 attack on a Portland train and a local high school student’s death by suicide but said he hasn’t been able to reach as broad of an audience as he wants to. Johnson has rented the same home in southwest Bend since moving to the city four years ago, and he said he can’t afford rent without help from his family. The City Council should encourage different types of homes to provide options that residents like him can afford, he said. Bend needs to create safer roads for bicyclists and pedestrians, Johnson said. He said the city should add bike lanes and consider painting bike lanes in bright colors. Johnson supports alternative modes of transportation, including the summer Ride Bend shuttle. He said Bend doesn’t need to increase spending on tourism promotion, and Visit Bend should consider changing what it promotes. Johnson would like to see more promotion of small local businesses and artists, and he said the city should look at spending some of its tourism budget on supporting small events with local artists. The community should share the cost of connecting homes with septic systems to the city’s sewer, he said. “It’s important to support everybody and spread out costs,” Johnson said. Overall, Johnson said his campaign is based on caring about the community and making sure Bend approaches issues with compassion. “I’m really passionate about getting involved and making a difference,” he said. “I really want to bring unity.” — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,4.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,1020357,0.6207214756626831,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell receiver Dakota Effler fends off an opponent after making a catch during a recent game. The Titans host Alexander Central tonight (Friday, 7:30 kickoff). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. The Alexander Central Cougars have been among the area’s best teams the last few years, while the McDowell Titans have struggled. But last Friday night at around 10:30, the impending meeting between the two got a lot more compelling than some may have predicted at the beginning of the season. The Titans (1-2 Northwestern 3A/4A Conference, 3-4 overall) and Cougars (1-2, 5-2) face off tonight at Titan Stadium (7:30) with both teams jockeying for position in the conference standings – and both coming off wildly different results last week. McDowell is riding the crest of a convincing 48-28 win at South Caldwell over the league’s only other 4A squad. The victory gives the Titans the inside track for the one State 4A Playoff berth the NWC gets, but if McDowell can finish among the top three in the split conference standings, the Titans would be seeded with the No. 1s as opposed to the at-large clubs. Meanwhile, the Cougars have sustained back-to-back throttlings at the hands of Freedom (38-6) and Watauga (35-0) the last two weeks after starting the season 5-0. Central’s hopes of defending its NWC championship may have faded, but the Cougars are still a dangerous foe and are a far better club than their NWC record suggests. But McDowell does have some momentum on which on to build. The Titans’ offense comes into tonight’s game playing by far its best football of the season. McDowell has scored 84 points and rolled up 908 yards of offense in its last two outings, a 40-36 loss to St. Stephens and last week’s win over South Caldwell. In the victory over the Spartans, the Titans did something no other MHS team has ever done by having a 100-yard rusher and two 100-yard receivers in the same ballgame. Tailback J.C. Olivo went for career highs of 28 carries, 150 yards and four touchdowns. Andruw Randolph caught five passes for 146 yards and two scores, and Dakota Effler caught four passes for 103 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Adam Randolph was superb, going 11-for-13 for 300 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. The key to all that success was a complete performance by the Titans’ young but improving offensive line. It all added up to a season-high 495 yards. On defense, the Titans made several key personnel moves and held the Spartans largely in check early on, building a commanding 20-6 halftime lead. McDowell ended up allowing 379 yards, but much of it came in a wild fourth quarter that saw the two teams combine for 35 points. While the Titans have achieved solid balance between the running and passing games at times this season, the Cougars prefer to keep it on the ground. And why not? Alexander Central is averaging 300 rushing yards per game and an impressive 8 yards per carry. Coach Butch Carter’s Cougars also like to share the wealth. Two players have more than 500 rushing yards and two others are close to the 300-yard mark. Junior A.J. Miller (5-8, 150) leads the way with 518 yards and seven TDs on 61 attempts. Junior Steven Montgomery (5-8, 175) has 511 yards and seven touchdowns on 43 carries. Senior Tevin Clark (5-11, 210) has carried 59 times for 292 yards and five TDs; and junior quarterback Easton Rhoney (5-11, 160) has rushed for 274 yards and four scores on 28 totes. Defensively, senior linebacker Jordan Brown (5-7, 145) leads the team with 47 tackles, including 11 for losses. Senior lineman Isaac Chapman (6-1, 270) has 12 tackles for loss, including 3.5 sacks. For the Titans, Adam Randolph is within sight of a school record. The senior is 84-of-124 passing for 1,318 yards and 13 touchdowns with eight interceptions. He needs just 463 yards to equal McDowell’s single-season record, set by Casey Ray (1,781) in 2014. As it stands right now, his season is already the eighth best on the books. Olivo has rushed for 619 yards and eight TDs on 119 carries for McDowell. Andruw Randolph (26 receptions, 437 yards, 6TDs) and Effler (25-389-4TDs) have been just two of a reliable stable of pass-catchers. Defensively, senior Andrew Davis, who moved from linebacker to the defensive front last week, leads the team with 55 tackles. Linebacker Johan Ayala and linebacker Brycen Seymore – who moved inside from safety – have 48 stops apiece. Meanwhile, lineman Bryce Allison has made 43 stops and leads the team with seven tackles for loss and six quarterback sacks. Junior Braedon Allison also moved to linebacker last week, and made nine tackles. Notes: McDowell leads the all-time series 17-14, but Alexander Central has won the last six meetings between the two, including a 55-21 win last year in Taylorsville…Tonight is youth league night.

Andrew,Davis,1761,https://www.ktvz.com/news/cocc-seeks-new-president-may-save-newspaper/805641117,"Posted: Oct 11, 2018 12:07 AM PDT Updated: Oct 11, 2018 12:07 AM PDT REDMOND, Ore. - Central Oregon Community College is now one step closer to finding its next president - and also may be closer to reviving its previously halted campus newspaper. The COCC Board of Directors got an update on the presidential search process at Wednesday night's meeting.. It's still early, but they are still on track, according to John Mundy the chair of the board. They have created a committee to help in the search for their next president, succeeding Dr. Shirley Metcalf, who retires at the end of next June.. The board approved the committee to lead the hiring process for the new president, along with a profile or description of what they are looking for in the next college leader. Mundy said the board is looking for someone who's inclusive and is able to create good relationships with the faculty, staff and the students, and also create a good relationship with the community. ""We have what are called career technological programs, or CTE. We also have workforce development."" Mundy said. ""We want to make sure that we have someone who is astounding in that respect, somebody who can really grab the bull by the horns and coordinate with the local business leaders and give them what they need to develop our local workforce."" The next step is to advertise the open position, within the next week. From there, the committee will review the resumes received and give the board four candidates to interview. Mundy said he hopes to have the hiring process completed by mid February or early March. The future of the college's student run newspaper is in question as well. The COCC student-run newspaper, The Broadside, was shut down recently due to a lack of funding and support, but now it may be coming back. Those in the journalism department would like to see the paper return, even if it is in another form. The college received feedback suggesting they take a second look at shutting down the paper. Andrew Davis, the director of student and campus life at COCC, said the college is now forming a group that will take a look at just how viable it is for the news source to continue. Davis said the paper really is a unique experience for students. ""It's a teaching tool. Students get work opportunities in the field of journalism , and that's a good piece,"" Davis said. ""It also gives them a good opportunity to examine campus and community issues, and raise questions in a really specific format that otherwise they might feel like they don't have the ability to do."" About 25 students were involved in running the paper each year, but by last year, that number was down to just 10 students. About 400 papers were printed for each edition, but fewer than half of them were being read. That's why the paper could take a different form, if it's to be brought back. It might not just be a hard copy, but digital/online. That's what the newly created focus group will have to decide. Copyright 2018 KTVZ. All rights reserved.

Andrew,Davis,1761,http://www.courier-tribune.com/news/20181011/nc-district-judge-district-19b,"CORRECTION: The editor’s note that ran Friday on the judicial candidates contained incorrect information. District Court Judge Lee Gavin, who is running unopposed for his District 19B seat, explained the process more clearly: The judicial redistricting this year split Randolph, Montgomery and Moore counties, not just Randolph and Montgomery. In the process, Randolph did not lose a District Court judgeship but gained one — the N.C. District Judge, District 19B seat for which Brooke Schmidly, Sarah Neely Lanier and Andrew Davis are running. Current District Court Judge James Hill did not lose his seat when the redistricting occurred. Hill left that seat to run for a new Superior Court judgeship that was created. He is unopposed. A new judge will be appointed to replace Hill and fill out his term that expires in 2020. “The way the appointment works depends on the result of the constitutional amendment on the Nov. 6 ballot,” Gavin added. “Currently, the governor would make the appointment. But if the amendment passes, the Legislature would send the governor at least two names and he would pick one of those two that the Legislature wants.” *** Editor’s note: The Courier-Tribune’s General Election coverage continues today with a look at the one contested local judicial race — for the N.C. District Judge, District 19B seat. When judicial redistricting this year split Montgomery County from Randolph County and District 19B, a district court judgeship was removed from Randolph. When that occurred, Judge James Hill lost his Randolph County seat. Rather than filing for another district court seat, he is running, unopposed, for a new Superior Court judgeship in District 19B. Also, Judge Jayrene Maness of District 19B chose not to run for re-election. Filing for her seat are Andrew Davis of Denton, Sarah Neely Lanier of Asheboro and Brooke Schmidly of Asheboro. Judges Scott Etheridge and Lee Gavin are running unopposed for their respective N.C. District Court 19B seats. Montgomery County is now in District 20A with Stanly County. Moore County and Hoke County now make up District 19. *** Name: J. Brooke Schmidly. Age: 42. Address: 2575 Hickory Drive, Asheboro.

Family: Husband, Jeremy “Roper” Lanier, captain with the Randolph County Sheriff’s Office over Courthouse Security/Bailiff Division; son, Alex Lanier. Political Affiliation: Republican *** * What characteristics do you believe make a good judge? Schmidly: Judges need to be extremely knowledgeable about the law, completely independent of any political party, willing to follow the law (whether we agree with it personally or not), and insistent on the respectful treatment of everyone involved in the court system. Our system of justice works best when both sides are represented by competent lawyers and the judge is truly independent and impartial. If a person is ever likely to encounter our judicial system, that will occur in district court which decides issues impacting families, children and small businesses. The issues decided by district court judges are too important for someone to “learn on the job.” Finally, judges are vested with tremendous power. They may take someone’s liberty away. Therefore, I believe judges need a calm judicial temperament, and to be people who have demonstrated self-control and respect for all people. Davis: I am fair minded with an even-keel temperament. Lanier: District Court covers a number of areas. A good judge is knowledgeable about all areas of district court laws and upholds the law. A good judge does not bend rules to fit a particular individual or attorney, and is a good listener. In the words of King Solomon, they must have a “hearing heart”: someone who is willing to hear each side of the case and make decisions only at the end of the case. A good judge must have a consistent judicial temperament. She must treat everyone that comes before her with respect and dignity. A good judge makes wise use of her time, is available during the work day even when her court is down, and is willing to answer after-hours calls for emergencies. A good judge does not allow unnecessary delays in court and works to make court more efficient through use of scheduling. A good judge serves the community with innovations like Family Drug Court and courtroom technology. A good judge is tough on repeat offenders but believes someone is innocent until proven guilty. A good judge is a servant leader who puts the justice of the community first every single day. * What are your experience/education/qualifications that make you the best candidate? Why should Randolph County citizens vote for you? Schmidly: I have extensive experience in every area of district court. I spent four years as a prosecutor, prosecuting major felonies and eight years defending criminal cases (military and NC district and superior court). I have focused my practice primarily on civil and family issues for the last six years. I have tried over 40 jury trials (criminal and civil), have tried countless child custody and other family law cases, and I am a certified family financial mediator and a NC parenting coordinator (appointed by the court to shield children from high conflict divorce cases). Both in the length of my time practicing (nearly 18 years) and in the complexity of cases I have handled, both civil and criminal, I have far more experience than the candidates running against me. Additionally, having represented so many citizens of Randolph County in these very important matters, I know how important it is that a judge put in the hours necessary to get the ruling correct and issued as quickly as reasonably possible and I will always do that, if elected. I am used to long hours working on behalf of my clients and I will never rush through court or leave early when the people in cases before me are waiting their turn or awaiting my decision. Davis: I have 17 years practicing in all the different divisions of Randolph County District Court. I plan to set up closer communication between the Randolph County Court System and Federal ICE Agents. Lanier: Many people don’t realize how involved district court is in the lives of children and families. I am the only candidate who currently practices in all district courts. I have over 80 hours of continuing legal education in the area of child welfare law (for prospective, only 12 hours of continuing legal education is required per year), attended national conferences on the topic of child welfare laws, worked to develop local rules for Abuse, Neglect and Dependency Court, and am the only candidate certified to represent children in child welfare law cases as a Guardian ad Litem Attorney Advocate. Before I went to law school, on the advice of my father, I worked in the public sector rather than going straight to law school. I worked with juvenile offenders involved in court through the Teen Court and Restitution/Community Service programs. This gave me perspective about how the court system works and helped me see the areas where it could be improved. My focus is on children, families and ensuring the best interests of children involved in Randolph County cases. I know how important it is for district court judges to understand the laws. Soon, all Termination of Parental Rights cases will be appealed directly to the North Carolina Supreme Court. We need a judge who will be ready to hear these important cases from day one. These families usually are in the court system for a long period of time and the children need permanence. It is important that these important cases have sound court orders so they will not be overturned on appeal. My experience and sound knowledge of the laws will directly benefit families and children of Randolph County. I have also helped train law enforcement. I volunteer in mock trials to better prepare local law enforcement for hearings. I was hired to teach law enforcement officers throughout North Carolina civil procedure in Nuisance Abatement cases to shut down drug houses in communities. I’m pleased to have the support of law enforcement, Sheriff Robert Graves, Republican Sheriff Nominee Greg Seabolt, retired District Attorney Garland Yates, current District Attorney Andy Gregson as well as many other community leaders. In terms of criminal court, I see how drugs have affected our community and our crime rates. I pledge to be tough on repeat offenders but also help those with addictions seek and receive the help they need. Randolph County citizens should vote for me because I have the necessary experience and I will be fair and impartial to those appearing before me. * How will you balance being an independent judge and an elected official? Schmidly: Judges have to be completely independent and can’t decide cases if their impartiality is in question in any way. They also have to make rulings without regard to whether they will please certain individuals or political parties. The more political someone has been, the more concern we should all have as to whether that person will decide cases solely on the facts and law. I ran as a Democrat because I was not going to change my party affiliation for political advantage — I think truth matters if we are asking voters to trust us as a judge. However, I have not been a political person in any way, either locally or nationally. I’ve never had a client ask or care about a judge’s political affiliation. What they do care about is whether the judge knows the law, whether the judge will hear both sides out before making a decision, and the judge’s record of making good decisions for children. Despite what some people think, the judiciary is the place that politics should matter the least. I think judges, however, need to do a better job of being willing to speak honestly about how our legal system can be improved and be willing to hear and consider concerns from any person in our community. If trusted with this position, I will be accessible to everyone but beholden to no one. Davis: I am funding my own campaign, unlike the two opponents running against me, and will therefore not owe any favors to special interest groups if and when elected. Lanier: While political party may be indicative of how a judge may rule, I believe judges need to be answerable to the people. It is a powerful position and should be seen as a trust rather than a right. I am involved in a number of community organizations, am an active member of my church and serve in a number of leadership positions within those organizations because I am trusted to do a good job. I’m pleased to have the unanimous endorsement of the Randolph County Republican Party. I am a lifelong Republican, but while on the bench, politics will not influence my decisions. * How do you define injustice? How will you work to ensure equal access to justice for all? Schmidly: I continue to be concerned that justice can be very different for those who have financial means and those who don’t. This summer, while accepting the Pro Bono service award on behalf of the Randolph County bar, I encouraged North Carolina attorneys to do pro bono service openly to show people in NC the very good work of lawyers and also to inspire other lawyers to help the needy and vulnerable. I believe that judges have an important role in advocating for our system of justice, to the public and to our legislature. We need judges who will work with the administrative office of the courts to understand the impact of technological improvements that can drastically drive down cost, who understand the importance of adequate funding for lawyers to represent indigent people so the poorest people can have the benefit of the finest lawyers. In words and deeds, judges must push back against any and all attempts to politicize the courts. Davis: It varies depending on the situation, but as it applies to Randolph County District Court … when courts do not follow proper procedure and allow unwarranted judgments to follow as a result of those improper procedures. Make sure the each person has an understanding and appreciation of the circumstances that brings them to Randolph County District Court and inform each person about his/her access to counsel/representation. Lanier: Injustice is failure to follow the current laws of the state and nation. It is bending the laws to fit a particular result versus having the laws apply equally to everyone. It is also failing to treat people with respect, and failing to listen to all sides of a case prior to ruling. I believe local law enforcement does a fine job ensuring access to the criminal justice system and judges do not need to create additional business for our criminal courts. The Constitution affords us certain liberties and judges must ensure those liberties are not violated. On the civil side, I will listen to all sides objectively. I would encourage all people who appear in front of me, regardless of representation, to review the local rules. The rules have a wealth of information from case timeline expectations to completing necessary forms for court. I would not treat a person representing themselves any differently than a person who hires an attorney, but I would expect the rules of court to be followed by all parties.

FLORENCE — A complaint filed by the owners of Stricklin Hotel against its downtown neighbor, FloBama Music Hall, has been dismissed. Court records indicate Lauderdale County Circuit Judge Benjamin R. Graves signed two orders on Sept. 18 dismissing the noise ordinance complaint against Andrew Davis and FloBama, as well as supplemental defendants, the City of Florence, Florence Police Chief Ron Tyler and City Prosecutor Heath Trousdale. In a joint stipulation requesting dismissal of the suit, plaintiffs' attorney John Saylor stated his clients have reached an ""amicable and confidential resolution of their dispute"" and therefore he asked that the case be dismissed. ""I am not at liberty to give the details of that settlement; however, it was reached by mutual agreement,"" Saylor said. Efforts Monday to reach Davis and his attorney, Jim Stanphill, of Florence, were unsuccessful. The owners of Stricklin Hotel, a boutique hotel located next door to FloBama, filed a complaint July 20, claiming loud music coming from the business late at night was negatively impacting the hotel's customers, and could damage future business. On Aug. 3, Davis and hotel owners Darren Rhodes and Jim Cunningham released a joint statement concerning the court action. In the statement, the owners stated they were working together in good faith to resolve any differences. Due to the confidentiality agreement, Saylor cannot discuss how the two businesses came to terms. ""Both parties are satisfied and live music is alive and well, as it always has been in downtown Florence,"" Saylor said. Saylor said the terms of the settlement are being kept confidential to protect the parties. Court records indicate the complaint against Florence, the police chief and city prosecutor was dismissed ""with prejudice,"" meaning the plaintiff is barred from bringing a new action against the defendants on the same claim. The complaint against Davis and FloBama, however, was dismissed ""without prejudice,"" which means the claim could be filed again. According to the judge's order: ""This court will retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcing the terms of the parties' settlement agreement and mutual releases."" In their original complaint, Stricklin Hotel owners suggested FloBama add additional insulation to the wall adjacent to the hotel building; detach the stage from the wall adjoining the hotel; or use other sound-dampening materials to prevent sound from penetrating the adjoining building. ""We are very pro live music and we feel live music is part of the fabric of our community, part of the success of downtown Florence,"" Saylor said. ""We are pleased with the outcome. Obviously, we never wanted to go this far."" Efforts to reach city attorney Billy Musgrove were unsuccessful Monday. City Council President Dick Jordan said the issue was between Stricklin Hotel owners and FloBama. The council president said he was happy the complaint was settled. ""I think it's good for everyone that they were able to work that out among themselves,"" Jordan said. ""It's beneficial to everyone. Both of them add to the livability of our downtown."" russ.corey@timesdaily.com or 256-740-5738. Twitter @TD_.RussCorey Your comment has been submitted. Reported There was a problem reporting this.

Andrew,Davis,1758,http://floridapolitics.com/archives/277092-ken-hagan-stacy-white-crushing-competition-in-hillsborough-co-commission-campaign-cash,"Two Hillsborough County Commission races look like they might be landslides based on campaign finance activity. Incumbents Ken Hagan and Stacy White are crushing their opponents in the money battle. Hagan has raised more than $500,000 in bid against Democrat Angela Birdsong for the District two seat covering north Hillsborough County currently held by Victor Crist. Crist is running for Hagan’s District 5 countywide seat. North Hillsborough, which includes both rural and suburban areas, is historically conservative and Hagan has won it before. He won that seat in 2002, 2004 and 2008. Birdsong has raised just $30,000 and has less than $200 remaining in her campaign account. Hagan isn’t wasting time with infusing his campaign with nickel and dime contributions. Nearly half of his 36 contributions during the last two weeks of September were $1,000, the maximum allowed. Most of his latest campaign haul came from real estate professionals and developers, followed by construction and contracting businesses, engineering and consulting. All of Birdsong’s contributions came from individual donors, not corporations, groups or business. Hagan spent $4.300 during the latest campaign reporting period including on advertising with La Gaceta for $231 and various campaign support staff. Birdsong spent $7,800 with most of that going to Blue Ticket Consulting in St. Petersburg for advertising. White, the Hillsborough County Commission District 4 incumbent, is also stomping his opposition in campaign cash. The Republican has raised more than $200,000 for his reelection to his highly conservative east and south Hillsborough seat. Those contributions were largely high dollar with more than half of his 20 contributions during the last two weeks of September at $1,000 each. Not one contribution was less than $100. Checks came largely from real estate and construction and development professionals and businesses. His Democratic opponent, Andrew Davis, has raised just over $10,000 to date and spent all but $1,100 of that. Davis brought in just $100 during the latest reporting period. He spent $1,800 on yard signs and printing. Florida Politics is a statewide, new media platform covering campaigns, elections, government, policy, and lobbying in Florida.

Andrew,Davis,1758,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6586119-151/bend-council-candidates-debate-bike-lanes-mirror-pond,"Several candidates for the Bend City Council talked about transportation issues and Mirror Pond dredging during a wide-ranging debate Tuesday at 10 Barrel Brewing’s east-side pub. The candidates for position 5 are Andrew Davis, student life director at Central Oregon Community College; Gena Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association; and Victor Johnson, a musician. The position 6 candidates are Barb Campbell, a sitting city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop; Sarah McCormick, a stay-at-home mother; and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, a community activist. Boozell missed the debate because he’s in jail through December for failing to pay child support. McCormick was absent because she was celebrating Canada’s Thanksgiving with her in-laws. But she recorded a video that aired at the start of the debate in which she said she was running because she was worried about her children’s safety downtown because of an “increasingly aggressive homeless population” and worried that Campbell was too concerned with national hot-button issues. Mirror Pond A private group that owns the land under Mirror Pond has spent more than a year seeking contributions from the city, the Bend Park & Recreation District, Pacific Power and private donors in order to pay the $6.7 million cost of dredging decades’ worth of accumulated silt from the pond. A few city councilors and park board members plan to meet later this fall to discuss ways the two governments could contribute. Johnson said everyone should split the cost. Davis agreed, saying the city, park district and homeowners along that section of river have an obligation to pay because Mirror Pond is an important part of the city. “Growing up in Bend, you couldn’t not know Mirror Pond,” Davis said. The city needs to remember that private owners own the land under Mirror Pond, and should figure out how to pay for dredging, Goodman-Campbell said. Old Mill District developer Bill Smith and Taylor Northwest Construction company owner Todd Taylor received the land several years ago. “I’ve been a little bit frustrated watching the city take up time and resources and staff discussing how the city should contribute when I don’t even know that the city should,” Goodman-Campbell said. Pacific Power’s dam, which created the pond, also created the problem of accumulated silt, Campbell said. She compared Pacific Power to a local wood chips company that the city cited when it let wood chips pile up, and said other businesses pay to clean up messes when they make them. Instead of cleaning up its own mess, Pacific Power is trying to get tax money to pay for it, Campbell said. She said she won’t support any city funding for the silt removal. Transportation planning Candidates were asked how they’d reconcile transportation for people who want to bike and people who want to drive. Campbell said she was excited about neighborhood greenways, which the city is now trying on NE Sixth Street and NW 15th Street. Greenways mean bicyclists can spend less time using bike lanes on busy streets, she said. “You take the thoroughfare and you go a block away, onto the residential street where traffic is already slower,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell said they’re both excited about partnering with the park district on ways to provide better-connected paths for bikers and pedestrians, especially on new, undeveloped land that Bend will plan and annex during the next several years. Johnson said he’d want to see more connected bike paths that will make it possible for people to safely bike from one side of town to the other. “We could structure downtown to be more bike friendly and pedestrian friendly,” he said. More than 80 percent of commuters drive with one or two occupants in their cars, Davis said. He said the city should keep high rates of driving in mind while planning, but also make sure new roads are wide enough and have adequate bike lanes. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806412,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

The bowling operator reported like-for-like revenue growth of 1.8 per cent in the 12 months to the end of September this year, adding that it expects pre-tax profit will have grown by 10 per cent over the same period. Shares jumped more than four per cent in early morning trading, as the group said it would return the excess cash from its profits to shareholders, providing it decides not to snap up any more expected short-term acquisitions this year.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson has spent the last few months reassuring New Zealanders that even though business confidence has been falling, the economy has actually been performing well. However, when the first set of annual Crown financial statements published under his watch on Tuesday provided some great headline figures to back up his stance, he retreated a little. Rather than boasting about the operating balance before gains and losses (OBEGAL) coming in higher than expected at $5.5 billion and the Government reaching its net core Crown debt reduction goal four years ahead of target, Robertson was a tad coy. He accepted the financials for the year to June 30 gave him a solid “starting point,” but didn’t shy away from admitting that this was in part due to the Government spending its money slower than Treasury had forecast in the 2018 Budget. So yes, it was great to see revenue (largely from taxes) increase more than expected. But half of the operational expenditure undershoot from Treasury’s projections, could be attributed to “timing issues”, meaning it’ll be spent next year. Treasury had expected the Government’s operational spend to reach $105.7 billion, but it only hit $104.0 billion. Looking at its net core capital expenditure, this was expected to come in at $6.7 billion, but it only reached $5.9 billion (note this is still the highest it’s been since 2009). Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon believes this shows that “spending up is hard to do”. “Bottlenecks and capacity constraints have for some time been the main hindrance to a lift in infrastructure spending, not the Government’s self-imposed borrowing limits.” So Gordon is saying it’s more a matter of the Government not being able to spend more than it is expected to, than it choosing not to do so. He points to a note he sent out ahead of the Budget in May, in which he explained: “Projected spending is one thing, reality is another. “From around 2015 the government began to recognise the need for a lift in capital spending, to support the rapid growth in the population. But we’ve yet to see actual spending rise beyond the levels seen over the last decade… “The Treasury has cited delays and capacity constraints in the construction sector as reasons for the shortfall. In this case, the spending shortfall is added back into the following years’ projections. “This backlog of delayed spending, plus the additions to spending plans in the last few Budgets, mean that the projections for capital spending over the next few years have ballooned out rapidly… “The side effect of delayed spending is delayed borrowing. Net core Crown debt has fallen well below what was forecast in recent Budgets. “Some of that can be put down to a stronger than expected tax take. But it’s also the case that the Government hasn’t had to borrow for projects that have yet to begin.” Gordon concluded: “While we think that the Government could meet its net debt target quite comfortably, it may not be for the reasons they intended.” He stands by those comments now, saying: “Overall, the accounts for the June 2018 year suggest a substantial amount of wiggle room for the Government in coming years. “Some of that wiggle room could quickly disappear – the Treasury’s GDP forecasts are at the top of the market range, so there’s a strong risk that the tax take falls short if the economy doesn’t grow as rapidly as expected. “But there is also room to provide some extra fiscal stimulus if the economy needs it. “The challenge will be how to spend it, if bottlenecks are proving to be an issue in a number of areas.” Help interest.co.nz grow our coverage, independent as always.

Against a $2.2 billion spend on the network, with the majority on State Highway 1 due to the Kaikoura Earthquakes, the revaluation appears to have taken a replacement based approach, as opposed to a value based approach which has resulted in a $2.4 billion uplift, as well as an average preliminary and general assumption rate of 34% equating to an $4 billion uplift. It does not seem that this valuation approach has been widely used in many other countries, but with some creative accounting the Government has turned a certain deficit into an astounding surplus. This will certainly be surprising to many, especially when considering the major increase in value is due to a fairly unusual approach."" https://www.trademe.co.nz/Community/MessageBoard/Messages.aspx?id=177414... Is this correct? Are we in fact just witnessing a whole lot of creative accounting flim-flammery from ""the most open and transparent government ever""? Having read the financials (here) especially the cash flow (which unlike almost everything else, is not subject to judgements about values, contingencies etc) I concur that the off-BS borrowing is the elephant-shaped hump under the dusty carpet in that faraway back room. The Highways revaluation uses ODRC, nicely explained here (although one can see the point in moving the acronym around from DORC). But the driver behind asset revals, more broadly, is to make BS ratios such as debt-to-equity, more palatable. Which may just mean that the 'wiggle room' referred to in the article consists of more ability to raise debt. In, say, 18 months' time. Because child poverdy.... The surplus from revaluation of assets is not included in the operating surplus of $5.5b. It is included as a other comprehensive revenue and expense (in the statement of comprehensive revenue and expenses on page 40 of the financial statements). In a nut shell, the valuation of roads has nothing to do with the $5.5b surplus discussed here. The main reason for the operating surplus is the $5b increase in taxation income and the $2b other income. Thanks to both you and waymad for clearing that up for me. So that just leaves the $6.5 Billion borrowings for Housing and NZTA, in truth part of the govt, and arranged this way purely so that it won't be accounted for in the debts for the OBEGAL figures, but meaning that the 'surplus' is in reality a $1Billion deficit. They haven’t spent 6.5 billion already have they? I agree 100% The failure of something like Kiwibuild will not be due to having no money It will be due to capacity constraints , logistical nightmares , Fletchers ensuring we cannot import Kit-form houses from Germany , not enough builders and Councils rorting the system by double dipping for fees , levies and charges , like $20,000.00 for a water meter and piece of pipe that costs just $300 . And I totally agree too. The extremes of self interest and squandering other people’s money is embedded deeply in our bureaucracies and those tentacles reach well into the corporates and vice versa for that matter. Far cats everywhere fighting for the cream while the milk pours out of the bottom of the bucket. Will be a pretty sad indictment of Fletchers as a company that grew to be what it is in part because of previous government housing efforts, if they stand in the way of affordable housing for Kiwis now. So if there are real capacity constraints in construction, fiscal stimulus could be focused on other areas of need. Areas that don't involve hard hats. Education, health and social care for example. Areas that if we invest today we form a skilled, educated workforce, decreasing dependency rates, shaping the kind of youngsters who can successfully engineer and work in that construction industry in a few years time. NZ still has a shortage of aggregate demand and a significant amount of underemployed and what I would call mal-employment. Spend to reduce that. Don't worry, NZ has lost the ability to consent and deliver projects within sane timeframes. Plenty of time to train up a workforce. They must use EY. Not sure why everyone is carping on about how hard it is to get a building project done as profitably as possible...is it any different in comparable economies? Highly unlikely. If you haven't twigged on yet there are other ways to make money like running an exporting business for instance, which by the way would generate export dollars for the economy...does anyone even care about that on this website?",0.0,2.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1011876,0.8502049218798918,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Now he's giving back to the city. Achievement in Service Award winner Michael Gordon Michael Gordon served three terms as president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association. (Casey Jade Photography) As part of UNLV's Homecoming festivities, the UNLV Alumni Association will celebrate the accomplishments of graduates at its annual reception and awards ceremony Oct. 18. You can stream the awards ceremony live here. Achievement in Service Award winner Michael Gordon is a vice president at The Public Education Foundation. He came to Las Vegas from Cape Town, South Africa in September 2006 on a Rotary International Ambassadorial scholarship. He is a double alumnus of UNLV with a master's of public administration in 2008 and doctorate in 2013, and continues, through his professional work and community involvement, to give back to UNLV and the community. It will sound trite, but without the academic and community engagement education I received at UNLV, I would not be where I am today. During my student days I was lucky enough to be part of several Foundation and Alumni events where I quickly learned that the civic leadership, persistence and a rebellious spirit is what build this university and town. The continued support and advocacy of these donors and community leaders is what allows UNLV to continue to produce the workforce for our growing economy and expanding city. Without their dedication to Las Vegas, none of us would be here. I was lucky enough to benefit from other people’s generosity and vision to make this university – and city – an excellent place to live and work. I want to help build on their vision and that’s why I’m proud to be a Rebel and to support the institution that will continue its proud tradition of opening doors for a different, daring and diverse student population. Michael Gordon came to Las Vegas from Cape Town, South Africa in September 2006 on a Rotary International Ambassadorial scholarship. As a student, he served three terms as president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association as well as one term as chair of the Nevada Student Alliance.

Michael,Gordon,1756,https://www.unlv.edu/news/article/stranger-strange-land-made-welcome,"Graduate College Alumnus of the Year Michael Gordon got a big boost when he was new in this country. Graduate College Alumnus of the Year Michael Gordon serves on several committees for UNLV. (Casey Jade Photography) As part of UNLV's Homecoming festivities, the UNLV Alumni Association will celebrate the accomplishments of graduates at its annual reception and awards ceremony Oct. 18. You can stream the awards ceremony live here. Graduate College Alumnus of the Year Michael Gordon, ’08 MPA, ’13 Ph.D., is a vice president at the Public Education Foundation. He came to Las Vegas from Cape Town, South Africa, September 2006 on a Rotary International Ambassadorial Scholarship and is a double alumnus of UNLV. During his time as a student, he served three terms as president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association and in numerous other roles. Almost everybody at UNLV showed me kindness in some form or fashion. It started even before I arrived with the Rotary Club of Las Vegas providing a scholarship to me to study in the United States. I had trouble getting my acceptance letter for my visa and former UNLV President (and Rotary member) Pat Goodall helped that process along — and I was greeted at the airport by Pat Carlton who would later serve on my dissertation committee. How many students can say that their academic advisor welcomed them to the country? I arrived in September and had already missed several weeks of classes, but during that first week Janine Barrett at the Graduate College was extremely patient and answered numerous questions from a scared international student. Lee Bernick, then chair of the department of public administration, made sure that I hit the ground running and had the support to succeed academically. My concerns about living on campus were mollified after speaking to Chrisey Grubb and moving into Tonopah residence hall, where I was greeted by “cool beans” Stan Dura. Finally, my first week was complete when Risha Gaitor offered me a job at the Student Union front desk. That job forced me to learn anything and everything about UNLV in double time. Nowadays, our Rotary Club continues this proud tradition of working closely with the university. Every year, we provide the Tiberti Scholarship to an engineering student; in partnership with UNLV Athletics, we entertain 350-plus children on Santa Clothes Day and help identify Honors College students for graduate international scholarships. During his time as a student, Gordon served three terms as president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association as well as one term as chair of the Nevada Student Alliance, the overarching student government association for all Nevada System of Higher Education student government organizations representing the more than 105,000 higher education students in Nevada. As a policy analyst at UNLV he researched and analyzed the academic infrastructure needs of the university while serving on the Faculty Senate, University Policy Committee and the Top Tier Community Engagement subcommittee. He is also a graduate of the Leadership Las Vegas Class of 2012 and serves on the boards of the Salvation Army of Southern Nevada, the Boy Scouts Las Vegas Area Council, and Beacon Academy of Nevada as well as the Rotary Club of Las Vegas.

Michael,Gordon,1756,https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/10/exclusive-listen-to-mkgees-dreamy-funky-come-on-yo.html,"Mk.gee, the project of L.A.-based songwriter Michael Gordon, has shared new single “Come On (You Know That I’m a Fool),” premiering exclusively here at Paste. The track is the first single off Mk.gee’s forthcoming EP Fool, which is being self-released on Nov. 16. The track is stuttering, sun-scorched dream-funk, a wavelength that Mk.gee has been comfortably operating on since his previous album, Pronounced McGee, which came out earlier this year. The track finds Mk.gee submerging his pure pop sensibilities under layers of watery production tricks. “I realized that the act of recording is not just simply trying to get the cleanest sounds,” he says. “There is unlimited creativity and storytelling with the way things sound on a record, which really got me into production.” The video juxtaposes the track’s depressed, solipsistic lyricism with images of Mk.gee and friends frolicking in a desert expanse, dancing numbly as the sun sets. “I wanted the video to be a bit of an ironic juxtaposition to the song,” Mk.gee says. “The music is pretty somber and deals with change and loneliness, but ironically the video is pretty lighthearted, and it’s just me and my friends doing dumb shit.” It’s dumb shit that’s often the best antidote to depressing shit, so the sentiment feels right. Mk.gee will be performing a handful of shows to celebrate the release of the Fool EP. Those dates can be found further down.

Rep. Michael Sylvester, D-Portland, is seeking re-election to the Maine House District 39 seat in what is virtually an uncontested race. Republican Peter Doyle’s name will appear on the ballot, but he declined a request to be interviewed and has not raised or spent any money on his campaign. PETER DOYLE Party affiliation: Republican Doyle declined to be interviewed and did not provide biographical info to the Press Herald. MICHAEL SYLVESTER Age: 49 Residence: Peaks Island Party affiliation: Democrat Family: Married, with three sons Occupation: Owner of Mike’s Carts on Peaks Island Education: Bachelor’s in languages and literature, Bard College Political/civic experience: State representative, District 39, 2016-present Website/social media: www.facebook.com/sylvester.forstatehouse Sylvester, a Maine Clean Elections candidate, lives on Peaks Island, where he runs a golf cart rental business. The 49-year-old is completing his first term representing House District 39, which includes the East End, eastern waterfront and the Casco Bay islands. Although he chairs the progressive caucus, Sylvester said he has been able to secure bipartisan support for a local option sales tax, which would allow municipalities to generate revenue from tourism-related industries. Though the bill did not get enough support to pass, he hopes to reintroduce that legislation in the next term. “We were able to accomplish a lot of things in terms of holding the line on the minimum wage and a lot of bills that were, in my view, targeting immigrants in Maine and being able to really push forward some progressive legislation,” he said. A Democratic Socialist, Sylvester supports the expansion of Medicaid that was approved by voters. And he also supports a so-called Medicare-for-all bill, which would provide health insurance to everyone. He also supports changing state law to allow for safe consumption sites, where people struggling with heroin addiction can shoot up under medical supervision. Some advocates have talked about creating a site in Portland, as a way to prevent overdose deaths and help people find treatment when they are ready. Although there is currently a shortage of treatment options, Sylvester said he still supports safe consumption sites. “Nobody can seek treatment if they’re not alive,” he said. “We’re in a little bit of a triage stage where we need to keep people alive.” Randy Billings can be contacted at 791-6346 or at: [email protected] Twitter: randybillings Send questions/comments to the editors. < Previous Next > Here at MaineToday Media we value our readers and are committed to growing our community by encouraging you to add to the discussion.

John,O'Neil,1752,https://marketbusinessnews.com/employment-outcomes-disabilities/188604/,"Market Business News - The latest business news For individuals with disabilities in the United States, employment outcomes depend strongly on local and state conditions. They also depend on the physical environment, says a team of researchers. The researchers wrote about their study and findings in the Journal of Disability Policy Studies (citation below). The authors are Andrew Houtenville, PhD, and Debra Brucker PhD, of the University of New Hampshire – Institute on Disability; Purvi Sevak, PhD, of Mathematica Policy Research; and John O’Neil, PhD, of the Kessler Foundation. The researchers explored the underlying factors that influence the considerable geographic variation among people with disabilities. The study focused on people in the United States. Across the US, there is a significant difference in the employment outcomes for Americans with disabilities. West Virginia, for example, has an employment rate of 25.3, while North Dakota’s is 52.8%. Employment rates in Arizona range from less than 30% to over 40%. Job prospects in Arizona vary by county. This wide variation in employment rates among and within US states suggests that environmental factors influence job opportunities. Policy variables, local economic conditions, and the physical environment, for example, affect employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The research team gathered and analyzed data from the 2009-2011 American Community Survey. They also worked with a set of county- and state-level environmental variables. They examined the relationship between job opportunities for people with disabilities and environmental factors. Specifically, factors that exist in the states and counties where people live. Regarding employment outcomes, personal characteristics and individual health mattered more than the environmental factors, the researchers found. Dr. John O’Neill, Director of Disability and Employment Research at Kessler Foundation, said: “We found that employment outcomes were most strongly related to the economic conditions and physical environment; while the policy environment was less of an influence.” “None of these factors, however, were as strongly related to employment as individual health and personal characteristics, which is why all of these factors need to be weighed and considered in order to find effective ways to improve employment outcomes for people with disabilities.” Dr. O’Neill added: “The efforts we focus on policies aimed at benefiting individuals must be weighed within the broader context of the environment.” “For example, policies that expand educational opportunities will be more likely to result in employment if the local job market and economic conditions of the job market are considered.” “State and Local Determinants of Employment Outcomes Among Individuals With Disabilities,” Purvi Sevak, PhD, John O’Neill, PhD, Andrew Houtenville, PhD, Debra Brucker, PhD, and Debra Brucker.

Panmure Gordon’s parent company, Panmure Gordon Group, made profits after tax of £2.3m in 2017, more than double the £1.1m 2016 profits of the pre-takeover group. The firm made net revenues of £14.9m in the year ending in December, according to its latest company accounts. Read more: Will fortune favour brave Bob Diamond's Panmure takeover? However, the bank’s figures were boosted by a £4.1m one-off accounting gain as the parent company took over Panmure’s old assets in what it deemed as ‘bargain purchase.’ Panmure made a statutory operating loss of £2.6m in 2017, compared to an operating profit of £1.6m in 2016, after absorbing £3.3m in acquisition fees and spending £1.2m in new investment. Underlying operating profit was £1.9m. Diamond, who lost his role as Barclays boss following the Libor rate-rigging scandal, banded together with the investment vehicle of the Qatari royal family to buy Panmure last year. The firm, which can trace its roots back to 1876, sustained heavy losses of £16.7m in 2015, prompting a wave of changes at the top and opening the way for the takeover. Ian Axe, Panmure chief executive, said 2017 performance was “stable”, but added the firm had “started to transform both our infrastructure and seed the growth of new businesses and diversification for the coming years”. The firm has expanded into mergers and acquisitions advisory and private capital, alongside more traditional broking activities. The firm’s headcount has risen to 130 people. The group’s UK subsidiary, Panmure Gordon (UK), reported a loss for the year in separate accounts, although this was accounted for mainly by one-off acquisition costs, such as legal and financial advisers, of £2.5m after the takeover. The group’s measure of underlying profit in the UK business after tax was £1.6m.

Born on April 15, 1951, Larry was the son of the late Donald and Helen Stanton. After graduating from Corinth High School in 1969 and earning his bachelor’s degree in business, Larry enjoyed a successful career in manufacturing management at Ball Manufacturing for 18 years; at Cargill, Inc., in Memphis, Tennessee for seven years; and most recently Cushman-Wakefield in Memphis and in New York, until his retirement in 2016. He married Teri L. LeClair on Oct. 12, 1973 in Corinth. The couple has resided in Tampa, Florida, Broomfield, Colorado, Atlanta, Georgia, Sarah, Mississippi, and currently in Corinth. Larry was a hard worker, both at his workplace and his home. He particularly enjoyed working on his little farm in Mississippi and spending time with family and friends. He also enjoyed playing golf, camping, and going on road trips, especially to the ocean. Survivors include his wife of 45 years, Teri (LeClair) Stanton of Corinth; two children, Jessica (Stanton) Redding (Kevin) of Sarah, Mississippi, and Ryan Stanton of Hernando, Mississippi; five grandchildren, Adrianne, Zoe, Ayden, Kora and Ivy; three step-grandchildren, Jacob, Dakota and Gracie; seven siblings, Steven Stanton (Christine) of Leland, North Carolina, Nancy Coffin of Ballston Spa, Michael Stanton (Sharon) of Greenfield Center, Donna Stanton of Greenfield Center, Debbie Stanton of Greenfield Center, Donald Stanton (Quinny) of Corinth and Edward Stanton (Wanda) of Corinth; and many nieces and nephews.

Andrew,Davis,1747,https://dailygazette.com/article/2018/10/08/student-choice-emphasized-in-hs-english-curriculum-rewrite,"SCHENECTADY -- Schenectady High School 10th-grade English teachers are trying something new this year: letting the students pick what they read. As part of a curriculum rewrite this summer, the high school’s 10th-grade English teachers developed a new novel-study unit that lets students choose from a teacher-curated list of about 10 contemporary books. Rather than battling to get students to read the same teacher-assigned novels, teachers are introducing students to a variety of books and giving them independence over what they choose. “It feels more like a privilege to be able to choose your own book,” said sophomore Jayden Williams, as he read ""Unwind"" in Andrew Davis’ English class last week. “You’re more into it than if you were assigned – everyone has different tastes and interests and likes.” Schenectady teachers and administrators don’t want students’ different tastes and interests to get in the way of their common need to learn literary devices, develop skills to analyze both fiction and nonfiction texts and adopt a lifelong love for reading. An essential part of novel study in 10th-grade class is getting students to understand character development, foreshadowing, narrative arc and literary elements – not the content of a particular book. So, the strategy goes, by giving students a choice over what they read, teachers aren't assigning books they just won’t read. “We shouldn’t also have to sell them on liking Julius Caesar,” said Kerri Messler, the district’s English language arts coordinator. “We should put books in front of kids they want to read.” Over the summer, a group of 10th-grade English teachers reworked the grade’s ELA plans. For the new novel-study units, students spent the first couple of weeks getting to know various young adult fiction books before choosing a story to commit to. The introductory time also taught students about ways to evaluate and select books. Each student cited a different reason for picking his or her book. “I liked a lot of the books, but this one seemed to stick with me the most,” said sophomore MyAsya Mayotte, who also chose ""Unwind,"" a novel set in a dystopian future where abortion is outlawed and some teens are harvested for their organs. “It just seemed interesting. I had never heard of anything like that before.” She said giving students a choice over their reading “assignments” makes them more likely to keep up with homework and lessons that go with the novel study. “When you choose a book, you already have that drive to read it, rather than the teacher saying we are all going to read the same book,” MyAsya said. “That’s kind of boring.” Donald Wilson, who chose to read ""Legend,"" another dsytopian young adult novel about a bleak near-future, was already on the second book of the trilogy. “It’s weird, I can’t explain it,” he said of the novel’s plot. “It was a good book.” Teachers who developed the list of books aimed for diverse stories. The novels covered everything from the life of a closeted gay teen to Civil War-era zombies. Many of the books touch on account of post-apocalypitc futures whiles other delved into fictionalized historical worlds. Throughout the district, administrators have sought to infuse more diverse books into classroom libraries and the reading curriculum. Students still have to read various assigned texts like speeches, poems and other material, but the novel study unit, with student choice at its core, makes up one of the longest units of the year and one of the few chances the students get to take on a full-length novel. “Why not have texts students find more interesting and engaging and especially more representative of them?” said Oriana Miles, a 10th-grade English teacher in her first year on the job. Miles, who attended Schenectady schools, said that, for many years, she didn’t encounter nuanced, black characters in the stories she read for school. She ticked off novels like ""Of Mice and Men,"" ""Grapes of Wrath,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and others. That turned her off from literature, she said, until she started reading a wider variety of texts in college, when she “bought into this world of English.” Messler said the traditional Western literary canon that has underpinned high school reading lists for generations skews heavily toward old, white men. What’s left off the reading list sends a message, too, the teachers said. So when students don’t read stories that represent their lives or perspectives, they begin to think their own stories are not worth writing. “What you don’t see and learn in school can be more powerful for how you develop as a person than what you do,” said Ethan Brooks-McDonald, also a new teacher. “If [the traditional canon] is all you’re seeing -- all you’re learning -- then that sends a message.” The English teachers also decided to drop Macbeth from the year’s reading program -- a Shakespeare classic all students had read in previous years. “I was spending as much time trying to get kids to like Macbeth as I was teaching kids what kind of [literary] work Shakespeare is doing inside of this text,” Davis said. “You had to be a car salesman first and a teacher second.” It’s not that the classics don’t have a place, Messler said, but the first goal for educators should be to help students find a love of reading – a love of reading Shakespeare can come later. “At the end of the day, for English teachers K-12, everything they do with reading is in service of independent reading. That’s how they grow as readers: by literally reading,” Messler said. “It’s not that our kids don’t want to read. I feel in my soul kids want to read. They absolutely do. What we forget is their voices and their perspectives matter.”",0.0,1.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,1020357,0.9287548687806412,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

He won the best picture trophy for Oliver Stone's Platoon (1986) and was nominated again for Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993), and His features received 17 Oscar nominations and amassed more than $3 billion in worldwide receipts. In all, Kopelson produced or executive produced nearly 30 features, also including Triumph of the Spirit (1989), Falling Down (1993), David Fincher's Seven (1995), Outbreak (1995), Eraser (1996), The Devil's Advocate (1997), the sequel U.S. Marshals (1998), A Perfect Murder (1998), Thieves (2001) and Twisted (2004). He was honored as producer of the year at ShoWest in 1994. A year later, he signed an exclusive deal with 20th Century Fox after five and a half years with a first-look agreement at Warner Bros. Kopelson began his career in New York as a banking attorney representing institutions that lent money to the entertainment industry. In 1972, he and future wife Anne Feinberg formed Inter-Ocean Film Sales to represent independent producers in marketing their films internationally. The company was an instant success, licensing Ted Kotcheff's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974), starring Richard Dreyfuss. Inter-Ocean recognized the growing demand for U.S. films aboard and capitalized on that need during the 1970s and '80s. For years, he worked the film markets at MIFED, Cannes and AFM, sometimes selling films by the foot. During this period, Inter-Ocean represented producers on more than 100 motion pictures; those films included Bud Yorkin's Twice in a Lifetime (1985) and Stone's Salvador (1986). With sales declining, Kopelson turned to producing, launching Film Packages Inc. (later known as Kopelson Entertainment) to develop and produce movies. He personally financed his company's overhead and development costs and produced his first three movies with Boston-based General Cinema Group. Among his early successes was the box-office comedy sensation Porky's (1981). More auspiciously, Kopelson teamed with Stone on the Vietnam-set Platoon, which received four Oscars in all. He followed up with Warlock (1989) and Triumph of the Spirit, a story of a Balkan boxing champion (Platoon's Willem Dafoe) sent to Auschwitz. The drama, shot at Auschwitz, was praised by Holocaust survivors. Kopelson acquired the rights to the famed 1960s ABC series The Fugitive and produced the adaptation at Warner Bros. that starred Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble. Kopelson had been in the news recently as it was reported this summer that in January, he had made a secret video of Sumner Redstone, his friend of 17 years, that could have emerged in the legal battle between Shari Redstone and members of the CBS board who supported CEO Leslie Moonves. Kopelson denied he had made the video surreptitiously. It could have bolstered claims that Redstone, 95, is no longer competent to weigh in on his businesses, but it was never released and litigation was resolved just as Moonves departed following increasingly serious allegations of sexual misconduct. As Shari Redstone took control of the CBS board, Kopelson was among several directors who departed. Arnold Kopelson was born on Feb. 14, 1935, in Brooklyn. His father was a pianist who died when Kopelson was 10. Raised in Sheepshead Bay in the borough, he studied piano as well. Kopelson earned a degree in business and marketing from NYU, then entered New York Law School while working full time at a law firm. As a lawyer at Gettinger & Gettinger, he was assigned to the Chemical Bank account, which loaned money to the film industry. He worked at the firm for a decade, negotiating deals for United Artists and learning the business side of filmmaking. At Chemical, Kopelson noticed there was a need for foreign distributors to have access to U.S. movies. He acquired the low-budget indie The Last Rebel (1971), starring New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath, and started selling the film, getting names of indie companies from around the world. As checks arrived from around the globe, Arnold and Anne set up Inter-Ocean and started looking for other movies to grow their business. In addition to his wife and business partner of 42 years, Kopelson is survived by his children Peter, Evan and Stephanie. A funeral service will be held at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills. A memorial will take place at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Duane Byrge © 2018 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Michael,Gordon,1746,https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1028369/Brexit-news-UK-EU-deal-latest-Theresa-May-House-of-Commons-Parliament,"Talk of ensuring Brexiteer MPs and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party are put under a “time pressure” could determine when Theresa May is sent back to Westminster to have her agreement ratified by the British Parliament. EU diplomats are confident any possible deal can be fast tracked through the European Parliament within a matter of weeks but are uncertain of their British counterparts being able to do the same because of age-old procedures. One senior source said a deal could even be delayed until 2019 if it helps the Prime Minister guarantee a smoother route through the House of Commons on its way to a British ratification. They believe putting a “time pressure” on those willing to vote down the deal will deter them if they believe Mrs May won’t have sufficient time to renegotiate with Brussels leaving Britain on the verge of a no-deal scenario. Another diplomat was sceptical a deal could eventually be completed but shared the same fears of potential problems in the House of Commons. They said: “I’m not sure we can do it next year, I think the biggest problem is in the British Parliament in getting all of the legislation through. “Of course, we have bureaucracy in the European Parliament but at least we can fast track the withdrawal agreement through.” Michael Gordon, professor of constitutional law at the University of Liverpool, believes Mrs May would face a number of possible outcomes if MPs were to reject the agreement she returns to the Commons with. The Prime Minister could face a no confidence vote, which would trigger a general election if an alternative government cannot be formed within 14 days. EU diplomats believe the biggest chance of a no-deal Brexit would be brought along by Mrs May being ousted from Downing Street. When the Prime Minister released her controversial Chequers proposal, European capitals recommended high profile figures not to torpedo the plans in order to preserve Mrs May’s position. According to Mr Gordon, another possible outcome for Mrs May’s deal being voted down by MPs would be a second referendum, while another vote would infuriate Brexiteers it is unlikely possible to create the required legislation in time for March 2019. The third option would see Britain attempting to extend the two-year Article 50 process. The request would require the unanimous backing of the EU27 but a number of sources have revealed the move be sorely looked at ahead of the upcoming European elections. One EU source told Express.co.uk extending Article 50 would provide a boost for populists at the ballot box. They believe anti-Brussels candidates would be able to argue EU bosses have stopped Britain from leaving despite the public voting to quit the bloc. Despite the concerns about British parliamentary procedure, EU officials are confident a Brexit deal is “very close” to being signed between Brussels and Westminster. After a “Coreper” meeting of EU ambassadors, one diplomat revealed to Express.co.uk “things are going in the right direction”. They added: “We are getting closer and closer to an agreement.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1011876,0.9630101568145124,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail
Steve,Cummings,1745,https://www.velonews.com/2018/10/news/new-chinese-team-ready-to-rock-cyclings-boat_479911,"VeloNews magazine will bring you inside the sport of bike racing, with exclusive features, analysis, expert training advice, unbiased gear reviews and the absolute best cycling photography. VeloNews caught up with Tim Kay, the CEO of a new China-based cycling project that's aiming to launch in 2020. FLORENCE, Italy (VN) — A new Chinese team, set for a 2020 debut in the WorldTour, wants to “rock the boat in cycling.” The new GCP team announced last week aims to bring in a different investment model for sponsors — which it also wants to share with its rival teams. “I’m here to rock the boat in cycling in a positive way,” team CEO Tim Kay told VeloNews. “I’m not just another business guy, but I’m here for cycling. I’m not trying to make it a different world, but make cycling a positive space, making it easier for the WorldTour teams to get big brand sponsorships, and become a viable opportunity for big brand sponsors to invest with long term strategy.” Once the team is up and running, Kay wants to allow rival teams and cyclists to invest as well so that they too can attract big-dollar sponsorships and make returns back to their teams and increase team revenues. “We will have investment models, we want to open them up in years to come to other WorldTour teams. I want to make cycling stronger,” he explained. “If I bring in big companies, then other big brands will follow. The cyclists can invest in our investments, something riders can get involved in to follow up on after their careers.” Kay’s team is aiming to debut in the WorldTour in 2020 as the first top-level Chinese team. It wants to produce the first Chinese Tour de France winner by 2025. Kay rode in England and grew up with cyclists like Steve Cummings. Through his work developing properties with Chinese clients, Kay began to believe the time is right to create a structured team and attract Eastern investors. “I saw a lot of WorldTour teams suffering last year with sponsorship. I couldn’t get my head around why so many successful cycling teams in big countries like us couldn’t find big brand sponsors. There are big companies out there looking to invest large amounts in sport right now,” continued Kay. “I dived in to how UCI operated, and how teams are run, their business models. Team Sky is run like a cooperate business, they are doing things right, but many are run a lot more loosely without structure, foundations and business strategy. I started thinking about how I could bring in a WorldTour team and create a business model with return on investment, strategy and creating a sustainable business giving longevity . I am familiar with China and how they like to invest.” Over the last year, Kay has been developing this team starting with meetings with the UCI governing body and bringing in Brian Smith as team manager and sports lawyers. He also made a deal with Shane Sutton, the former British and Sky coach, who now directs the Chinese track team. “We also want longevity, the team will be one small cog and part of a much bigger venture globally. We have a big project behind this, long-term investments, low-risk and high-rewards, we see them as investments and not sponsors,” Kay said. Along with a top-level cycling team, GCP will include a development team of all Chinese riders. They will be based in China, working with the national association, and will travel to the team’s base in Girona, Spain. Running parallel, they will support a fan base and create mass participation programs and track events around China. The project with be put together via investments. A fraction of that income will fund GCP, which could race under a generic team name — perhaps its adopted motto “Jingshen,” or Spirit. “Cycling doesn’t sit on a great business model right now, but it doesn’t mean it can’t be done,” Kay added. “The project and the money? Yes, it’s serious. You’ll know or have heard of the companies, we are speaking to massive brands, some private investors. We are in talks with big clients, the big guys in China.” VeloNews magazine will bring you inside the sport of bike racing, with exclusive features, analysis, expert training advice, unbiased gear reviews and the absolute best cycling photography.Subscribe © 2018 Pocket Outdoor Media, LLC.

Robert,Hoopes,1743,https://www.njherald.com/20181007/sussex-county-lost-oct-7-hudak-to-speak-on-the-ladies-of-trenton,"The Sussex County Historical Society is sponsoring a lecture about the history of the society known as the Ladies of Trenton. Catherine Hudak will present the lecture at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 14, at the society's Hill Memorial Museum, located at 82 Main St. in Newton. The Ladies of Trenton was organized as a society on July 4, 1780, for the express purpose of raising funds for the relief and encouragement of the men fighting with the Continental Army. This organization appointed ladies in each of the then 13 counties in New Jersey to collect and forward donations. The ladies selected for this work were among the most respected and influential in their communities. Hudak notes that there were four ladies chosen from Sussex County: Mrs. Thomas Anderson, of Newton; Mrs. Robert Ogden, of Hardyston; Mrs. Mark Thomson, of Hardwick; and Mrs. Robert Hoopes, of Oxford. Letitia Thornton Anderson, one of the four women in Sussex County who served as coordinators for the society in this area, was born in Newton in 1740. She married Thomas Anderson on July 16, 1772, and together they had five children, three of whom lived to adulthood: Margaretta, William Thornton and Thomas Oakley. Thomas Anderson was a counselor at law and served as an assistant quartermaster in the army during the Revolutionary War. Letitia Anderson died Aug. 30, 1784, and is buried with her husband in the Old Newton Burial Ground. James Snell, in his 1881 book, ""History of Sussex and Warren Counties, New Jersey"" noted ""that the men of the Revolution were not alone. The women of that day spoke the language of freedom and taught it to their sons, brothers, husbands and lovers."" In the July 12, 1780, New Jersey Gazette, the following noticeable paragraph is found, referring to July 4 of that year: ""The Ladies of Trenton, in New Jersey, emulating the noble example of their Patriotic Sisters of Pennsylvania, and being desirous of manifesting their zeal in the glorious cause of American Liberty, having this day assembled for the purpose of promoting a subscription for the relief and encouragement of those brave Men in the Continental Army who, stimulated by example, and regardless of danger, have so repeatedly suffered, fought and bled in the cause of virtue and their oppressed country: And taking into consideration the scattered situation of the well-disposed thro' the state, who would wish to contribute to so laudable an undertaking, have, for the convenience of such, and the more effectually to carry their scheme into execution, unanimously appointed Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Dickinson, Mrs. Furman and Miss Cadwallader, a Committee, whose duty it shall be immediately to open subscriptions and to correspond with the Ladies hereafter named, of the different counties throughout the state, requesting their aid and influence in the several districts; and in order the more expeditiously to carry their scheme into execution, the Ladies now met have taken the liberty to solicit the interest of the following Ladies, in promoting said subscriptions."" The establishment of this society of ladies demonstrated that there was a considerable level of activity by the women throughout New Jersey and other states to support the war effort being led by George Washington and his troops. Catherine Hudak is an educator at Morris Hills High School in Rockaway. In 2001, she earned an undergraduate degree in special education from Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania. She completed her master's degree in history in 2007 from William Paterson University, where she discovered the Ladies of Trenton. Since then, she has been dedicated to furthering her research and sharing the powerful story of these women throughout the state to ensure their position in New Jersey and United States history. Funding for this lecture has been made available in part by the New Jersey Historical Commission through the County History Partnership Program, as administered by the Sussex County Arts and Heritage Council. Admission to the lecture is $5 for the public and free for members of the Sussex County Historical Society. ••• Sussex County Historian Wayne T.

Andrew,Davis,1741,http://www.bendbulletin.com/opinion/6573234-151/editorial-choose-davis-for-bend-council,"Of the three candidates to fill Nathan Boddie’s seat on the Bend City Council next year, Andrew Davis stands out as most likely to be an effective, thoughtful member of that body. Voters should choose him for the Position 5 seat. Davis, 34, faces Gena Goodman-Campbell, also 34, and Victor Johnson, 49. Goodman-Campbell, who ran unsuccessfully against Knute Buehler for the Legislature in 2016, grew up in Portland and has lived in Bend since 2006. She’s bright and articulate, but her views about the city’s problems and how to solve them seemed more suited to her hometown than to Bend. Victor Johnson, 49, moved to Bend in 2014. A musician and songwriter, he took a job with a local preschool but found his position eliminated in a change of leadership at the school. He’s concerned about livability in the city and believes a greater role for the arts could improve the situation. Davis is a Bend native, a graduate of Oregon State University-Cascades in business administration and has a master’s degree from Willamette University. He works as student campus life director at Central Oregon Community College and previously held a similar position at OSU-Cascades. Davis is all too aware of the economic boom-bust cycles the community goes through and would like to find ways to smooth them out. He knows, too, that one way to ease the housing crunch in town is to bring more land inside city limits quickly, a move that should also include additional commercial land, which, he says, is in short supply. He’s worried that a proposed solution to septic-to-sewer problems in southeast Bend will prove too expensive for some and believes the city should step in to see that residents get the help they need. Davis is a careful, middle-of-the-road candidate who has clearly done his homework and who seeks reasonable solutions to city problems. It’s a good attitude in a community that too often seems divided, and one that would help make the City Council more effective. He should be elected.

Sara,Burns,1740,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/fredericton-strong-benefit-concert-aims-to-bring-community-together-1.4124182,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement On Saturday night in Fredericton, a benefit concert will aim to pay tribute to first responders and bring the community closer together through the power of music. The ‘Fredericton Strong’ concert will honour those who lost their lives in the Fredericton shooting on August 10th. On Saturday, last minute preparations were in full swing to make sure the show is an unforgettable event. Organizers of the show say putting together the benefit concert has been a roller coaster of emotions. “Emotional, overwhelming, it’s come together so quickly that we haven’t had a lot of time to think about it. But when we have had those difficult conversation with the families, it’s been emotional,” explains concert organizer Matt Cleveland. The concert was put together by Bell Media and Newcap Radio to show support for Fredericton, which was shaken after an August shooting left four people dead, including two police officers. Const. Robb Costello, 45, and Const. Sara Burns, 43, of the Fredericton police were among the dead. Civilians Donald Robichaud, 42, and Bobbie Lee Wright, 32, were the other victims. Matthew Vincent Raymond was charged with four counts of first degree murder. In a recent interview with CTV Atlantic, Steven Burns, the widower of Constable Sara Burns, said the support he’s received since her death has been overwhelming. “People from all over the world have reached out to me, and it just makes you know how important she was, and it gives you that comfort,” said Steven Burns. Over 3000 tickets have been sold for Saturday’s sold-out concert. Some of the biggest names in Canadian music will hit the stage, including David Myles, Neon Dreams, The Trews and Classified. The musicians say they hope the show brings a sense of healing to those watching, and listening. “I think music is one of those rare things that, if you go to a baseball game you’re for one team or the other, but music, everybody is there for the same reason,” says musician Matt Anderson. The proceeds of the Fredericton Strong Benefit Concert will go to the Canadian Red Cross, the Chalmers Foundation, and the Canadian Mental Health Association of New Brunswick. “The whole essence of this show is to celebrate the strength of our community. And we feel that music heals. It can’t fix everything, but it can serve as an escape,” says Cleveland. “Music for the most part is pretty selfish. We get to play and have fun for ourselves, but tonight, it’s not about us at all, it’s about the people in the room,” adds Anderson. The concert is being held at the Aitken Centre, the same location as the regimental funeral that was held for the fallen officers. The facility is being provided free-of-charge. “For us we’re just proud to be, as it was with the funeral, we’re just proud to be part of it,” says Dave Saad. “To give our building up for an opportunity for this to happen,” The concert is expected to last five hours, and see 11 different artists performing their own individual sets. With files from CTV Atlantic’s Kate Walker. On Saturday, last minute preparations were in full swing at the Aitken Centre to make sure the 'Fredericton Strong' concert was an unforgettable event. ""We get to play and have fun for ourselves, but tonight, it’s not about us at all, it’s about the people in the room,” says musician Matt Anderson.

Sara,Burns,1740,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-strong-concert-1.4853833,"It was an evening of celebration in Fredericton after what's been a tough two months for the city. About 3,000 people gathered in the Aitken Centre for the Fredericton Strong concert, which featured top acts from across the East Coast and beyond. ""People have had a sombre summer,"" said Fredericton-born musician David Myles, who was the master of ceremonies for the event. ""It was important to do an event that was about celebration, and about celebrating the city, and celebrating all parts of the city that have helped make the city what it is."" And celebrate they did. East Coast acts such as Ria Mae, Tristan Horncastle, Matt Andersen, Neon Dreams, Matt Mays and Classified put on a show for the crowd. The acts had people dancing, singing and cheering for most of the evening. Myles said the benefit concert quickly came together after the shooting on Aug. 10 that killed two civilians and two Fredericton police officers. Donald Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were killed in the shooting that day along with Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns of the Fredericton police force. ""It felt like me and a bunch of other musicians including Matt Andersen were looking for something, some way to help our hometown,"" said Myles. Organizer Matt Cleveland said the event raised over $80,000, which will be split between the Chalmers Hospital Foundation, the Canadian Red Cross and the New Brunswick Chapter of the Canadian Mental Health Association. Midway through the evening, Andersen had people belting out lyrics as he performed a fitting rendition of With a Little Help From My Friends. Just before Andersen took the stage, Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien addressed the crowd. He asked everyone in attendance to stand, hold someone's hand and remember the lives lost on Aug. 10. O'Brien said that day had been the darkest day in the city's history, but it wasn't the end of the story. ""On that dark day I told the nation that that morning was perhaps the worst we've seen in Fredericton, but over the next few days and weeks you'll see the best of Fredericton, and that's what we're doing here everybody,"" said O'Brien. O'Brien said the evening was a ""part of the healing process but also just another way to celebrate the wonderful city we live in."" But besides that moment, the crowd was able to celebrate the city of Fredericton. ""This is why music is so important. It can really provide us with these opportunities to come together,"" said Myles. Philip Drost Philip Drost is a reporter with CBC New Brunswick. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Slight chance of a rain shower. High 61F. Winds light and variable.. Cloudy skies. Low 48F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 12:35 pm “Singing in the Rain” has delighted audiences since its first appearance as a movie in 1952 followed closely by the stage version, and I find it impossible to imagine a livelier, better done, more colorful production than the one currently hoofing it on the Barter main stage. Nor can I imagine any troupe anywhere that could even come close to Barter’s resident company, to its directors and coaches or to the all of the backstage folks who do everything from design and build sets, imagine and construct costumes and wigs and even those who sweep up, launder costumes, and all the other minute’ but vitally important tasks. And that’s not even mentioning the musicians, volunteer ushers and manners-of-the-fudge display. Sean Maximo Campos positively dazzles as Don Lockwood (Fred Astaire’s old part), and Kim Morgan Dean as Kathy Seldon is enthrallingly beautiful with voice and talent to match. Another standout includes Andrew Hampton Livingston as Cosmo Brown, who, along with Campos, does some tapping that one would swear spits in the face of gravity. Almost everybody’s favorites are in this show, including Sarah Laughland, Paris Bradstreet and our old pal Zacchaeus Kimbrell, among others. Of special note should be Hannah Ingram as Lina Lamont, a star of silent film whose singing ability and voice makes fingernails on a blackboard positively melodic. How Hannah, whose own voice is heavenly, can maintain this screechy persona throughout the entire play amazes. Only an actress who is so good could be so bad! Unlike so many musicals, “Singing in the Rain” has a very nice plot to augment all the dancing and singing. “The Jazz Singer” has just been released as a “talkie” and R.F. Simpson, the head of Monumental Pictures (Rick McVey) knows he must follow suit or see his studio flushed down the spout. Problem is his top-billed female star, Lina, despite her screechy pipes, insists on continuing her career into the talkies and she has the contract to prove it. Thanks to Cosmo, however, everything eventually works out, although Lina ends up out of both job and boyfriend as Don and Kathy make the romantic sparks fly. Good thing it’s raining! Even if you’ve never seen the movie or play, you will certainly recognize several of the songs. These include: “All I Do,” “You Stepped Out of a Dream,” “Broadway Melody,” “Beautiful Girl” and, of course “Singing in the Rain.” The actors! The costumes! The music! There’s nothing to not love about this show. If seeing a magnificent better-than-Broadway show is on your bucket list, then bring it to Barter.

In 2019 starting with a new #1 issue, the team of teen superheroes will gain new members and face even bigger threats. Writer Jim Zub made the announcement at Marvel’s Next Big Thing Panel at New York Comic Con. Joining Zub will be artist Steve Cummings, who helped co-create the Image Comics title Wayward with the writer. ”We’ve got surprises you’ve never seen coming,” Zub promised. The first issue’s cover by Kim Jacinto was displayed, showing the full team and new tag line: “Because The World Still Needs Heroes.” RELATED: Marvel Reveal’s War of the Realms Logo and Creative Team The Champions first came together in the aftermath of 2016’s Civil War II, frustrated with the constant infighting in the superhero community. Right now, the current lineup is Ms. Marvel, Miles Morales Spider-Man, Viv Vision, Unstoppable Wasp Nadia Pym, Ironheart, and Brawn. Joining the team in the relaunch will be Patriot and Red Locust, who were previously part of the team’s membership drive, and Power Man, last seen on the New Avengers when it had control of A.I.M.

East Devon may not be renowned for attracting national attention but since 2010, it has seen elite athletes race along its streets as cycling’s Tour of Britain has been staged across the area. In its latest edition, Tour de France winner for 2018 Geraint Thomas, and four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome were among the 120 riders taking part in this year’s event. Previous winners of the Tour have included Britain’s Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2013 and Steve Cummings in 2016, as well as many others from other nations. With more than 100 riders competing in the event, it is a chance for the active and those less so to see top athletes racing along their streets – and spectators turn out in their thousands along the route. Over the years, more than one million people have taken to Devon’s roads and lanes to see the race leaders and following pack of riders, or peloton, ride through. The tour has criss-crossed the county, with Honiton often seeing the cyclists racing in High Street and it has twice started in Sidmouth and, this year, the competitors set off from Cranbrook. The event is widely seen as a benefit to the area, with visitors spending thousands of pounds in the area’s businesses. In 2016, the economic report for that year’s event revealed that visitors spent £909,102 in East Devon, with nearly more than £447,000 being spent in Sidmouth, where that year’s stage started. The spectacle was also well received on television, with 425,000 people watching the Devon Stage live on TV and an additional 117,000 viewers watching the ITV4 repeat show of the Devon Stage, the highest repeat show viewing figures of all the eight stages, that year. The report also showed that people had been inspired to get out on their bikes as a result of seeing the some of the sport’s top performers taking part. Speaking after the report was published, Councillor Stuart Hughes, Devon County Council’s cabinet member for highways with responsibility for cycling, said: “The impressive turnout and that more people watched the Devon highlights programme than that of any other stage, again demonstrates how well regarded The Tour is in Devon. “The Tour is now a well established event on the sporting calendar, and I’d like to think that Devon has played a role in helping to achieve that over the years. “It’s great to see that this report has found that so many people enjoyed the race and have been inspired to cycle more often. “That’s part of the legacy that we’ve always aimed for, and along with the worldwide TV coverage, it all helps to ensure Devon maintains its reputation as a cycling county. “The event generated millions of pounds of extra spending by visitors, benefiting businesses including bed and breakfasts, cycling shops, pubs and eateries across the county, effectively extending the holiday season in Devon into September. Bringing the event to the county is a co-ordinated effort, with various authorities getting involved Councillor Iain Chubb, who was East Devon District Council’s portfolio holder for the environment in 2016, also reacted to that year’s report. Speaking at the time, he said: “We know that thousands of people came to watch the spectacular start of the race in Sidmouth and they lined the streets and roads as the race came through the district. The Tour is the UK’s biggest professional cycle event featuring world class athletes and it was great that it happened on our very own doorstep. “East Devon certainly benefited from all the visitors who came to watch on the day and I’m convinced that the television coverage which showcased our glorious countryside – including our World Heritage Jurassic Coastline - will attract more visitors in the years to come who are keen to see it for themselves.” So as the memory of the 2018 Devon stage starts to fade, we have yet to see what benefits the Tour of Britain has brought to the area, but it was clear that it certainly attracted the crowds.

Ward made two field goals in the game for the Panthers. Porterville falls 50-16 to Tulare Western Things started off well for Porterville High School’s football team against Tulare Western in Friday’s East Yosemite League game at Jacob Rankin Stadium but they quickly went downhill resulting in a 50-26 loss to the undefeated Mustangs (7-0, 2-0 EYL). It was the first loss of the season for the previously undefeated Central Section Division IV Panthers (6-1, 1-1 EYL), as well as their first loss to a Div. II team bringing their record against Div. II teams to 3-1. Porterville scored on both of the opening drives of the first and second quarters, with sophomore quarterback Hector Nava Jr. connecting with senior wide receiver Hunter Alcantar for a 42- and 27-yard touchdown, respectively. But after giving up a total of four touchdowns to Tulare Western — three of them to the Valley’s No. 1 rusher Tairyn Johnson — Porterville went into halftime down 28-17. Junior kicker Nick Ward knocked down a 37-yard field goal just before the end of the half. There was a life out of the Panthers to start the second half with an on-side kick from Ward scooped up by senior Adelaido Duran on the Mustangs’ 36-yard line on the opening kickoff. But after getting the ball into the red zone, Porterville had to settle for a 32-yard field goal. After the game PHS head coach Michael Machado told the team “can’t kick field goals, got to score touchdowns.” On the following drive, Tulare Western’s Andrew Davis scored a 6-yard rushing touchdown, but Porterville answered with a scoring drive of their own that saw a little trickery from the Panthers. On fourth-and-goal from the 6-yard line, Nava Jr. handed the ball off to freshman running back Isaiah Ellis who tossed the ball to senior running back Demario Ennis who then hit a wide-open Nava Jr. for a touchdown. But after getting a penalty on the PAT, the Panthers were only able to come away with six points. Down 35-26 with 3 minutes, 29 seconds and a whole quarter to still be played, Porterville wasn’t yet out of the game. The Panthers again went for the on-side kick but the Mustangs were ready for it. On the ensuing drive, Johnson scored a 14-yard rushing touchdown and Tulare Western put their stamp on the score with a 2-point conversion. Johnson scored one last time on an 11-yard run in the final three minutes of the game. Prior to his final two scores, Johnson scored on 13-, 1- and 4-yard runs. Tulare Western’s Rolondo Holmes also had a 41-yard reception from quarterback Elijah Burrell for a touchdown in the first quarter. Mustangs’ kicker Carlos Hernandez was 6-of-6 on extra points. The Mustangs also intercepted Nava Jr. twice. “I told them just now it’s maturity,” Machado said. “We start probably 14 or 15 underclassmen. And they’re still learning how to win, they’re still learning how to play at a championship level, and so they just seen a championship level team and those are the type of things we’re talking about. You need to see those things before you can overcome them. Those are just building blocks in a program and they need to learn that they need to prep themselves a little bit.” Next week things don’t get any easier for Porterville when they take on Div. II Tulare Union (7-0, 2-0 EYL) at Bob Mathias Stadium in Tulare on Thursday, Oct. 11. While the Panthers faced one of the best rushers in the Valley against the Mustangs, they’ll take on one of the best passers in the Valley when they matchup with the Tribe’s Nathan Lamb. “It’s the complete opposite,” Machado said. “Tulare Union’s going to throw it all over the field and so we get both. We get two championship caliber team’s back-to-back and they do two completely different things, they’re 180. We’ll get challenged in a different way next Thursday night, and we just got to be mature and learn from this and clean up the mistakes. “You know we left some points out on the board, I don’t know if it was enough tonight but it would’ve been a situation that we had a shot to win at the end,” Machado added. “And that’s really what you want to do when you’re playing a championship team, is just a shot to win it at the end.” Sorry, there are no recent results for popular videos.

Joel,Cutler,1735,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20181005/hilliard-davidson-17-upper-arlington-7,"Christian Sweet has seen time all over the field for the Hilliard Davidson High School football team, starting as a cornerback his sophomore year before working his way into a starting role in the backfield. During a recent practice, he even played strong safety when another player had his helmet knocked off and had to briefly sit out. Special teams have remained a constant for the senior, however, and that is where he made arguably his biggest impact Oct. 5 against Upper Arlington. After scoring on a 20-yard run in the final minute of the first quarter, Sweet returned a punt 51 yards for a touchdown 23 seconds into the second quarter for what turned out to be the game-winning score as the host Wildcats again knocked off the Golden Bears 17-7 in OCC-Central Division play. “Their punter (Ben Krimm) is by far the best punter we’ve gone up against. I just got behind their coverage, I made the first guy miss and took advantage of some good blocks,” Sweet said. “I just like to get my opportunity to make a big play. My teammates did all the work and I was able to find the end zone.” Davidson, which attempted only one pass, improved to 6-1 overall and 2-0 in the league and won its 12th consecutive game in the rivalry dating to 2008. The Wildcats lead the all-time series 20-5. UA, which fell to 3-4 overall and 1-1 in the OCC-Central, has been held to a touchdown or less in all but one of those games. “Christian is such a big playmaker for us, a jack of all trades. He could play anywhere in our secondary right now, but he does so much offensively and that takes a lot out of him,” Davidson coach Brian White said. “Nobody wants to be in the senior class that has this streak end. It’s something they are proud of.” The Bears did not score until the final 90 seconds. After a fumble recovery, Josh Rushin caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from Jacob Leve. “Our defense played lights out; it was outstanding. They defended a good, complex team and did a lot of great things,” UA coach Joel Cutler said. “We just have to get healthy and take care of us.” dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave ========== HD—Sweet 20 run (Carrier kick) HD—Sweet 51 punt return (Carrier kick) HD—Carrier 44 FG UA—Rushin 32 pass from Leve (Raish kick) © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Phillip,Frost,1732,https://www.analystratings.com/articles/barrington-sticks-to-their-buy-rating-for-opko-health-opk/,"Barrington analyst Michael Petusky maintained a Buy rating on Opko Health (NASDAQ: OPK) today and set a price target of $7. The company’s shares opened today at $3.49. Petusky said: “We know that management received several questions regarding the recent news that the SEC has launched an investigation into the trading of certain low‐priced securities, and that CEO and Chairman Dr. Phil Frost and OPKO were among the investors whose activities are now under SEC review. The general thrust of the investigation seems to involve allegations of “pump and dump” stock trading. We simply do not have enough information to make any kind of high conviction call on the ultimate outcome of this investigation, but we can say that both Dr. Frost and OPKO have a long history of making investments in smaller companies. In the case of OPKO (and to the best of our knowledge), not a dollar of investment that the company has made in any of the trading activity being examined by the SEC has ever been monetized. Regarding Dr.” According to TipRanks.com, Petusky is a 4-star analyst with an average return of 14.2% and a 59.2% success rate. Petusky covers the Healthcare sector, focusing on stocks such as Anika Therapeutics Inc, Varian Medical Systems, and DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

Garrard, 79, also expressed regret for his largesse. Yet in the past few weeks he has given deputy leader Tom Watson's office £15,000. My Westminster source explains: 'There's no better way to irritate Jeremy Corbyn than by giving money to Watson.' Santander's incoming boss, suave Italiano Andrea Orcel, has been described as a determined alpha male who likes to get what he wants. Although the ex-UBS banker, 55, will hold the title of chief executive, overall in charge at the bank remains its redoubtable executive chairman Ana Botin, 58, whose family control Santander. Wonder how that's going to play out? An erstwhile colleague mischievously smirks: 'Pass the popcorn'. Competitors in this weekend's Alfred Dunhill Golf Championship at St Andrews include ex-Barclays boss Bob Diamond, Richemont chairman Johann Rupert and Aberdeen Standard chief Martin Gilbert. Accomplished players all, who should more than hold their own in tackling the world's most famous golf course. Unlike my colleague Piers Morgan, who judging by some of his practice shots yesterday looks likely to be keeping the greenkeepers busy. Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH's billionaire patriarch Bernard Arnault has appointed his cherubic son Frederic, 23, as digital director of watchmaker Tag Heuer. Father-of-five Monsieur Arnault's youngest son Jean, 19, now remains the only member of his offspring yet to enter the family business. Perhaps Bernard, 69, should send him to Celine to keep an eye on the fashion label's waifish creative chief, Hedi Slimane. His debut collection was universally panned this week. Fulham Football club's fabulously moustachioed owner Shahid Khan's has a floating gin palace Kismet, which was comfortably the biggest vessel on display at the recent Monaco Yacht Show. The 312-ft monster has eight bedrooms, a 28-man crew and is available for charter at £1million a week. Is anyone daft enough to pay that much?

Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 12:40 pm McDowell senior Cedric Biddle shouts encouragement to his teammates during last Friday's loss to St. Stephens. The Titans are on the road at South Caldwell tonight (7:30). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell senior Cedric Biddle shouts encouragement to his teammates during last Friday's loss to St. Stephens. The Titans are on the road at South Caldwell tonight (7:30). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. No matter what their respective seasons have been like to this point, the McDowell Titans and South Caldwell Spartans will end up playing an important game every season the current Northwestern 3A/4A Conference lineup stays in place. The league’s only two 4A squads will meet tonight in Hudson (7:30 kickoff), with the winner earning the tiebreaker for State 4A Playoff purposes. Because of that, both the Titans (0-2 NWC, 2-4 overall) and Spartans (1-1, 2-4) have plenty of reasons to play hard. “We’ve got a lot of things going for us if we can pull this off,” said McDowell head coach Andy Morgan, whose club is coming off a disappointing 40-36 loss to St. Stephens last Friday on homecoming. Last season, South Caldwell surprised the Titans 46-27 at Titan Stadium. It ended up being the Spartans’ only conference victory and it landed them a first-round bye along with a home game in the second round of the playoffs. This season, teams in split conferences must finish at least .500 overall or in the top three of the league standings in order to be seeded as a No. 1. Both those accomplishments would be tall orders – although certainly not impossible – for both McDowell and South, but that doesn’t diminish the importance of tonight’s game. For the Titans, tonight also offers a chance to put last week’s loss behind them. McDowell had plenty of chances to beat St. Stephens, but gave up some big plays and made some huge mistakes. The most damaging error was a roughing-the-punter call on a fourth and long with the Titans leading by a point in the fourth quarter. “We shot ourselves in the foot some,” said Morgan. “Those two 80-yard runs (by Saint tailback Xavian King) we were lined up in the wrong spot. We continually made mistakes. I don’t want to say we beat ourselves, because Saint Stephens is not a bad team. But if we had lined up in the right spot, some of those things don’t happen.” Morgan said the Titans have done a good job putting last week in the rearview. “The overall mood is good and we had a good film session Monday,” said the third-year head coach. “They seem like they’re ready to go.” That’s a good thing. The Spartans are typically one of the bigger and more physical teams the Titans face, and McDowell has struggled at times this season against those kinds of clubs. The Spartans are coming off a 62-13 win over West Caldwell last Friday. Like the Titans, South has been pretty good offensively, but has struggled to stop people. The Spartans have scored 44 or more points three times, but have surrendered 42 or more four times. Junior running back Spencer Piercy (5-11, 172) has rushed for 575 yards and nine touchdowns on just 40 carries, an average of 14.4 yards per attempt. Sophomore Isaiah Kirby (6-0, 180) has run for 354 yards and a pair of scores on 56 carries out of South Caldwell’s well-disciplined wing-T. The Spartans have worked with two quarterbacks this season, but seem to have settled on sophomore Avery Raynor (5-11, 180), who went 7-of-9 for 114 yards and two scores last week. “They’re big and physical, and that’s what they make their living on,” said Morgan. “They’re big up front. They have a 260-pound tight end and a 250-pound H-back. They throw a lot of formations at you and you have to work on them all. “Defensively, they’ve played a 4-4, a 3-4 and a 3-4 stack, so you have to game plan for all three defenses. But it seems like the kids are picking it up pretty well.” The Titans counter with the likes of senior running back J.C. Olivo (91 rushes, 469 yards, 4TDs), who is coming off a career-high 144 yards against St. Stephens; and quarterback Adam Randolph, who threw for 155 and two scores and ran for 100 more yards and another TD last week. Randolph (73-of 111, 1,018 yards, 10 TDs, 7 INTs) became the 13th Titan quarterback in history to throw for 1,000 yards in a season. It’s the seventh straight year a McDowell signal caller has accomplished the feat. Defensively, senior lineman Bryce Allison is coming off a huge game last week. Allison made eight tackles, four of them for losses, and recorded three quarterback sacks in a losing effort. The Titans own a 16-9 edge in the all-time series between the two, but South Caldwell has won the last four. Northwestern 3A/4A Conference football 2018 Conf.

Andrew,Davis,1728,https://sportscar365.com/imsa/ctscc/camaro-gt4-gets-bop-break/,"Camaro GT4.R given weight, power adjustments ahead of CTSC finale… by Photo: Jake Galstad/IMSA The Chevrolet Camaro GT4.R has been given a weight and power break ahead of next weekend’s Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge season finale at Road Atlanta. The Pratt & Miller-built car, which returned to series competition at Virginia International Raceway two races ago at Virginia International Raceway with Rebel Rock Racing, has received a 35 kg reduction in minimum weight and 2 mm larger air restrictor. Additionally, the car will have a 4-liter increase in fuel capacity and 2 mm larger refueling restrictor. Robin Lidell and Andrew Davis have driven the Camaro GT4 to third and 12th place finishes in its two races this season. It is one of several GT4 cars to have received Balance of Performance adjustments for the final round. The BMW M4 GT4 has been given a weight and fuel capacity increase, with the Mercedes-AMG GT4 receiving a 2-liter fuel capacity reduction and smaller refueling restrictor. A weight adjustment has also been given to the McLarne 570S GT4, when at a declared altitude track. No BoP changes have been handed out to the TCR or ST categories.

This year, a record 204 billionaires weren’t wealthy enough to crack the exclusive Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans. The cutoff to the make the list was higher than ever: $2.1 billion, up $100 million from last year. The list of those not quite rich enough includes people who have appeared on The Forbes 400 in years past, like private-equity giants Bruce Karsh and Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital (now worth $2 billion each); Under Armour founder Kevin Plank ($1.9 billion) and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman ($1.8 billion), who Forbes recently learned has given away $1.5 billion. Others who fell short were new billionaires from a variety of industries, many of whom have the potential to rise in the ranks and make the cut in the coming years. GitHub’s cofounder Chris Wanstrath, worth $1.4 billion, sold out in exchange for the lucrative currency of Microsoft shares. In June, Microsoft announced it would purchase the software-development platform for $7.5 billion in stock, and Wanstrath, GitHub’s largest shareholder, received an estimated $1.4 billion. As part of the deal he stepped down as CEO of the company that he founded in 2008 to become a fellow at Microsoft. Even closer to the $2.1 billion minimum is Tim Sweeney, the founder of blockbuster video game Fortnite Battle Royale, who’s worth an estimated $1.8 billion. The game has attracted at least 125 million players and over $1 billion in estimated in-game sales (the game is free to play, but players can buy various extras and add-ons). Forbes calculates that Sweeney owns roughly 16% of Epic Games, the game developer he founded in 1991 while studying mechanical engineering at the University of Maryland. Jim Kavanaugh, a former pro soccer player who played on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, went on to cofound IT provider World Wide Technology six years later at age 27. Back then, he found himself driving 500 PCs to Omaha just to fill an order. The grit paid off: He’s now worth $2 billion, based on his 38% stake in the $10.4 billion (sales) company. It’s not only the tech sector that produced billion-dollar Americans this year. Anastasia Soare, who emigrated from Romania in 1989, expanded her L.A. eyebrow salon—clients include Kim Kardashian and Cindy Crawford—into an international makeup phenomenon and a $1 billion fortune. Her Anastasia Beverly Hills brand is sold in more than 1,500 stores and had sales of $200 million last year. With nearly 18 million Instagram followers and a number of celebrities touting her products, Soare, 60, has built a low-cost marketing machine. Jimmy John Liautaud, worth $1.7 billion, made his fortune thanks to his eponymous sandwich chain, which he founded in 1983 at age 19. Although he sold a minority stake to private-equity investor Weston Presidio over a decade ago and Roark Capital bought a majority stake in 2017, Liautaud still owns an estimated 35% of the company and serves as its chairman. A poor student who graduated near the bottom of his high school class, he started the business using a $25,000 loan from his father, an Army veteran. Jimmy John’s now has nearly 3,000 locations. Former NBA star Michael Jordan may have stepped off the court, but he is still in the game of making money. Worth $1.7 billion, Jordan's playing salary during career totaled $90 million, but he has earned another $1.4 billion (pretax) from corporate partners including Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck. In 2010 he used some of those earnings to purchase a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets. The team is now worth $1.05 billion, and he owns 90%.

Simon,Stertzer,1726,https://www.dicardiology.com/article/how-biotechnology-impacting-treatment-and-prevention-heart-disease,"Interview with interventional cardiology pioneer Simon Stertzer, M.D. Simon Stertzer, M.D., is one of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s and 1980s. He performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States in 1978. One of the key, early pioneers who helped bring coronary angioplasty to the United States in the late 1970s was Simon Stertzer, M.D. In this article he shares his views on the current direction and next steps in cardiovascular biomedical technology. On March 1, 1978, Stertzer in New York, and Richard Myler, M.D., in San Francisco, each performed the first two coronary angioplasty balloon procedures in the United States.[1] This was just six months after the world's first angioplasty was performed by Andreas Gruntzig in Zurich, Switzerland. Gruntzig presented his first angioplasty cases at the American Heart Association (AHA) in Novemeber 1977, and found some enthusiasm among early American supporters for this new, non-surgical intervention. Stertzer pushed the limit of the early dilation balloons in his first case, treating a complex lesion in an older patient, which even Gruntzig shyed away from. His first cases, along with Gruntzig's and Myler's, were combined into the first-ever interventional cardiology multi-center study, which they presented at AHA in 1980. Stertzer was also involved in the first live case courses to teach early adopter cardiologists how to perform angioplasty procedures. Stertzer was director of the catheterization laboratory at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York from 1971 to 1983. He served as the director of medical research and director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at the San Francisco Heart Institute in Daly City, Calif., from 1983 to 1993, working with the institute’s director, the late Myler. In 1993, Stertzer was recruited to Stanford University’s School of Medicine, as professor of medicine. In 1984, Stertzer was a founder of the interventional device company Arterial Vascular Engineering (AVE). It was purchased in 1998 by Medtronic to form its interventional division. He was also involved with Quanam Medical Corp., founded in 1994, which developed polymer-coated stents used for drug delivery in coronary angioplasty. That company was acquired by Boston Scientific in 2001. Today, Stertzer is professor emeritus at Stanford University School of Medicine and is a co-founder of BioCardia, which was created in 1999. He serves as chairman of the board. The clinical-stage regenerative biotechnology company is developing technology for the direct injection of stem cells and agents into the heart muscle, as well as personalized screenings to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from intramyocardial injection of therapeutic agents. Its main focus is in treatments of heart failure. Question: Just how big of a problem is heart disease in the U.S.? Answer: According to American Heart Association statistics, cardiovascular disease, including stroke, is listed as the underlying cause of death in about 836,546 deaths in the United States. This breaks down to about 2,300 Americans dying of cardiovascular disease each day, an average of one death every 38 seconds. Currently, about 92.1 million American adults are living with some form of cardiovascular disease or the after-effects of stroke.[2] Question: Based on your career treating patients with cardiovascular disease, what are the biggest risk factors that contribute to the development of heart disease? Answer: The biggest risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of physical activity, obesity, poor diet, and critically, genetic and family history. Question: The latest statistics show that heart failure is on the rise due to advances in healthcare innovation and people surviving prior heart attacks. How can both lifestyle changes and advanced new treatments prevent future heart failure in heart attack survivors?Answer: Meticulous attention to blood pressure, diet, physical activity, and blood lipid treatments can all delay or decrease the numbers of increasing heart failure in post-heart attack victims. Cell therapy may also hold promise for decreasing or ameliorating heart failure in this population. Question: You performed the first coronary balloon angioplasty in the United States. What have been some of the most successful innovations used to treat heart disease? Answer: After the initial introduction of coronary angioplasty into Europe and the U.S., in 1978, we have seen an explosion of subsequent technology such as: stents (including drug-eluting stents), improvements in pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, percutaneous valve replacements without open chest surgery, and now, the beginning of stem cell introduction directly into the heart muscle to affect the course and symptoms of heart failure. Question: There have been numerous examples of healthcare innovations enabling people to better monitor their health. A great example is the new Fitbit Charge 3 that tracks sleep apnea, which has been linked to heart disease. What are your thoughts on these types of devices as a means of tracking overall health and protecting against heart disease?Answer: The diagnosis of sleep apnea, a significant risk factor for heart disease and arrhythmia (like atrial fibrillation), has traditionally been by sleeping partner observation or by spending a night in a specialized hospital setting requiring an overnight stay. This is a costly and highly disruptive process to diagnose sleep apnea. Thus, to the extent that we can obviate an overnight stay and still make accurate diagnoses of sleep apnea, these out-of-hospital aids could be excellent. Question: When you look ahead to the future of medicine, where do you see the most innovation taking place? Answer: When it comes to the future of medicine, we will continue to see a combination of both devices and biopharmaceuticals paving the way for the improvements in disease treatment. Finding the keys to cellular metastatic behavior (the spread of cancer) will drastically change the outlook for cancer sufferers, and hopefully eradicate early death rates. Devices will continue to aid orthopedic and neurological conditions, while biochemistry and artificial intelligence will continue to alter the course of many other chronic and fatal diseases. Question: BioCardia is pioneering new advancements in the treatment of cardiovascular disease through the use of stem cells. How is BioCardia changing the way heart failure is treated? Answer: Up until the present era, common varieties of heart failure have been treated with a variety of medications, exercise and activity restrictions, salt restriction, diuretics and various hormonal therapies designed to improve cardiac function. Although these therapies relieve many of the symptoms of heart failure, they do not fundamentally improve the heart muscle itself. BioCardia is in a pivotal trial administering certain types of blood cells directly into the heart muscle from the outside of the body, using a specialized catheter system invented at the company laboratories in San Carlos, Calif. These cells are the first generation of a future line of cells, gene products and other biologicals, the administration of which will change the course of heart failure and other diseases in the near future, in my opinion. The future of this therapy will improve cardiac function and may even regenerate heart muscle in the coming years. Not only do we expect cell therapy to eventually regenerate diseased tissue, but we already are seeing replacements of heart valves using catheter procedures from the outside of the body, as well as improved pacemakers and implantable devices (in selected patients) designed to decrease the incidence of sudden death. Question: Tell us more about the recent Phase III trial for BioCardia’s CardiAMP heart failure treatment. What is CardiAMP, and what do the results show?Answer: The investigational CardiAMP therapy uses the patient's own (autologous) bone marrow cells to potentially stimulate the body's natural healing response through a minimally-invasive, catheter-based procedure. The results are highly promising. In a recent Viewpoint paper, the authors acknowledge that although the varying properties and potency of bone marrow-derived stem cells across patients are recognized, little focus has been put on the regenerative capacity of the patients themselves in determining outcomes.[3] They point out that the pivotal CardiAMP-HF Trial is the first to incorporate a cell potency analysis and score in the screening criteria. BioCardia was highlighted as an example of personalized medicine, with promising results from the first 10 or so-called roll-in cases.

Bernard,Osher,1725,http://www.newsminer.com/features/our_town/at_the_library_column/keep-learning-no-matter-how-old-you-are/article_76be1d44-c6ea-11e8-b728-973ad47aed08.html,"Mainly cloudy. High 14F. Winds light and variable.. Partly cloudy skies. Low 1F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 8:44 am FAIRBANKS — The fall Guys Read program is in its 13th year, and “Leon: Protector of the Playground,” is one of the featured books. Leon Magnificent’s world has many watered-down super heroes and villains. Leon’s superpower, for instance, is common sense, though he gets to wear a cape. Gertrude Stein, who once commented that “everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense,” would have liked Leon. If you’re ripe enough, keeping the senses sharp is reason to join UAF’s Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Philanthropist Bernard Osher’s foundation supports university “programs targeted toward more mature students not necessarily well served by standard continuing education curricula,” according to OsherFoundation.org, because “the interest of many older adults, especially those who have retired, is learning for the joy of learning, without examinations or grades.” UAF’s one of 122 universities offering OLLI classes, but only elders 50 and older can participate. It’s inexpensive and stimulatingly fun. I’m a volunteer OLLI instructor. This fall’s class is about word histories, which is why recent columns have leaned that way. A lifelong interest in word origins has produced a personal library of relevant books, but I’m no expert. I’m boning up to have a fighting chance of not embarrassing myself, and that’s how I met Mrs. Byrne. Josefa Heifetz Byrne was a concert pianist and the daughter of “legendary violinist Jascha Heifetz,” who in 1958 married Robert Byrne, a civil engineer, leading expert on pool and billiards and author of important books on the latter subjects. In fact, Byrne coined an obscure term, “squirt” for a particular sort of misplayed shot wherein the cue ball “squirts” off to the side. He and Josefa divorced in 1976, two years after he edited and wrote the forward to “Mrs. Byrne’s Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words.” Claiming that “every entry in this book, even the most ludicrous, has been accepted as a formal or legitimate English word by at least one major dictionary,” Byrne added that his wife “managed to assemble the six thousand weirdest words in the English language. Nobody asked her to do it because nobody thought such a thing was possible. In fact I asked her not to do it. Completed, the book stands as one of the most peculiar feats of compulsive lexicography.” Examples include “quasihemidemisemiquaver” (a 128th note), “quadrigomist” (“someone with four husbands or four wives at the same time”), and “quop” (“to throb”). If there aren’t enough strange words already, now the Oxford English Dictionary has asked teens to tweet them their latest catchy slang expressions. “Inside the OED: Can the World’s Biggest Dictionary Survive the Internet?,” a NYTimes.com article by Andrew Dickson, is a fascinating look at the greatest English dictionary’s inner workings. It also provides a good thumbnail description of how “the mother of all English language dictionaries” evolved, and how it continues to thrive as internet hyper-connectivity and communication speeds is causing new words to sprout and spread exponentially. The Third Edition of the OED is underway, “a goliath project that involves overhauling every entry (many of which haven’t been touched since the late-Victorian era) and adding … missing words, as well as making the dictionary into a fully digital resource.” It’s a glacial process; 2000 was the original completion date, and presently they’re “about 48 percent” along. “Go,” for example, took about 12 months to fully update and revise, but then “the revised entry for ‘go’ traces 537 separate senses over 1,000 years.” “Well,” as Michael Proffitt, the current chief editor, put it, “we have to get things right.” “Bare” is one of the new crop of slang. It means “many or much; a lot of,” as in OED’s #YouthSlangAppeal: “We could do with some help. Bare help.” Then there’s “woke,” which the American Heritage Dictionary defines as “Aware of the injustice of the social system in which one lives.” Perhaps youngsters will someday woke to the plight of elders being overwhelmed with new terms. Until then, we oldsters should employ common sense and circumvallate (“surround with or as if with a rampart”) ourselves with venerable, crusty expressions of yore, and show them a thing or three.

Phillip,Frost,1724,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-lawyer-at-the-center-of-sec-pump-and-dump-case-1538675403,"This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies for distribution to your colleagues, clients or customers visit http://www.djreprints.com. https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-lawyer-at-the-center-of-sec-pump-and-dump-case-1538675403 In a stock fraud suit filed last month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, regulators allege that billionaire drug entrepreneur Phillip Frost and his company Opko Health participated in pump-and-dump schemes organized by investor Barry Honig. The complaint in Manhattan’s federal district court says that Honig and his associates bought stock in three small companies, controlled the firms’ managements, and planted promotional articles about them before unloading their shares. The schemers reaped more than $27 million, the SEC charges, before leaving public investors with virtually worthless stock. Unmentioned in the SEC’s case is how all three public companies in the alleged swindles used the same securities law firm and the same stock transfer agency. SEC filings over the past decade show that nearly two dozen public companies backed by Honig, or other defendants in last month’s SEC complaint, used securities lawyer Harvey Kesner, a 61-year old partner at the leading small-cap law firm Sichenzia Ross Ference, until he retired from the firm just before the SEC action. Those companies also happened to use Equity Stock Transfer, a New York outfit that SEC registrations show was financed and controlled by Kesner. A prominent Honig-backed firm that Kesner represented was Riot Blockchain (ticker: RIOT), whose shares rose tenfold in last year’s cryptocurrency surge, to $46, before falling back to a recent $3.40. Riot wasn’t named in the SEC’s case, but its chief executive, John O’Rourke, was. He has resigned and said he’ll fight the civil charges that he colluded in Honig’s alleged swindles. Following the SEC charges, Frost stepped down as chairman from the brokerage firm he controls, Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services (LTS). The 81-year-old Frost and Opko (OPK) deny the wrongdoings alleged in the SEC’s action. Honig has made no public statement. He did not respond to Barron’s requests for comment. One defendant, John H. Ford, quickly settled the SEC’s charges, without admitting or denying allegations that he took undisclosed payments to tout a couple of the stocks on the website SeekingAlpha.com. Securities lawyers and transfer agents are essential gatekeepers under federal regulations meant to protect the investing public. But one of the three companies featured in the SEC’s New York case, the tiny biotech firm MabVax Therapeutics Holdings (MBVX), says that Honig forced it to hire Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross firm as a condition of his financing, according to a little-noted malpractice case that MabVax filed in a San Diego state court after the SEC case became public. The MabVax suit contends that Kesner and his law firm advanced the interests of Honig at the expense of MabVax, deceiving the company and committing malpractice that led to its delisting from Nasdaq. Although MabVax had retained Kesner’s law firm “to keep the company safe,” says the biotech’s complaint, Kesner’s firm instead “put MabVax in harm’s way.” Neither Kesner nor Equity Stock Transfer responded to Barron’s requests for comment or in court filings. Kesner’s former firm strongly denies that it wronged its client MabVax. “There are very serious misstatements and misleading facts alleged in the complaint, as well as errors in law,” says Mark Anesh, a malpractice specialist from the firm Lewis Brisbois, who will represent Sichenzia Ross’ lawyers in the California case, but not Kesner. “The firm intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit, and in the end we fully expect that the claims contained therein will be found to be completely and utterly without merit.” Kesner was a rainmaker at many of the firms where he worked. Before Sichenzia Ross Ference Kesner—as the New York firm was known until Kesner’s August departure—he’d been with the Dallas firm Haynes and Boone until the firm terminated him in 2009. In a lawsuit that was quickly settled, Kesner demanded $15 million from the Dallas firm and alleged that its partners defamed him by telling others “Harvey is dirty” and “had relationships with clients that the firm did not wish to associate with.” A Haynes and Boone spokesman said, “Mr. Kesner left the firm in March of 2009. We resolved our disputes at that time and have had no further contact with him.” After arriving at Sichenzia Ross in 2009, Kesner helped build the firm into one of the busiest securities law practices in America’s small-cap stock market. The firm’s website has been intermittently offline lately while it scrubs mentions of Kesner, but it had featured many tombstone announcements of deals that SEC filings show were bankrolled by Honig, Frost, and their investing associates. Sichenzia Ross’ website said that it “consistently ranked at the top of national league table rankings for issuer, investor and placement-agent legal counsel.” In MabVax’s California complaint against the law firm, the biotech says that Honig and his associates forced MabVax to hire Kesner as part of a 2015 financing. The complaint says that Kesner later said that he worked on at least five deals a year for Honig’s investment group. MabVax said it had found 22 other companies backed by Honig’s group where “Sichenzia and Kesner have been inserted as counsel.” MabVax claims that the advice it got from Kesner was secretly designed to serve clients such as Honig. In 2015, MabVax alleges that Kesner tipped Honig off to a potential legal issue that weakened his control over the company. Honig repaired his position and then forced MabVax to issue $10 million worth of securities—for free—to Honig and his investment associates, who secretly included Kesner. The company also says that Kesner’s law firm inserted legal language in Honig’s deals so that the investors could deny that they were acting as a controlling group. But doubts about the legitimacy of Kesner’s techniques have since forced MabVax to disclaim four years worth of its previous SEC filings, alleges the company, and caused its Nasdaq delisting. Sichenzia Ross’ outside counsel in the MabVax case, Anesh, would not comment on any details alleged by MabVax. As for MabVax, it declined to comment through its outside attorney, Joel Fleming of Block & Leviton. A key player in the world of small-cap finance is a company’s stock transfer agent, which can allow the sale of unregistered shares and convert warrants or preferred shares into common stock. In the SEC action against Honig and his associates, the agency says the group used “false attorney opinion letters” to get a transfer agent to remove restrictions from Honig’s share certificates, so that Honig could sell the unregistered stock. The transfer agent for the public companies involved in the SEC case—and more than another dozen funded by Honig—was Equity Stock Transfer. Equity Stock Transfer’s initial SEC registration in 2011 says that it was funded by one of Kesner’s limited-liability companies and managed by Avital Even-Shoshan, a partner who just left Sichenzia Ross and one of the defendants in MabVax’s case. Other SEC filings said that the transfer agency’s “control persons” included Kesner, his wife Renee, and an employee of Kesner’s law firms, Mohit Bhansali. In its March 2018 registration with the SEC, the transfer agency said that it still owed money to Kesner and that its ownership was divided between Bhansali and an Atlanta management consultant named Michael Beeghley. Both Bhansali and Beeghley have served as directors of Honig-backed companies, including Riot Blockchain and PolarityTE (PTE), a Salt Lake City biotech startup whose $18 shares value the unprofitable company at about $400 million. “Stock transfer agents are the gatekeepers of securities,” says Bhansali in an online video interview linked on the transfer agency’s website. “Security for securities, that’s what we do!” Neither Equity Stock Transfer, Bhansali, nor Beeghley responded to Barron’s questions about the transfer agency. Riot Blockchain’s interim Chief Executive Chris Ensey says his company no longer uses Kesner as its securities lawyer or Equity Stock Transfer as its transfer agent. PolarityTE still uses the transfer agent, but stopped using Kesner and the Sichenzia Ross law firm in the spring of 2018. Unlike MabVax, PolarityTE’s managers say they were satisfied with Kesner’s legal advice. “We were never forced to use Mr. Kesner,” says PolarityTE Chief Operating Officer Edward Swanson.

Sara,Burns,1722,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-fredericton-police-make-staffing-changes-in-wake-of-fatal-shooting/,"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. Years of understaffing have created a crisis for the Fredericton Police Force in the wake of the August shooting rampage that left two officers dead, says the force’s union, with a high number of officers now off work at any given time. ""We were running short-staffed for so long that it was running into a critical situation,” said Sergeant Sean Clark, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 911, which represents the Fredericton Police Force. He said the number of vacancies is high and that no section has a full complement of staff. On Monday afternoon, Police Chief Leanne Fitch announced plans to bolster emergency-response capacity and hire 16 additional officers to help cover shifts for officers unable to return to work due to operational-stress injuries. The new hires are also meant to replace constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello, who were murdered while responding to the August shooting call in which residents Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright were also killed. Story continues below advertisement Const. Robb Costello, 45, left, and Const. Sara Burns, 43 were murdered while responding to the August shooting call. handout/The Canadian Press ""The tragedy has, as you can imagine, placed a strain on some of the members of our team, with some who have not yet been able to return to full duties,” Chief Fitch wrote in a statement. “This will help to provide much-needed resourcing to our front lines, return officers to their former duties in a timely manner and restore services that are important to this community.” However, while the union wants the new hires to be permanent, Fredericton’s chief administrative officer, Chris MacPherson, said the extra officers will be temporary. ""As things stabilize and officers come back to active duty, we will adjust and get back to our normal numbers,” Mr. MacPherson said. ""We expect this could take two years to fully recover from the tragic events of Aug. 10.” On Aug. 10, at 7:20 a.m., Fredericton police received a call of shots being fired at an apartment complex on Brookside Drive. Constables Costello and Burns were the first to arrive on the scene and were shot as they ran to assist Mr. Robichaud and Ms. Wright. Matthew Vincent Raymond, 48, was later charged with four counts of first-degree murder. The police chief was not available for an interview, but in response to questions from The Globe and Mail about whether the front lines were adequately staffed on the morning of the murders, Fredericton Police Force spokesperson Alycia Bartlett wrote in an e-mail that the primary response team was staffed according to the 2018 organizational plan – above minimum staffing levels. “Because the incident happened to occur during the shift change, we had additional immediate resources on scene.” The killings shook the quaint, white-collar city of 60,000 to the core, particularly the officers’ colleagues. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Ten officers are currently off work because of physical injury, illness or operational-stress injury, according to Ms. Bartlett. She could not say how many of those absences are the result of the shooting, adding that it ""continuously changes, which is to be expected after such an event. We anticipate that may continue for the foreseeable future.” Sgt. Clark said the number of officers off work after the shooting increased by a ""fairly large margin” and that at any given time the force is missing 10 to 15 members. ""We’re always encountering stress-related injuries just by the nature of our job, and that wasn’t recognized by the city, but it is now,” he said, referring to the additional $1.45-million the city has approved to hire extra officers. ""It’s unfortunate that this incident had to precipitate that.” From 2008 to 2013, the Fredericton Police Force had 115 members. In 2015, the number of officers was reduced to 105, where it is now. Sgt. Clark said the reduction came as crime, crime severity and the number of calls for service were on the rise. He said the city wanted to reduce staff to 93 members. ""The chief fought tooth and nail to keep us at 105,” he said, adding that the force has appealed to the city to increase staffing to between 125 and 130 to no avail over the past few years. According to Statistics Canada’s crime-severity index (CSI), which factors in both the number of crimes and their seriousness, between 2016 and 2017 Fredericton’s severity measure jumped 17.1 per cent to 85.61, much higher than the national figure of 72.87. The city’s violent-crime index rose 30.4 per cent. Story continues below advertisement Statscan figures also show that New Brunswick’s police strength for 2017 was lower than the provincial and territorial average, with 162 officers per 100,000 people, compared with 185 across the country. Sgt. Clark said the restructuring, which also includes moving some officers to front-line duties from other assignments, creates a safer environment for members and the public. As an example, he said that if only six or seven officers are working, as a minimum-staffing standard, and the force receives calls about an impaired driver and a robbery, there would not be enough staff on standby to sufficiently police the rest of the city. ""You don’t have adequate backup. Members suffer. The public suffers. You don’t have proper numbers on the street for your front-line service delivery. That’s the foundation of any security mechanism for a community,” he said. Welcome to The Globe and Mail’s comment community.

Michael,Gordon,1721,http://www.ironmountaindailynews.com/news/local-news/2018/10/ir-man-gets-jail-for-threats-to-ski-brule/,"Oct 4, 2018 MICHAEL GORDON CRYSTAL FALLS — An Iron River man who threatened to “shoot up” the Ski Brule resort earlier this year was sentenced in Iron County Trial Court to 10 months in jail, with credit for 219 days already served, and five years of probation, during which he is not allowed on the resort’s premises. Michael Steven Gordon, 23, previously pleaded no contest to felony lying to a police officer in a violent crime investigation as part of a plea deal with the Iron County Prosecutor’s Office. One of Gordon’s co-workers at the Ski Brule resort southwest of Iron River previously testified he saw a verbal argument the morning of Feb. 24 between Gordon and a member of management. When Gordon and the co-worker were talking together later that day, Gordon started making “idle threats of physical harm” to the manager, the co-worker testified. This escalated to Gordon threatening the manager’s life, his own life and the lives of Ski Brule guests by saying he would “shoot up Ski Brule,” according to the co-worker. The co-worker then filed an incident report at the lodge, which informed the Iron County Sheriff’s Office. Gordon, while incarcerated, reportedly had an “active plan” to harm the manager and himself once he was released, Iron County Prosecutor Melissa Powell claimed, but she said there wasn’t enough substance for charges. The manager submitted a letter to the court asking for a lengthy sentence, saying he fears Gordon. But defense attorney Michael Scholke said mental health evaluators deemed Gordon wasn’t a threat. And Gordon told the court he has no animosity toward anyone, is not prone to violence and is ready to move on with his life.

Usually only a two-week injury when the meniscus is removed in surgery, Sims decided on a slower approach that is unlikely to see him return to training until the new year but should help the 28-year-old’s fitness in the longer term.

T&Cs apply. “The surgeon went in and stapled down the meniscus (rather than removing it),” Dragons high performance boss Nathan Pickworth said on the club’s website. “The difference with that is it will be a bit of a slower rehab in the earlier stages so we’re looking at a three-four month mark of him getting back to training and playing. It’s a bit slower than your usual meniscectomy. “The benefits we have done is in the back end of Tariq’s career he won’t be at risk of getting early onset arthritis. He’ll be able to run normally and do all the things he needs to do like that.” The Dragons have otherwise received good news on the injury front after they endured a tough end to the season, in contrast to going a record 12 rounds without changing their starting side. Lock Jack de Belin won’t require surgery on his injured ankle and will likely be fit to start pre-season training at the same time as the rest of the group on November 19. Captain Gareth Widdop will have a longer break after surgery on his dislocated shoulder, but the Dragons are confident he’ll be fit for the start of next season. Prop Paul Vaughan should also begin running on return from ankle and foot injuries at around the same time as the start of pre-season.

Not pictured is John Horton - D Flight. Posted: Wednesday, October 3, 2018 11:45 am Laidback holds 14th tourney 0 comments Once again, the Laidback Golf Tour traveled to Greensboro National Golf Club where they held their 14th tournament of the season. Just as in previous seasons the group of 24 golfers found the course to be in great condition and one of their favorite stops on their schedule. This time the challenging layout gave up two eagles and eighteen birdies to the field as four golfers turned in rounds in the 70s. Leading all scorers for the day was Mark Dill playing in the A Flight with his score of 74. Dill carded one eagle and one birdie in the round to allow him to claim his second win of the season in just four starts. It was also two in a row as he also won the Tours last event which was at Forest Oaks. Steve Cummings and Fran Hensley both turned in scores of 75 to tie for the second spot; but Cummings collected the prize money as he won a single hole play-off against Hensley. A play-off was also necessary to determine the B Flight as Tom Simmons and David Wilson both finished regulation play tied at 82. Simmons won the play-off as he two putted while Wilson took three putts. It was Simmons first win of the season. Wayne Ferrell claimed third place in the flight at 85. The C Flight also had a first-time winner for the season today as Debbie Thompson claimed the two-stroke victory with her round of 83. It was only Thompson’s second outing of the season. Lee Lemons also competing in his second event of the year took the flight’s second place with his round of 85. John Horton collected his second win of the season in D Flight with his round of 89. Meanwhile Curtis Smith and Tour Director Kenny Powell had to have a play-off to determine second place. After coming to the 18th hole tied; Smith forced the play-off as he putted in from off the green to tie Powell at 94. They went back to replay the 18th hole for the play-off only for Smith to once again putt in from off the backside of the green to win the second-place prize.

Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 11:33 am Serving South-Central Minnesota The Highway 22 Corridor Study, recommending upgrades in Mankato and points north and south of the city, is nearing completion.File photo The Highway 22 Corridor Study, recommending upgrades in Mankato and points north and south of the city, is nearing completion.File photo MANKATO — Plans are nearing completion for the remake of Highway 22 in Mankato and points north and south of the city. The 18-month Highway 22 Corridor Study has examined deficiencies and potential improvements from Mapleton to St. Peter. The busiest stretch of the highway is within Mankato, where average daily vehicle counts top 12,000 throughout the city and approach 19,000 between Madison Avenue and Highway 14, making it the third most heavily traveled road in the area behind Highways 169 and 14. People interested in viewing the concepts developed for intersections, roadway layout and pedestrian upgrades are invited to attend an open house from 4:30-6:30 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 11, at the Minnesota Department of Transportation building at 2151 Bassett Drive. One high-interest component of the study — the route of a planned bike trail connecting St. Peter and Mankato — has not been decided. The open house is the final public meeting on the broader changes proposed for the roadway, which could include everything from roundabouts to turn lanes to passing lanes. The recommended layouts were based in part on input from area residents at previous open houses, said Anne Wolff, public engagement director for MnDOT. ""This open house is going to be sharing a few recommended layouts based on their feedback,"" Wolff said. The corridor study was done in anticipation of planned reconstruction of large portions of Highway 22 in the next five to six years. In 2023, construction crews will be placing new pavement on Highway 22 from Highway 83 on Mankato's south side to Blue Earth County Road 57/North Riverfront Drive north of the city (other than the portion between Bassett Drive and Highway 14 which was reconstructed in 2014 when two roundabouts were added.) The following year, work will focus on the section north of County Road 57 to St. Peter. MnDOT is sponsoring the corridor study in conjunction with the Mankato Area Planning Organization, made up of a number of local governments in the area. Consultant SRF was contracted to conduct the study. Another agency, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, is involved in the portion of the study examining trail options connecting Mankato, Kasota and St. Peter. The trail segment is a critical component of the legislatively authorized Minnesota River State Trail that will ultimately run from the Twin Cities to the river's headwaters at Big Stone Lake. A final decision on a particular route between Mankato and St. Peter will come later, Wolff said.

John Hardin quarterback Justin Russell has thrown for 991 yards. The John Hardin coaching staff has had to alter its preparation more than the Bulldogs have. The Bulldogs play at the Louisville Valley Vikings at 7:30 tonight in a rare Thursday game. “It makes for a short week,” John Hardin coach Chris Engstrand said. “We have kept the game plan more concise this week. We didn’t adjust our practice schedule. We kept it a normal day today and didn’t have a walk-through like we usually do the day before a game. It’s been more of an adjustment for the adults than the players.” If not playing on Friday night didn’t throw a wrinkle to the Bulldogs, Engstrand said it’s one of the worst weeks of the season since the school is on fall break. “Fall break and homecoming are the worst two weeks,” Engstrand said. “Nothing good comes from those two weeks. You spend a whole lot of time trying to eliminate distractions. Fall break is difficult because we are coordinating rides for players. It’s tough from that standpoint trying to figure out who’s going to be there.” The Bulldogs (5-2) are in the midst of a four-game winning streak. Since a loss to Daviess County on Aug. 31, they have beaten Warren Central, Central Hardin, Meade County and Louisville Western. They needed comebacks against the Bruins and Green Wave before blowing out the Warriors last week. John Hardin has a chance to match its longest win streak since winning five straight in 2016. The Bulldogs have to like their chances against a struggling Valley team. Valley’s lone win was a 27-12 victory over Louisville Iroquois on Aug. 31. The Vikings (1-5) have lost three straight, including a 27-0 setback to Moore in their Class 4-A, District 3 opener. The Bulldogs are averaging 23 points and 278.6 yards per game. Valley has allowed 21 or more points in all five losses. “They are going to cause a lot of chaos,” Engstrand said. “They remind me a lot of Western in the regard they are going to bring a lot of pressure. We have to identify where the big threats are, because it’s a high stakes game. If we can get the ball out quickly, there are some big plays out there.” Senior Justin Russell has passed for 991 yards and 12 touchdowns. Senior Darion Davis has been his top target with 29 receptions for 243 yards and five touchdowns. Juniors Andrew Davis and Shelby Gosnell and seniors Markelius Hill and Josh Garrett are threats in the passing game as well. Sophomore Dominik Hodges shouldered the load against Western, rushing for 70 yards on 14 carries. Leading rusher Will Cason is unlikely to play. Senior Jaylin Springs has added 171 yards and one touchdown. “If we can get through to the second level, there is no one there,” Engstrand said. “There is plenty of real estate. We’ve done a better job of springing our backs.” The Vikings have had trouble generating points. They have only reached double digits twice and failed to score in two games. But Engstrand has cautioned his team about taking the Vikings lightly based on statistics. “The quarterback (Charles Camp) is a good athlete,” Engstrand said. “He has a good arm if he has time to throw. He’s pretty good once he breaks contain. If we have trouble keeping him hemmed in, it’s going to be a long night. We have to keep the pressure on him. This week kind bleeds over to Louisville Moore because they have an athletic quarterback. It’s one of those games where we have to be disciplined with our pass rush and keep him contained.” Engstrand praised the job the Bulldogs have done on special teams. Last week, they blocked two punts and returned another 27 yards to set up a short scoring drive. He gave the credit to assistant coaches Adam Cobb, Marcus Hyche, Aaron Evans and Shaun Boykins. “Dakota (Risner) has done a fantastic job for us all season punting,” Engstrand said. “He has pinned the opponent inside the 5 several times. There an 18 percent chance the offense is going to score. We work on special teams 30 to 45 minutes every day. Dakota has been a weapon for us to flip the field. That’s really important. We’ve done a good job of fielding punts and not letting the ball roll 10 or 20 yards. I think our team realizes how important special teams are.” Chuck Jones can be reached at 270-505-1759 or cjones@thenewsenterprise.com.

An Ayre Group Property. Hit Enter to Search Shareholders of crypto mining and investing firm MGT Capital Investments, which has previous ties to John McAfee, have filed a class-action lawsuit against the company over allegations of a pump-and-dump scheme that manipulated the price of MGT shares. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe into a stock-pumping scheme involving a group of 10 investors and corporate executives, including former MGT Capital CEO Robert Ladd, former Riot Blockchain CEO John O’Rourke, and billionaire Phillip Frost. John McAfee, who served as executive chairman and CEO of MGT Capital until his resignation in August 2017, was not named in the SEC investigation. However, he was named a defendant in the class-action lawsuit filed by Rosen Law Firm on behalf of current and former MGT shareholders. According to the lawsuit, the defendants failed to disclose that they “were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate MGT Capital’s stock price,” that the “illicit scheme caused MGT Capital to make false and misleading statements, which would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the SEC,” that “the illicit scheme would ultimately cause MGT Capital’s stock to become delisted from” the New York Stock Exchange, which means that their statements regarding MGT Capital’s business prospects “were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.” The suit is asking the court to order MGT Capital to pay damages to the shareholders who were affected by the alleged manipulation of MGT shares, as well as cover the plaintiff’s court costs, and award further relief to aggrieved parties. Recently, CoinGeek reported that McAfee has ceased promoting ICOs due to threats from the SEC. Though not explicitly named in the SEC order, the complaint indicated that the defendants used dishonest promotion and manipulative stock trading to drive up the price of MGT shares, enabling them to net more than $9.4 million in just two weeks. However, MGT tells CCN that the firm has the ‘utmost confidence’ that the suit is without merit and that it will be dismissed. Copyright © 2018 Coingeek. All Rights Reserved.

(Legal Newsline) – A clinical stage biotechnology company headquartered in Georgia is alleged to have deceived the investing public and engaged in a scheme to inflate the prices of securities. Anthony Pepe filed a complaint individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated on Sept. 20 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Cocrystal Pharma Inc., formerly known as BioZone Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Director Phillip Frost; et al. alleging violation of federal securities laws. According to the complaint, the plaintiff is suing on behalf of class members who purchased Cocrystal and/or BioZone securities from Sept. 23, 2013, to Sept. 7, 2018. The suit states on Sept. 7, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission released a press release that announced Frost was named in a complaint over allegations of fraudulent schemes. The suit states after this announcement, Cocrystal shares fell more than 15.5 percent and damaged investors. The plaintiff holds Cocrystal Pharma Inc., et al. responsible because the defendants allegedly employed devices, schemes and artifices to defraud in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs request a trial by jury and seek judgment against defendants, damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, expert fees and other costs, and further relief as the court may deem just. He is represented by Laurence M. Rosen of The Rosen Law Firm PA in South Orange, New Jersey.

Steve,Cummings,1711,http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/worlds-pinot-has-no-regrets-at-sacrificing-himself-for-french-team/,"'My goal was to make the race hard' Thibaut Pinot's rivalry with his contemporary Romain Bardet famously saw them both miss out on stage victory to Steve Cummings at Mende during the 2015 Tour de France, but the Groupama-FDJ man put personal ambition firmly to one side with a selfless display in the World Championships road race on Sunday.Related ArticlesPinot joins Bardet and Alaphilippe in French Worlds teamPinot doubles stage wins at Vuelta a EspanaValverde crowned World Champion in InnsbruckBardet: We can't be satisfied with second place Bardet took the silver medal behind Alejandro Valverde (Spain) after Pinot had worked prominently on behalf of him and preordained team leader Julian Alaphilippe on the final two laps of the demanding Innsbruck circuit. Pinot was to the fore on the last ascent up the climb to Igls and was again at the head of the dwindling leading group on the approach to the vertiginous climb of Höll, where the winning move eventually took shape. After Bardet went away with Valverde and Michael Woods (Canada), Pinot attempted to pace Alaphilippe back into contention, but the damage was already done. They reached the finish 43 seconds down on Valverde, and Pinot placed 9th, on the same time as a visibly disappointed Alaphilippe. ""I sacrificed myself,"" Pinot said in the mixed zone afterwards. ""I swung off after doing my work, when there were only six riders left in front. There was no lull in front so we never got back on from behind. My goal was to make the race hard because the number one favourite was Julian."" After victories at the Tour of Britain and Tour of Slovakia in the weeks leading up to the Worlds, Alaphilippe was expected to shine on the tough parcours, but he lost contact with the leaders on the final ascent. ""He had cramps on the climb, so then we played the Bardet card,"" Pinot said. ""My instructions were to move in the last two laps and to ride at the bottom of the last climb. That’s what I did. We’re obviously disappointed because we wanted the title, but we came across a stronger rider."" A winner of two stages at the Vuelta a España and a regular contender at Il Lombardia, Pinot might have been deployed as a team leader rather than as a deluxe équipier. The 28-year-old insisted he had no complaints about the role handed to him by Guimard, however, pointing out that Alaphilippe was the rider best-suited to the course. ""I had my role, I accepted it and I have no regrets,"" Pinot said. ""It’s a pity but we showed that we were strong collectively, and that’s what we need to take away from this race. I stuck with my role and I didn’t hide. In the last two laps, I jumped on everything that moved. For me, Julian was stronger than me on paper on a course like that. It was normal to sacrifice myself for him."" Despite the rigours of the Innsbruck course, a sizeable peloton remained in contention come the final two laps. The severity of the climb to Höll perhaps discouraged attacks from distance, while the strongest teams all had a similar tactical outlook ""Everybody was betting on the finishing sprint of their leader and it’s a tactic that almost paid off for us. If Julian had been up there, he could have won,"" Pinot said. ""When three riders in the top 10, we showed we were strong, although we were aiming to win."" France have not won an elite men’s world title since Laurent Brochard’s victory in San Sebastian in 1997. Bardet is only the third medallist in the intervening period, after Jean-Cyril Robin’s bronze medal in Verona in 1999 and Anthony Geslin’s bronze in Madrid six years later. While Alaphilippe’s versatile talents make him a contender on just about every kind of Worlds course, Pinot confessed that he might have to wait a little longer for another opportunity to play a role in the finale. ""We still have time [to win the Worlds] and I hope it might be in Switzerland in two years’ time,"" Pinot said. Not that Pinot is without objectives in the immediate future. After placing third in 2015 and 5th a year ago, he will line out among the favourites for Il Lombardia on October 13.

Bob,Diamond,1709,https://bklyner.com/the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-that-never-goes-out/,"COBBLE HILL – Sometimes the most exciting places in New York are not found on its streets but right underneath them. Consider the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel in Brooklyn. Along with places like the 91st Street ghost station and the abandoned East 18th Street station, the tunnel is one of several abandoned underground transit spaces in New York. Built in 1844, the world’s first subway ran under Atlantic Avenue between Boerum Place and Columbia Street, according to The Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA). Constructed almost 40 years before the Brooklyn Bridge opened, it was the last step in connecting Boston with New York by rail link. Running the trains underground satisfied investors who wanted to develop the area and residents who wanted to keep it beautiful. But benefits were offset by pollution when ventilation shafts unleashed sparks and shot plumes of smoke onto the avenue above. Residents complained, and in 1859 a New York Court prohibited coal or wood burning locomotives from entering Brooklyn, according to Robert Daley’s book The World Beneath the City. The world’s first subway had been active for only 16 years. The tunnel lived on in the minds of New Yorkers. Rumors claimed the missing pages of John Wilkes Booth’s diary, pirates, prohibition era bootleggers, mustard gas wielding WWll spies, mobsters, and giant water rats had all found sanctuary within its walls. The tunnel became the stuff of fantasy. This all changed in August of 1980 when a young engineering student from Flatbush, Bob Diamond, went down a manhole, crawled through a shallow chamber, broke through a brick wall and pulled the tunnel back into reality. “This blast of cold air came out from the other side, just like Raiders of the Lost Ark,” Diamond said of the moment he opened up the cavernous tunnel. The discovery was followed by eight months of obsessive researching and digging through city records. The work had paid off. More than the tunnel, Diamond’s fascination was fixated on what he believed was inside—an abandoned 1830s engine sealed behind the far wall of the tunnel. Captivated with trains since his childhood, Diamond filled his home with model train sets in his youth and now stacks it high with piles of books on the subject. “I wanted that locomotive,” Diamond said. “As far as I’m concerned, that was mine.” For a time it seemed he might succeed. The city reacted positively to his proposed plans for a museum in the tunnel. Private organizations offered to donate trolley cars. In 1982 Diamond started offering public tours. He formed the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association the same year. The association successfully appealed to the National Register of Historic Places which landmarked the tunnel in 1989. Diamond expanded his efforts to restoring trolley service in Dumbo and nearby Red Hook, with the goal of one day connecting the two lines. By 2010, now flanked by a Trader Joe’s and Urban Outfitters, the neighborhood above the tunnel was different from the day Diamond first clambered down a manhole. Recent rezoning in downtown Brooklyn raised the maximum height for new developments. The dusty antique stores that once lined Atlantic Avenue were beginning to disappear and plans to open a Barney’s had recently been announced. Diamond had changed too. No longer the youthful student crawling his way into adventure, he suffered from arthritis and conducted his tours from a seat in the tunnel. His persistent nature had made him a thorn in the side of local government agencies, several of which declined to comment for this article. Despite the neighborhood’s transformation, Diamond was shocked when his operation was shut down in 2010. Over the 30 years the tunnel was open the tours had increased in popularity. Hundreds of curious visitors were ushered weekly through the manhole in the middle of Atlantic Avenue (at Court Street). Rooftop Films held screenings in the tunnel, running series with themes like “Trapped in the Tunnel” and “Tunnel of Love.” National Geographic planned to film a documentary about the tunnel and the abandoned locomotive rumored to be sealed in its depths. The growing attention might have done more harm than good. In December of 2010, on the recommendation of the Fire Department, the DOT suspended the tours and the City of New York barred Diamond and the BHRA’s access to the tunnel. Diamond sued the City in 2011, seeking to recover damages for fraud and breach of contract. He lost the case, the court finding that the City had the “right to revoke and terminate the consent agreement at any time.” He appealed and lost again in 2015. Today the Atlantic Avenue entrance remains welded shut. In 2014 the owners of Chez Moi at 135 Atlantic, Tarek Debira and Patricia Ageheim, were renovating their restaurant. After a beer and some persuasion with a sledgehammer, Debira uncovered an exterior section of the tunnel behind a basement wall. Like Diamond’s comparison to Indiana Jones, Ageheim said finding the tunnel “was like opening the doors of Narnia”. The space was incorporated into a speakeasy style bar, Le Boudoir, which attracts customers with this slice of Brooklyn history. It’s a fitting fate for a tunnel once rumored to have been a hideout for bootleggers and illegal whiskey stills. Petitions have circulated urging the City to resume the tours. Ageheim said there were reports of a residence in the area also having basement access to the tunnel. A test conducted in the tunnel shortly before it closed showed evidence there could be a large metal object behind the far wall, right where the locomotive is alleged to sit. Diamond has not given up hope he will see the inside of the Atlantic Avenue Tunnel again. Inspired by the new evidence from the test, he continues to look for new ways to regain access. Referring to a book by Chairman Mao sitting on his table, he said the process was like “long term, low intensity warfare.” While the second life of the Atlantic Tunnel might have been a brief 30 years, this chapter closes with a new generation of Brooklynites curious about its future. Hopefully the giant rats won’t be a part of it. This story is free to read thanks to the generous support from readers like you.

Andrew,Davis,1708,http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/6566480-151/bend-council-candidates-debate-housing-growth-sewer,"Four Bend City Council candidates sparred over growth, transportation and housing at a debate Monday. The Central Oregon Association of Realtors hosted a joint debate with Position 5 candidates Gena Goodman-Campbell and Andrew Davis and Position 6 candidates Barb Campbell and Sarah McCormick. Victor Johnson, who’s running for Position 5, and Ron “Rondo” Boozell, who’s running for Position 6, did not attend the debate. Boozell is in jail through December for failing to pay child support; Johnson did not respond to an invitation, said Tyler Neese, the association’s government affairs director. The association’s political action committee has given $30,000 to Davis and $10,000 to McCormick, according to campaign finance records filed with the Oregon Secretary of State. Growth Davis and McCormick both said the city should focus on quickly annexing land in its urban growth boundary, the line around Bend that limits where it can grow. A land shortage means Bend can’t build homes or attract high-paying jobs quickly enough, said Davis, Central Oregon Community College’s director of student life. The city also needs to start planning for its next UGB expansion immediately, he said. “If we can build homes quickly enough, we can help costs from scaling out of control,” he said. Goodman-Campbell, public lands coordinator for the Oregon Natural Desert Association, said she agreed Bend should be building more homes quickly to address the city’s housing crisis, but she said Bend should be careful about sprawling. The city’s last urban growth boundary expansions took two tries and several years to be approved because it tried to expand too far, she said. “I really don’t think we can afford more sprawl, especially when we have trouble maintaining the roads and infrastructure we have now,” she said. Smart growth includes focusing development in the center of the city, where roads and other infrastructure already exist, Goodman-Campbell said. Affordable housing Davis and Goodman-Campbell said they wanted to see developers in Bend building more varieties of housing, including duplexes and townhomes. The focus should be on homes for people making the median income of $64,000 or below, Goodman-Campbell said, because Bend has a shortage of thousands of homes for people making that amount but a surplus of homes for people with higher incomes. McCormick, a stay-at-home mother whose family owns the Pine Tavern, said the city should focus on annexing land in the UGB rather than trying city policies like rent control or inclusionary zoning, which requires affordable housing in developments. Developers work with fine margins and requiring them to construct affordable housing will mean they move to other cities, she said “There is a price to be paid for putting in low-income housing,” McCormick said. Bend and other cities have learned from past failures and now build subsidized housing so it fits in with neighborhoods, said Campbell, a current city councilor and owner of the Wabi Sabi gift shop in downtown Bend. She said she wished she could get all Bend residents who are concerned about affordable housing projects on a bus tour to look at the projects the city’s already completed. “I think most of our citizens would be surprised to find out they are already living near affordable housing,” she said. “We’ve done a remarkable job of making those types of housing fit into neighborhoods.” Transportation State law requires Bend to reduce how many miles vehicles travel, and there are several ways to do that, Goodman-Campbell said. One way is by making sure Bend residents have access to amenities like grocery stores in their neighborhoods, so they’re able to safely walk, bike or drive a short distance instead of driving across town, she said. “If their car breaks down, a lot of people don’t have ways to get around town,” she said. Campbell and Goodman-Campbell both talked about how advances in street-light technology can help traffic. Smart traffic signals and route-finding apps that advise drivers to take less congested routes help create capacity without widening streets, Campbell said. McCormick and Davis, meanwhile, said they supported a pilot program near Oregon State University-Cascades that will test subsidizing ride-hailing services in place of a bus route that was canceled this summer because of low ridership. Subsidizing ride-hailing rides is better for the city’s budget and the environment than operating buses, McCormick said, but she said Campbell would disagree because “she’s part of the protest with the bus union people.” Campbell, along with Deschutes County District Attorney John Hummel, joined city bus drivers when they rallied for higher wages last month. “I’m really excited about having Uber subsidized in place of our bus system,” McCormick said. Campbell, who voted against the pilot program, said she doesn’t want the city to work with companies like Uber and Lyft because their rating system allows for discrimination. “Subsidizing Uber with tax money? No, thank you,” she said. Sewer Campbell and Goodman-Campbell agreed that the city as a whole and the hundreds of homeowners who will have to connect to Bend’s sewer lines should split the costs of connection. A current suggestion from a city committee made up mostly of people who live in a southeast Bend neighborhood near a new city sewer line would cap the connection costs for homeowners at $25,000, instead of the $100,000 or more some homeowners would have to pay without city intervention. The committee’s suggestion also would create financing options that would spread the cost over years and create a safety net for people who can’t afford to connect. A fee of $25,000 is still too much, Davis said. “To someone who is retired and drawing on Social Security, that number might as well be $1 million,” he said. He said the city should keep looking at financing options and make sure everyone contributes to the cost. McCormick, meanwhile, said its the city’s responsibility to take care of its residents and homeowners shouldn’t have to pay $25,000. “The city needs to get back to the drawing board,” she said. — Reporter: 541-633-2160; jshumway@bendbulletin.com Explore more of Central Oregon with a subscription to The Bulletin.",0.0,5.0,0.35714285714285715,0.0,1020357,0.5496088938337768,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

The organization will honor Olympian Adam Rippon, poet Leslea Newman, Chance Mitchell and Justin Nelson of the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce ( NGLCC ), and youth advocates Drew Adams & Ose Arheghan. Judy and Dennis Shepardthe parents of Matthew Shepard, whose brutal and homophobic murder was the impetus for the Matthew Shepard Foundation as well as the Hate Crimes Prevention Actwill be speaking at the event. Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown signed SB 918, the Homeless Youth Act of 2018, authored by Senator Scott Wiener ( D-San Francisco ) and Assemblymember Blanca Rubio ( D-Baldwin Park ) and co-sponsored by Equality California ( EQCA ), an EQCA press release noted. Following an historic $25 million investment in combating youth homelessness included in California's 2018 budget, SB 918 provides resources for housing, services and supports for youth experiencing homelessness, and tasks the state's Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council with overseeing the program. The Black LGBTQ+ Migrant Project ( BLMP ), a project of Transgender Law Center, celebrated the release of Udoka Nweke, a 29-year-old gay Nigerian migrant, from California's Adelanto Detention Facility, according to a BLMP press release. ( Nweke fled from Nigeria, where he was the target of violence for being gay. ) A June 2018 report by Human Rights Watch, the National Immigrant Justice Center, the Detention Watch Network and the American Civil Liberties Union analyzed the death records of people who died while in immigration prisons and found that between 2010 and 2017, seven people died at Adelantomore than any other facility in the United States. After taking flak for remaining the only MLB team not to host an LGBT Pride Night, the New York Yankees organization changed the narrative by announcing details on a series of 2019 events that will commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, USA Today reported. The Yankees' commemoration, tabbed the Yankees-Stonewall Scholars Initiative, will be held during the team's homestand June 17-26, 2019, that will honor graduating senior students from the New York City Public School who have made impactful support toward LGBT equality. Lesbian Texas gubernatorial candidate Lupe Valdez rejected anti-transgender bathroom legislationonce a priority for anti-LGBT Gov. Greg Abbottas ""fear-mongering"" in a debate Friday night with her opponent, The Washington Blade reported. During a debate at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, KSAT-TV anchor Steve Spriester asked Abbott whether he'd sign a bill barring transgender people from using the restroom consistent with their gender identityand Abbott eventually said, ""Not on my agenda."" Valdez said, ""There is a continual fear-mongering, and I don't believe in laws that start out with fear. We need to stop the fear-mongering in our laws and get down to what really matters to all Texans: To have an equality life, to have an equal and fair opportunity in this state instead of just dealing with people that you don't agree with."" A lawsuit challenging the replacement for North Carolina's House Bill 2 is moving forward, with a judge finding evidence that transgender plaintiffs are being harmed by a prohibition on new local anti-discrimination laws, WRAL.com reported. However, U.S. District Judge Thomas Schroeder rejected another key argument: that uncertainty created by the current law effectively discriminates against transgender people. Schroeder sided with plaintiffs' arguments that House Bill 142 ( which halted new local anti-discrimination ordinances until the end of 2020 ) largely thwarts their efforts to seek new LGBT protections. In Pennsylvania, what started as a call to support a principal who had been placed on leave turned into a personal admission from Beaver Area School District's top administratoras Beaver Area Superintendent Carrie Rowe said she's lesbian, TimesOnline.com reported. Rowe's statement came after Luke Berardelli, a Beaver graduate and former Beaver councilman, organized a rally prior to a meeting to show support for Steve Wellendorf, the Beaver Area High School principal placed on paid leave in August. Berardelli had complained of a ""toxic culture"" in the school district, and alleged Rowe has targeted people who are involved in a Christian group called Young Life; Wellendorf supported the speech of a student at a 2017 graduation that included elements of prayer and Christian themes. There is a new project to compile a resource list of service providers to the transgender community throughout Texas called the Texas Transgender Alliance, The Dallas Voice reported. Black Transman founder Carter Brown and Equality Texas Transgender Programs Coordinator Lou Weaver are running the project. The Texas Department of State Health Services is identifying groups across the state falling through the cracks when it comes to HIV care. In a strange development in Colorado, a Jefferson County court has found that a man was married to his ex-boyfriend as a result of a commitment ceremony in 200311 years before gay marriage was legalized in the state, Westword.com noted. As a result of the ruling on a complaint filed by his onetime partner, who sued for spousal support earlier this year, Denver-area resident Dean LaFleur had to divorce a man to whom he never believed he was married tolosing a sizable amount of his assets in the settlement that resulted. Bryan Deneumostiera Miami man arrested in July for posing as a housewife and promising men sex before luring them to his home, filming them without their knowledge and putting those films on a pay website called Straightboyzhas pled guilty to charges of recording two victims in May and July 2015, a Towleroad item noted. Deneumostier reportedly told the men he filmed that the ""housewife"" was an army wife and would never film them. The men wore blackout goggles or a blindfold while engaged in the sex act. The Trevor Projectthe world's largest suicide-prevention and crisis-intervention organization for LGBTQ young peoplereleased ""How to Save a Life,"" a new national campaign that encourages supporters to apply to become volunteer crisis counselors for TrevorText and TrevorChat, a press release noted. The campaign's 30-second PSA features artist-activist Jussie Smollett. To become a volunteer, supporters can apply at TheTrevorProject.org/SaveALife; to see the ad, see https://www.thetrevorproject.org/about/corporate-partners/trevor-att-and-jussie-smollett/#sm.0002tjds011zre0fw2g1eeusb6kkf. On the Sept. 21 episode of ESPN's Outside the Lines, sportscaster Bob Ley commended Capital University's Wyatt Pertuset for ""the first touchdown scored by an openly gay college football player in any division"" during the show's ""Underreported Story of the Week"" segment, Queerty noted. Pertuset actually made the touchdown nearly three weeks prior, and Ley speculated the triumphant moment had been underreported because sports media is finally treating LGBT athletes as equals. There are still no openly gay football players currently playing in the NFL, but there are seven openly gay or bi players competing at the college level. An effort to accommodate LGBTQ students at the evangelical Christian Azusa Pacific University changed when its board reversed an administration decision to lift the ban on LGBTQ relationships, San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported. When the APU student newspaper published an article on Sept. 18 about the initial pro-LGBT move, the 119-year-old university received some kudos but significantly more criticism, especially from Christian news outlets and pundits. In response, the university announced Sept. 28 that because the policy change was never approved by its board of trustees, it was reinstating the ban. A new episode of Smithsonian Channel's The Lost Tapes relives the Bill Clinton impeachment scandal, using only contemporary film and audio to allow viewers to experience history without comment, a Smithsonian Channel press release noted. The hour-long episode seeks to ask: At a time when everyone took a side, would you take the same one now? The Lost Tapes: Clinton Impeachment will air Monday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. CT on the Smithsonian Channel. Fox News fired contributor Kevin Jackson over his tweet referring to the women accusing U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault as ""lying skanks,"" TheWrap reported. Jackson, a radio personality and author, took to Twitter to make some widely criticized comments during Kavanaugh and his accuser's testimonies before Congress on Sept. 27. Speaking of Kavanaugh, his gay college roommate spoke out about what it was like living with the Supreme Court nominee around the same time he was accused of assaulting multiple women, Queerty noted. Kit Winter lived with Kavanaugh and a third roommate in a three-man suite at Yale in fall 1983. In a new piece by The Cut, Winter, who is gay, described what it was like living with Kavanaugh and the ""grim"" conditions. Winter described Kavanaugh as a ""loud, obnoxious frat boy-like drunk"" type who was ""frequently drinking excessively and becoming incoherently drunk."" The Center for Fiction announced that Oprah Winfrey will present author Toni Morrison with a lifetime achievement honor for ""Excellence in Fiction,"" Page Six noted. Winfrey, who has chosen such Morrison novels as Song of Solomon and Paradise for her book club, will introduce the author during a Dec. 11 dinner ceremony. Morrison's longtime publisher, editor-in-chief Sonny Mehta of Alfred A. Knopf, also will be honored that night. A message of ""silence"" shared on fourth-ranked Ohio State football's Twitter account drew criticism on social media and from national advocates for victims of sexual abuse and relationship violence, ESPN.com reported. The football team's account shared a graphic ahead of its top-10 win at ninth-ranked Penn State featuring the word ""silence,"" along with a message that said ""silence the white noise""and the post was later deleted. The context creating controversy stems from head coach Urban Meyer's recent suspension for how he handled a former assistant coach accused of domestic violence.",0.0,5.0,0.35714285714285715,0.0,1020357,0.5496088938337768,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Sara,Burns,1707,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/fredericton-police-bolster-front-line-emergency-response-after-deadly-shooting-1.4116668,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement The Canadian flags are lifted off the caskets of slain Fredericton Police officers Const. Sara Burns and Const. Robb Costello during a regimental funeral in Fredericton on Saturday, August 18, 2018. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darren Calabrese FREDERICTON -- The Fredericton Police Force is bolstering its front line emergency response capabilities in the wake of a deadly summer shooting that claimed the lives of four people, including two police officers. Chief Leanne Fitch said in a statement Monday that although the pain of the loss is still very fresh, the force has to adjust the way it delivers services to adapt to a ""post-August 10"" reality. ""Seven short weeks ago, our police force and our community suffered a grave tragedy, something we never imagined could have happened,"" she said. ""The senseless loss of Donnie Robichaud, Bobbie Lee Wright, and our cherished officers, Cst. Sara Burns and Cst. Robb Costello, is still resonating throughout our great city, and in the hearts and minds of loved ones and colleagues."" Although the force is continuing to mourn the deaths, Fitch said the force must also ""adapt to the realities we have faced."" A number of officers have been transferred to the force's primary response team patrols, a move that Fitch said will impact staffing levels in other areas such as police station tours and public presentations. The change will also curb the force's ability to roll out specialized traffic tools, such as portable electronic speed signs. In response, the city of Fredericton has committed to hiring 16 new officers in the coming months -- 10 more than previously approved -- to strengthen the front lines, restore community services and provide some flexibility for officers who require time off for vacation or personal reasons, the chief said. Offering a glimpse at how deeply the tragedy impacted the force, Fitch said the shooting has placed a strain on officers -- with some not yet able to return to full duties. ""As you can well imagine, the Fredericton Police Force is feeling this loss acutely,"" she said. ""The pain of the loss is still very fresh for us, and it will continue to be as we face reminders in the coming weeks and months."" Matthew Vincent Raymond is facing four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. During Raymond's first court appearance, his lawyer said they were unable to proceed with the case because the defence was still awaiting disclosure -- or release of the findings of the police investigation. Lawyer Nathan Gorham has said he eventually expects a plea of not guilty and a request for a preliminary hearing.

Sara,Burns,1707,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/fredericton-city-council-budget-2019-1.4846454,"Calamities like the Fredericton shootings that left four people dead, including two police officers, could cost the city up to $2.2 million in its 2019 budget. ""The reality is, there is no buffer to absorb these significant unexpected costs right now, without additional revenue, without impacting service levels,"" Tina Tapley, the city treasurer and director of finance, said at a pre-budget council-in-committee meeting on Monday. Councillors were told the city was responsible for paying for the regimental funerals for Const. Robb Costello and Const. Sara Burns, who died, along with Bobbie Lee Wright and Donnie Robichaud, in the shootings outside a north-side apartment building in August. The city is also paying for the investigation and for police officers who had to fill in for officers who needed time off after the shootings. Matthew Vincent Raymond, who is charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the August shooting, is expected to appear in provincial court on Oct. 22. The city still doesn't know exactly how much those expenses will be, which worries some councillors. ""It's been an expensive and catastrophic year across a variety of files,"" said Coun. Greg Ericson, chair of the city's finance committee. ""Council has some challenging decisions ahead of it in terms of how we're going to cover those costs and still provide services and the quality and value that the citizens get from our services."" At the meeting, Fredericton Mayor Mike O'Brien said Ottawa will help with some of the costs, but he didn't say how much it would contribute. The city's bottom line was also impacted by tariffs from the United States, unprecedented spring flooding, halting the city's plans for Officers' Square, and the continued effects of the provincial property tax assessment freeze. Council agreed there needs to be a better contingency fund to cover unforeseen expenses. Right now, Ericson said, the city doesn't have a strong plan for dealing with unexpected costs. ""Huge one-time fluctuations, whether they're costs or whatever, can impact all kinds of operations that the city performs,"" he said. ""We have very limited revenue streams and limited capacities to borrow under provincial legislation. ""We don't have a credit card with an unlimited amount on it, and we can't just turn to other levels of government with our hands out every time we need it."" In 2018, the city was able to handle some budget challenges such as the property assessment freeze because of a substantial surplus carried over from a previous budget. ""This year we don't have a surplus that helps in the same way, so we've got some difficult conversations around the council table,"" said Ericson.

Phillip,Frost,1706,https://www.financial-planning.com/news/ladenburg-thalmann-not-dependent-on-ex-chairmans-capital,"The SEC charges against Ladenburg Thalmann’s primary shareholder will not affect access to capital for its 4,300-advisor independent broker-dealer network, CEO Dick Lampen says. Phillip Frost retired from the Miami-based firm’s board on Sept. 20, two weeks after the SEC accused him of involvement with a $27 million pump-and-dump scheme. In addition to the network of five IBDs, Ladenburg’s subsidiaries also include its 139-year old investment bank, an asset management unit, an insurance brokerage and a trust division. The company’s various entities hold $250 million in cash with a book value above $390 million, Lampen noted in a statement. Ladenburg is “very pleased about how well-positioned our company is today for continued industry leadership,” he said, noting it also has $600 million “in permanent capital and long-term investment-grade notes” raised in the past five years. “With access to significant capital resources,” Lampen added, “Ladenburg will continue to explore opportunities for growth, including growth through strategic acquisitions, if and when the right opportunities present themselves.” Frost controls about 35% of the company, according to Barrington Research Associates, the sole analysts currently listed as covering the stock. He owns about 3.1 million shares directly and 67.7 million shares indirectly through two entities where he’s the trustee, an SEC Form 4 filing shows. Frost exercised options to purchase nearly $1 million worth of Ladenburg’s stock on Sept. 24, according to the filing. In a separate transaction, he had forfeited 45,000 shares in connection with his retirement from his role as chairman. In the second transaction four days later, Frost exercised his options and held the stock rather than selling the 600,000 shares valued at $948,000, or $1.58 per share. The options, which the company granted him in 2008, would have expired on Oct. 30. The SEC charged one of the stock-owning entities in which Frost is a trustee, Frost Gamma Investments Trust, in the pump-and-dump case. The other, Frost Nevada Investments Trust, is an affiliate of Frost Gamma, according to the firm’s $40 million credit agreement with Frost Gamma. In a civil case filed earlier this month in the Southern District of New York, the regulator charged Frost, nine other people and 10 entities with selling penny stocks at artificially inflated prices. Retail investors wound up holding “virtually worthless” stock, the SEC says. The billionaire dermatologist’s fortune, which stems from his legendary career as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields, helped Ladenburg acquire its five IBDs between 2007 and 2015. Frost has largely taken “a passive role” with the IBDs, though, says recruiter Jon Henschen. Henschen sees the SEC case against Frost as much different from the accounting scandal which plunged former Cetera Financial Group parent RCS Capital into bankruptcy protection in 2016. “It has nothing to do with Ladenburg,” Henschen says. “They’re basically putting up a Chinese wall to shield them, whatever does transpire there. Whether he’s innocent or not, it’s not going to involve Ladenburg.” Barrington analyst Alexander Paris reiterated the research firm’s “outperform” rating for Ladenburg’s stock in a Sept. 21 note following the announcement of Frost’s retirement. Paris set a 12-month price target of $4.75 per share, or roughly an 95% increase over its current value of $2.44. Paris noted that Frost had expressed confidence in Ladenburg’s outlook even as he stepped down, which “suggests to us that he has no current plans to sell or reduce” his stake in the firm. The analysts “can attest to his long-term and successful approach to investing,” Paris wrote. The sell-off following word of the SEC charges against Frost left the value of Ladenburg's shares at 60% of its projected 2018 revenue, according to Paris, who describes the price of the firm’s stock as a discount on the ratio of 1.3-times-revenue for shares in its “closest proxy,” LPL Financial. “We expect continued growth going forward, as Ladenburg leverages its significant scale and capitalizes on further consolidation opportunities,” Paris wrote.",0.0,21.0,0.875,0.0,1053951,0.9994979930908506,1,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

The case, Pepe v. Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. f/k/a BioZone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al, No. 2:18-cv-14091 was filed on September 20, 2018. The lawsuit focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose that: (1) the company and certain of its officers were engaged in a pump-and-dump scheme to artificially inflate Cocrystal's stock price; (2) this illicit scheme would result in governmental scrutiny, including from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""); (3) the Company failed to abide by SEC disclosure regulations; and (4) as a result, the Company's statements about Cocrystal's business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading. Specifically, on September 7, 2018, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Phillip Frost, one of the Company's directors and shareholders, and others, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, Phillip Frost allegedly participated in at least two unlawful pump-and-dump schemes involving various microcap companies. After the lawsuit was announced, Cocrystal's share price fell from $3.74 per share on September 6, 2018, to a closing price of $3.16 on September 11, 2018—a $0.58 or a 15.51% drop. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Sara,Burns,1703,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/officers-killed-in-fredericton-shooting-honoured-at-ottawa-ceremony-1.4115776,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement Two Fredericton police officers who were killed in a shooting nearly two months ago were among the six officers to be honoured in Ottawa for making the ultimate sacrifice. Six Canadian police officers who died in the line of duty were honoured on Sunday in front of hundreds of colleagues at the 41st annual Police and Peace Officers' Memorial Service outside Parliament Hill. Among them were Fredericton police constables Sara Burns and Robb Costello. Burns and Costello were killed on the morning of Aug. 10 in a shooting at an apartment complex in Fredericton. Two civilians -- Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright – were also killed. The suspect in the shooting, Matthew Vincent Raymond, has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. His next court date is scheduled for Oct. 22. Both Costello’s and Burns’ families were at the ceremony in Ottawa, but were too emotional to speak with reporters. “They're doing as well as can be expected,” said Fredericton Police Chief Leanne Fitch. “They are incredible families and I think this has been a very healing event for all of us.” In 1998, the federal government officially proclaimed the last Sunday of September as Police and Peace Officers’ National Memorial Day. In a statement, Canada’s Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale acknowledged the police officers’ “self-sacrifice and dedication to their noble professions.” “Police and Peace Officers' National Memorial Day is an opportunity for all of us to reflect on the vital role police and peace officers play in our society and to honour those who have sacrificed their lives in carrying out their duties,” he said. “It is also an opportunity to think of their families and loved ones, and to extend to them our thoughts and prayers."" The other four officers who were honoured on Sunday included: All six names will be added to Honour Roll tablets on Parliament Hill, which already include the names of more than 860 fallen officers in Canada. With a report from CTV Ottawa’s Megan Shaw A cool + cloudy day in Ottawa, but the National Police+Peace Officer Memorial Service was both moving + impressive. Thousands gathered to pay tribute to fallen officers. #HeroesInLife #WeRemember pic.twitter.com/RfJhV0EyP6 A police officer adjusts her hat before the Canadian Police and Peace Officers Memorial Service on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Sunday, Sept. 30, 2018.

Updated: November 8, 2018 @ 12:49 pm Serving Lawrence County since 1880 Walkers head up the hill from the Cascade Park picnic grove during the Fit Walk. Editor Walkers head up the hill from the Cascade Park picnic grove during the Fit Walk. In their childhood, they rode rides like the Comet, the Tumble Bug, the Ferris wheel and the merry-go-round. Those amusements that once populated Cascade Park put people in motion, but riders always ended back where they started. The concept was basically the same at the sixth annual Challenges Fit Walk yesterday, except the kids are now senior citizens, all the motion was done on foot and home base was the park’s venerable dance pavilion. According to Michael Gordon, health and wellness coordinator for Challenges: Options in Aging, a record 328 people registered to participate in yesterday’s event that included a choice of two walking courses — one easy, the other harder — as well as lunch, a basket auction, 50/50 raffle and prizes. “We’re going to take a stroll through the park today and reminisce at Casade. People are real excited to be here,” Gordon said of the participants. “They grew up in this park and they get to see and reminisce all about the roller coasters and the park as it once was.” The event started out six years ago at Pearson Park in Neshannock Township, but quickly outgrew that facility. Few, though, seem to have outgrown the walk itself. “We have people walking into their 90s,” Gordon said. “It’s impressive what they can do. “But we’re also going to have an indoor sit-down exercise session for those who can’t go out and do the trail today.” Prior to heading out, the participants loosened up with some dance and exercise moves in the pavilion after watching Dottie Trott receive proclamations from both state Sen. Elder Vogel and the Lawrence County commissioners. Trott is retiring after 41 years as fiscal administrator for Challenges. Somewhat newer to the cause is Claire O’Connor, health and wellness assistant at Challenges. Yesterday was her first Fit Walk. Story continues below video “I was impressed by them from the first day I started, and they just continue to impress me with everything they do and how they support each other,” she said. “It’s amazing to see how many of them are here, and how excited they get and how much fun they have.” John Duda, 73, paused outside the pavilion to say, “It’s a great day for exercise, it’s a good fun time. I love it, I come every year.” Richard Macaluso, 77, has done all six Fit Walks, but they are just one part of the Challenges experience he enjoys so much. “Just being with Challenges is good — best operation in town for the elderly,” he said. “I started out in the back with the Fitness Club and stayed with it. They have a golf league, a bowling league, learning how to play mahjong, my wife plays bridge. It’s just a great thing.” Dan Houk, took a different tack. Asked what he liked best about the day, the 63-year-old Ellwood City resident deadpanned, “The prizes.” His wife, Sandy, 67, played along, noting “We did our walk — from the car to here.” The pair conceded that they did plan to participate in the exercise session while others walked, but Sandy said the day is about more than exercise alone. “This is very festive” she said, “exercises and talking to other people.” In other words, just a walk in the park.

It was a loss that set the tone for rest of the district slate last season. John Hardin hosts the Warriors at 7:30 tonight at Bulldog Stadium. The Bulldogs hope to atone for last season and start off on the right foot this year. “This is the first week of our season,” John Hardin coach Chris Eng­strand said. “Everything before this week was merely preparation for district play and playoffs. We weathered the storm of four 6-A schools and that has prepared us for what really matters: District champions and deep playoff run. This week and every week from this point on is our most important week of the season.” John Hardin is riding a three-game winning streak, including scoring late to pull out wins over Central Hardin and Meade County. Engstrand said it hasn’t been difficult to keep the Bulldogs’ attention. “It’s not been too difficult. We just remind them of last year and how easily things can change for the worse,” Eng­strand said. “This group is different. They are hard to put my finger on. Not that it’s a bad thing, I just can’t remember coaching a group this unique. They are fun and maddening at the same time.” The Warriors have struggled offensively this season. They have managed only 21 points in six games, including being shut out four times. It’s a far different offense than last season that scored 49 points against the Bulldogs. But Engstrand said the Warriors still are a dangerous team. “Western is fast, they will try to pound the ball behind a really big offensive line – I mean huge,” Engstrand said. “If they get past our second level, it could be a long night. We have to continue to stop the run and force teams to be one dimensional. If we can continue to do that, we can make a really good run.” John Hardin’s offense is churning out 18.5 points and 343.8 yards per game. Senior Justin Russell has passed for 876 yards and 11 touchdowns. He has completed 52.1 percent of his passes. Russell has thrown 10 interceptions in 169 attempts. Russell has added 116 yards on the ground. Senior DeShawn Johnson has 22 catches for 299 yards and three touchdowns, while senior Darion Davis has made 29 receptions for 243 yards and five scores. Junior Andrew Davis has 14 grabs for 106 yards. Senior Will Cason leads the team in rushing with 226 yards and one touchdown on 40 carries. Sophomore Dominik Hodges has added 216 yards on 42 attempts, while senior Jaylin Springs has 171 yards on 46 carries. The Warriors are allowing 42.5 points per game, but Engstrand said they still are capable of disrupting offenses. “Defensively they are athletic and fast,” Engstrand said. “They play a base 4-3 and really like to bring pressure. They can cause us some issues. Offensively we are going to pick up our tempo. For the first time this season, we have the advantage of numbers and our conditioning. We are shooting for 80 to 90 offensive snaps.” Western (0-6) dropped its district opener at Breckinridge County, 39-6. The Bulldogs (4-2) are in a much better situation than a year ago. They were 3-3 at this time last season. They have won three straight for the first time since 2016. It’s the longest streak in Engstrand’s two-year tenure. Engstrand said the foundation of this season was laid when the Bulldogs rallied from a 19-0 deficit to beat Mercer County, 20-19 in the season opener. “The team believes, it’s that simple,” Engstrand said. “It didn’t start on the winning streak, it started when we came back to win at Mercer. Aside from the hiccup versus North, we have been in every game and we’re a kicker away from beating Daviess County.” Chuck Jones can be reached at 270-505-1759 or cjones@thenewsenterprise.com.

Andrew,Davis,1694,http://www.thevalleydispatch.com/ci_32171206/ayer-man-stabbed-death-woman-charged,"AYER - A 24-year-old Ayer man died Friday afternoon after being stabbed by a 26-year-old Ayer woman to whom he is related, and the woman is in police custody pending arraignment on Monday, according to the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Emergency crews in Ayer were called to an apartment complex on Groton School Road in Ayer Friday about 1:18 p.m. by a 911 call reporting a stabbing, according to a press release. Crews arrived to find the man suffering from a stab wound to the torso, according to a press release. ""That man was taken to the Nashoba Valley Medical Center, where he later died from that injury,"" District Attorney Marian Ryan said during a Friday evening press conference outside the Ayer Police Department. Ryan was accompanied by Ayer Police Chief William Murray and Massachusetts State Police Lt. Paul Bulman. According to Ryan, preliminary investigation suggests that the victim was apparently in an altercation inside the apartment with the woman with whom he is related. ""During that altercation, the allegation is that the female stabbed that male with a large kitchen knife,"" Ryan said. Officials said the woman lives in the apartment where the stabbing occurred. The woman was arrested at the scene and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon causing serious bodily injury. More serious charges could be filed once an autopsy is complete. The identities of the victim and the suspect cannot immediately be released since the incident is domestic in nature, according to a press release. Over at the Zodiac Village Apartments at 75 Groton School Road, investigators cordoned off a section of the complex with yellow crime scene tape. They brought out shoe covers to wear in the area of a second-floor apartment. ""I'm shocked,"" Jan Kendall, who was dropping something off for someone at the complex, said. ""It's a whole quiet area."" Andrew Davis, who has lived at the complex for about three years, had no idea what allegedly occurred around the corner from his home. ""It's always been a pretty safe place,"" the 70-year-old said from the entrance of his first-floor apartment. ""I've never seen anything like that."" A short time later, a man wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap showed up to the scene with a concerned look on his face. He didn't want to share his name but said he knew the people who lived in the apartment investigators were looking at. As he learned more details, the man became increasingly distraught. He peered up at the apartment flooded with officers. ""I know who lives there,"" he said. ""I just don't understand."" The 26-year-old suspect was held on $100,000 cash bail and will be arraigned Monday in Ayer District Court.

Sep 28, 2018 @ 2:10 pm By Bruce Kelly With the Securities and Exchange Commission cracking down on penny stocks, Merrill Lynch recently told its clients and financial advisers that it is putting restrictions on the purchase and sale of a large swath of low-priced securities. ""To ensure we are complying with SEC regulations and protecting the interests of our clients, we recently made changes to our policy regarding low-priced securities,"" a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Jerry Dubrowski, wrote in an email. As a result, certain transactions may be subject to restrictions, trading prohibitions or other limitations."" According to a source familiar with the moves, as of July, clients were no longer able to buy penny stocks through Merrill Lynch, and by the end of September, will no longer be able to sell them through the brokerage. The stocks will still be able to be transferred to a different account at another broker-dealer. After Merrill informed its clients it was not allowing the sale of the securities and gave advisers and clients to the end of the month to complete the trades, advisers raised concerns about closing down clients' positions, according to the source, who asked not to be named. The changes in Merrill Lynch's stance come as the SEC continues to warn investors about penny stock trading and the risks of market manipulation and higher volatility. The SEC on Friday said it had settled charges against clearing firm COR Clearing for failing to report suspicious sales of penny stock shares totaling millions of dollars. As part of the settlement, COR has agreed to exit a key penny stock clearing business by significantly limiting the sale of penny stocks deposited at COR, which was fined $800,000 and neither admitted or denied the SEC's findings. Earlier this month, Dr. Phillip Frost, the largest shareholder of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc., was charged with fraud by the SEC for his involvement in a pump-and-dump, penny stock scheme. At the time, Dr. Frost was the non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann. He resigned from that position days after the SEC's filed its complaint. The new restrictions at Merrill do not affect securities listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq, the source said, but apply only to those on the over-the-counter market, which is also known as the Pink Sheets. ""Other firms are saying we don't want these securities,"" the source said. Two years ago, UBS Financial Services created a similar policy regarding so-called high-risk stocks, including penny stocks. According to Merrill Lynch, a low-priced security is generally defined as having one or all of the following traits: securities that trade over-the-counter, or OTC, at or below $5 per share and have a market capitalization of less than or equal to $300 million; securities labeled as ""Caveat Emptor"" by the OTC Markets Group; and OTC securities that have limited or no financial disclosure information available. ""Caveat Emptor,"" Latin for ""let the buyer beware,"" is a designation generally used to inform investors that there may be reason to exercise additional care and perform thorough due diligence before making an investment decision in that security, according to Merrill Lynch. After September 30, Merrill Lynch clients who want to sell existing positions will face additional compliance reviews that could slow down the transactions. Regulators have increasingly made their views of penny stocks known. The SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis published a white paper in 2016 highlighting the risks of investing in over-the-counter markets. The majority of investors lose money in the trades, and losses worsened for stocks that were the subject of promotional campaigns and those that had weaker disclosures, the SEC said. CNBC first reported the changes in penny stock policy at Merrill Friday morning.

Andrew,Davis,1692,http://www.oregonwinepress.com/bubbling-brew,"By L.M. Archer Sparkling wine demands time, toil and treasure. It’s also seductive as hell. Just ask Oregon winemakers. Already renowned for premium Pinot Noir, the state now threatens to outshine other wine regions in bubbles. Many ascribe this burgeoning fizz fame to a far-flung band of passionate winemakers as diverse as their respective terroirs and as complex as the sparkling they craft. Willamette Valley winemakers represent a history of leading, not following. If you’ve tasted a bottle of this gnarly region’s bubbles, chances are one of two men had a hand in it: Rollin Soles or Andrew Davis. Many credit Soles of ROCO Winery for getting the ball rolling and Andrew Davis of The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company for advancing it down the field. Together, their respective legacies account for a major touchdown in Oregon méthode Champenoise or méthode traditionelle, the Old World method developed in Champagne. Soles founded Argyle Winery in 1987 in Dundee with a specific intent: to produce world-class sparkling wine in the Willamette Valley. A pragmatic, handle-bar-mustachioed Texas Aggie, Soles blames luck for his eventual foray into bubbles. “Setting oneself up to receive luck is important,” says Soles. “My luck was that my biochemistry professor [at Texas A&M] set me up to work in Switzerland one college summer vacation for his cousin, Hans Uli Kesslering, who grew Pinot Noir and was a pioneer in sustainable agriculture in the mid-’70s.” Soles credits this experience as the impetus to his future in wine. A side note: “Can’t get any tougher than ripening Pinot Noir in northern Switzerland,” he confirms. Soles’ guiding hand propelled Argyle, and Oregon, to the forefront of sparkling wine internationally, garnering an unprecedented trifecta on Wine Spectator’s list of “Top 100 Wines of the World” in red, white and sparkling categories. “It’s humbling how very small changes in sparkling winemaking actually show up in the wine,” notes Soles. “From picking decisions to pressing the fruit, to fermentation vessels and yeast choices, to blending, to best timing on yeast in the bottle and dosage, sparkling winemaking has made me a better white and red wine winemaker.” In 2001, Soles and his wife, Corby, planted vines on land they purchased in 1987 within the Chehalem Mountains AVA. From that vineyard, Wits’ End, Soles produced his own “Private Stash” Pinot Noir, a cult wine later served at the White House. Such success paved the way in 2009 for Soles to establish ROCO Winery — the name derives from the first two letters in Rollin and Corby — and build a tasting room in 2012. In 2013, Soles turned over the Argyle reins to winemaker Nate Klosterman to concentrate on ROCO. Klosterman has since added Ksenija Kostic House as Argyle’s assistant winemaker — Soles still maintains a healthy mentoring relationship with Argyle. “The timing [to leave Argyle and start ROCO] was perfect,” says Soles. “I’m inspired every month by the manner that ROCO was set in motion by my wife, Corby. She did the ‘hard yards’ of making ROCO happen, has an amazing palate and is the most creative person I know. How could that not inspire this old winemaker?’’ Six Degrees of Andrew Davis While Soles laid the foundation, many people point to Andrew Davis, founder of The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company, for Oregon’s dominance in sparkling today. At 6 feet 5 inches tall, the Argyle alum literally towers above his fellow winemakers. Davis learned sparkling winemaking from Soles at Argyle directly after completing a master’s program in New Zealand. “It was my first stop,” he says. “I knew I wanted to be making bubbles.” Davis recounts his time working under Soles, “He was a wonderful mentor to me. Spectacular. And [he] had the confidence in my abilities to slowly give me more and more of the reins, until I took on the winemaker role.” As Argyle grew, Davis realized he wanted to take on a personal project of a much smaller scale. That day arrived in 2013. Sensing a latent desire from area winemakers for assistance starting their own sparkling projects, Davis founded Radiant — partially funded by Rollin and Corby Soles. Investing in a state-of-the-art mobile bottling unit, coupled with a no-frills warehouse operation replete with a gyropalette for riddling and an assembly unit for disgorging, topping, corking, caging and labeling, Radiant provides Oregon winemakers the sparkling infrastructure without the costly capital outlay. “This is coming up on year six of the Radiant Sparkling Wine Project,” says Davis. “I started with a number of people thrown together very quickly in 2013. That doubled the next year, and then doubled again.” He reveals he’s somewhat surpassed his goal regarding clientele, with future success measured in other ways. “I see smaller, more natural, organic growth, as my clients feel comfortable about their own production and their own sales,” Davis explains. “Eventually, someone’s going to grow to a point where commercially it makes sense for them to buy their own equipment, and I’ll mark that day as a sign of my success.” Not wanting to give up his winemaker’s hat, Davis, in 2013, also participated in a collaboration called Lytle-Barnett with Andy Lytle, Antony Beck and consulting winemaker Pieter “Bubbles” Ferreira of Graham Beck. Davis found the fruit, made the base wine, and bottled the blanc de noirs, brut and brut rosé, all pending release. Making bubbles is not for the weary. “You have to be passionate about it [sparkling wine] because it is more work and a longer pay-off,” Davis says. “It’s more nerve-racking than still wine, so you have to be dedicated from the get-go to do this. You also have to be on top of your game. You can’t short-cut it. You can’t cut corners. You can’t be lackadaisical about it, or else, it won’t turn out.” Radiant impacts a number of Oregon sparkling wine projects, including Chemeketa Community College Wine Studies Program. The Willamette Valley college first integrated sparkling wine production into their curriculum two years ago. “This ranges all the way from discussions of partial pressures in wine chemistry to all parts of the production process in our wine production series,” explains Scott Dwyer, program chair and winemaking instructor. “Sparkling wine interest and sales are increasing daily, and our job is to create educated and skilled members of the wine industry.” Dwyer acknowledges the local wine industry, former winemaking instructor Barney Watson and Davis for contributing valuable resources, time and expertise to the program. “When I came on board here, there were bottles on tirage still from 2009, 2010 and 2011,” says Dwyer. “This gave us the ability to start teaching all the components of the process immediately and helped show students that sparkling production isn’t necessarily limited to larger wineries with massive equipment budgets.” The college recently gained international recognition when it hosted the 2018 Sparkling Symposium at their Northwest Wine Studies Center, featuring keynote speaker Peter Liem, author of “Champagne.” The biannual event allowed students to showcase a clonal variation experiment in base wine to participants. “Oregon sparkling is both challenging and exciting to me,” concedes Dwyer, “because of the unseen potential. It’s exciting to be a part of it all and to see when it will all tip.” For some, méthode Champenoise constitutes a means of self — and site — expression. Anne Amie Vineyards winemaker Thomas Houseman always wanted to make sparkling wine but held back due to associated costs and logistical hurdles. However, he believed that Anne Amie’s 12 Oaks Estate on Chehalem Mountain, a cool vineyard with great acidity, presented the perfect site for bubbles. “I prepared a file with all the details in case the subject ever came up, but kept my mouth shut,” says Houseman. “In 2011, Dr. Pamplin [Anne Amie’s proprietor] came to me and asked me if I’d like to make sparkling wine. I said, “Of course,” and showed him my folder with all the details hammered out. The rest is history.” Since 2015, Anne Amie has hosted Bubbles Fest, a two-day consumer event held every February centered on Oregon sparkling wine. In 2018, the winery added a technical symposium for sparkling producers. “The idea is to do for sparkling wine what the Steamboat Pinot Noir Conference did for Pinot Noir, giving us a forum to share our trials, our successes and our failures,” explains Houseman. Houseman believes community drives the success of Oregon sparkling wine, as it did Pinot Noir. “Our strength lies in our ability to help one another,” he says. “Eight years into making sparkling wine, I can attest to that. We were helped by those who came before us, and I am there to help those who want to follow in our footsteps.” For Shane Moore of Gran Moraine in Yamhill-Carlton AVA, “sparkling production is a bit of an ideological twist for me. In still wine production, I generally try to throw numbers out the window and follow wherever the vineyard is leading me.” Moore also employs Radiant for bottling. Of the four vintages completed so far in Oregon, Moore considers 2017 his favorite. “I think it’s because we got to hang the fruit out there a bit later,” Moore says, “and the wines have a lot more electricity, as well as depth.” Ribbon Ridge proprietor and winemaker James Frey of Trisaetum developed a natural appreciation for site-specific grower Champagne from his own production of single-vineyard Pinot Noir and Riesling. “When Andrew Davis started Radiant Sparkling Wine Company, and provided the logistical support for many of us to really explore what sites, soils and clones can produce amazing sparkling wines here in Oregon, I jumped in with both feet in 2014.” Frey produces four different sparkling wines under the Pashey label, an homage to his maternal grandmother, a striking, dark-haired British ‘traveler,’ or gypsy, whose image graces the muselet atop every bottle. “Oregon has always attracted entrepreneurial winemakers who want to push themselves, and others, to find what wines are truly best suited to this climate and these soils,” says Frey. “The collegial spirit among winemakers here in the Willamette Valley is clearly speeding up the learning process with sparkling winemaking. It’s an exciting time to be making wine here.” Sokol Blosser co-president and winemaker Alex Sokol Blosser of Dayton admits family feeds his foray into sparkling wine. “Growing up, we had bubbles for special occasions, and felt there was always something mysterious and fanciful about Champagne,” shares Sokol Blosser. “When my sister, Alison, and I took the reins from our parents, we knew we wanted to put a stake in the ground as an outstanding house of sparkling wine in Willamette Valley.” “Our favorite site for our bubbles program is Blossom Ridge Vineyard in the Eola-Amity Hills,” says Robin Hawley, Sokol Blosser’s laid-back, lead sparkling winemaker. “It sits in a nice little bowl that the Van Duzer Corridor effect helps keep cool and the fruit clean.” Sokol Blosser contends sparkling production has improved all aspects of their winemaking. “Carbonation exposes everything about the wine, and makes the fruit pop more, as well as any sweetness — but on the bad side, it showcases any wine imperfections,” he confesses. “You see everything — for better or worse. This has forced us to bring more precision to our winemaking to ensure we get the flavors we want in the bottle.” The sparkling wine industry favors those flirting beyond the traditional fizz framework, too. While growing in popularity, Oregon Pét Nat producers like Dan Rinke of Johan Vineyards in Rickreall and Kate Norris of Division Wine Company in Portland, still remain a select tribe. “I made a traditional method sparkling wine in 2010, and I was looking for a way to make a sparkling wine the same way that I farm, which is using Biodynamic methods,” says Rinke. “That means minimal additions to the wine. No cultured yeast, no fining, no filtration, no yeast nutrients, no sugar and no sulfur. A true ‘natural wine.’” Since Rinke’s first vintage working with Pét-Nat in 2014, he’s expanded this program to include Pinot Noir, Melon de Bourgogne and even plans to do a Grüner Veltliner Pét-Nat in 2018. “Pét Nats are tricky because what we are looking for at Johan are some ripe flavors but lower alcohol and high acid, whereas with conventional sparkling wine, you’re looking for acidity and low alcohol with some flavor.” Champagne importers Terry Theise and Vintage ’59 introduced Bobby Rowett of Mellen Meyer to the world’s finest bottles of boutique Champagne while he worked for them. Obsessed by Champagne’s nuances and variety, Rowett wondered, “Why weren’t wineries making sparkling wine in that style in the United States?” This question led him to conclude, “Willamette Valley is the place to make our contribution to the world of premium sparkling wine.” Rowett sources Biodynamic fruit for his sparkling, in part, from grower and producer Johan Vineyards. “While we are inspired by Champagne and other great sparkling wine regions in the world,” Rowett says, “I think it’s essential we focus on making these wines in our own way. This is our unique corner of the wine world.” Sometimes confused with its famous concert-going cousin, The Gorge in eastern Washington, Oregon’s Columbia Gorge AVA scrims both sides of the Columbia River with wind-swept, hard-scrabble, moody drama. Scoured, uplifted and layered by epoch-old geologic events, it turns out this vertiginous fulcrum between the Willamette and Columbia valleys proves an ideal crucible for making some of Oregon’s most compelling bubbles. Part of this region’s success rests on the unassuming shoulders of vineyard manager and winery owner Lonnie Wright, and his dynamic daughter Sierra Wright of The Pines 1852 in The Dalles. Lonnie Wright moved to the Columbia Gorge in 1981 after marrying a local girl. Fresh from a three-year stint planting vines for Columbia Crest in Patterson, Washington, Wright immediately found work helping restore what proved to be one of Oregon’s oldest vineyards, The Pines, a site planted in the 1890s to old-vine Zinfandel. Over time, he developed a successful vineyard management company while leasing, expanding and, eventually, purchasing The Pines. “In the late 1990s, we started seeing wineries come here,” says Wright. “For years and years, I had sold fruit to wineries out of this area, so that was probably the biggest thing when we started to see wineries show up in this area because the winery is what’s going to give the area its reputation.” Convinced of the region’s potential, as well as the quality of their fruit, the Wrights established The Pines 1852 winery in 2001. In 2005, the Columbia Gorge AVA was approved. That same year, Sierra returned from college to assist, and The Pines 1852 built the first tasting room in downtown Hood River. Finally, in 2009, after much prodding, Sierra convinced her father to venture into sparkling wine. A pragmatic man, the decision wasn’t easy. “Everything in sparkling is more expensive. Everything,” Lonnie Wright says with a shake of the head. “The bottle. The cork. The cage. The label. Also, if you have someone that’s doing some contract winemaking.” Wright initially contracted with Chris Berg of Roots Wine Company for their 2009 and 2010 vintages but logistical issues with the bottler led them to Radiant Sparkling Wine Company in 2012; the mobile bottler also completed their 2016 vintage. The 2016 is still on tirage. Infrastructure and aging account for only part of the total cost. “The taxes that you have to pay on [sparkling wine] are a lot more expensive than you have to pay for other wine,” he explains. “It’s considered a federal luxury tax that you have to pay.” For Sierra Wright, despite the expense, Columbia Gorge AVA sparkling wine offers a chance for area winemakers to highlight their unique styles while offering consumers greater diversity. “We grow so many different kinds of grapes, and we have so many different styles of winemaking. With sparkling, that’s no exception. So you can’t just say ‘Oh, yeah, the Gorge sparkling is like this,’ because we’re all very different.” Ultimately, sparkling wine chooses the winemaker. Analemma Wines winemaker Steven Thompson and partner Kris Fade moved to Mosier from Walla Walla, Washington, in 2010. Veterans of tending Bordeaux varietals and Syrah from The Rocks District of Milton Freewater within the context of “normal” growing cycles, their first vintage in the Columbia Gorge proved anything but usual. “When the vines hadn’t even flowered by the second week of July, I was like ‘Oh, wow!’ says Thompson. “There’s no way we’re going to make it to harvest, to maturity.” Instead of panicking, the two listened patiently, and learned. They discovered Atavus Vineyard, the 50-year-old site they leased and managed above White Salmon, Washington, contained the Mariafeld clone from Switzerland, a Pinot Noir suited to cold climates. They also realized making sparkling wine was the original vision of the vineyard’s founder, Charles Henderson. “We thought, ‘OK, we’re hands-off here. This is what we’re doing.’” recounts Thompson. “I believe this element of listening, and respecting the variables we walked into, helped create the Atavus Blanc de Noirs into what it is today.” The slight, soft-spoken Thompson imbues a meditative approach to each aspect of sparkling wine production, save riddling and disgorgement, which he entrusts to The Radiant Sparkling Wine Company. “Because that’s what it’s about, right?” Thompson affirms. “It’s about giving your attention. We are contemplative and very intentional in our practices. And, ultimately, our goal is to provide a Zen-like experience for the consumer. When they share the wine with friends or family, it stops people in their revelry just for a minute to go, ‘Wow, this is something special.’” Translucent golden hue with persistent perling and rich, cashmere-like mousse that unlocks subtle, intoxicating aromas of marzipan, brioche and almond blossom.

Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com McDowell's Brycen Seymore and defensive coordinator Keith Styles talk on the sideline during last week's loss to Hickory. The Titans host St. Stephens in the annual homecoming game tonight (Friday, 7:30). Josh Davis/blueridgesportsphotography.com Note: ""Tonight"" in the story refers to Friday. The McDowell Titans experienced some smooth sailing at the start of the football season, winning their first two games in statistically dominant fashion. Then came the hurricane season, and the waters have been choppy ever since. But the Titans will try and right the ship tonight when they host the St. Stephens Indians in the annual homecoming game (7:30). McDowell (0-1 Northwestern 3A/4A Conference, 2-3 overall) is coming off a 31-0 loss to Hickory in the conference opener last Friday and has dropped three in a row. The Titans’ last win came at Avery more than a month ago (Aug. 24). On paper at least, McDowell should match up fairly well with tonight’s opponent. The Indians (0-1, 1-4) have had their share of struggles as well, and like McDowell, were shut out in the NWC opener last Friday. Freedom blanked St. Stephens 49-0, handing the Indians their third straight defeat. Last season’s game was tight throughout. McDowell held a 10-7 lead late in the first half, but a punt snap rolled out of the end zone for a safety and St. Stephens added a touchdown on the ensuing possession to hold a 16-10 lead at the break. The Indians ended up on the long end of a 19-17 score in the first meeting ever between the two schools. Although the Indians have had their share of difficulties, they’re certainly not without weapons. Sophomore quarterback Connor Williams (6-4, 190) is 42-of-94 passing for 553 yards and five touchdowns with 11 interceptions. Receiver Zach Lee (6-4, 190) has been Williams’ primary target, catching 23 passes for 437 yards and three scores. Running back Xavian King (5-9, 160) leads the team in rushing with 326 yards and four TDs on 78 carries. Linebacker Chance Benfield (6-1, 195) leads the Indians in tackles with 54, including four for losses and four quarterback sacks. McDowell will counter with senior quarterback Adam Randolph, among others. Although his production has tailed off since the start of the season, Randolph has still been solid, going 58-of-92 passing for 863 yards and eight touchdowns. He has thrown seven picks, three of them coming in the Hickory loss. Running back J.C. Olivo is the leading rusher with 325 yards and two scores on 71 attempts. Receivers Andruw Randolph (20 receptions, 280 yards, 4TDs) and Dakota Effler (15-241-2TDs) have been reliable. Defensively, inside linebacker Andrew Davis leads the team with 40 tackles, including two for losses. Linebacker Johan Ayala has made 35 stops, three for losses. Safety Drew Green has 32 tackles.

Andrew,Davis,1692,http://www.oregonwinepress.com/wine-on-the-go,"By Hilary Berg Our society loves its conveniences. Groceries delivered to your door, meal kit subscriptions, renting movies via your TV, eyeglass frames to try on at home, coffee drive-thrus. The list goes on and on, and on. In the wine industry, convenience translates to other amenities, such as wine clubs’ home delivery (see page 26) or canned wine — which we recently covered. Behind the scenes, one of the greatest game-changers is the mobile unit. Owning and operating a winery can be cost-prohibitive. It takes a fair number of expensive equipment to make your favorite Pinot Blanc or Albariño (see page 14). Processing the fruit requires sorting lines and de-stemmers, presses and pumps. But, like I said, mobile companies are now here to make wine production more affordable and so much easier. For example, Jon Casteel, the youngest of the Bethel Heights Casteel clan, saw a need and filled it, literally. With an eye on a tractor-trailer, he made an incredibly savvy business decision in 2006: He started his own mobile bottling unit. Twelve years later, he’s serviced wineries all across the Valley, and now owns an on-site bottling facility, offering even more options to his ever-growing client list. Filtering wine. Who knew this was such a tricky task? Winemakers, raise your hands. Companies like Willamette Cross Flow offer reliable, affordable mobile filtration, alleviating headaches of cellar workers throughout the state. A service that’s a clear winner. And now, one of the most expensive and time-consuming endeavors any winery can undertake, traditional sparkling, has been innovated into a mobile service using the latest equipment and making the highest quality bubbles on the market — if you’ve never tasted founder Andrew Davis’ sparkling, Lytle-Barnett, you are truly missing out (see page 30). Although not on the road, other innovations are happening, too, in the vineyard, in the lab, in the distribution market (see page 40), etc. In the end, all these modernizations lead to the same goal: Quality wine from a healthy market in which new ideas and tradition balance for a perfect delicious blend. Now that’s something worth waiting for in the winding-around-the-parking-lot line that’s now spilling out into the street. Coffee, not so much.

The series comes on the heels of a study that examined one major sector initiative and found that eight out of 10 nonprofits that implemented efforts to collect feedback went on to make changes to better serve clients. The SSIR series The Power of Feedback, which is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, will feature philanthropy leaders such as Fred Blackwell of The San Francisco Foundation, Pamela Norley of Fidelity Charitable and Kathy Reich of the Ford Foundation; nonprofit leaders such as Frank Daidone from the Nurse Family Partnership; sector experts such as the Center for Effective Philanthropy's Phil Buchanan and Listen for Good's Valerie Threlfall; corporate leaders such as SurveyMonkey CEO Zander Lurie; and clients of services related to housing, employment, and more. ""Sharing the latest strategies and best practices in social change with social sector leaders is at the heart of the work we do at SSIR,"" said SSIR publisher Michael Gordon Voss. ""This series represents the most comprehensive public discussion around the idea of constituent feedback for the nonprofit sector published to date. Leveraging the full array of our narrative tools—long-form articles, video, podcasts, and webinars—we will bring to our audience both the unique insights of nonprofit and foundation leaders, as well as the moving, personal experiences of individuals who participated in feedback programs."" SSIR is working with Milway Media on production of the series. ""Getting and using feedback from the people we seek to serve needs to become the new normal in the social sector.

The new series, which will run through February 2019, will feature commentary, webinars, and multimedia content with the latest research, practical insights, and tools and tactics from field leaders about their experiences in trying to more rigorously seek and use feedback from beneficiaries. SSIR plans to invite a conversation with readers via social media with the hashtag #FeedbackEmpowers. Listening to beneficiaries—the end users and clients of direct services provided by nonprofit organizations and supported by charitable donors—has been rated as one of the most promising practices for improving the impact of social change organizations, and more donors and nonprofits are adopting the approach. Through Listen for Good, the signature initiative of the donor collaborative Fund for Shared Insight, funders and nonprofits work together to build high-quality feedback loops with nonprofit clients. More than 200 nonprofits have received Listen for Good grants, totaling more than $9.4 million since 2016 and elevating the voices of more than 90,000 nonprofit clients nationwide. As of last week, when the latest round of Listen for Good grants were announced, the total number of funders involved with the collaborative effort is nearly 100. An evaluation of the initiative's effectiveness finds that nearly eight out of 10 organizations that participated are translating insights from the feedback collected into changes to better serve clients. Among those: In addition, the analysis suggests that the implementation of high-quality feedback loops can also advance organizations' equity, diversity, and inclusion work by providing clients a seat at the table at various stages of the decision-making process and allowing them to shape the services that benefit their communities.

Michael,Gordon,1691,http://www.ragtrader.com.au/news/best-and-less-owners-rebrand-amid-controversy,"The move comes as its global parent company, Steinhoff International, weathers legal and financial woes over a highly-publicised accounting scandal. Greenlit Brands will continue to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steinhoff International. No decision has been made concerning the separation from ownership by Steinhoff International and the Group said it will ""continue to carefully and methodically consider the various options in due course."" Greenlit Brands operates a number of homewares and apparel retailers, including Harris Scarfe, Postie and Best & Less. It is also the local operator for Debenhams. The company employs more than 10,000 people with 640 stores across Australia and New Zealand. The Greenlit Brands new name and logo were developed from within the Group and selected following a group-wide voting process. Greenlit Brands Group CEO, Michael Ford welcomed the change. “We have great brands which all originate in Australasia, that are loved by Australian and New Zealand consumers. Our retail brands cover the good, better and best spectrum in the household and general merchandise sectors. ""We also have our own manufacturing, logistics and supply chain operations which provide support to our retail brands. We look forward to building on this portfolio for our customers under the Greenlit Brands corporate identity.” Refinancing Package Greenlit Brands has secured a new financing package with a syndicate of three Australian-based banks comprising ANZ, NAB and Deutsche Bank. The package includes a Senior Facility of A$256m with a tenor through to October 2020. Greenlit Brands’ existing intergroup debt with entities of Steinhoff International Holdings NV (‘Steinhoff International’) has been subordinated to the Senior Facilities with longer tenor than bank debt, and existing parent company guarantees under the former local banking facilities have now been released. The refinancing package underlines that Greenlit Brands operates independently from its parent group, Steinhoff International, in terms of its working capital requirements and debt funding needs. Greenlit Brands CFO Michael Gordon said the package is essential to operations. “Putting in place longer term funding arrangements for Greenlit Brands is a major step forward for our Group. “We are pleased to have secured the longer term for our bank facilities with our local banking partners, which has been struck on normal commercial terms and interest rates. “This important initiative provides our 10,000 employees, our suppliers and our business partners across all of our respective brands with certainty about the Group and is indicative of the strength and independence of our Group in Australasia,” he said.

Phillip,Frost,1690,https://news.fiu.edu/2018/09/your-brain-is-a-work-of-art/126502,"What do you see when you look at this image? Tomás R. Guilarte asks his 8-year-old daughter Sofia this very question, curious about her young mind’s interpretation of this and several other pictures. They are all images of brain cells in culture he has brought home from work. Guilarte is dean of Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work and an expert in the fields of neuroscience and neurotoxicology. He is also a professor of environmental health sciences and cognitive neuroscience and imaging. Sofia tells him she sees a green octopus with bright blue eyes (upper left corner). He shows her a couple more, which Sofia says remind her of: 1) a galaxy, spreading itself infinitely 2) an orchid, due to its long curving stem, and 3) the roots of a tree, veining deep into the ground. 1) “A galaxy” 2) “An orchid” 3) “The roots of a tree.” Guilarte prepared the same activity for an attentive audience at “Beauty and the Brain: Connecting Art to Science,” as part of the Mixtape Mondays lecture series at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Museum. Mixtape Mondays features FIU faculty across disciplines, welcoming them to present their innovative research and studies in relation to art and the museum’s collection. Guilarte shared his research on the detrimental effects of environmental pollutants – such as heavy metals – on neurological and mental health. Presented with the colorful images of the cells, the room-filled audience gave similarly imaginative answers. Some said the “orchid” looked like a “chicken with a very long neck,” and the “roots” were reminiscent of the aerial view of a cityscape with its twinkling “lights,” which are actually synapses. Guilarte was excited to integrate art into the lecture, easing the understanding of these concepts by connecting notions that are seemingly unrelated. “I’m very visual. I see pictures, and just like the ones I showed, I begin to see shapes, animals and objects,” he said. “Providing an idea of the shapes and colors living within the organization and structure of the brain is a great way to communicate these ideas and connect art to science.” Tomás R. Guilarte This exercise, like any puzzle, is an excellent workout for the brain, one that Guilarte says promotes neuroplasticity (the creation of new neural connections) and neurogenesis (the growth of new brain cells). And other studies also agree, proving that regularly practicing art enhances brain connectivity. But keeping our brains healthy is a difficult task when considering the cluster of harmful compounds that we are exposed to on a daily basis. “We live in a soup of chemicals, we have to minimize our exposure and properly feed our brains,” said Guilarte. Because our brain’s susceptibility to injury from exposure to environmental pollutants is remarkably high, it is vital to prevent the loss of neurons and promote the growth of new ones. “As we age, neurons die, and many neurodegenerative diseases – like Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s – are principally diseases of aging,” said Guilarte. “But we are beginning to understand how these pollutants can initiate and/or accelerate the disease.” Though the traditional route of adopting a balanced diet and exercise regimen along with not smoking is still highly recommended, Guilarte emphasized the somewhat unconventional yet impactful role of art – both its consumption and creation – in the birth of new neurons and their integration into brain circuits that can enhance learning and memory. “And though genetics matter, it appears art is exceptional for our minds and our longevity,” he said. So, the next time you stop by a museum, keep a few things in mind about art: it improves brain function, brain wave patterns, fine-motor skills, creativity, and our social and emotional development. It may now help us lead healthier lives too. Mixtape Mondays is hosted once a month at the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum. For the museum’s event calendar, click here.

Teva fell 4.5% today, making it a 10% drop in three days, and bringing the company's market cap down to NIS 85 billion. Opko Health fell 6.5% today, for a 17% drop over the three days. Its market cap is now at NIS 7.9 billion. Perrigo, the third largest pharma stock on the Tel Aviv 35 list, remained fairly flat over the same period.

The leading factor is apparently the recommendation by a panel of the European Medicines Agency to approve Eli Lilly's migraine treatment. Eli Lilly's drug works in a similar way to Teva's migraine drug, which was recently approved for sale and which is considered one of the two great hopes for the future of the company's innovative business, alongside its drug for Tourette syndrome. The migraine prevention market has started to become very crowded, and the race to the top is close. The first drug in the category, from Novartis and Amgen, was approved in May, and was given a low market penetration price. Teva's product was approved for sale in the US two weeks ago, and not enough time has passed to assess the difference in the pace of market adoption of the two products. Eli Lilly's product should be considered for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within the next month or two, and the positive recommendation by the European panel raises the probability of it being approved in the US. A fourth product by a smaller company called Alder has passed a Phase III clinical trial but there is still no target date for a response by the FDA. Against the background of the approval of its migraine product two weeks ago, Teva's share price rose 12% within a few days, but it has now subsided to the level it was at before the approval. This is a frequent occurrence for pharma companies that receive a drug approval that was expected: the initial enthusiasm passes, anyone who was only waiting for the event exits the stock, while those looking to the longer term start to take into account not just the glad tidings of the approval but also the challenges of the marketplace, which in this particular case are considerable. A competitor to Copaxone? The second factor possibly contributing to the weakness in Teva is the report by a new contender in the multiple sclerosis treatment market, TG Therapeutics, of good results in a Phase II trial for its product. The results look very promising, although the trial was carried out on just 22 patients, and it will be some time before the product reaches the market, if at all. It may be that by that time Teva's dependence on multiple sclerosis (with its flagship original drug Copaxone) will substantially reduce, but still, TG Therapeutics looks like an interesting potential competitor. As for Opko, the company is still under the cloud of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe of Opko CEO Phillip Frost and of the company itself on suspicion of share price manipulation. The affair broke on September 7, and since then the company's market cap has dipped 35%. It recovered slightly on September 14 when Frost publicly rejected the accusations against him and spoke out against the SEC for not having requested his response before revealing the investigation.

Huff Retired Monsignor Pat Bishop is greeted by friend and former parishioner Gienia Klas on Wednesday as he joined several members of the classes of 1958-61 for a reunion at St. Joseph Catholic School. Bishop also performed the Mass yesterday morning. Staff-Kelly J. Huff MARIETTA­ — Kathleen Reed threw her arms around her old classmates Wednesday morning in the lobby of St. Joseph Catholic Church. Ten friends, many of whom hadn’t seen each other in decades, were brought together for a reunion of the classes of 1958 through 1961. While the majority in attendance Wednesday still live nearby, one graduate, Carole Shockley, journeyed all the way from Arlington, Texas, for the occasion. Laughs were had and stories were shared, particularly about Sister Mary Gerald, the school’s former principal described by her old students as a strict disciplinarian. “You see that stick she’s holding?” asked 1958 graduate Chris Lamer as he picked up an old black and white photograph of the school’s nuns. “She carried it around and used it to beat the s--- out of us.” In the spirit of Reunion Day, Monsignor Patrick Bishop, a 1959 St. Joseph graduate, delivered a lively sermon for the Wednesday morning mass. After singing songs of praise along with the schoolchildren and high fiving each of them as they headed off to class, the 72-year-old Woodstock resident joined his classmates, laughing at how old they had gotten since he last saw them. Some, like Marietta resident Martina Goscha, had their own stories to share about “Father Pat,” a priest of more than 40 years who served 25 years as the pastor of Marietta’s Transfiguration Catholic Church. Goscha, a longtime Delta flight attendant who came to St. Joseph when it opened in 1953, recalled what her mother said to her about Bishop one morning before school. Success! An email has been sent with a link to confirm list signup. Error!

Johnstone, who took taxis to and from school each day and mowed St. Joseph’s lawn once a week for $1, told a tale about how, as a boy, the priest would go around collecting money for what he called “Bishop’s Relief Fund.” Bishop admitted raising money for himself, but promised he never made much more than a quarter off fellow students wishing to chip in. The retired priest said he used to return regularly to conduct children’s masses, but hadn’t been back to his old school in several years. “This was homecoming for the first time in a while,” said Bishop, who enjoyed seeing his childhood friends and reminding all of them how much older they look these days. “I have nothing but wonderful memories of this incredible place.” As for his career choice, Bishop said he has loved it every step of the way. “I don’t know how to tell you what a wonderful life it is,” he said. “You enter people’s families — even though you don’t have your own — you enter people’s families as a relative and you’re there in good times and in bad. You love them and boy, they love you back. It’s an exciting life. In 45 years, there’s never been a boring moment.” Shockley, who went on to graduate from Sprayberry High with the class of 1963, said she enjoyed her time at St. Joseph. She remembered the large magnolias that once covered the campus and how she and her classmates would play among the shady trees. “None of this was here, and for recess, we would use the trees to hide from Sister Mary Gerald,” Shockley laughed as she caught up with her old friends. After light refreshments and a three-song set from St. Joseph’s first-graders that put huge smiles on everyone’s face, the graduates were given a tour of the campus that has changed substantially over the last six decades.

Andrew,Davis,1687,http://www.newsherald.com/news/20180926/worker-charged-with-defrauding-restaurants-insurance-company,"PANAMA CITY — A former Po’ Folks employee has been arrested after allegedly defrauding the restaurant’s insurance company of more than $20,000 in workers’ compensation, according to Florida Department of Financial Services (DFS) reports. Andrew Davis, 58, appeared in court Wednesday to face charges in the case. He was arrested recently after claiming he suffered a lower back injury in 2016 while moving furniture for Po’ Folks and received $21,487 in workers’ compensation from the businesses insurance company. Davis faces a charge of felony workers’ compensation fraud of more than $20,000, according to court records. DFS investigators claim that Davis knowingly made false statements during his hiring that set him up to receive workers’ compensation and then perpetuated the lie that he previously had not received workers’ compensation for his back injury. “Davis’ history of two prior workers’ compensation claims, that both resulted in civil action, would show an advanced knowledge of his medical claims history,” officers wrote. “Had Davis disclosed this information during his pre-employment questionnaire, Retail First Insurance would not have been exposed to this loss. Davis continued to hide these lies during the claim and medical treatment process.” However, Davis also allegedly told investigators that he only knew he injured his “tail bone” in a previous claim and did not know that consisted of his lower back.

Andrew Davis, 58, is accused of defrauding his employer’s insurer of $21,487 in workers’ compensation benefits. Department of Financial Services investigators say he made false statements about his medical history before he was hired by a Po’ Folks restaurant in Panama City. He had filed a claim for a lower back injury in 2016 while moving furniture while at work. A DFS report says Davis filed two previous comp claims, both of which were litigated. “Had Davis disclosed this information during his pre-employment questionnaire, Retail First Insurance would not have been exposed to this loss. Davis continued to hide these lies during the claim and medical treatment process,” the investigators’ report says, according to the newspaper. Davis reportedly told investigators that he knew only that he injured his tailbone in a previous claim and did not know it was considered part of the lower back. Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, long criticized by labor advocates for his opposition to some workers' compensation measures, was defeated in his bid for re-election Tuesday.

Andrew,Davis,1687,http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/NATIONAL-Laverne-Cox-activist-dies-Calif-trans-bill-UpStairs-Lounge/64170.html,"In Virginia, longtime LGBTQ-rights activist Guy M. Kinman Jr. has died at age 100, Richmond.com noted. He moved to Richmond in 1960 after serving as an Air Force chaplain during the Korean War and, before that, a Presbyterian minister throughout Illinois and Minnesota. Once in Richmond, he was married for 10 years before embracing his sexuality in his 50s. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to First Unitarian Universalist Church of Richmond, the Virginia Museum of History & Culture and Diversity Richmond, as well as the Guy M. Kinman Jr. scholarship within VCU's Department of Gerontology. Lambda Legal applauded AB 2119, which was signed into law by California Gov. Jerry Brown. His signing of the bill made California the first state in the union to explicitly guarantee gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth in the state's foster care system, a press release stated. Lambda Legal Counsel and Youth in Out-of-Home Care Project Director Currey Cook said, ""Across the United States, transgender and gender-nonconforming foster youth suffer greatly when their access to critical, affirming medical and mental health care is denied or delayed. California's leaders have made history by making it clear that among the most vulnerable children in their state are guaranteed access to the care and services they need."" The City of New Orleans is attempting to find the lost remains of Ferris LeBlanc, a World War II veteran who died in a 1973 fire that killed 32 people at a popular French Quarter gay bar called the UpStairs Lounge, ABC News reported. Five members of the Office of Mayor LaToya Cantrell were tasked with the search shortly after the release of an ABC News documentary that highlighted his family's increasingly desperate effort to locate his remains and return them to California for a proper military burial. The UpStairs Lounge fireintentionally set by an arsonist who was never arrested by local authoritieswas the largest mass murder of LGBTQ citizens in United States history until the Pulse nightclub massacre in 2016. LGBTQ activists say that Texas law-enforcement authorities misidentified one of four women they say was killed by Border Patrol supervisor Juan David Ortiz, making things worse for those who knew transgender woman Nikki Enriquez, KREM.com reported. ""Disregarding the victim's gender identity and misgendering them in news reports adds further insult to injury, compounding the tragedy by invalidating who the victims were,"" GLAAD said in a statement. Enriquez was killed only hours before Ortiz was apprehended by investigators in Laredo, Texas. Transgender Law Center and co-counsel from the law firm of King & Greisen LLP filed an amended complaint on behalf of Lindsay Saunders-Velez, a 20-year-old Black transgender woman incarcerated by the Colorado Department of Corrections ( CDOC ), a press release stated. The amended complaint adds a retaliation claim under 42 U.S.C., Section 1985, and alleges that CDOC has used harassment and intimidation in an attempt to dissuade Saunders-Velez from pursuing her case against them. The initial caseSaunders-Velez v. Colorado Department of Corrections, filed last year without an attorneychallenged her treatment in CDOC custody, including CDOC's policy of incarcerating transgender women in men's prisons. On National Voter Registration Day ( Sept. 25 ), the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) published a full-page ad ( which doubles as a poster ) in USA Today urging people to pledge to vote for equality in the upcoming midterms, an organizational press release noted. HRC called on voters in the ad to join the more than 10 million LGBTQ voters and 52 million ""Equality Voters"" in making a difference this November by checking their voter-registration status and making a plan to #TurnOUT and vote. HRC has already helped to register more than 28,000 voters. Also, HRC released a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen calling on her to take action ensuring the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) addresses the alarming rate of reported sexual abuse that LGBTQ people face while in ICE detention, another press release stated. LGBTQ people make up less than 1 percent of people in immigration detention, but account for 12 percent of the reported victims of sexual abuse and assault in ICE detentionmeaning that LGBTQ people are 97 times more likely to report being sexually abused in detention than non-LGBTQ people in the same conditions. President Donald Trump said that he consulted ""my generals"" before announcing via tweet last July a ban on transgender individuals serving in the militarybut a new batch of internal emails reinforced the view that the Pentagon was blindsided, Military.com noted. ""Everyone was caught flat-footed,"" Air Force Brig. Gen. Kyle Kremer, director of manpower and personnel for the Joint Chiefs, wrote to Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford and Air Force Gen. Paul Selva after Trump's tweets. ""These emails reveal that President Trump's reckless and impulsive tweets targeting our nation's brave transgender service members were as shocking and surprising to the Pentagon as they were to the rest of us,"" said American Military Partner Association President Ashley Broadway-Mack in a statement from Communications Director Nick Stone. The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California rejected the Trump-Pence Administration's latest attempt to implement its transgender military ban, denying a motion to dissolve the nationwide preliminary injunction previously issued in a lawsuit filed by Equality California and seven active duty service members and recruits seeking to join the military, a press release noted. ""Anyone willing to risk their life to protect our country should be treated fairly and with dignity and respect,"" said Equality California Executive Director Rick Zbur. ""As long as President Trump continues to double down on this unpatriotic and discriminatory ban, we'll continue to fight him with everything we've gotand we have a pretty good track record of winning."" A diverse coalition of social-justice organizations ( including Human Rights Campaign and UnidosUS, among others ) unveiled a new digital ad featuring singer-songwriter actor John Legend that urges viewers to contact their senators and tell them to reject the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to a press release from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. as well as The Leadership Conference. The digital ad was being released as Kavanaugh's nomination faced additional scrutiny because of sexual-assault allegations by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The ad is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geu4PGQrSwY&feature=youtu.be. A man who allegedly attacked a gay man died just hours later in a shootout with police, LGBTQ Nation reported. Alexander Carballido, 40, was being chased by Miami police after he allegedly committed a violent hate crime against a gay man; Carballido then pulled out an AK-47 assault rifle and started firing on over a dozen police officers who were pursuing him. A fitness model admitted to cops he tried to murder his roommate a few days after moving to New York to dance at a gay strip club, The New York Post reported. ""The guy tried to make moves on me, I told him no, then he said he'd shoot me so I had to defend myself,"" Geoffrey Tracy allegedly told police after he stabbed Gregory Kanczes 16 times. Kanczeswho was stabbed in the neck, chest and shouldersurvived the attack and was eventually released from Bellevue Hospital. Tracy is free on $500,000 bond. A mistake attributed to an oversight at Target Corp.'s website operations resulted in a handful of wordsincluding ""transgender,"" ""queer"" and ""Nazi""being stripped from some book descriptions on Target.com , StarTribune.com reported. The words were replaced with an asterisk or series of asterisks, even though they were not among a list of words the Minneapolis-based retailer would normally consider blocking, a spokeswoman said. Cael Keegan, author of the November release Lana and Lilly Wachowski, noticed the redactions and alerted his publishing company, the University of Illinois Press. Target said it was working with its staff and had corrected most of the book summaries. Despite losing the special mayoral election in June by 1.1 percentage points to London Breed, gay former state Sen. Mark Leno has ruled out challenging her in 2019 when she seeks a full, four-year term, The Bay Area Reporter revealed. Leno said, ""I have no plans to run at this time, adding that any serious challenger would need to soon enter the race. He declined to comment on how he felt his opponent in the race has been handling being mayor since her swearing-in ceremony in July. A school district in Chula Vista, California, has named its first-ever transgender homecoming queen, NewNowNext.com noted. Sweetwater Union High School students voted for Karl Cruz, 18, to wear the crownand she said the honor and warm reception were surprising. Principal Maribel Gavin said she wasn't as surprised by the outcome of the vote, but did offer she was ""extremely proud."" The Los Angeles City Council approved $850,000 to aid the construction of the LGBT Center's Anita May Rosenstein Campus, which will include affordable housing, homeless beds, and homelessness services in Hollywood, NBC Los Angeles reported. Los Angeles City Councilman David Ryu said, ""This campus will mean 98 units for seniors, 25 units for youth, and 100 beds for homeless youth with services, staff and street improvements surrounding the center. I firmly believe that when completed, the Anita May Rosenstein Campus will be the pride of Hollywood."" A Republican politician who was caught with an underage sex worker recevied 15 years in prison, LGBTQ Nation reported. In March 2017, Oklahoma state Sen. Ralph Shortey was arrested after he was found in a hotel room with a teenage boy. Text messages showed that he promised the teen ""money for spring break"" in exchange for ""sex stuff."" The San Francisco Youth Commission swore in a new nonbinary chair ( Bahlam Javier Vigil ) and transgender vice chair last week, and almost one-third of its members identify as LGBTQ, The Bay Area Reporter noted. The commission is a body of 17 youth between the ages of 12 and 23 who represent the city's 11 supervisorial districts. The youth commission had its first full meeting on Sept. 17 and will convene again Oct. 1. The Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) announced its endorsement of a record 28 pro-equality candidates in the Michigan state legislature, a press release noted. A few of the candidates include Stephanie Chang ( Senate District 1 ), Matt Koleszar ( House District 20 ) and Yousef Rabhi ( re-election to House District 53 ). Michigan is one of 30 states in the country that lacks explicit state-level protections for all LGBTQ people. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, is considering an ordinance that would make it illegal for any business to discriminate against any person based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, WKYC.com reported. The ordinance, co-sponsored by County Executive Armond Budish, is an addition to already existing protections for other groups ( such as race or religion ) already covered by state law. A ""Commission on Human Rights"" would also be set up to promote "" diversity, inclusion, and harmony"" in the area. The county's seat is Cleveland. The Queer Health Hackathon took place Sept. 21-23 at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the event's website stated. The event 'is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, mental or physical disability, physical appearance, neuro( a )typicality, religion, level of knowledge, level of experience, parental status, marital status, socioeconomic status or background, political affiliation, or any other attribute."" The Tegan & Sara Foundation ( TSF ), which backed the conference, aims to help LGBTQ girls and women. Ian Burumaunder fire for publishing an essay by a disgraced ex-Canadian radio staris no longer the editor of The New York Review of Books, The Huffington Post noted. Buruma had been on the defensive since the Review's Oct. 11 issue was published with the theme, ""The Fall of Men."" It featured a piece by Jian Ghomeshi, a former CBC radio personality ousted after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Buruma, in an interview with Slate after the Ghomeshi piece was published online, said he was ""no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation."" Bill Cosby's sexual-assault victim, Andrea Constand, declined at his sentencing hearing to rehash what the disgraced actor/comedian did to herbut her parents and sister unleashed on the former sitcom star, Page Six noted. Constand, who testified at length during two trials, kept her statement to Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill brief, saying Cosby's fate rested in his hands. A jury found that Cosby gave the former Temple University basketball administrator pills and sexually assaulted her after she slipped into a drugged-out stupor at his home in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, in 2004. Colin Kaepernick will join the likes of African-American icons as he will receive Harvard's highest honor in African and African-American studies in October, USA Today noted. Kaepernickalong with seven others, including comedian Dave Chapellewill receive the W.E.B. Du Bois medal ""in recognition of their contributions to African and African-American culture and the life of the mind."" Past award winners include Muhammad Ali and Maya Angelou. TLCin partnership with Redbook magazine and Love Is Louder, a project of The Jed Foundationgathered several influential advocates, celebs and industry executives for its second annual Give a Little Awards at the Park Hyatt hotel in New York City, a press release noted. This year's honorees were TLC star Jazz Jennings, TV personality/host Kelly Osbourne, Emmy Award-winning choreographer/actor/author Derek Hough, recording artist Jessie Chris and three national contest winners who are actively deploying various bullying prevention tactics in their communities: Kristen Caminiti ( Kindness Grows Here ), Dianne Grossman ( Mallory's Army ) and Jaylen Arnold ( Jaylens Challenge ). NiK Kacy, the founder and president of gender-free luxury brand NiK Kacy Footwear, is bringing the first Equality Fashion Week to Los Angeles in partnership with the newly renovated boutique hotel Montrose West Hollywood, a press release noted.

It’s claimed the palatial berth, where bearded Lloyd will roost during his new advisory role, is costing upwards of £350,000. Goldman insists the figure is less than £75,000 but either way it’s at odds with a recent expenses crackdown. One banker moans he had a claim rejected for a piece of fruit. Not a desperately happy ship, by all accounts. Barclays boss Jes Staley met with the Duke of York this week at Buckingham Palace, an opportunity no doubt for Jes to garner Andrew’s extensive business insight. The pair have a mutual friend in former investment banker and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who lobbied unsuccessfully for Jes to be made Barclays’s chief back in 2012 after Bob Diamond got canned. The job instead went to Antony Jenkins, dismissed by Epstein, not entirely groundlessly, as ‘an internal dweeb’. In-the-pink hedgie Crispin Odey remains scornful of David Cameron’s premiership, telling Financial News: ‘Once you met David, you realised he was going to do absolutely nothing. He was so unbrave.’ Will Dave bother to retaliate in his long overdue memoirs? They’re now rivalling the 55-year wait for Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, albeit without the anticipation. Debenhams’s retail chief Steven Cook yesterday appeared alongside his new menswear head Andrew Lepp, who warned journalists to expect an improvement at the ailing department store’s shelves in the coming months. Cook interjected: ‘Months? Month! Or you’re fired.’ He was joking of course. Or least we must assume. Outré Mr Cook has a shaved head, a Rasputin beard and that menacing look of a man who delights in strangling poultry. Comcast boss Brian Roberts is rumoured to be dropping by Sky’s headquarters today following his £30billion acquisition of the broadcaster. Certain pinko outlets have claimed the sprawling, West London estate is known as ‘Skyberia’. Oddly, nobody I know ever calls it that.

Sara,Burns,1684,https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/fredericton-shooter-s-case-adjourned-until-oct-22-1.4107060,"Live Now: CTV News Channel Advertisement FREDERICTON -- A Fredericton man accused of killing four people, including two city police officers, is due back in court next month after his case was adjourned Monday. Matthew Raymond, 48, faces four counts of murder in the Aug. 10 deaths of Const. Sara Burns, Const. Robb Costello, Donnie Robichaud and Bobbie Lee Wright. The slim, balding Raymond sat quietly in the courtroom during his brief appearance. Defence lawyer Nathan Gorham told the court he had just received a large volume of material and needed time to review it. ""We received some information from the prosecution. We are in the process of investigating the case further, reviewing the disclosure, and then making some meaningful decisions on how the case will proceed,"" Gorham said outside the court. ""I still expect there will be a not guilty plea at some point in the future."" Judge Julian Dixon set the matter to return to court on Oct. 22. The opportunity to enter pleas will come once the matter is sent to the Court of Queen's Bench. Members of the victims' families were among the people who filled the courtroom Monday. They left without speaking to reporters. The police officers and civilians were gunned down outside an apartment complex in the New Brunswick capital. Court documents say the incident ended after police shot the alleged gunman in the abdomen. Costello, 45, was a 20-year police veteran with four children, while Burns, 43, had been an officer for two years and was married with three children. Robichaud, 42, had three children and had recently entered into a relationship with 32-year-old Wright when they were killed. Matthew Vincent Raymond, charged with four counts of first degree murder, arrives at provincial court in Fredericton on Monday, Sept. 24, 2018. Two city police officers were among four people who died in a shooting in a residential area on the city's north side.

Michael,Gordon,1682,https://www.parkrecord.com/news/runaway-dump-truck-causes-wreck-in-park-city/,"September 25, 2018 A runaway dump truck on Marsac Avenue hit a pick-up truck near the Old Town roundabout Tuesday morning. The drivers of both trucks sustained injuries that were not life threatening. A runaway dump truck careened down Marsac Avenue, overturned and hit another vehicle near the Old Town roundabout Tuesday morning, closing the area to traffic for hours. Utah Highway Patrol trooper Michael Gordon said the truck was traveling north on Marsac Avenue when it lost its brakes on a downhill stretch. The driver veered into oncoming traffic to avoid hitting a vehicle, then swerved back to narrowly miss an oncoming bus. The truck overturned near the roundabout, crashing into a northbound pickup truck. The accident happened around 10 a.m., according to the Utah Department of Transportation. The drivers of both trucks were transported to a local hospital with injuries that were not life threatening, Gordon said. The section of Marsac Avenue stretching from Deer Valley to the Old Town roundabout carries a steep grade. Trucks with failing brakes have caused numerous accidents on that stretch of road over the years. In May of 2017, a runaway truck on Marsac Avenue crashed into a residence near the location of Tuesday's incident. There is a truck-escape lane on Marsac Avenue south of the roundabout. It was unclear whether the driver of the dump truck Tuesday had discovered the brake failure before reaching the ramp. ""It is an extremely dangerous situation,"" Gordon said in reference to runaway trucks. ""We encourage semi-truck drivers to keep up the maintenance on their brakes.""

Here’s how to create the perfect town plot Although I live in a town, my garden thinks it lives in the country, with its brambles and nettles and patches of rural shagginess. I like it this way, and so do the birds, insects and other creatures that live and breed in it. When I look out of the window, I want to see other beings going about their business in safety and comfort. For me, the garden is a place for them to live full time, and for me to visit for a while every day, to grow some ornamental plants and a few vegetables without causing too much upset. However, I realise that this approach is not for everyone.

Joel,Cutler,1668,http://www.thisweeknews.com/sports/20180922/football-uas-sass-suffers-collarbone-injury,"The Upper Arlington High School football team will begin OCC-Central Division play without its starting quarterback, and the Golden Bears might not have him for the rest of the season. Senior Sammy Sass suffered what coach Joel Cutler called a “significant” collarbone injury during the first quarter of UA’s 29-28 loss to Lancaster on Sept. 21, although he stopped short of saying it was broken and would not put a time frame on how long Sass might be out. “Without going into too much detail, Sammy has a significant collarbone injury and it doesn’t look good for the near future,” Cutler said Sept. 22. “It’s a tough blow.” Sass was injured at the end of a long run in the first quarter. Two Lancaster defensive backs sandwiched him near the goal line, causing the injury. “He was trying to get into the end zone and he was splitting the safeties when they went to tackle him. They both fell on his shoulders when he hit the turf,” Cutler said. Sass’ backup, junior Jacob Leve, completed four of eight passes for 56 yards against the Golden Gales. UA fell to 2-3 with the loss and will play host to Westland in its OCC-Central opener Sept. 28. Sass, who has completed 42 of 76 passes for 616 yards with seven touchdowns and three interceptions and has rushed for 155 yards and four touchdowns on 32 carries this season, also missed much of last baseball season because of a broken left thumb — on his non-throwing hand — suffered in April. Sass has committed to play baseball at Wright State. dpurpura@thisweeknews.com @ThisWeekDave © Copyright 2006-2018 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Wolff recently launched a new initiative, known as Workplace Financial Solutions, to provide corporate customers with benefits for their employees, including financial wellness, executive wealth management and other forms of benefit plan administration. The initiative is still in its early stages, but it is starting to gain traction. For instance, B of A has begun providing onsite financial services to employees of one of its large corporate customers in the technology industry. It also built the firm a customized mobile app. The move has attracted new customers to B of A’s retail bank, according to Wolff. “We have had great success in acquiring thousands of new clients for Bank of America, while helping our client provide much-needed financial products and solutions for its employee base,” she said.

""Ed and I have never seen ourselves as they kind of people who will move down to the warm weather and play bridge and tennis for the rest of our lives,"" Lane said. ""That was never going to work for us."" Lane sought out local classes for older adults at Berkshire Community College. Her husband, Ed, separately pursued his master's in business administration. Today, Lane not only takes classes at the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College, she is also a board member. Her husband, a former consulting actuary, now teaches finance and economics as an adjunct professor at other colleges. ""At the end of the day, you're having a glass of wine and preparing dinner,"" said Lane. ""And Ed's got his stories about his students and I've got my stories. It's really been wonderful for us."" For retirees who find themselves with time on their hands and a willingness to learn, taking classes or even going back to school full time may be an appealing option. Colleges and universities are meeting that demand with everything from dedicated lifelong learning programs to on campus living arrangements. Individuals living on a fixed income likely want to avoid the big tuition bills that can come with going back to school. Fortunately, there are programs designed for older and retired individuals that let you take classes for a fraction of the costs of today's tuition. The Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, which receive funding through the Bernard Osher Foundation, provide non-credit, non-graded courses aimed at adults ages 50 and up. Its network includes 122 college and university programs across the country. At Berkshire Community College's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, membership is $60 per year, and classes are $50 each. Like other Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the program offers scholarships for those who find those costs too steep. The school's program currently has 1,200 members with two full-time staff members. Its robust schedule — including 26 classes in the fall semester — relies heavily on the help of volunteers. The Pittsfield, Massachusetts, area, where the school is based, is a popular retirement destination for people who love culture and nature, according to Megan Whilden, executive director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College. That has drawn more of those residents to its classes, which are on everything from current events — such as contemporary gender roles, nuclear weapons and gerrymandering and the right to vote — to memoir writing and fly fishing. More from Personal Finance: Retirement isn't just a pipe dream. How to make it happen You need to save for retirement. But don't forget your dreams These countries are ahead of the US in retirement The program also offers day trips, such as previews of upcoming performances at the Tanglewood Music Center or tours of a local dairy farm. Many of the students are not your typical senior citizens, according to Whilden, who recalled seeing an 85-year-old woman in a Pussy Riot t-shirt during her first week on the job. ""It's good for blowing up stereotypes, for sure,"" Whilden said. Nancy Vale, 87, a professionally trained actress, has found that both teaching and taking classes through the Performing Arts Initiative at the Institute has enabled her to continue to put her acting skills to use. It has also helped her grow her social circle after her husband of 49 years, Michael, the actor who played the baker in Dunkin Donuts' ""Time to make the donuts"" commercials, died 10 years ago. ""There's always someone directing something or appearing in something or wanting to put heads together about a workshop or class,"" Vale said. ""I've made a lot of friends."" That support continues outside of the school, which helped to promote to the school community her role in a local production of ""The Vagina Monologues."" The lifelong learning model that many schools follow today was first created at The New School in New York City in 1962. Today, that program — called the Institute for Retired Professionals — continues to thrive. Annual membership costs $1,054, and gives participants access to up to three study groups and a regular course at the New School each semester at half price, plus other activities and special events. The program has about 300 students, with members ranging in age from their 50s to their 90s. Those members use their professional backgrounds — including areas such as human resources or finance — to help run the program. ""This is about the self-motivation of learning, being involved in an active learning community,"" said Mary Watson, executive dean of The New School's Schools of Public Engagement. The average tenure for members is 15 years. If students decide to discontinue their membership, they can convert to alumni members for a $25 lifetime fee. Like the Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes, the New School offers scholarships for those who have limited resources. Retirees who want to go back to school on a budget also have several other options to consider, according to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of research at Savingforcollege.com. Some colleges and universities offer senior citizen tuition waivers. In addition, many community colleges will let senior citizens audit classes for free, provided there is space available, Kantrowitz said. Companies that provide video lectures or online education programs may also be a low-budget option for learning new information. Retirees may also want to consider going back to work for a company such as Starbucks or Walmart to get access to the free tuition benefits they offer, Kantrowitz said. The good news for aspiring students: Any money you have left over in a 529 college savings account can be used to pay for classes, even if you're not pursuing a degree or certificate. ""Maybe you had a 529 plan that you set up for your children or grandchildren and there's money left over,"" said Kantrowitz. ""You can use it for your own education, even if you're not pursing a degree. ""It's great for continuing education classes,"" he added. Retirees who will spare no expense in pursuing a college experience may instead want to opt to live on campus. Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, is seeing demand for such accommodations. The university is adding a dorm building to its campus for senior residents. The building, which is scheduled to open in 2020, will include 252 independent living apartments and 52 health-care units. Individuals must be at least 62 to sign up to live there. So far, almost 90 percent of the units have been sold. Residents will have access to campus amenities, including an art museum, dog park, indoor pool, restaurants, spa and theater. But the biggest perk of all, according to Todd Hardy, managing director at Innovation Zones at ASU, will be the access to campus culture, including performing arts events in the dorm, and the ability to join the community themselves as students, teachers and mentors. ""The young folks learn more effectively when they're exposed to an older generation,"" Hardy said. ""The older generation thrives significantly because of exposure to the younger generation."" To live in the dorm, called Mirabella, residents pay a buy-in fee, which ranges from $378,500 for a one bedroom unit to $810,200 for a two-bedroom penthouse. When a resident dies, 85 percent of that fee is returned to their heirs. In addition, residents must also pay a monthly fee — which covers activities, dining, housekeeping, shuttles and utilities, as well as other costs — which ranges from $4,195 for a single person in a one bedroom unit to $5,570 for two people living in a penthouse suite. For many Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes across the country, the challenge is keeping up with demand from new students who want to participate. ""In the past couple of years, our growth has just exploded,"" Whilden said of Berkshire Community College's program. ""We've increased our membership by 30 percent — 12 percent just over the past year."" At Northwestern University's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, where students have access to courses on everything from art in America to how democracies die, membership has grown by 11 percent to 12 percent every year, said Kirsty Montgomery, director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Northwestern. In 2011, Northwestern's program had 800 members. Today, that total has climbed to 1,400. As a result, Montgomery said she rarely advertises the program outside of the college community because there is only so much growth the program can take. ""It's a good problem to have,"" she said. At Bismarck State College in North Dakota, the school's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute plans to grow to 500 members in the next couple of years, from 150 members today. That target is in keeping with the area's growing retirement community, said Bismarck State College President Dr. Larry Skogen. Skogen, who is also a historian, will be teaching his own course this fall on the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848 as a prelude to the Civil War. But the biggest takeaways from the programs are the social connections that the students establish, according to Norma Clippard, director of the Osher Institute at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Vanderbilt's program includes a steel drum band, complete with a band camp, and classes on astronomy and American popular music. For many retirees, this has been life changing, Clippard said, and has let them find new purpose in retirement. Grandparents sometimes run into their own grandchildren — and fellow students — on campus, while other students have met their significant others in class. ""These classes have been a life saver for me, and I've heard a lot of other members say the same thing,"" said Kathy Garthwaite, who currently serves as advisory board president of Vanderbilt's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Garthwaite, 63, found the program after an unexpected early retirement led her to become ""bored to death."" Attending the classes has changed her life – and the lives of others – for the better, she said. ""People said they were depressed and then they started to come to classes and started to get involved and made new friends,"" Garthwaite said. ""It has made all the difference in their lives.""

Jane Lynch fell down a rabbit hole of nostalgia with PeopleTV’s Couch Surfing host Lola Ogunnaike, and the two fell on The Fugitive. Lynch, soon to be seen (excuse us, heard) in Disney’s Ralph Breaks the Internet, shared some behind-the-scenes stories about her time working with Harrison Ford — including how Ford didn’t care for how their scene had been written. “He didn’t like the scene as it was written,” she recalled. “And it was raining outside and he took me underneath his umbrella, we went to his trailer, and we worked it out, we worked the scene out. Like, ‘You say this and then I’ll say that, and then I’ll say this and you say that.'” Released in 1993 and directed by Andrew Davis, The Fugitive starred Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble, a man on a mission to find his wife’s killer after he was framed for the crime.

MIKE MATHISON/The News-Enterprise John Hardin's Darion Davis gains yardage after one of this six receptions during the second half of Friday's 15-9 Bulldogs' victory. MIKE MATHISON/The News-Enterprise John Hardin coach Chris Engstrand previewed the tussle with visiting Meade County as a fight in a phone booth. He wasn’t wrong. The Bulldogs held the Green Wave to three points on back-to-back trips inside the 10-yard line and escaped with a 15-9 battle. “That was very important,” John Hardin linebacker Navash Daley said about keeping Meade County out of the end zone to start the second half. “We stayed disciplined. We had great coaching by Coach (Greg) Goodman and we executed very well. I feel like this game brought us together and showed us what we can do on the defensive side of the ball.” Meade County had a second-and-goal at the 1 the first time and lost possession via fumble that the Bulldogs’ Cameron Brown recovered. The Green Wave had first-and-goal at the 10 on the next drive and came away with a 25-yard field goal by Mason Craycroft for a 9-7 lead with 4:48 left in the third period. “That (not scoring to start the second half) and the fumble on the goal line were probably our two biggest defensive stands of the night,” Engstrand said. “Just to keep them from hitting paydirt was big for us.” The two long drives were at the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half. “We have a saying, it’s pretty normal, but ‘bend, don’t break,’” John Hardin defensive lineman Dominic Hope said. “If we can hold them to a field goal, we’re gonna hold them to a field goal. We did that tonight. We didn’t allow them to score a touchdown on our defense. “They were trying to run it away from some of our good linemen. We switch around people on the line. Every game we play different positions. I never play just tackle or just end. We all get switched around and find that sweet spot and what works. The sweet spot changes every game, depending on what team we’re playing.” John Hardin’s defense shut down Meade County (2-4) the rest of the evening. The Green Wave had 24 snaps for 142 yards on those two drives and 32 yards on 26 plays everywhere else. “Film study and great coaching,” Daley said. “We couldn’t get it in the end zone,” veteran Meade County coach Larry Mofield said. “You’ve got to be able to get it in the end zone. You can’t kick field goals, although we did a nice job of taking the lead. We couldn’t run the football. That was on me because I think I talked Coach Kirk into throwing the ball too much. We probably should have stuck with the running game a little bit. That one’s on me.” The Bulldogs (4-2) held the visitors to back-to-back three-and-outs after the field goal and took over possession at the 45-yard line. They went on a 14-play, 55-yard drive in which they converted four third downs and one fourth down and took 4:22 off the clock. Will Cason scored from the 6 and a Russell pass to Andrew Davis was good for the two-point conversion and John Hardin held the 15-9 lead with 5:35 left in the game. “They did a good job tonight. You got to give Coach Engstrand and those kids credit,” Mofield said. “They really find a way to come back and win football games. They’re playing well right now. They’re pretty hot. If they stick together, they’re gonna make a lot of noise. “They spread you out and do a nice job with the screens. They’re spacing is good and are able to run the ball. Their quarterback runs the offense well and they’ve got a lot of nice athletes. I thought they did a good job up front, too on both sides of the ball, but especially on the defensive line.” Meade County made it 6-0 when Mason Burnett picked off a Justin Russell offering and took it back 50 yards just 77 seconds into the game. The 2-point conversion run was stopped. “They came out fired up and we came out a little on our heels,” Engstrand said. “But we knuckled down when we needed to.” John Hardin made it 7-6 at the 7:23 mark of the second period when Russell found senior Darion Davis on fourth-and-goal from the 7 one player after a Davis run was stopped for a six-yard loss. “The defense, I thought, played well all night and did a good job containing,” Mofield said. “Then they got us in a three-man front and started running the ball. They got us in a lot of second-and-short, third-and-short opportunities, which is pretty easy to call plays.” Meade County was short on a fourth-down run on its next possession and then threw three straight incomplete passes to turn the ball over with 90 seconds left in the game. “(The last two weeks) tells our defense that we can hang with the gonna ones, that we can hang with the big boys,” Hope said. “It doesn’t matter that we’re small, we’re still gonna pop you.” Russell finished 13-for-27 for 119 yards. Six receptions for 67 yards and a score went to Davis. The Bulldogs ran the ball 24 times for 117 yards. “We had them behind the chains most of the night,” Engstrand said. “And that matters, especially with a team that’s so run heavy. We can pretty much dictate what they’re gonna do at that point.” The Green Wave had 114 yards on the ground. Senior Nathan Holley led the way with 62 yards on 12 carries. He was followed by junior Donovan Matthews, who had seven carries for 45 yards. Quarterback Trent Mofield was 4-for-16 for 46 yards. He was 1-for-9 for minus-1 yard in the second half. “We’ve got to find a way to keep our bunch together,” Coach Mofield said. “We’ve lost a bunch of tough ones. It’s gonna check our resiliency. I think our kids are frustrated at losing. These are the times that try you. If you can come through these because this is a lot like life. There’s gonna be a lot worse that happens to us that losing football games. Getting through moments like these will set the course of us down the road I think.” The Bulldogs have won three in a row and have given up 32 points in those contests. “I feel we’re set well going into district play,” Daley said.

Phillip,Frost,1663,https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/09/22/1574592/0/en/Pomerantz-Law-Firm-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Class-Action-against-OPKO-Health-Inc-and-Certain-Officers-OPK.html,"NEW YORK, Sept. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Papa John’s International, Inc. (“OPKO” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: OPK) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, and index under 18-cv-23924, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons other than Defendants who purchased or otherwise acquired OPKO securities between September 26, 2013 and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking to recover damages caused by Defendants’ violations of the federal securities laws and to pursue remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against the Company and certain of its top officials. If you are a shareholder who purchased OPKO securities between September 26, 2013, and September 7, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until November 13, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased. [Click here to join this class action] OPKO purports to be a healthcare company that engages in the diagnostics and pharmaceuticals business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose that: (i) OPKO and its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Phillip Frost (“Frost”), were participants in a “pump-and-dump” scheme designed, in part, to artificially inflate the price of various stocks, allowing Defendant Frost, among others, to reap millions of dollars in unlawful profits; and (ii) as a result, OPKO’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On September 7, 2018, the SEC issued a press release entitled “SEC Charges Microcap Fraudsters for Roles in Lucrative Market Manipulation Schemes”. The press release stated, in part, that the SEC had “charged a group of 10 individuals and 10 associated entities for their participation in long-running fraudulent schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock.” The press release named both OPKO and Frost as defendants. Following this news, OPKO’s stock price fell $1.01 per share, or more than 18%, before NASDAQ halted the trading of OPKO stock on September 7, 2018, at 2:34 p.m. EDT at $4.58 per share. The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com CONTACT:Robert S.

Will Cason scored from the 6 and a Russell pass to Andrew Davis was good for the two-point conversion and John Hardin held a 15-9 lead with 5:35 left in the game. Meade County was short on a fourth-down run on its next possession and then threw three straight incomplete passes to turn the ball over with 90 seconds left in the game.

Sep 21, 2018 @ 9:54 am By Bruce Kelly Dr. Phillip Frost, who was charged this month with fraud, said Thursday evening that he was retiring as non-executive chairman of Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. Dr. Frost and nine other individuals were charged Sept. 7 in a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit with participating in ""long running schemes that generated over $27 million from unlawful stock sales and caused significant harm to retail investors who were left holding virtually worthless stock,"" according to the SEC's complaint. Dr. Frost is the largest shareholder in Ladenburg Thalman, controlling about 36% of the broker-dealer's shares Along with his role at Ladenburg Thalmann, Dr. Frost is a well-known biotech investor in South Florida. Since March 2007, he has served as chairman of the board and CEO of OPKO Health Inc., a multinational biopharmaceutical and diagnostics company, according to Ladenburg Thalmann's annual proxy statement. Ladenburg Thalmann is one of the leading networks of independent broker-dealers. Its B-Ds include Securities America Inc., Triad Advisors, Investacorp Inc. and Securities Service Network, which are home to 4,300 independent contractor brokers and financial advisers. Richard Lampen, Ladenburg Thalmann's CEO and president, will replace Dr. Frost as chairman. Adam Malamed, the firm's executive vice president and chief operating officer, will join the firm's board of directors. ""I have decided to retire from the Ladenburg board and will concentrate my efforts on OPKO Health and my philanthropic interests,"" Dr. Frost said in a statement, making no mention of the SEC's fraud charges. ""As a long-term shareholder, I am confident in Ladenburg's outlook and look forward to its continued growth and success."" ""Ladenburg would not be where it is today without [Dr. Frost's] many contributions, and his presence in the boardroom will be sorely missed,"" Mr. Lampen said. Some had been calling for Dr. Frost to resign, saying that the reputational risk he created for Ladenburg would only increase the longer he stayed with the firm. The SEC's complaint describes in elaborate detail the efforts that Dr. Frost and his associates allegedly made to pull off what the SEC called ""classic pump-and-dump schemes."" ""From 2013 to 2018, a group of prolific South Florida-based microcap fraudsters led by Barry Honig manipulated the share price of the stock of three companies in classic pump-and-dump schemes,"" the SEC alleges. ""Miami biotech billionaire Phillip Frost allegedly participated in two of these three schemes."" The companies were not identified by the SEC. Mr. Honig ""allegedly orchestrated the acquisition of large quantities of the issuer's stock at steep discounts, and after securing a substantial ownership interest in the companies, Honig and his associates engaged in illegal promotional activity and manipulative trading to artificially boost each issuer's stock price and to give the stock the appearance of active trading volume,"" according to the SEC. Mr. Honig and his associates then dumped their shares into the inflated market, reaping millions of dollars at the expense of unsuspecting investors, the SEC alleges.

Earlier this month, Frost was named in a securities fraud complaint brought by the SEC. Frost has denied the allegations. “I have decided to retire from the Ladenburg Board and will concentrate my efforts on OPKO Health and my philanthropic interests,” Frost said in a statement. “As a long-term shareholder, I am confident in Ladenburg’s outlook and look forward to its continued growth and success.” Ladenburg’s board announced CEO Richard Lampen as its new chairman.

Sign Up Junior Minister of Health Dr Karen Cummings on Tuesday visited villages within the Mabaruma sub-region to ensure that measures are in place to protect the population against any risk of outbreaks that can result from the influx of Venezuelan migrants. Cummings’ visit, according to a Department of Public Information (DPI) report, was said to also have been aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the health services being offered to the migrants. Cummings explained that because of the porous nature of Guyana’s border, it is important that Region One be prepared and equipped to address any eventualities that can arise from the continuous arrival of Venezuelan migrants. Furthermore, she noted that measures have to be implemented to protect the local community, especially women and children, from deadly illnesses and diseases. The DPI report revealed that during her trip the minister engaged the Mayor of Mabaruma, Henry Smith, and Mabaruma’s Town Clerk, Barrington Wade. The officials reportedly related that the town council is collaborating with an established task force to house and provide for the migrants. It was noted that at Khan’s Hill, Mabaruma, where the Minister met the Mayor and Town Clerk, approximately 103 indigenous Venezuelans have settled there. In Smyth’s Creek, which is located along the Barima River, there has been a reported increase in the arrival of Venezuelan migrants who are seeking refuge, shelter and food. The last recorded number of persons in this area was 80. The influx of migrants within the community has led to the construction of sheds, likened to benabs, where the families are being housed. Because the migrants are mainly of Warrau heritage, the town council has been exploring the possibility of developing five acres of Warrau lands to assist them, as the migrants are currently occupying residential lands and reserve spaces. Minister of Foreign Affairs Carl Greenidge recently said Guyana is intent on working with its neighbours and the international community to monitor and manage the health of Venezuelan migrants so that any possible pandemic can be nipped in the bud. Currently, authorities are working to find all migrants so that they can be screened and registered since at this stage the Latin American and Caribbean Region views the prosecution of Venezuelans for immigration offences “dysfunctional and insensitive.” Greenidge repeatedly stressed that government is working to find migrants and establish their status so that they can get the necessary health care.

The growth equity investment fund of Google parent company Alphabet, CapitalG, led this round of Convoy’s capital raise, bringing the digital brokerage’s total funding raised so far to more than $265 million. FreightWaves Associate Editor John Paul Hampstead spoke to Andrew Davis, VP and Equity Investment Analyst at T. Rowe Price about the deal. “Our view is they’ve made a dramatic amount of progress in terms of the business model and proof points,” said Davis told Hampstead. “I’ve seen their ability to take data and create analytics around it at a pace and confidence interval that I think is unique.” Convoy was not looking for the most money at the highest valuation during this round. Instead, they sought out people who had the right combination of capital, partnership and guidance, according to Davis. “In five years, Convoy will be demonstrably bigger. Their ability to scale from where they are right now is really exceptional,” Davis concluded.

(Bloomberg) Delivery of new truck orders is expected to continue ramping up in the coming months, but J.D. Power Senior Analyst Chris Visser expects the current new truck cycle will remain hot for the for at least two more quarters. While the record-breaking order rate reflects more build slot reservations than legitimate need, deliveries are still below their predicted peak. “The last time orders dramatically increased over a multi-month period was late 2014, with orders peaking at just under 46,000 units. In following months, actual deliveries increased to slightly over 25,000, then delivered rather quickly,” the report reads. “Today, orders have crested 52,000 units, but deliveries are struggling to hit 23,000. If we assume economic and regulatory factors have created a need for roughly 50 percent more trucks today versus 2014, actual need should be 37,500 units per month.” Those calculations mean OEMs still have a significant amount of headroom before they begin meeting demand. J.D. Power is forecasting more new truck deliveries in the coming months, but demand is still expected to outpace supply into the second quarter of 2019. Hammer down, everyone!

Andrew,Davis,1656,https://www.freightwaves.com/news/convoy-raises-185m-reaches-unicorn-valuation,"#1 source for navigating the Freight Markets News that will impact the freight industry, from technology, to regulatory changes, to economic developments. Convoy’s founders: CTO Grant Goodale and CEO Dan Lewis. (Photo: Convoy) The growth equity investment fund of Google parent company Alphabet, CapitalG, led this round of Convoy’s capital raise, bringing the digital brokerage’s total funding raised so far to more than $265M and a valuation exceeding $1B. As part of the deal, David Lawee from CapitalG will join Convoy’s board of directors. Silicon Valley money has been keen on Convoy for a long time, but what interested us most about the deal was the participation of traditional investment and asset management firms, notably T. Rowe Price Associates and Lone Pine Capital. Previous investors in Convoy Greylock Partners and Y Combinator also participated in the round. FreightWaves spoke to Andrew Davis, VP and Equity Investment Analyst at T. Rowe Price about the deal. We were particularly interested in how T. Rowe Price’s thesis on Convoy had evolved over time. “This is a deal that was organic,” said Davis. “I met [Convoy CEO] Dan Lewis 18 months ago, prior to the last round, but historically we’re not a VC firm. What we’re typically doing is investing in companies that have potential to become really really large over time: they’re solving big problems and they’re companies that can become multibillion dollar companies over time, with the possibility of going public. We discussed things last year, but at that stage it didn’t make sense for us to step in, it was a little early.” “Our view is they’ve made a dramatic amount of progress in terms of the business model and proof points,” said Davis. “I’ve seen their ability to take data and create analytics around it at a pace and confidence interval that I think is unique.” Davis said in this round, Convoy did not go out looking for the most money at the highest valuation, but was looking for people who had the right combination of capital, partnership, and guidance. T. Rowe Price is already a major investor in publicly-traded transportation companies like C.H. Robinson and Old Dominion. “They were interviewing us as much as we were interviewing them,” said Davis. Still, he continued, Convoy brought a rich tech valuation rather than a logistics company valuation. Davis said that there will always be demand in the marketplace for equity in a fast-growing company with a great management team trying to solve a big problem, “especially in a slow growth world like we’re in now.” “To be very candid, freight matching is a math problem, and math problems, especially in a network, are all solved by Metcalfe’s law, and in this context, we feel that Convoy has the strategy and the ability to execute because they’re looking at the problem in a different way,” Davis explained. But what makes Convoy truly different, and why is a company commonly referred to as a digital brokerage calling itself a “tech-enabled trucking network” in its new press release? “Convoy built a system to solve the ultimate problem—how to eliminate waste from supply chains. They’re not just trying to capture arbitrage like a traditional broker. If you create liquidity and drive down waste, freight will naturally find you,” Davis said. Davis cited Dan Lewis’ experience at Amazon, and the fact that many of his senior team came from other West Coast tech companies. Initially, Davis said, that could have been a headwind for a logistics company, but he now feels that Convoy’s tech-first approach has been proven out. “Eighteen months ago I wasn’t quite sure they were going to get there. At the pace Convoy’s progressing now, they have the chance to be a very large—I don’t want to use the word broker—a very large marketplace company,” Davis pointed out. Convoy’s margins have improved as its lanes matured and reached density, and the company has been able to show how quickly it can bring new products to its shipper customers and carrier partners, learning from its own data at a pace that makes it feel more like a Silicon Valley tech company than a Chicago-based brokerage. “In five years, Convoy will be demonstrably bigger. Their ability to scale from where they are right now is really exceptional,” Davis concluded. Correction: a previous version of this article stated that Convoy ‘was now bigger than Echo Global Logistics’. That statement was misleading because while Convoy’s valuation is now roughly equivalent to Echo’s market cap, Echo’s market share and overall revenues exceed Convoy’s. Founded in 2015, Avenger Logistics is growing so fast that, according to their estimates, they’ll crack Inc. 5000’s 2019 top ten in their first year of eligibility.

Andrew,Davis,1656,https://www.newsweek.com/valkyria-chronicles-4-sega-interview-localization-1133340,"War is hell. Yet, in the case of Sega’s cult-fave tactical RPG series, Valkyria Chronicles, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s pretty darn gorgeous, too. Set in a fictionalized fantasy riff on Second World War Europe, Valkyria Chronicles 4 puts you in the shoes of Commander Claude Wallace of the Atlantic Federation, a soldier determined to bring down the Eastern Imperial Alliance. At first glance, the game’s distinctive anime-meets-WWII watercolor art style is deceptively sweet and charming. Add an adorable cap-clad shiba inu medic to the mix, and it’s tempting to assume the strategic combat on offer will be a walk in the park. That would be a mistake. For all their superficial loveliness, the Valkyria Chronicles games demand complex strategy and a well-honed knack for changing tactics on the fly. Left your sniper out of cover when you finish your turn? She’s toast. Attempted to plow straight toward your objective using a tank? You’ve left your flank exposed: game over. This latest installment aims to enrich the series’ hallmark combat by adding a new troop class and last-ditch heroics for units on the brink of death, as well as allowing the relationships between soldiers to exert greater influence on the battlefield. Newsweek spoke with Sega of America Associate Localization Producer Andrew Davis about the game’s story, new enhancements to combat and the process of bringing the title to Western audiences. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity. How does Valkyria Chronicles 4 build upon the previous installments of the series? There hasn’t been a mainline Valkyria Chronicles game on consoles since the original premiered in 2008, so getting back to the roots of the series was one of the explicit design goals—this is why the classes and map sizes reflect the first game rather than the handheld PSP sequels. However, there are a number of significant advances introduced in Valkyria Chronicles 4, not least of which is the new Grenadier class. The mortars these soldiers carry give you a new option for long-range attacks, but since the Empire has their own Grenadiers as well, you’ll have to watch for their defensive fire. It’s now a lot more difficult to, say, rush the enemy with a Scout when Grenadiers are raining explosions down on you from all sides. The charming aesthetics of ""Valkyria Chronicles 4"" belie the series' challenging, strategy-driven gameplay. Sega How closely related is the story to the original Valkyria Chronicles? Six of the first game’s characters are playable through DLC, but do the connections extend beyond that? The new game’s story takes place at the same time as the original Valkyria Chronicles, so it’s the same war and the same continent, but set hundreds of miles apart. It’s a self-contained story, so you don’t need to know anything about the first game’s story—all the required background info on the war is explained early on. There are a few moments in the storyline fans of the original will recognize as references to VC1 events, which helps tie the two games together. And of course, as you mentioned, there is an optional crossover DLC chapter where the VC4 heroes take a train back to Gallia and meet a familiar ragtag crew... Ragnarok the shibe medic has been featured pretty prominently in the game’s promotional materials—and he’s so darn cute! How does he fit in with the rest of the cast, and is there a reason he has such a dramatic mythological name? Isn’t he such a good boy? (Yes, he is.) We created animal mascots for the older titles, but they ended up kind of weird and high-concept—a pig with wings, because why not? This time around, we went with something a little simpler. “Dogs are actually part of war in real life, so maybe just ... a dog?” It turned out that’s just what we needed. Sometimes simple is best.Ragnarok, or “Rags” as the cast calls him, is a loyal friend to all of Squad E, and while he may not contribute much to the dialogue, he’s present in a few key scenes in the story, especially those involving certain characters who’ve particularly bonded with him. His striking name is actually of a piece with a number of other names in the game drawn from Norse mythology, including a mysterious wolf called Fenrir. Could you tell me a bit about the Brave system and how it impacts the gameplay experience? The Brave system, or “Last Stand,” as it’s called in the English version, is another one of the new tweaks added to the BLiTZ battle system in Valkyria Chronicles 4. As in the previous games, if a unit’s health is reduced to zero, they collapse in critical condition, and will permanently die if they’re not quickly evacuated. However, now there’s a certain random chance that they pull themselves to their feet for one last action, giving you a couple seconds to pick an option. You might “Stand Up” and take one last move, staggering closer to your comrades for easier evac. You might “Counterattack,” taking revenge on your killer before you fall. Or you might “Inspire” your comrades with your sacrifice, giving a stat boost to the nearest comrade and an extra Command Point to your squad.It’s a nicely dramatic way to take the edge off the loss of a unit—you're still doomed, but you at least get one last choice to make before you fall. Raz, one of your companions in ""Valkyria Chronicles 4,"" takes on an Imperial Scout. Sega Why is permadeath an important aspect of the game? Will the overall story change if particular characters die? Do character deaths affect the game’s difficulty? The colorful cast of characters is one of the key assets of the game. Sure, there’s the central core group of old friends around whom the main story is centered, but beyond that, there are more than 40 Federation soldiers you can recruit into Squad E, each with a name, face, personality and life history. This actually has an effect on gameplay, as each character comes with their own personal Potentials (quirks) that will give them bonuses or debuffs in certain battle conditions.Because of this, you’ll get to know your squad members as more than just statistics, and if you lose one and can’t save them in time, you’ll just have to mourn them and press onward. Sure, sometimes you can reload and try to save them, but your first time through the game we encourage you to accept the losses and move forward. This is, after all, the cost of war. Characters who are central to the main story cannot permanently die—that would be a bit too chaotic, I’m afraid—but side characters sometimes show up in story scenes, and if they’re dead, the game properly reflects that by using a different character. Losing a character means you can no longer depend on their particular stats and perks, but there’s a wide roster you can choose from instead, and even if you manage to send most of your squad to their deaths, the Federation will supply you with generic soldiers so that you can still complete the story. How is localizing for voiceover dialogue different than text? For timed lines, are there instances where you’ll sacrifice synchronicity to retain the spirit of the dialogue? Oh my, yes, voiceover dialogue is a very different concern from unvoiced text. You might have something that looks brilliant on the page, and then when a voice actor stumbles their way through it, you realize it’s an awkward jumble of words that needs a total rewrite. Timed lines, where you have to match the timing of the original Japanese, is an even harsher limitation. We generally have to keep strictly to the original timing, since if we go too short, it results in awkward silences, and if we go too long, we risk the characters talking over each other or themselves, which is worse!However, even if we have to rewrite the line, we strive to maintain the same type of drama and characterization as the original script. There’s a certain art to it, gracefully padding out a line that’s too short, or carving nonessential phrases out of a line that’s too long, sometimes leaving certain information implied or moving it to a nearby line. Once you’ve learned how to do it, the constraints actually become a kind of liberation, as they make a lot of the decisions for you as the editor, letting you focus on the dialogue’s key information while keeping everyone acting in character. Protagonist Claude and tank driver Miles talk during a cutscene in ""Valkyria Chronicles 4."" Sega This game has a FIGS (French / Italian / German / Spanish) localization as well. Is that process handled by your team, or another team elsewhere? Does it happen simultaneously with the English localization or is it entirely separate? Our office at Atlus USA / SEGA of America is only equipped to handle Japanese-to-English localization, so for anything beyond that, we rely on outside partners. In the case of Valkyria Chronicles 4, we enlisted our handsome friends at SEGA Europe to spearhead the FIGS localizations. These are based off the English scripts, simply because it’s much, much easier to find capable translators from English into other European languages than it is to find professionals who specialize in translating directly from Japanese into those. However, this does affect the localization schedule, as you essentially have to plan for two full localization cycles one right after the other. This is one reason it can be challenging to launch a Japan-developed title simultaneously with the Japanese release date, and in this case, we’re presenting our EFIGS version to the public about six months after the Japanese PS4 release.Was anything about the game’s story or characters’ personalities tweaked in the English localization?We didn’t do anything to overtly alter the story or characterizations in the Western release, but some speech patterns did bend in a slightly different direction. Raz’s Japanese voice actor gives him a stereotypical Japanese “juvenile delinquent” affect, while in the English version, his voice is less gravelly; instead, we got the crass nature of his personality across in the way he words things, often four letters at a time. Kai, too, has speech patterns in Japanese that are more commonly associated with men than women. English doesn’t really have an explicit equivalent to this, but we kept her gruff, no-nonsense attitude.Likewise, Imperial general and recurring foe Klaus Walz has a verbal tic we debated for a while. He’s a notorious playboy and womanizer, and when he realizes Squad E’s Claude Wallace is a worthy opponent, he pursues his military rival as he would a romantic conquest, calling him (in Japanified French) his “femme fatale.” The French phrase wound up sounding awkward in English, and it didn’t quite convey the excitement Klaus clearly feels about meeting a deserving challenger, so we ultimately localized this as “my soulmate.” If you play with the Japanese voiceover (available on all platforms!), you can still hear the Japanese actor say “femme fatale!” Valkyria Chronicles 4 comes to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Steam on Sept. 25. © 2018 Newsweek",0.0,3.0,0.21428571428571427,0.0,1020357,0.7657225643508048,0,2018-11-08 13:03:09,True,Priority Mail

Michael,Gordon,1655,https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/09/21/no-panic-from-james-tedesco-despite-slow-start-at-roosters/,"ROOSTERS In-form Roosters fullback James Tedesco admits it was a struggle to find his place in a new team at the start of the year but a focus on supporting through the middle of the ruck triggered his explosive Origin campaign and late-season form surge. The Roosters spent big in an effort to capitalise on their premiership window, signing Storm, Maroons and Kangaroos veteran Cooper Cronk in place of Mitchell Pearce and luring Tedesco from the Wests Tigers. It is hard to win a premiership without an elite fullback (Ben Barba, Billy Slater, Lachlan Coote, Greg Inglis and Anthony Minichiello are the past five premiership-winning No.1s). Since the retirement of Minichiello and departure of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck the Roosters have got by with a combination of veteran Michael Gordon and a rotating cast including Connor Watson, Blake Ferguson and Latrell Mitchell (who is a far better centre now than he was a fullback in 2016). The recruitment of Tedesco ensured star billing in the key spot but his stint started sluggishly; the team opened with a 4-4 record and a lack of cohesion among the play-makers – also including Luke Keary and Jake Friend – was becoming a growing concern. Speaking to NRL.com in the lead-up to the blockbuster preliminary final against old rivals South Sydney in what will be the last match at Allianz Stadium, he admitted to struggling early but a focus on his defence and supporting the ruck had turned things around. ""Coming into this team it was hard to find my role and what I was best at,"" he said. ""It's obviously a different side to what we had at the Tigers. Those first six to eight rounds I was still trying to find my feet and what was best for me and the team. ""After that Origin period I found my strength was around the ruck and with our powerful ball runners that's when I can find a lot of space and run the ball well and it felt like that's just natural now, whenever the boys are taking it forward I'm supporting and getting off the back of them. ""That's when I think we're playing our best footy as a team and obviously the combinations with Cooper and Keary and Friendy, that's just spending time with them all and practising at training."" A rejig of the side's attacking plans during the representative round break after a 24-8 Anzac Day loss to the Dragons was the catalyst for a form spike that helped Tedesco fend off a challenge from Manly custodian and eventual Blues winger Tom Trbojevic for the sky blue No.1 jersey. Tedesco produced one of Origin's great individual performances in a dominant game-one win and was unlucky not to receive the player of the series award after starring in all three games. He said the series boosted his confidence through the second half of the season and those performances, like his recent club form, were based on capitalising on space through the middle. ""Playing good footy at that elite level obviously brings a bit of self confidence but I just found my way here at the Roosters, it took its time,"" he said. ""Even through Origin I was through the middle and that's when I was playing my best footy as well."" Tedesco does not believe he's a significantly different player in attack now to what he was at the Tigers, rather he simply has a different role. It is his work off the ball where Tedesco feels he has genuinely improved as a player. ""Defensively I'm definitely better,"" he said, crediting the teaching of coach Trent Robinson and Minichiello. Minichiello is not only the club's most recent premiership-winning fullback and a Roosters legend, he is also a former Italy World Cup teammate of Tedesco. ""Defensive line organisation and talk and getting across the back has definitely been an improvement because Robbo puts a bit of emphasis on that which definitely helps my game and the team,"" Tedesco added. ""Attack-wise, I don't think much has changed as a player. At the Tigers, we had a different team. At the Roosters I've had to play a different role. ""I'm running more metres here and supporting our boys a lot more. I'm trying to develop all areas and become a complete player."" The stats bear out Tedesco's suggestion that his running has increased; he averages 193 metres gained per match which is easily the best of his career. That's up from 175 at the Tigers last year and his previous season-best of 152 in 2015. The retirement of Billy Slater and cheekbone surgery for Trbojevic look to have reduced the race for the green and gold for the two end-of-season Tests against New Zealand and Tonga to just Tedesco and in-form Sharks custodian Valentine Holmes. Greg Inglis is playing centre, Kalyn Ponga is out of contention after finishing the season early due to injury and Darius Boyd has also retired from rep footy. ""I haven't been trying to think about it too much,"" Tedesco said of a possible Test debut. ""I know if I'm playing good footy in the finals and for the Roosters that opportunity will come and I'm hoping I do play well and it does come. ""If I do play well and it does come it will be a dream to play for I haven't wanted to think about it too much because I know if I do that I'll go off my game."" Tommy who?

Michael,Gordon,1655,https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/business/366873/nz-s-economic-growth-picks-up,"The economy has grown faster than expected in the second quarter driven by strong activity in agricultural and service industries and countering gloomy forecasts because of the fall in business and consumer confidence. Photo: 123RF Gross domestic product (GDP), the main economic barometer, rose 1 percent for the three months ended June, double the rate for the first quarter. It was the strongest quarterly growth in two years. The annual rate picked up slightly to 2.8 percent on the same time last year. ""Once again service industries led growth,"" Stats NZ national accounts senior manager Susan Hollows said. ""Goods-producing and primary industries also saw rises this quarter."" The largest contribution to growth came from agriculture, up 4.1 percent, with a rebound in dairy production, higher forestry harvesting and processing of cattle with Mycobacterium bovis that have been culled. House building also lifted along with activity in the services sector such as business spending, telecommunications, and tourism. There was a slight fall in business investment. The numbers were above expectations, and will mean the Reserve Bank will be comfortable to keep interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future. The New Zealand dollar rose on the news, gaining more than a quarter of a cent to 66.4 US cents. ""Not only was the overall result stronger than expected, the details were more encouraging for the economy's growth prospects going forward,"" Westpac senior economist Michael Gordon said. He said the strength of the data should put paid to talk of the need for interest rate cuts, but focus would turn to the current quarter and whether the fall in confidence has flowed through into business and spending decisions. Once the rising population was factored in, the gains per person were more modest rising 0.5 percent in the June quarter and 1.1 percent over the year.

Michael,Gordon,1655,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/BU1809/S00557/update-stronger-than-expected-growth.htm,"Video | Agriculture | Confidence | Economy | Energy | Employment | Finance | Media | Property | RBNZ | Science | SOEs | Tax | Technology | Telecoms | Tourism | Transport | Search UPDATE: Stronger than expected growth sees traders dial back rate cut chance (Recasts with comment from economists) By Rebecca Howard Sept. 20 (BusinessDesk) - New Zealand's stronger-than-expected economic growth pared any chance of a rate cut but downside risks - particularly flagging business confidence - remain. Gross domestic product expanded 1 percent in the June quarter, accelerating from a 0.5 percent rise in March, and was up 2.8 percent on the year, Statistics New Zealand said. Economists had expected quarterly growth of 0.8 percent and 2.5 percent annual growth, according to the median in a Bloomberg poll. The central bank was forecasting growth of 0.5 percent. The GDP data attracted particular attention as the central bank had indicated it could cut rates if the economy failed to fire. Prior to the data, money markets had been pricing a 40 percent chance of a rate cut by May 2019. That fell to 20 percent after today's release. The New Zealand dollar jumped following the release, reaching 66.52 US cents, its highest level this month. It was at 66.12 cents immediately before the announcement and recently traded at 66.44 cents. While today's result doesn't guarantee the economy is on an accelerating path, ""it does argue against the case for official cash rate cuts in the near future,"" said Michael Gordon, senior economist at Westpac Banking Corp. ""Not only was the overall result stronger than expected, the details were more encouraging for the economy’s growth prospects going forward,"" he said. Growth was shared widely across the economy, and the one-off spikes in areas such as electricity, transport and government services ""weren’t as big as we expected, which means there’s less risk of an unwind in the next quarter,"" he said. Gordon also pointed out that growth would have been even higher in the second quarter but for outages at the Marsden Point oil refinery and Pohokura gas field. ""With both operators back in action, these will add to the growth rate in the September quarter,"" he said. Still, ANZ Bank New Zealand senior economist Liz Kendall said the data provide some reassurance the central bank will not be ""complacent about downside risks."" ""The economy is grappling with headwinds, recent drivers of growth are waning, and there is a risk that downbeat business expectations become self-fulfilling – with employment and investment having turned negative,"" she said. Tumbling business confidence - which is hovering near a 10-year low - has preyed on the central bank as it frets about slowing business investment. Today's data reinforced that - one of the few weak points was a dip in investment spending. Residential investment increased 0.5 percent while business investment, which is all investment less residential construction, shrank 0.2 percent in the June quarter after expanding 0.3 percent in the prior quarter. Several components, however, such as investment in transport equipment and other construction were positive. ""It remains to be seen whether investment will be affected by downbeat business intentions into the second half of the year,"" said Kendall. Overall, today's print will give the RBNZ some breathing room to continue to “watch, worry and wait”. She expects the central bank to reiterate a willingness to do what it takes to support the economy, restating that the next move in the cash rate could be “up or down"" at next week's review.
